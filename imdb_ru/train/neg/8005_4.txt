Gwoemul (Boss) - Due to pollution in the Han River, the mutated beast begins to run amok. The youngest member of the Park family is kidnapped by a beast, and the rest of her family must find her before she becomes the last beast's food. <br /> <br /> First of all, I like monster movies: mutated bears, oversized alligators, flocks of Komodo crowning dragons, and much more. Creature features are my favorite kind of horror movie. So, I really wanted the Boss, but it was not supposed to be. <br /> <br /> There were three main problems with it: <br /> <br /> You can see the first one by quickly looking at the IMDb page. <br /> <br /> Genre: Action / Comedy / Drama / Fantasy / Horror / Sci-fi / Thrillers <br /> <br /> Too many damn genres. He took himself too seriously to be a comedy, and yet was too frivolous to have any real message (although he seemed to be trying to make some kind of statement. Anti-pollution, anti-American or anti-government). The drama was out of place and mixed in a mixed bag with all other styles. <br /> <br /> Secondly, after the initial attack of the monsters, nothing happens for almost the entire movie. The central family wanders in search of their own, and the governments of Korea and America, apparently, do nothing. And that's all, they just wander around, hitting each other from time to time, presumably for some comedic relief. This inaction caused my attention to be distracted, and apparently it did the same for the director, since the whole plot threads remain unresolved (the mysterious plague invented by evil Americans is completely forgotten and never solved). And finally, the film is clumsy political. He portrays Americans as stupid and evil, but does not give us American characters with the same depth as the villain from the cartoons. The opening scene has the most obvious stupid American versus wise Korean moment. With a Korean morgue assistant who asks his boss, the coroner, not to pour chemicals into the Han River. The American coroner giggles almost maniacally, ordering the assistant to continue. Besides being racist, he is lazy, makes a film, and there is no excuse for that. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the monster is good, a kind of mixture of The Relic and Deep Rising. Some movement effects are quite steep, and the initial chase for monsters in the park is a lot of fun. The film also has good shots. Some of them, oddly enough, remind me of how the film “Firefly” was made (shaking cameras, out of focus shots, etc.). In the end there is also a good scene where the hero and the little boy he saved sit in the family. mobile grocery kiosk. Night falls and it snows, the street light radiates cold light, but the counter has a warm glow emanating from it. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was very disappointed with this film. I was looking forward to a decent movie, and instead I got a bit of pseudo-political, comedic horror. Looking at the comments on IMDb, I cannot help but think that if it were production in the USA, it would have been planned. The fact that this is a foreign film does not mean that it is good. In recent years there have been some great films from Korea (for example, the trilogy of revenge and the Brotherhood), but this is definitely not one of them. <br /> <br /> This time I'm for a remake. Strengthen the direction, improve the scripts, and it could be a good movie. In fact, it is not worth a couple of hours of someone else's time.
