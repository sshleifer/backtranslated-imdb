Rating: 4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> As this mini-series approached, and we were well aware of this for the last six months, when the Sci-Fi channel continued to fill its shows with BG advertising, I confess that I I felt a growing unease when I learned more. <br /> <br /> As is the case with any other work of cinematic art that has stood the test of time, different people come to him to see different things. In this regard, when people think of Battlestar Galactica, they remember different things. For some, these are chrome warriors with fluctuating red light in their visor. For others, it is the love they held for special effects that were quite evolutionary for their time. Many people forget about the state of special effects in the late 70s, especially on television. For some, memories are resolved around the storyline arch. Others still remember the relationship, how the relationship itself helped overcome the difficulties they faced. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I'm from the last group. The core of Battlestar Galactica were people who came together to save each other from the evil empire. Yes, evil Cylon had nothing to win, except for the destruction of the human race, but they did it. While the stars of the base circled around, men and women gathered together to confront the enemy with virtually unlimited resources, and somehow they managed to survive until the next show. They did not survive because they had better technology or more firepower. They survived because they cared and trusted each other until the next show. <br /> <br /> The show had its flaws, and sometimes juicy, but they were people you could take care of. <Br /> <br /> The authors of this current version never seem to understand this. In a sense, he took the least significant part of the original show, the names of the characters and the look at the storyline and created what they called nothing more than a rethinking of television science fiction. Since this was their goal, they can be judged on how well they achieved it: failure. It was far from rethinking. In fact, it was in many respects one of the most derivative areas of science fiction in a long time. He borrows from ST: TNG, ST: DS9, Babylon 5 and even Battlefield Earth. I find it unfortunate. <br /> <br /> Ronald D. Moore has been a member of popular science fiction for over a decade and has contributed to some of the most popular science fiction television films you can hope to see. One of the difficulties he seemed to have encountered was that there could be no conflict in the team of the Enterprise D & E brigade. This was the unbreakable rule ST: TNG Roddenberry. Like many who lived by these rules of others, who then use every opportunity to break the rules when they are no longer under this authority, Ron Moore seems to have forgotten some of the lessons he learned from a recognized master of science fiction: Gene Roddenberry . Here, instead of writing the best possible story, he created a dysfunctional cast, as I have ever seen, with the intention of creating as many collisions as possible. Besides the fact that he was dysfunctional, some of them were not a bit believable. Anyone who has ever been in the army knows that someone unprovokedly hitting a higher officer will not get just a couple of days “confused”, they could get executed and will never get out the next day. That would not have happened, especially during the war. <br /> <br /> I remembered most of Ron Moore’s earlier work because he wrote the death of captain James Kirk. He killed Captain Kirk, and, alas for me, he killed Battlestar Galactica.
