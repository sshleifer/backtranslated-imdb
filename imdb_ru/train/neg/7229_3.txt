This film seems to start in the middle, represents the peripheral players, as if they were significant, and represents the main characters without any creature and subtle paper and / or impenetrable stories. Almost no one has a credible or noticeable motivation for their actions in this film. The plot rumbles and ultimately does not go anywhere, the dialogue is awkward and banal, and the director has little idea about how to get the most from his actors. It seems that there is the first half of this film, but it was never made. <br /> <br /> We are told that a mysterious pyramid appeared over New York and that Central Park inexplicably turned into an Arctic wasteland. However, it seems that none of this has caused much fuss among the general population and is only a minimal problem for the government. <br /> <br /> We are represented by an “evil corporation” in eugenics, but in reality it’s just a convenient vanity to populate the universe with a pair of power minions. The whole twin of “Eugenics is bad” is cruel and will never really work. We need to take care of the main characters, but never know enough about them to understand why. In this world, there is so much underdeveloped or completely undeveloped that it looks like a 1-hour, 40-minute fatal rationalization of rape. <br /> <br /> In the “amazing” world of digital animation created here, everything I can say that around the same time that this film was shot, several other directors did the same with smoother and more believable results. . <br /> <br /> Having spent time watching this film, the most acute question remains. my mind was "so what?"
