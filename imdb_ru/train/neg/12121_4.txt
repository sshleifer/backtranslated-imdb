Tony Goldwyn is a good actor who obviously tries his hand at directing. "Walk on the Moon" seems to be borrowed from other, better-made films. The real story unfolds in the late sixties at a summer resort for working-class Jews near Woodstock. Screenshot using Pamela Gray does little, so it’s a mystery why Mr. Goldwyn decided to view this film as his first attempt at directing. <br /> <br /> The Kantrowitz family spends some time at the resort. We see them arrive in a small bungalow, which will become their temporary home. Marty, the father, comes only for the weekend; he works in a family-owned small TV repair factory, mostly. A few days later the first man will go into space, so that the excitement will become apparent. <br /> <br /> Women in Kantrovice left behind. Pearl, Marty's wife and her mother-in-law, Lilian, are inaction there until the "seller of blouses" arrives. Pearl scans, and she finds much more than shmatte; she also gets the seller. It seems that Pearl and Marty have no sex life at all. After two children, Pearl, who seems sexy and with high libido, is ready for extra marital fun. <br /> <br /> This is the basic premise for the film, which becomes a soap opera when young daughter Alison decides to play crazy and go to a festival in Woodstock nearby, where, terrified of horror, she sees her own mother talking to seller blouses! What should a girl do? Well, stay tuned for the finale's news, when all parties happily reunite at the bed of the little son, when the wasps sting him, and the salesman comes to use some home remedy, and dad is called out of town after learning of the betrayal of Pearl with the younger stallion. <br /> <br /> Poor Diane Lane, she later went on to make “Wrong,” which is a high-profile version of this rag. Viggo Mortensen is a seller who serves his single female buyers who whisper something in their ear! Liev Schreiber in the role of Marty, the cuckold husband, has nothing to do. Anna Paquin plays the rebellious Alison, and Tova Feldshuh is the unfortunate Nana, who would like to stay in the city, watching her soap operas, instead of watching first-hand, who plays in her own backyard! <br /> <br /> Watch it at your own risk, or insert a DVD into a TV set when you have a cheerful crowd at home and you really want to laugh, or two, to make a movie.
