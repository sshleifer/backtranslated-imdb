First of all, when I saw the teaser for Wendy Wu, I was definitely excited. Brenda Song, one of the hottest girls on the Disney Channel, practiced martial arts, and I was fine with that ... until I watched the movie. The action was poorly constructed, the film could not be implemented by anyone, the fight was unreal, and it sucks ... along with the plot. If you really think that it is an imitator, Buffy, a vampire slayer, a girl who is a descendant of other warriors who were women, the girl wants to ignore her vocation and wants to be the queen of homecoming, an observer who is trying to prepare her for a big fight. it is an ancient evil. The idea was not original, the film is a waste of time.
