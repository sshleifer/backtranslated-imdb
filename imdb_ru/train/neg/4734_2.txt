Do you like pretty girls? Yes, me too. What is there to say about beautiful girls / women? Nothing fancy, so why would I give this film only 2 stars out of 5, although it received “talents” Chiaki Kuriyama and Aya Ueto? <br /> <br /> If I really wanted to watch beautiful people, I would watch MTV or something else, therefore. This film, the so-called fighter. So by definition, even the plot is not needed, right? I do not agree 100%, but let's say yes. So what is needed for this? 20 minute footage from the first part (perhaps I exaggerate a little, but it seemed to me that more than 20 minutes had passed ...)?! That would be no. But then again, you never know that the people who watched the first part might not know what they ate for breakfast this morning, so hey, let's remind them ... hey, maybe remind them even twice? Just to be sure that they will not forget ... at least until the loans go, of course !!!! <br /> <br /> Forget about this story, about character development, about real emotions, about “action” (and no, I don’t think women in skirts walking and / or fighting are responsible for actions!) ... what does it leave? Yes, fighting scenes. The action scenes are not bad, and therefore I gave the film 2 stars instead of 1! I gave this film a chance, but it was a waste of time ... You have more important things to do, believe me ...
