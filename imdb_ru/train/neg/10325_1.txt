This series is getting worse and worse. Badly written and just not funny! The premise is excellent, but the writer's inexperience shines through. Trying to offend anyone, they insult everyone. Now in the second season, the desperate actors stopped waving their hands and resorted to this patronizing, complacent style of the game “Oh, you stupid,” which is accompanied by a script without laughter. They roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other, as if to say, aren't we crazy? Isn't that funny? Well, no, in fact it is not. Gum disease is less painful. Unsurprisingly, with the exception of Corner Gas, Canadians usually avoid Canadian television. Come to CBC, you must be our leading station, demonstrating the best of Canadian talent. Pull the plug out of this amateur mess.
