First of all, I'm not a fan of the whole movie genre, “things eat meat with disgusting new ways,” but I'm a bad movie buff, so my neighbor next door said that he had the worst movie in history. This. So, we start to watch it. First of all - it is recorded on a video camera without a tripod! Secondly, the voice of a skinny white doctor is duplicated by a big black man! Thirdly, none of the dialogs makes any sense. Fourth, the zombie scenes, although they are unconvincing and full of dirty makeup and tomato paste, make me believe that the director (and my closest neighbor) need psychological help. It's funny for 5 minutes, but it is aging quickly. This is so amateurish, it's like watching a badly dubbed school video yearbook ... with zombies. A note for everyone associated with this film - I want to spend 20 minutes of my life watching this before falling asleep, back.
