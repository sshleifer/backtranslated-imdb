I watched this movie by car in 1959. Before The Howard Duck, I thought it was the worst movie I've ever seen. This film tried to combine all the genera in one; comedy, horrors, teen anxiety and hot rod, which was supposed to sound "My mom, the car." Maybe he deserves a second viewing to see if this is an exact reflection of his time.
