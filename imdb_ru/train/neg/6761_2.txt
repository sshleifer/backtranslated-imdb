Let's be honest. As a film school project, shot without a budget and “real” actors, this is a tolerably interesting film. Like what will be released on DVD for an innocent viewer, this is a very poorly produced product. If I was idle, switching channels, and accidentally got on this film, it probably would have stopped my view and attention for a while. As the person who bought this DVD under the impression that I will get the right cinematic product, that is, the film, I am deeply disappointed. This is a television play, filmed on video, something similar to the TV shows of the old sixties, but without a certain charm. In addition to the leader Mr. Redfield (who also directs), other actors seem to be either guys from the campus (in fact, it’s too old for him), or members of the director’s family who appear in front of the camera without any help other than the casting couch , but also a make-up artist or a hairdresser (the hood over the overgrown permanent blows or the cylinder over the mullet is very far from the creation of the 1840s). All this is captured using a fixed camera in a small, bare studio, sometimes using a blue screen for outdoor backgrounds. The synthesizer generated a boring score of a lame “period” inspired by romantic karaoke, insulting the ears of viewers more than once. The film is trying to be "fabulous", whereas in reality it is just an incomprehensible collage of those frames that fell into the montage (and believe me, the standards were not too high to begin with). From time to time interesting dialogs appear, but in general it is a rather flimsy and two-dimensional production in several ways, without any flashes of genius, either from the director or among the team members. This is how "feature" films were tried to watch in the 80s. Mr. Redfield works as an actor much better than a director.
