If you are one of those who find the great TV comedy "According to Jim", it will shock your world. And let me add, thank you for proving that good talent, good writing and a charismatic star are all you really need on any network except ABC, which prefers to fool around like Jim Belushi show year after year. <br /> <br /> “K-911” is a big, steaming, brown one, the size of a “thank you” German shepherd dog for all the geniuses who loved the first movie. This is exactly what fans of this film and the smaller Belushi deserve. Comedy jokes and the choice of Jim in the projects never inferior to his ability to kill the blues standard. Look for him to try to demonstrate all of his diverse talent shortages in every project he throws to the public, like an ugly chimpanzee in a zoo. <br /> <br /> If you like the work of Jim, this film is your reward.
