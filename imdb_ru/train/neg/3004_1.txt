What a horrible movie. The acting was bad, the walk was bad, the cinematography was bad, the direction was bad, the “special effects” were bad. You expect a certain degree of evil in the slasher, but even the killings were bad. <br /> <br /> First of all, the past event, which established the motive for the slaughterhouse, lasted for 15 or 20 minutes. I thought it would never end. They could remove 80% of them and explain what happened quite well. <br /> <br /> The victims were then invited to a “reunion” in an abandoned school, which still included all utilities. One of the victims thought it was a bit strange, but rejected it and decided to intervene anyway. <br /> <br /> Finally, the killings were so fake that they were almost invisible. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to watch this film, unless you want to see breasts, and not very good breasts. This film makes the Showgirls virtually indistinguishable from Citizen Kane.
