Canadian TV transcends itself again and creates another show that will go unnoticed after its premiere episode. <br /> <br /> Last time I remember that sitcoms were supposed to provoke a reaction that we call business in laughter. How funny is it to beat the stereotype of all white people who believe that all Muslims are terrorists? OK, maybe one joke to just stick it to the masses. But not 30 minutes. This is called beating a dead horse. Even SNL knows that he must surrender after a commercial break. <br /> <br /> Also, let's look at the conflict in these scenarios. Will she be able to serve cucumber sandwiches to break the fast of Ramadan? When will Ramadan begin? Ohhh, this Emmy wins here. <br /> <br /> And characters! What kind of characters ?! All of them are cut out of cardboard, and there is nothing interesting in them, so that we want to follow them from one situation to another. This is the point of the comedy situation. We need strong, interesting, dynamic characters so that we are constantly drawn to the TV every week. We need to take care of these characters to worry about the challenges they face next week. If I never see these characters, it will be too soon. Fortunately, I can't remember any of their names (a note for CBC is not a good sign). <br /> <br /> And the acting is so soft. This is more a problem in casting than in actors. None of these people really embody the characters they play. It seems they are just playing their part, as if they are working on the film of the week. Sitcoms require actors who live and breathe this character — make us fall in love with them — where they become inseparable from the character they portray. Look at any American sitcom and see how easily recognizable characters are. Part of the problem is that the actors seem to view this project as if it could become a platform for bigger and better things, instead of being their one big character in life, which they will play next 8 years. This level of disinterest in the characters and the project shows. But, to be honest, taking into account the unconvincing concept and terrible essay, the actors have nothing to do except to say their words and try not to bump into the furniture. As another commentator mentions, it looks like a television movie, not a comedy. <br /> <br /> And the direction, or lack thereof! What can I say, Canada has so many talents, see what makes the Comedy Channel with Dolls That Kill and Hit. Look at the Trailer Park Boys (not a movie because he bit the big helium dog). Look at any American show to see the potential of our talent, since it is there that many of our stars strive to find a decent job. <br /> <br /> Give it up for the CBC, they really know how to create an advertisement for a non-event. Remember "One"? No - well, do not even try to learn the names of the characters in this series, as he will definitely follow the path of the dodo. <br /> <br /> Let's hope for a full blow to ACTR to get something like this out of Ceeb for a long time.
