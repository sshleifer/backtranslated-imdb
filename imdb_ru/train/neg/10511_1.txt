A note for horror fans. The only horror here is when you realize that you have spent 95 minutes of your life on a film that is so useless that it is offensive. <br /> <br /> I watched this because: <br /> <br /> The package sounds somewhat promising: it is not. This is just an excuse to use the same slop kits from other low-budget slasher films that weren’t good either. <br /> <br /> The promise of naked forest nymphs sounded good, even if the movie was terrible: it is not. This is not so. Amateur cinema ensures that “fallen angels” are about as sexy as ordinary homeless people. <br /> <br /> The name of Tom Savini has a long history in the horror genre: he is the king of low-budget special effects and low-budget action. If you think about it, Savini should have been the reason for not watching this movie. Not that he is bad, but he is almost always in bad movies. His only good role was in From Dusk Till Dawn, and since then he has milked it at horror conventions. <br /> <br /> But let's focus on the positive: “The Forest of the Damned” is a great example of how NOT to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Everything else is negative. Obviously, the author is allergic to originality. The script is terrible. This is all given after the first 10 minutes. But an ignorant step; how the director regards the “conspiracy” and “characterization” as a nuisance that, in his opinion, does not bother anyone; and painfully long and boring sequences of driving, walking, and nature (no doubt added to increase the working time to make the film suitable for distribution) show a total lack of ability to film and narration in general. <br /> <br /> This is another good example of how number one you can tell if a movie will be bad: if it is written and shot by the same person, wait for the trash.
