I have already talked about this in other reviews, without a story, you can give the audience all the smoke and mirrors you want, but still nobody cares. <br /> <br /> The director seems to look great for the art deco of the 30s (which I love), and I think that the idea of ​​using all digital backgrounds and the like could really be a wave of the future in filmmaking. Nevertheless, it is obvious that the director was so interested in the digital visualization of his film that he forgot to shoot a lot of scenes that would be extremely helpful to this amazingly thin film. (SPOILER) Because they shouted loudly, they forgot that there is a villain in it! Well, they have one, but he was dead for 20 years by the time the movie took place. Conran overlooks what the Villain has. As for actions, let's see, Sky Captain (Lo) knocks ONE robot, two or three aircraft with flapping wings (before Dex (Ribisi) tells him to stop shooting them !!!), and a couple of robots, but mostly spending time to look smart and make others fight for it. Paltrow in the role of Polly, Peggy, Punk or something totally unjustified in this film (the reviewer who comments on her and Law’s lack of chemistry is very right), and I, for one, was tired of seeing repeated pictures of her camera’s she had only two shots left, of which she wasted for nothing in the film, one is not entirely funny, and the other is quite funny, although I saw that this happens after 70 years. No one, except Low and Paltrow, has significant time on the screen, and this is a real drawback of the film. The audience is not identified with robots, it needs a hero to cheer on, and an evil, despicable villain who needs to be hated. Without this, plus a good fascinating story, all the computer graphics in the world will not help.
