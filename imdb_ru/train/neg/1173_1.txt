If I had only one camera accidentally glued to the floor, the film would be enough for only one take of each shot, and then I lost the whole film, and I had to spend a few dollars to buy several digital video tapes, and I was forced to make a more than two-hour film about the French Revolution, in which there were also no filming, and it was necessary for my 4-year-old autistic son to draw backgrounds, and the only actors I could find were people who did not. I was not auditioning for the soap opera of that year, and I also had to not use music in the entire film, and the zoom function on the camera did not work, except for one case when it accidentally began to increase and could not Do not stop, and I hated my audience, I could have done something like this horrible, but mistakenly fun, worthy hell of a waste of time. Almost great-looking, but completely fake-looking backgrounds reminded me of some of George Lucas' latest works, which made him a lot more disappointing because during the whole movie in the back of my mind there was a little glimmer of hope that the film was the culmination of a light duel / space laser the battle. I do not want to spoil the film for those who have not seen it, but it is not. The only thing that I can remember that spent more time than watching this movie was writing this review. World.
