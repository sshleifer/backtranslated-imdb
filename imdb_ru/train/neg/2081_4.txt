This film has recently been shown over the cable again and again, so .. <br /> <br /> These two attractive women have no excuse to fight for Luke Wilson or for the equally soulless “villain” in this film. Actresses are very cute, and this is the only reason to watch this movie. I suppose it is “funny”, that around Luke there is an even more ugly / stupid / stupid friend, but well, that's what we get. <br /> <br /> None of the female leading roles will ever, NEVER talk Men in this film for more than 5 minutes. What we get is what they sob, cry, fight and so on, more than two guys who are best described on Friday the 13th. Dead * @ $ #
