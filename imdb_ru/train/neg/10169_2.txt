This is 1978, and yes, obviously, there are too many black players in the teams! The fans will be upset, and, of course, 75,000 places will be filled, only less happy that there are so many black players on the field! This is made for Super Bowl television film to watch. This is not much more, but it is really amazing, the cast of talented actors who appear (at the time) is probably first and foremost Tom Selleck. Unfortunately, any good that Selleck brings to the screen quickly surpasses such “actors” as Dick Butkus. <br /> <br /> This is a stupid story about super bowl betting. "New York" (read mafia) accuses PJ Jackson that the game ends in their favor, in this case a bet of $ 10,000,000. PJ is quite innocent and seems to have a weak grip, buying off several people here and there. But things seem to fall apart for him. Another man, an unexpected lane, takes responsibility. For some time the mystery of the killings is not exactly known, but it is quite clearly revealed during the last murder that Leini is a new antagonist. <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie, but you can watch it. The acting is decent, and the filming is fine. At least, there were no stupid typical car chases of the 70s (their place is simply not here). Just keep an eye on past stereotypes and the cocaine era, and you will survive. <br /> <br /> 2/10 (maybe 2.5)
