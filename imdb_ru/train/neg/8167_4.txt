The Forest is not only your usual cannibal, but also an interesting mixture of supernatural elements. The story of two couples who go hiking in the forest. Soon they are terrorized by the cave dwellers of the forest, cannibals and the ghosts of his dead wife and two children. There is something that you do not see every slasher. Director Don Jones gets an “A” for the effort, although the film itself is almost ineffectual at almost every level, the acting skills are just average, except for Janet Kelly, who plays the dead lumberjack wife (Michael Brodie, aka Gary Kent). /> <br /> The film begins with several beautiful shots of a couple traveling through the valley into the forest. They realize too late that someone is stalking them. They are both shipped in typical slash fare. Our killer uses the trusty hunting knife throughout the entire movie, except during the recollection, when he uses a handsaw, forks and a rusty saw blade to send his changeable wife's lover. <br /> <br /> There is a good storyline in the forest, but the film just doesn’t work with it, I found it rather boring with just a stupid game. 4/10
