Jason Lee is doing everything possible to give pleasure in a stupid situation, but the movie simply can not establish a connection. <br /> <br /> Perhaps due to the fact that the character of Julia Stiles seems awkward, as cunning and sexy, will soon become a cousin. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is because her characters and Selma Blair were supposed to play the opposite way. (Selma Blair seems more cunning than Julia). <br /> <br /> In any case, this film is another Hollywood banalization of a possible situation in the real world (when you are caught with your pants at a bachelor party, and not leaning). your cousin), which, despite the promise, can not cope. <br /> <br /> There is some laughter to be sure, and the actors (even if they are missed) do everything they can with the material of the subclass, which does not go beyond the dirty topic, So instead of getting successful a festival (for example, Animal House or American Pie), we still have the golden mean of humor and stupidity (a la Meatballs 2 or something like that).
