For the most part, On Demand delivers some pretty horrible horror films, and offers only other horror films that everyone has seen and already have an opinion. It was either this or “The Invincible” (I like Mark Wahlberg films), which I did not see, and in fact I was in the mood to watch a movie, which does not often happen, because I already watched all the films that I had there is. a million times, and these are many films, and I'm not very interested in new films, and boy, this film made me regret it. I'm not going to put in any spoilers, I’ll just tell you that only a few of the very few actors in this film are half decent. I think that the main girl, the dead, who kills everyone, is very annoying, but convincing; I would take her for a psycho bitch anytime, so she fits well with her bun, although she is lame. The blood is not that great, only a few murders, or I can say that the “wounds” are all right, but you don’t see much, and there’s no props for body parts to make the wounds look more convincing. By the end of the film, I begged my girlfriend to turn him off, and, being a member of the group, the “recording” parts were also not very interesting, although what happened really happened during the recording. I did, if you want to watch this, dress yourself.
