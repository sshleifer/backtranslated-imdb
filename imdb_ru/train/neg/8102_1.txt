Oh, I heard so much about this movie. I went to see him with my best friend (she is a woman, I am a man). Now please let me disagree with the mainstream. After the first couple of dozen "removed the clothes", we both felt a very strange combination of stupidity and boredom. We laughed (at this, not at this), we dozed off (and it would be better to stay in bed), we were convinced that we spent the money in vain. And we had it. The plot was incoherent, and the heroes were a group of people whom it was impossible to take care of. A waste of money, a waste of celluloid. This film does not even deserve one out of ten votes, but it is the lowest available. I'm not sure why this film has a reputation for excellence; I do not recommend this to anyone who has a little taste or intelligence.
