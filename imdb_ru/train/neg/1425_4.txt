I'm not sure which HK films were watched by other reviewers, but “Entry into Eagles” is far from the top of the pile in HK action. Michael "Fitz" Wong should be glad that he can get an acting job in Hong Kong, because he couldn't get out of the wet paper bag in English. Shannon Lee looks good and is a fantastic fighter (even better with fighting on his feet than her dad), but her acting skills are also not up to standard. In fact, the entire English dialogue (90% of the film - even more than in Gen-Y Cops) is so bad that I switched to audio Mandarin to save myself from the suffering due to the poor delivery of dialogues and the redundancy of the English subs. Of course, there are some decent skirmishes (but nothing that we have not seen before) and good cinematography, but the raw visual effects really spoil the action. <br /> <br /> However, it is worth to watch Shannon and Benny "Jet" Urkides go for it. Spectacular, and almost worth seeing the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, you may notice some of the scenes that seem “familiar” to you, such as the open market shootout (for example, The Matrix) and Fitz’s diving. from a helicopter wearing a black uniform (think MI: 2). I think someone thought that at least a few things in this film were worth taking away.
