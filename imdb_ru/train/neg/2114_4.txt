Just looking at the scenery, staging and editing, it is easy to say that this project did not have the proper budget. Maybe Bela Lugosi has decided to distract himself from such things. Young brides fall dead at the altar, saying "I do." Their corpses were stolen by the famous gardener Dr. Lorenz (Lugosi) and a pair of his bizarre minions, since his aging wife (Elizabeth Russell) needs injections of ferrous young virgin fluids to remain forever young ... forever beautiful. The local cub reporter (Luana Walters) understands that each missing bride wore the same rare orchid to the altar; the orchid in which Dr. Lorenz would be the most knowledgeable. Typical horror movies from a horror movie make visiting Lorenzâ€™s estate a bit intimidating; especially with the gnome and slobbering hunchback in the rooms. Other players: Angelo Rossitto, Tristram Coffin, Minerva Urekal and Frank Moran.
