Shiner, ruled by Christian Coulson, centers around three “couples” and their relationship with obsession and violence. Pretty good start, as I understand it. Interesting. Couples break up into a heterosexual couple, two heterosexual male friends and a straight guy who is “harmlessly” haunted by a gay. <br /> <br /> “Het” couple really does not play a big movie role. There are some scenes that show how they like to be aggressive when having sex or playing with each other, but they seem to have no real purpose, since they are so isolated. I suggest that they provide a more everyday illustration of how sex / violence is integrated into the life of couples. The couple is not very aggressive and not even shot in any erotic way. As characters, they add little to the theme or plot. <br /> <br /> Two male friends make up the main part of the plot. They make some funny beatings, urging a homosexual man to have sex with them in the alley. It turns into violence. And violence changes them. It becomes a means of sexual satisfaction. And their need for the release of violence grows as the film moves. The main problem I encountered is inconclusive violence. It never seems that any of the characters is in real danger. It just does not work. Given that the whole topic of the movie is about the relationship of characters with violence, this is a serious problem. Unfortunately, makeup does not help either. Sometimes everything is good, sometimes it is very bad. In one scene, I really wondered why one of the characters smeared his face. Confusing. <br /> <br /> A more interesting pair of characters is a “pair of pursuers”. Here, it seemed, Calson had something to say, and he was able to develop a more consistent storyline. Perhaps this is because the characters seem to evolve more and have permission at the end. Shiner would probably be much better if stuck with these two. <br /> <br /> I appreciate that Calson wanted to achieve a lot with this movie. It is wonderful. Most low-budget films do not aspire to many. I don't think Calson has achieved what he aspired to. I myself have not found anything particularly controversial or disturbing. Shiner was unconvincing. This, however, does not mean that the director cannot achieve something with his next film. <br /> <br /> He seems to have something to say.
