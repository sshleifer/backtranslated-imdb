This film was terrible in terms of plot and movement. I looked at the clock in the theater, hoping that it would run out, and after 80 long minutes I was relieved that, fortunately, it happened. In fact, five characters appear in the film: “Son and Father”, a friend of the son, and two male characters of the age of the son, who appear and then disappear without context or explanation. The film and the scenes seemed to suggest homoeroticism, but nothing really happened to show it anyway. There were a couple of brilliant scenes. At the beginning of the film, a son's friend appears at the window in his room, and they enter into a strange conversation. Photography and acting give an incredible seductiveness to the interaction between them, ending with the fact that she admitted that she has another man who is “older”. The end of this story.
