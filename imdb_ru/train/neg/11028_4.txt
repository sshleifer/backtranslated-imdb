At the very beginning, after it was established that the criminal John Dillinger (Warren Oates) was a selfish rapist, another thug of the 1930s was cornered in a farmhouse and surrounded by the FBI. The second in the team, Melvin Purvis (Ben Johnson), examines the situation, puts a lit cigar in his mouth, takes two charged .45 automatic rifles and goes alone to a distant house. Bach Bach Bach. Purvis comes out of the house with a female hostage, the dead corpse. All in perspective. <br /> <br /> If you're passionate about stories like Little Red Riding Hood, this should be very attractive. <br /> <br /> Oh, it's just as exciting as itâ€™s thoughtless. Handsome Floyd meets his death dramatically. Numerous violations of the civil code. Lots of tommy gunfights and guns. Blood all over. <br /> <br /> Like a story, it stinks. Few people remember Melvin Purvis as an FBI hero, in part, I suppose, because of his name. Melvin Purvis? We all remember J. Edgar Hoover, who fired Melvin Purvis because he was a rival for public attention. <br /> <br /> The picture was painted and directed by John Milius. He is the guy whose contract states that if any animal is killed during one of the performances, he must be the designated shooter. Milius - the guy, the ugly gunsmith who had the Rough Riders Teddy Roosevelt in the Spanish-American War, screaming quotes from Henry V - "St. Crispin's Day" and all that. <br /> <br /> Excites, yes, and full of garbage. "I knew that I would never take him alive, and I did not try too hard." That is, kill them all and let God deal with them. <br /> <br /> You just like it.
