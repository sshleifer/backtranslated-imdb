Before this film, I saw only two films directed by Andrea Bianchi: the dirty zombie film Le Notti del Terrore (1981), known to horror-admirers for its unforgettable performance from male child Peter Barca, and the pleasant and dirty jallo Strip Strip Nude For your killer. Neither film was a particularly impressive piece of cinema, but both were interesting in their own way (and the fact that they had a lot of blood and nudity didn't hurt). The massacre, however, is boring, boring, boring, despite the fact that it sprinkles a little and a strange stain from unwarranted bare flesh. <br /> <br /> The story of the hotel murder series, where the actors and the horror film team filmed during the filming are confusing and terribly boring: when blood does not flow and skin is not shown, the film is a real struggle to to sit down (it took me four attempts to get ready), with endless scenes of incredible characters quarreling among themselves and almost noticing anything. <br /> <br /> The only interesting point in the film is that its producer Lucio Fulci used several of his death scenes to Lay out his megacore movie Cat in the Brain (AKA Nightmare Concert). And if you've already seen this film, then Slaughter has no particular cause for concern.
