You know, I went to see "The hills have eyes of 2," wanting to please. I really enjoyed the original, and the remake was quite interesting. Obviously, they had more money than Wes Craven for special effects a second time. Despite the fact that I still prefer the original film, the remake was well done, and it was a kind of guilt for me. Bloody, intense and great special effects. In short, a great popcorn movie for any horror fan. <br /> <br /> This leads us to "The Hills, which have eyes of 2". Man, where do I start? The plot, or lack thereof, is thin on paper. We do not quite discover new opportunities here. The military decided to control the area, and all these people disappear. So what do we do now? Let's send in the National Guard for investigation. In a real Hollywood way, we need to make them the dumbest and worst soldiers weâ€™ve ever seen. Gee, I've never seen this premise before. In short, you have mutants that kill moron soldiers one by one graphically. Once again, the Nicotero's special effects are great, but the killings, no matter how boring and predictable the graphics are. Frankly, it seemed to me that this click was made only in order to earn money quickly. It was bloody and clear, but I found it predictable, boring and not at all scary. It would be nice for me if there was one original thought in this film. Wes Craven and his son shared the responsibilities of the writer, and he was associated with many of my favorite horror films, but unfortunately this is not one of them.
