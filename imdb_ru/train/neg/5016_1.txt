Nick Shtala’s name, young cast and attractive VHS cover made me buy and watch this film, expecting to see a good movie for teenagers. What the hell! The complete script is cliché, dialogues and presentations are terrible, terrible, very bad, terrible, terrible ?? To summarize, a complete waste of time. There is no horror, black humor, just an absolutely boring story with shameful storylines. The film begins with six characters, in fact, three pairs, together similar to a group of friends, but in fact very unpleasant people who seem to be enemies, playing a ridiculous senseless game called “Taboo”, and each of them writes “yes” or "No" for certain problems taboo. That's all: without the preliminary development of the characters, the viewer does not know who they are, their motives and attitudes. Then a year later the dots pass, and the same group gathers at a party on New Year's Eve, insulting each other in a very disgusting way. But the plot and turns are so ridiculous, predictable, mediocre and incredible that they do not deserve any additional line in my review. Only one piece of advice: do not waste your time or money on this garbage, you will certainly regret it. My voice is one (terrible). <br /> <br /> Header (Brazil): “Taboo ?? Jogando Com o Assassino "(" Taboo ?? Playing with the killer ")
