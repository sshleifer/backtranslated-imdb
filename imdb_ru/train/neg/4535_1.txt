slow, incomprehensible, boring. Three enthusiastic words that describe the movie from the book. This is definitely the case when the film should never have been made at the expense of the book. The best part of the movie was the scenery, great. Worst of all was the slow movement of the actors, which was combined with endless meaningful views. Editing is sharp and patchy. However, despite this, the actors worked very hard, at least trying to be a little believable with a scary script. It was amazing that, although Peru did not have a single person of Peruvian origin, wandering around the set - even in the memoirs depicting Peru in the 17th century. If you have a sense of history, try to avoid this movie.
