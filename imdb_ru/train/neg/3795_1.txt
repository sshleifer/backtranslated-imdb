I really wanted to love this show. Honestly, honestly. <br /> <br /> For the first time, gay viewers have their own version of the Bachelor. With the help of his compulsory "karg" Andra, James, a good-looking, wealthy thirty with something, has a chance to fall in love with 15 grooms (or "comrades", as they are mentioned in the show). The only problem is that half of them are straight, and James does not know this. If James chooses a gay man, he will get a trip to New Zealand, and if he chooses an honest one, he will receive $ 25,000. How can this not be fun ?! Take my hand, let's take a walk: <br /> <br /> The most glaring problem of this show is the bachelor. James is your typical young and successful gay guy with a beautiful smile and a body that you will probably take two views of your local bar before grazing on greener pastures. Why they decided to play James in the role of the lead, I can not do it. God knows that there are so many other hot and cheerful homosexuals who die to be on television. <br /> <br /> In addition to the rather average appearance, James is as interesting and exciting as a piece of chalk. Even so, he has this arrogant, smugly condescending aura about him. However, if James were standing by an empty white wall, he would have stuck into it. I honestly can't remember any interesting or remarkable things that James said during the show. He is so boring and forgettable. In fact, one of his peers advised him not to feel any connection. I thought it was the best part of the show. In addition, James speaks in a painfully annoying voice. It sounds feminine or masculine, but it doesn’t say tones in the middle of sentences ... it’s so painful to sit. I hated him so much throughout the entire show that I continued to think: “Please, choose a real guy and humiliate yourself and your unfortunate appearance” <br /> <br /> Then we have fiancés. A wonderfully soft group of people who don't seem to care about everything that happens. Equally useless, they seem indistinguishable from one guy to another, with the exception of: “Hey, this guy has bright highlights or curly hair.” Again, strikingly inept casting decisions seem to be the goal of this show. While it may be beaten for recruiting roles, it would be much more interesting to watch than these amorphous drones. Nevertheless, despite all their banality, they still manage to overshadow James (which is not so difficult to do in any case), although a bit. You know, you have a problem when some of the suitors are actually hotter and more interesting than the presenter. And the fact that the fans seem to be having fun around EVERYONE OTHER than with the lead man? Very sad. <br /> <br /> In addition, I just thought that I mentioned something mentioned on bulletin boards that, in my opinion, was true: straight men are hotter than gay guys. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that all the funny guys were ugly and boring, in fact I found some of them very cute. Simply, in general, they were just BLAH, compared to men, whom you would see on such shows as “A Shot in Love” with Tela Tequila or “Bachelorette Party”. <br /> <br /> I don’t know how many times I beat forward during this show. I can accept a protagonist as interesting as a cardboard box, I can accept worldly, indifferent fans, but PLEASE, for the love of God, amuse me just a little. There is no such luck. <br /> <br /> If you expect drama, intrigue, sexuality or excitement, you will be VERY disappointed. The biggest “drama” is due to the fact that one of the suitors can still have a guy in New York (how scandalous!). No matter how exciting it is, I guarantee you that this is the ONLY thing that remotely resembles any conflict in this show. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a twist, but if you have some semblance of Gaidar in you, you, I easily understand who is who (this was not at all difficult, I made a mistake only once). This show stacks up so many of its chips that it can not deliver anywhere else. <br /> <br /> We observe how James and Co. hold such exciting activities as teaching Western step dance, buying gifts, visiting a zoo and gay karaoke. To yawn. Of course, you have topless from time to time, but who cares when everyone is boring? This is one of the main problems of the show: no one seems to be enjoying it - they just experience the movement there, trying their best to seem like they are having a good time. And you really cannot blame them, since all these events are incredibly inconceivable and unconvincing. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is no physical aspect. There are no hugs, no affection, no kisses (!), No affection of any kind. It's just, “Well, it was a boring date, I’m going to go back to my ugly, tasteless, willing to live in the Sydney Opera House (fast beak on the lips) CYA.” This show is so bad that it is ridiculous. I can understand that they do not want to play up to the perceived imprudent nature of homosexual men, but do not pay attention. People who watch reality shows want more than restrained hugs and short kisses. This show refuses to compromise. <br /> <br /> Sorry if this was a long time, but I felt that these were problems that needed to be solved. I really recommend Bravo for the first time that he organized a show of this kind, but the stunningly incompetent manner in which this show took place is staggering. To sum up my three points: Boring + Boring + Boring = go do something else. It will be more fun for you to wait to see you in the doctor’s office, at least there are some interesting magazines.
