I watched this film along with all the other adaptations I could get, including watching plays, in preparation for research. Cinematography is very touching, like music. Unfortunately, all life was taken out of history. I have never seen such a terrible image of Mr. Rochester. All his main features disappeared. Where is his wit? Where is his passion? Rochester Scott is more like the foil of Rochester, St. John, than the character from the novel. In fact, the actor playing the role of Saint John in this film adaptation, played the passionate Saint John, while Scott is pleased with breaking things or just looking at the ceiling (which he does constantly). I have no idea what they were thinking. I would like to give this film a slightly higher voice, based on great music and cinematography, but I honestly cannot see this film for too long due to the performance of George Scott.
