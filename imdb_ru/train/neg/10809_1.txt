This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I watched this movie with friends, and 40 minutes later we had enough. The plot was bad, and there was not a single cute character. I could get more fun watching static. I gave this film 1 only because the scale was not included in the negative numbers. Avoid this movie at all costs.
