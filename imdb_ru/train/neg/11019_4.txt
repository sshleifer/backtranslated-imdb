Fred Olen Ray is a lousy director, even if the directors of the film are “B”, but “Hunting Fear” is probably one of his best films. Yes, it gives rise to the wonderful story of the "Premature Burial", and yes, it is terribly tempo and uneven, but also quite interesting. Brinke Stevens, the queen of screams, is better than usual, a pretty fragile housewife whose worthless husband (Jay Richardson) is plotting to do away with her because he needs money to pay off the gangster (who is played by Robert Quarry). Delia Sheppard, a veteran of many films from the early 90s, actually gives the best role in the film as a slutty lover. You will also enjoy the small roles played by Karen Black as a psychic, Robert Clark as a doctor and Michael Berryman in a beautiful cameo in one of the best scenes. The ending didn't make much sense!
