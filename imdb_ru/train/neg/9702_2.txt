I don't think this film was rated correctly. I took my copy, dimmed the PG rating and wrote down R. I would NOT recommend it to anyone under 17 or 18, no matter what the limit of R. <br /> <br /> Why? It contains a scene in the jungle with several topless Indian women. I do not know about you, but this is not what little children should watch. True, this may be the traditional "style of clothing" of African (?) Indians, but ... I think partial nudity should give the film a rating of R. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the movie recently, but I think otherwise everything was fine.
