Not bad, but not a very good film about robberies. Kirk Douglas - recently released from prison safecracker, who, after rejecting the proposal from the mob decides to quit himself. He is gaining circus gymnast Giuliano Gemma. Chaos will follow. Douglas and Gemma are soon prosecuted by Romano Puppo, a mafia dummy, and also get entangled in a really stupid love triangle with endlessly patient Douglas girl (Florinda Bolkan). Directed by Michel Lupo maintains a fast paced pace, and there is at least one excellent and creative sequence of car racing with Puppo & Gemma. Although Italian production, most of the filming seems to have been made in Germany. With Douglas, everything is fine, and not just stagger in the fast Jiallo. Striking Bolkan gives you amazing performance. The music is written by Ennio Morricone, and the cinema is written by the great Tonino Delly Colli, who managed to work with everyone in Italy (from Werthm√ºller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone).
