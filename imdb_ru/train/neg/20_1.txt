This movie was terrible. At first I just read the plot summary, and it looked fine, so I looked at it. The game was terrible. it was as if the actor was shy about the camera. everything seemed fake. I feel bad because of Edward Farlong, Terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago ... I watched it at least 20 times .... <br /> <br /> The plot was shit too. Most likely, the writers were deprived of sleep when they came up with the line. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is a good bad movie. the one that you keep watching, just to see how worse it can be, so that later you can tell other people how you couldnâ€™t believe how horrible the movie was. <br /> <br /> I think everyone should watch this So that later we can appreciate other, REAL, films.
