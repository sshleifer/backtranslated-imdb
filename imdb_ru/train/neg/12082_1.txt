Alas, poor Hamlet. I knew him, dear reader, and let me tell you, THIS VERSION OF FAILURE! I do not know which of all people invests in this fleet, but I hope that they are proud of themselves. They took a classic play and turned it into the most boring melody you can imagine. This version is literally so bad that even the presence of such a great tespiana like Maximilian Schell cannot save her. The only quality of this film is that it made an excellent feed for "MST3K"; Mike, Servo and Crowe have fun with it. <br /> <br /> But in any case, I’m sure that Shakespeare, if he was alive when they did, wouldn’t want his name to be associated with It. This "Hamlet" is not even so bad that it is good; it's just bad. Absolutely awful.
