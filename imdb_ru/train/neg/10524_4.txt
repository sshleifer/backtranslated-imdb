I was actually going to watch this movie in the theater. It was actually sold out. Instead, I went to see Solaris, which was actually the worst film that was released in 2002. <br /> <br /> Victor Rosa (John Leguizamo), a hard, street “street pharmacist,” goes crazy when he sees the Child being shot, so he decides to go clean and invest all his money with Jack (Peter Sarsgaard). It seems that things are going well, until Jack misses the city with his girlfriend Trish (Denise Richards). It happened very late in the film, so if they hadn't shown it in the preview, it could have been an interesting twist. But they did, so it is not. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is nothing interesting about this movie; everything is given in the preview. If you’ve seen at least one preview, you’ve seen the whole movie, so you could just think to really fill in the blanks. Go to the site, download the preview, save $ 3.99. There is not a single surprise or twist in the whole movie, except how awful the soundtrack is. <br /> <br /> I hope that the person responsible for writing the soundtrack was fired. Twice. Basically, this is what music would be like if the only songs that could be released were duets by Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan, and (I can destroy the fabric of the space-time continuum with a concept as stunning as this) they both had less talent and musical ability. <br /> <br /> The game is bad at best, the scenario is at best a crime against humanity, and Denise Richards is at best 67% polystyrene foam and 33% ziploc bag. You know that everything is bad when John Leguizamo (he was in "Pest!") Performs the rest of the acting skills with his acting skills.
