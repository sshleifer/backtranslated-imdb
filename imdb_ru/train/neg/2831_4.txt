I saw this recently with my wife and found that it’s better than Kane thinks, although it’s not that much. The greatest British actor ever is not very interested in this role, and it’s a pity that he may have enhanced it with more conviction in his game. Rex Harrison seems even less concerned, perhaps not surprising, since his character is very poorly written. William Holden is better, but his time on the screen is fleeting, and, again, his character is not very well written. <br /> <br /> Beverly Johnson is as beautiful a woman as I have ever seen, but she has very little to do, the film may have won a lot, concentrating more on her story. Ustinov steals the show, but mostly plays a comic character who does not fit into the serious tone of the film. The music is bad, and Omar Sharif makes one of his many senseless cameos (his career has been based on this for decades). <br /> <br /> Richard Fleischer must be blamed for not managing it more effectively, he was an incredibly unpredictable director, and this is one of his weaker films.
