First, yes, I am white, so I try to step a little into the delicate question of race ... anyway ... White people who hate black people = BAD, but black people who hate white people = OK (because, obviously , we deserve it !!). where do I begin? I would like to say something good about this movie besides unintended comedy scenes: the infamous scene was Ice Cube and co. fight some really big, really strong, really very evil and scary looking neo-nazis and win !!! neo-Nazi, where twice as much :) and chase! The chase is priceless ... This is not a film about race, tolerance and understanding, it does not deliver ... This is a racist film that confirms all the stereotypes of cliches, the white stupid guy who is beaten by his black roommate is automatically turned into a skinhead ... just terrible, i'm very sorry to have ever seen it. <br /> <br /> Save your time and terrible experience of poorly written, poorly acting, boring and clearly biased picture, if you are in the subject, go and rent American History X, now hereâ€™s a movie
