RATING STARS: ***** Saturday evening **** Friday evening *** Friday morning ** Sunday evening * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Ray (Ray Winston) has a criminal past, he had problems with alcohol and now forms a drug habit that makes him paranoid and prone to domestic violence to his wife Valerie (Katie Burke), who tries to rally the family, but ends up leaving more like a rug. Meanwhile, her mother Janet (Leila Morse) is aware of Ray’s son, Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles), and of his growing addiction, which sends him off the rails. The film tells about these desperate characters who torment their lives. <br /> <br /> It is said that the British seem to enjoy being unhappy, and this includes watching movies that entertain them in this way. Films like Nil by Mouth underline this. This is a story about a broken family torn by crime, poverty, alcohol and drugs, one of those that Jeremy Kyle prepared as a three-course dinner. In fact, it is also a story about auto-destructive men divided into three generations, and each copies each other, tearing the family and women trying to keep it together, despite the fact that they are not strong enough. If you understand a little what this is about, you can see that from the very beginning it does not promise a good view, and, of course, it will not disappoint you. <br /> <br /> It is true that everyone was talking about the performances, and the main stars, Winston and Burke, really perform great. We see Winston losing him with his wife, beating her after the senseless paranoia caused by Coca-Cola, and breaking her during a telephone conversation with her, and revealing a typical arsenal of obscene words when she refuses to let him see her child. Similarly, in a solitary moment, we see how Burke skillfully loses composure on the stairs, a full blow of the night before starting the game. <br /> <br /> This is another one of those films in which there is no “plot” to be followed in this way, just a sense of the real life of these hopeless lives, which continue day after day. This was welcomed by many (including the buffs!), But in fact it was too gloomy and bleak for me. I have no right to criticize him for this, knowing that I knew about it from the very beginning, but, unfortunately, that is how I found him. **
