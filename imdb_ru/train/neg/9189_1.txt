This film received a lot of bad press from people who do not understand what it was supposed to be. It must be understood that this film should never be taken seriously. This camp, according to the same principles as the "Army of Darkness." AoD was stupid, but ridiculous and bad in a good way. The "house of the dead" cannot be "good and bad." <br /> <br /> There are qualities in good films made on camping trips, the most important of which are believable fantasies. You need to believe in what happens in the movie to see humor when the situation is incredibly wrong. Without boundaries, the film becomes absurd. HotD lacks credibility. <br /> <br /> Worse, HotD brings nothing new to the genre and repeats the same plot twists and reactions of characters that inevitably begin to show many horror films. For example, too often horror films fall into the trap, where the main characters find love among blood and destruction. I do not know about you, but when zombies are chasing me, I want to deal with a hot chick. Believe it? Not? Then you probably won't believe it when the characters start sucking each otherâ€™s faces in this movie. <br /> <br /> In addition to the obvious problems that haunt this film, like many other horror films, Uwe Ball decided to add scenes from a video game that shoots zombies, randomly, when the character shoots zombies in the film. Not only is there no clear justification for this artistic choice, but it distracts from the already incredible plot. In addition, there are frequent and numerous examples of bad play, and, apparently, the director is not trying to control the actors' reaction to events ... leaving the film without redemptive qualities. Avoid ...
