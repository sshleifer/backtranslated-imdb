Although the likelihood that someone will focus on IT comments among the other 80+ for this film is low, I feel I have to say something about it. I am not one of those who watches a movie, who pays attention to production value, which makes dialogue or a brilliant acting game and direction think. However, I argue that this film sucks. I don’t know why I don’t like it ... I mean that it has almost everything I want from a horror movie: blood, outrage, unintentional humor, etc. According to this testimony, this should be mine loved ones. However, Zombi 3 is a movie with the films “baaad”. <br /> <br /> Too many things make you scream on the screen. For example, when a girl leaves an army guy, when their car breaks down to find water (it doesn’t spoil anything, so don’t worry). She enters what I see as an abandoned hotel or something like that. Didn't she see that there was a damn lake in the middle of the building ??? Yes, she is looking for water and passes by the lake. What for? Because she wants to know why people (who are not there, because the place is abandoned) will not answer her when she shouts: "Is there anyone there?" <br /> <br /> However, there is a reason why I gave this movie more than 1 star. This is one of those films where, if you forget how bad it really is, like I have several times, you will want to watch it again, because it’s just incredible in all aspects. I called it blood in the first paragraph, but in this film there is no blood, there is an ocean of blood in it. In addition, there are quite strange creatures in it: a zombie child (with an adult-sized hand ???) and a magically flying head, to name just two. <br /> <br /> Do you know when you are trying to think about the worst and funniest films ever made, and did you come up with sci-fi films from the 50s? I believe that Zombi 3 and similar films should surpass them. It has all the elements: scientists argue with the government, warnings about the apocalypse on the radio, armies fighting monsters, and so on. This is plan 9 of the 80s! Although I will not say that it is a waste of money, if you want to buy it, just expect the worst. And when you find that waiting for the worst is an underestimation of Zombi 3, everything will not be so bad. You can really like it, I'm not saying that this is impossible. <br /> <br /> Don't think that I hate this film, I don’t ... really. Oh, ps Killing Birds (aka Zombies 5) rules! (Did I just undermine my authority?)
