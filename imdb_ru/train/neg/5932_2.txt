What documentary about the musician does not contain a single track of the artist himself ?! Unlike “Ray” or countless other films about musical artists, half of the pleasure in the theater (or on the couch) is the revival of the wonderful songs themselves. Here all the tracks are covers covered by uninteresting characters, and these performances are not able to convey Cohen’s slow, jazz style. Most often the popular versions are poorly executed on the covers. Muck <br /> <br /> Interview more or more with other musicians and figures, and not with Cohen himself. Only rarely does the film Cohen reads his own work (never sings) —for example, letters, poems, etc. The film does not really reflect the life story of the artist, nor his development in recent years. A huge disappointment for Cohen's big fan.
