This is the beginning of the 80s. There is a group of suspiciously old teenagers. And here the maniac pursues. Yes, this is Slasherville. <br /> <br /> This movie is called "Jokes." Why is it called pranks? I have no idea. If your idea of ​​a good joke is not to constantly beat someone with a baseball bat dinner - on the scales, and not a big joke; in fact, it is a complete prank, to tell the truth. But here you are. <br /> <br /> The film itself tells about a group of teenagers who are tasked to remove a hostel from a decommissioned apartment. They realize that the psychopath is free. To fight this development, they parted and roam in the dark. For most of them, this ends in tears. <br /> <br /> "Jokes" - poorly made slasher. The DVD I watched was Vipco. It looks like it was pretty brutal violence. This makes the DVD even more meaningless, because let's face it, a non-violent film by a director is a waste of time. Only for slasher films and videos of nasty complements.
