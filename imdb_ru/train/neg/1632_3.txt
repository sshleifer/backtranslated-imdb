An obvious vain project for Karin Mani (who?) When beauty Charles Bronson is going to wipe out the “scoundrels” who robbed her parents, grandmother and grandfather or something like that, and impress young fans with their karate skills. In the key scene she intervenes to stop the rape, and the idiotic police officer throws her into jail, so after a couple of cool scenes in the shower and some unsuccessful seduction of the prison dam, she has to take the law into her own hands, blah blah. I think there have been many such films? The script is dumber than usual if you can believe it. Mani looks like a showbiz type who will co-produce her own lead role in the movie Death Wish, and I find this type occasionally cute, but the film is a clumsy machine. Competent actors would have been wasted on the role of scum here, and would actively undermine the fantastic incompetent porcelain and the judge, who should be the producer's uncle.
