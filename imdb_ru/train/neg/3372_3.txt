The pale shadow of a great musical, this film suffers from the fact that director Richard Attenborough completely misses the meaning of the musical, unnecessarily “reveals” it and confuses the meaning of the play. A show about a group of dancers auditioning for work in the B'way musical, and explores their desire and desire to work in this complex and not always useful work. Attenborough gives us a new circle of performers of hope, suggesting that they are trying to achieve their "big breakthrough" in show business, instead of presenting a darker mix of characters created on the stage as a group of "Gypsy" workers living in the show, to show along with a pair of newbies. The film has one advantage over the play - the initial scene, which shows the size of the original audition and the true shrinking scale up to 16/17 on the line (depending on how you think Cassie, who stupidly does not start the line in the film). Anyone who can catch the local opera, Civic Lighting, will have a much richer experience than this poorly thought-out film.
