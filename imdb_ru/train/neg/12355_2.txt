After reading many reviews, I don’t know which movie some people watched, but obviously it wasn’t the movie I’ve seen. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. Acting, first of all Mura, is simply terrible. A woman cannot act. Good tits, but she just can not act. In no case did she seem to be a real character. Instead, it was spoiled, the Hollywood actress goes to the beach to play with the guys in a pretense. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is the film - the pretense of Hollywood. Teaching sequences from above. Politics - beyond that. Political correctness is beyond that. Battle scenes - you guessed it, from above. Your mission is to go in and out without being detected. So what are you doing? Why shoot as many shots as possible and make as much noise as possible, of course. About G.I. Jane, you can be my assistant at any time. <br /> <br /> The premise is good, but once Hollywood has mastered it, we’ll get Top Gun with tits. <br /> <br /> What else can you expect from US commercial films? Not much, I think.
