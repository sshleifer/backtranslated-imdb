Obviously, she has a talent, Maria Bello is always gorgeous. but it's just a waste of time, portraying each character as a person who is hated and exploited so that someone can make a film out of an “interesting” story. well, I hope they got it from their systems. Unfortunately for the audience, there is no understanding, no sensitivity, no context, and in fact there is no humanity. that everything would be fine, except that there is no humor, horror, context and nothing constructive to say about the story he is trying to tell. bad things happen, you sit and watch it, you don't care, so what? In 99% of cases, the words “based on real events” are an unintentional warning to the audience. this means that the director and screenwriter are lazy and fascinated by some of the events that they have heard about somewhere, so they just throw them on the screen and expect the “true” nature of the plot to make the audience feel something without having to do something work. I hope they had a great time filming this movie. stinks on ice.
