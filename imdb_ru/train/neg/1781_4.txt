Written by Stephen King, but this approach is not as convincing as most of his cinema stories. Mother and son move to a small Indiana town with a secret. They are lunatics, feline creatures that feed on young maidens. This little story has its share of blood and special effects; plus hints of incest. <br /> <br /> Alice Kriege is an outstanding mother. Others are Madhen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Look for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King starred as a cemetery caretaker.
