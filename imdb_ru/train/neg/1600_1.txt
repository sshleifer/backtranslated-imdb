National Lampoon's biggest hit remains "Animal House", and rightly so. It was funny, hoarse and good-natured. <br /> <br /> The complete opposite of any other National Lampoon movie. Including "Class Reunion". <br /> <br /> PLEASE do not be fooled by the inclusion of Stephen Furst (Flounder) from Animal House. Or the fact that John Hughes wrote this mess. This reunion is about as fun as the root canal, and doubly painful. <br /> <br /> One star, and it is generous. Again, I always thought that most of my old classmates were also demons, vampires, and serial killers.
