I was born, raised and educated in Scotland, and I was shocked by this disgusting image of a man who was no more and no less than scotch. Worse, the thread of the entire film was sex in one form or another, indirectly or orally. To see this, you might think that the 18th century Scotland was inhabited by a bunch of sexual perverts and homosexuals. Lange was a joke, acting like a “young” mother at 49, but Liam Nison was even worse! Taking a “bath” in a Scottish lake is NOT common, as they portrayed it, but it gave them another opportunity to demonstrate how sexually we are moved. Save your money and see Pinnochio.
