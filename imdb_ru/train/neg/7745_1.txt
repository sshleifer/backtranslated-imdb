Where to begin? special effects should be called special defects. When the director shouted “action,” I think he also instructed the actors to perform the worst performance they could think of. Perhaps he was dissatisfied with the producers and wanted to make sure that they would not return a single cent of their investments and that the work would become an example of how not to make a movie. Or maybe he hated art school and wanted to become an accountant, but his family would not allow him. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is sure is that the one who will hire him is in the future because he is in love with him (because his objectivity jumped through the window) or because he changed his name and deleted all previous previous ones links.
