I read all the comments on this movie. I am a big fan of the Dalai Lama. Therefore, I read the book on which this film was based. The film is an ugly and humiliating fiction of truth. I do not criticize this for having changed small details or events for dramatic purposes; This <br /> <br /> is not a documentary. But the scenario will CHANGE the influence, reaction, realities and changes of EVERY main character. This greatly changes the real relationship between Harrar and the young Dalai Lama. <br /> <br /> From the ridiculous rivalry for a Tibetan woman (which degrades the culture of Tibet <br /> <br />) to the gift of Harrahâ€™s music box and to the change of Garrar <br /> <br /> heart is all the movie is false - with the exception of an amazing photo <br /> <br />. I understand that the shots from the Potaly (palace) were smuggled out of Tibet. However, <br /> <br /> changing the real story about the relationship between two people, <br /> <br /> one of them is very important for this world to create <br /> <br /> the movie star is sad
