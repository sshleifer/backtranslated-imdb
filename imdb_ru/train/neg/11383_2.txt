This is really a terrible movie "B". This is stupid and often confusing. The plot, the main routine of "turning into show business," is practically absent. In fact, the film is just an excuse to push the war effort and highlight some of the popular 1942 bands, including Brothers Mills, Earl Basie, Duke Ellington, Bob Crosby and Freddie Slack. Each group gets about three standard minutes, except for the Mills brothers, who for some reason guaranteed two numbers. Ann Miller cannot dance until the last two minutes of the film, and she has little to do except to flaunt her things in the midst of the shelling of patriotic propaganda. <br /> <br /> The most interesting moment in the film In my opinion, occurred in the segment of the Duke of Ellington. The band seems to be playing in the train, standing in awkward positions. (At that time, in the deep south, the group was segregated in railroad cars during the journey.) Johnny Hodges is visible next to the duke, and Harry Carney can also be identified. At the last moments of the film, trumpeter / violinist Ray Nance rushes down the aisle to the camera and shoots Uncle Tom, looking into his eyes and moving his head, as Willy Best did in many films. For modern audiences, especially for jazz fans, such respect for segregation is really sad. Some films are best invisible.
