Yes, MTV does have a way to sell Daria. What began as a smart teen anxiety, “comment on everything that sucks and makes the viewer feel better in their obscene teenage life,” the sitcom now mutated into “how you should cope with your problems” - a simulator. I always looked at Daria and loved her. Now, sitting here after watching the so-called “movie”, I can only wonder at what the meaning of all this is. Daria tells us how to live college life? Excuse me? Didn't Daria tell in each episode that what you like to do is in order, as long as you are okay, no matter what the rest of the sick sad world thinks about it? All this reminded me of a scene in “Reality Bites”, documentaries are being shown for the first time on a film channel.
