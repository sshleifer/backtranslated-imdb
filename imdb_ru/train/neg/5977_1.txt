Wow. I don’t even remember very well this film, except that it is smelly. <br /> <br /> The plot is mostly; the girl's parents neglect her, so this sick PokeMon pretends to be her father. Am I the only one who cares? Then this crank PokeMon kidnaps Ash's mom, pretending to be a girl. I don’t care if he tries to make the girl happy, it’s just gross. <br /> <br /> There was no real conspiracy. The girl was just a whiny boy who wanted her own way. She played with the Unowns, was the “daughter” of Entei and, apparently, could grow and shrink in age at the whim with the help of her “dad”. <br /> <br /> This is almost all I remember, but I think you can take it as a hint and not see it. (Or, if you see it, do not expect much.) 1 out of 10. Seriously. If you want a movie about PokeMon, rent a “PokeMon; The first film.
