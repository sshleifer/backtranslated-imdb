I don’t look as much like a love sick as an image. Finally, the film expresses the sexual relationship between Alex, Kik, Sandu, their love triangle was full of tension, disappointment and jealousy, and finally, Alex woke up and realized that they would have no result and no future. It was sad to finish. <br /> <br /> Director Tudor Giurgiu was at the AMC Theater on Sunday, 12:00 on August 8, 2006, when we watched a movie together. After the film, he told viewers that the purpose of creating this film, which was supposed to express the sexual relations of the Romanians, was quite complex. <br /> <br /> From my point of view, sex life is always difficult everywhere, I do not feel any particular impression and effect from the film. The love relationship between Alex and Kiki, as well as Kiki and her brother Sandu, were a kind of neighborly story. <br /> <br /> Two main reasons why I don’t like this film, first, the film didn’t tell us how they started falling in love? It seems that after Alex moved into the building in which Kiki lived, the two girls fell in love. It makes no sense at all. How a girl falls in love with another girl instead of a man. Too many fragments, you have to portray and connect these stories with your mind. Secondly, the whole film did not have the scene of intercourse of Alex and Kik, this is what I was waiting for ???? However, he still had some details that deserved a recommendation. The ear piercing part was quite interesting. Alex was willing to experience the pain of ear piercing to appreciate Kik's love. It was a touching scene that gave you a little idea of ​​their love. Also on the stage, they lay on the football field, the conversation expressed their love, were truthful and passionate.
