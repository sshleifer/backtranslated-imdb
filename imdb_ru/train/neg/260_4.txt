Well, I can and will be very short. This is an incorrectly balanced, unconvincing film that could be a little better. It seems the script doesn't know which way to go ... from ridiculous to serious cliché ... it's a little silly. This is a plus of too many sentences that we heard before, “a hacker in Florida, or not, he is in Madrid, no, he is in ... he gives a signal”. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
