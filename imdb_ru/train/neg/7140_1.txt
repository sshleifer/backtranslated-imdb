You already know how painful it is to watch this movie. But I wonder why one of the worst films ever has to include one of the most beautiful cars. Why cars should be not only victims of violation, but also the only real actors and performers in it. So how could you, Porsche, Lamborghini or something like that, allow these people to connect with your cars and ruin your reputation for which you donate millions. It hurts those who love cars. It hurts those who love movies. <br /> <br /> I want my money back !!!
