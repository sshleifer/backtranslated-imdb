I see how several people who participated in this debacle wrote reviews to share their side of the story, and I thought that what they wrote helped to understand this. The fact that they basically invented excuses — they rewrite, limit the budget, production formats, etc. — they simply underline how bad this film is. And my criticism in panning is not a personal direction, but simply a warning that this one does not make the cut. <br /> <br /> This is watchable, but hardly so. In every corner there are plot holes, the dialogue borders on absurdity, and the ending is cabled a mile away. The modestly interesting feature of the hologram, interacting with the intelligence team, is drowning in foolish dialogue, like the one who cooks in the middle of what must be a tense and deadly meeting with an unknown enemy. Could you confuse us with some hamburger sally helper when these automatic sweepers are killed? Apparently, this elite team, equipped with the latest features and red plastic tubular armor, does not have access to the MRE. As soon as they get into the last rooms, they treat this place more like a four-star motel than a deadly collision zone. <br /> <br /> The meaning of the meeting with the terrible Rook is that it cannot be killed alone. , Yet only one scene back, the hero doing this thing threw King to do just that. BUT? Vivian Wu was attractive and handed the best character in the film. But this does not mean much.
