Christ, O God ... Someone looks dazed, distrustful and possibly abnormal when this tasteless exercise in a mad smut unfolds with all the wit and dexterity of a paralyzed Galapagos tortoise. Can such things be? Does this film really exist, or was I the unwitting guinea pig of some gloomy international pharmaceutical company, sipping my coffee, not knowing that a dangerous hallucinogen was added to it? I have seen many films and many bad films, but nothing prepared me for this; in the end I turned into a broken, whimpering wreck, tore teeth on the carpet like a dog, scratched the walls, howled until my lungs ached. I desperately, madly begged for mercy (to whom this appeal was addressed, I do not know) and craved the burning desire of the soothing balm Odzu Yasujiro. Sweet crying Jesus, memories ... sometimes they come back to me. When I am in the most vulnerable position, when I am least able to cope with them. I shudder, tears fall apart, bite my nails until my hands are covered with blood, but I can't completely banish terrible memories from my head. I often visit I am damaged. I am the shell of man. <br /> <br /> Other user comments suggest that Iâ€™m not alone in having experienced this horrific experience, which can only mean one of two things: a) the film does, in fact, exist, or b) I just only one victim among the legions of an international conspiracy of truly sinister proportions. What is overwhelming is that some people seemed to be enjoying their ordeal or at least not getting hurt by it. Perhaps they are part of the operation. Damn them, maniacs! Damn them to hell !!!!!!
