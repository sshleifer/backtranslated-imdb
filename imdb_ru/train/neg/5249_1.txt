I am 13 years old, and I hated this film, it is the worst film on earth. I completely wasted my time watching it and was disappointed that the film looks pretty good on the cover and on the back, but I was wrong, its bad. but when I saw Delta, she was completely different and a bad actress, and I really didn’t know how many years I tried to be two girls, I was so confused. the film was confusing in some places, and I didn’t like it at all, but I watched the whole movie, just to see if it would get better, but it wasn’t, it was boring, boring, and I said it was boring and I didn’t I think that many people liked it the same way I did. boring boring boring
