What can I say about this film, except for “I do not see it”. I waited, waited and waited for something to happen (or something else), and it just did not come. Watch it amazing how two people walk around, setting a record for most time filler screen in one movie. What are they doing? Do they reveal the secret? Do they collect evidence? Perhaps this is just hard to say. At the end of the film, after many radio signals are decoded (illegible on some kind of PET monitor), and this guy gives several lectures, the plot finally unfolds and is thrown aside as quickly as possible. Some aliens want to return to the utopia of their home world and are so happy that they want to blow up the earth (I think they don’t like to share the wealth). I guess they finished shooting and saw their 35-minute work or artwork (trash!) And decided that they would allow the film crew to turn it into an 88-minute feature film. Watching at your own risk is not even funny, because it’s so bad, it’s just bad.
