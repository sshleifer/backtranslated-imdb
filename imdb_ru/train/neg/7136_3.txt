"A complete waste of time" Just add a few explosions, nonstop battles, exotic cars, a crazy millionaire, slow computer car crashes and finally an equally important character like Hugh Hefner with hot babies from wall to wall and mix the blender and you will it be sorry for the movie. I really laughed at Doctor Evil, as a strongly fortified compound. The plot was somewhere between ridiculous and non-existent. How many millionaires are willing to bet $ 25 million on car racing? Answer: 4 but haven't they become millionaires due to fiscal responsibility? It was written for genital men, it plays like a video game. I really enjoyed the landing of the Gulfstream II in the desert.
