Where to start ... Oh yeah, the message to the bad guys: When you first find the person you were tracking (to kill), who witnessed the crime you committed, do not waste time talking to her so that she has another opportunity to leave. Message to the victim: When the gangsters are talking to each other and arguing, take this opportunity to "CHOOSE", do not sit there and do not watch them until you hear the noise they hear. Message to the Director: if someone has a 5 or 10 minute start in the car or on foot, you can't have bad guys on heels or a bumper right now! time and movement do not work that way. It would also be nice to think that a woman does not need to brutally kill (4) men in order to give herself the opportunity to leave the abusive relationship at home.
