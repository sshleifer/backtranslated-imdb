This film is a great example of how even some very funny jokes can go terribly wrong. I was really expecting something from this movie, seeing an addition that was damn funny, but the movie was not so good. <br /> <br /> The strange part is that the jokes are actually funny, the Smoking Ban parody, Joe Bole, etc., are really good jokes, but I donâ€™t know who to blame for this film. <br /> <br /> The main candidates may be: - 1) Hammers (actors)) and hammers (actresses) and not even a funny appearance 2) Director 3) A guy who shoots actors and / or director In any case, if you are really very bored, and I mean really watch this movie, or get a copy of each commercial or teaser of this movie and laugh at you, because it will be much funnier than in the movie. <br /> <br /> ps the only saving grace of this film is mahesh manjrekar and funny chappu bhai
