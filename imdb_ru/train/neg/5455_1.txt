I saw this work at the Central Asian Film Festival. My God, what was the director thinking about? Movie professors should use this film as an example of what NOT to do when creating a short film. First, this project makes absolutely no sense. The action of the film takes place partially in “Waystation”, in some silly trifling bar in the middle of nowhere, where nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The acting game is bad. So bad that I almost thought it was a comedy. Lead actress Julia Reading is a step below action in most amateur porn movies. There are one or two decent performances, including the guys who played Jacob and Fenner, but the director had no idea how to work or use his fans. The only thing that is worse than acting is a dialogue bordering on the absurd. A screenwriter (whom I suppose the director is also) writes each character as if he were auditioning for a comic villain. <br /> <br /> The overall production value is quite good, but, frankly, with such a bad film it is easy to miss. The production design is pretty good, although the Waystation looks like any ordinary bar. The costumes and make-up are in order, and I understand that the production worked with a small budget. Just when the characters speak, or they try to push the plot, the movie falls apart into pieces of shit. <br /> <br /> As I said, this film is terrible. As if the director / writer watched a lot of science fiction films, threw all the parts he liked into a blender and invented it. My only hope is that he used other people's money for it, because if he used his own, he sucks.
