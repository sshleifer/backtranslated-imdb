This Oscar Petersson film is unique. Its uniqueness lies not in history, since many half-crazy Hollywood productions have served us with comparatively pitiful scenes, but rather thoroughly that complete and complete laziness in one aspect is combined with equal lice in all other aspects. /> <br /> Dialogue is worse than embarrassing. Rotten action and horrible direction thrown into the mix. Bosnians who speak English with heavy Swedish accents add an unintended element of humor. Inimitable lightning and camera work burn the turkey cake. As a sort of surprise for the audience, there are several completely unmotivated slow motion sequences that you least expect. To add insult to a wound, it is all cut out by someone deprived of any sense of time. <br /> <br /> “The Scriptwriter of the“ bad guy becomes good after hearing the good guy speaks at the church ”, this is the point that it’s time to overthrow Ed Wood as the worst director of all time; Move over to Ed Voodoo - that’s Oscar Petersson!
