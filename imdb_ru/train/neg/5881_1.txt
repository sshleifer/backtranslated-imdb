Absolutely the most boring movie I've ever spent my money on. It was the wrong choice for all these great stars to waste their reputation on. Boring! boring! boring! Each character was portrayed in a less inspiring way. No acting talent is shown - just reading the role. Alec can play realistic characters normally, Gwynit looked ugly because of the unfavorable role, Annette needs advice on how to choose the films she wants to play in, like all those big stars that left me disappointed with how they let them talents that can be stifled in a function that leaves much to be desired in entertainment. "Running with scissors" encourages the public to anticipate an excellent game in the film, which involves experiencing tension and deep emotions. There was not a single moment when the actors could portray any interpretation of this on the screen. Maybe it was the director's mistake ---- anything.
