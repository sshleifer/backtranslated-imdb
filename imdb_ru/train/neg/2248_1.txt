This movie is a huge smoking pile. <br /> <br /> I have no idea why someone thought that the Garland / Mason version needed to be redone, and why Strieshand would be the best choice for a star. <br /> <br /> I have no idea why our people (gay Americans) tend to think of Strisand as a kind of treasure. At least, in my opinion, she professionally worked with “Funny Girl” and “Bogdanovich, how are you”. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and rent a classic Judy or even an original (a wonderful movie in itself), but please, please, skip this smelly pot!
