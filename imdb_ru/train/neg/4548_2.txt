Boring. The minimum plot. No character development. I entered this film with high expectations from the book. It could be a terrific movie. It could become a cult classic. No, it was a huge disappointment. It was poorly molded and had terrible special effects. It was difficult to determine who the bad guys were: rebels or the military, or the church, or all of them? I'm still puzzled by some mini-plots from the movie. I am surprised at some aspects of this so-called “prophecy,” which is never fully explained. I felt like I was watching a banal episode of a mini-series on a science fiction channel. It was like a movie made for television. Do not go watch this movie. It is a waste of time and money.
