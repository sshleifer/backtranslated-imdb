I was ready to come to terms with many of the militants in the late spring / summer, but in general this was due to the fact that most of them have a reasonable return (for example, cool special effects, interesting plot twists, comic value, Steve Bushemi, etc.) In this film, however, this was nothing. All we got is a cheap thrill of splitting Eva Longoria for a few minutes (Maximâ€™s release is cheaper than a movie ticket). I feel an awkward lack of plot, suspense, history, character development, continuity, etc. I would like to go into details, but, to be honest, most of the movie I may have forgotten with pleasure. <br /> <br /> All the while I was in the theater, I kicked myself for not spending half a day watching the 24 seasons on DVD. Save your money on this, folks. If you really, really, really dislike splitting Eva Longoria.
