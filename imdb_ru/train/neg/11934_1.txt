I spent almost one episode of this series and just could not bear it anymore. It seemed to me that I had already watched dozens of episodes, and then struck me ..... There is nothing new here! I heard this joke about Seinfeld, I saw someone fall for friends like that, the episode "Happy Days" had almost the same storyline, etc. None of the actors here are interested! Some were good at other shows (not here), while others were new to the profession they should never have attended. Avoid this abomination!
