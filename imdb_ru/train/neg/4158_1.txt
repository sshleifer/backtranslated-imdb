This is the worst movie I've ever seen !!!! <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that I have never seen a movie worse than this !!! <br /> <br /> AND I DON'T KNOW EVER !!!! <br /> <br /> I’m a big fan of horror films "B". As you can imagine ... I am faced with some of the worst effects that the film industry has to offer. <br /> <br /> I was attracted by this film by name. I mean, come on ... what a true horror fan would not intrigue such a title as “Vampires vs. Zombies” ??? The images of the "undead" fighting each other and the "undead" danced in my head. I thought to myself ... "This I must see" !!!! <br /> <br /> Well ... sorry, but to say ... "I would not want that" !!!!! <br /> <br /> This movie title is misleading, to say the least. There were no vampires fighting zombies. In fact, there is no plot !!!! If you asked me what this film was about, I would honestly say that I have no idea !!! <br /> <br /> There was no plot !!!! <br /> <br /> There was no history !!!! <br /> <br /> This film absolutely does not make any sense at all. <br /> <br /> At the end of this disaster ... I felt sorry for the poor souls who invested their money in this project, because they certainly do not have any business sense !!!
