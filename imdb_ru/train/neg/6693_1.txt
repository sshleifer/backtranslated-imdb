Run away from this movie. Even by B-movie standards, this movie is terrible. It is also insidious in its topic. The main theme is that people who reject society and do not respect anything are cool and admirable. People who treat others with respect are losers. Guncrazy is a film that speaks of the deprivation of civil rights much better than this film, watch it. <br /> <br /> No normal child will do what Trent does. State soldiers do not work the way they work in this film, etc. After watching this film, you will understand why the writers use the cliche “prostitute with a heart of gold”. Micah is not a sympathetic prostitute who, yes, had a terrible life. However, she is such a terrible person that viewers cannot identify with her. <br /> <br /> Usually there is one thing for which a film can be recommended, in this case not. This is such a funny film, it offends a person who is trying to identify himself with the main characters. The game is adequate to the standards of B-movies, and the direction does not represent anything new or interesting.
