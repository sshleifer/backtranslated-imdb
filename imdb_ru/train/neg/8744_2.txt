I happened to be in this movie. I'm still not sure if I regret it or not. I felt that I was watching a film made by a group of film school students who didn’t quite hit. He plays along with every conceivable Hollywood cliché, all the while smacking us with the message “corporations are absolute evil.” The subtleties of this film do not know. As far as possible, he even manages to create his own spoilers. <br /> <br /> History seems to be turning into the fantastic world of computer nerd. The protagonist is an attractive teenager with a girlfriend, but still the programming genius and the obvious hacker (I think), among many other elements that you have to see, is fantasy. <br /> <br /> Also, I should have known that it would be a z-movie when I saw Ned Bellamy ... he tends to be a good tip. <br /> <br /> Can't recommend this one, I'm afraid
