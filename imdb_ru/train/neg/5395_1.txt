Kenneth Branagh is trying to turn William Shakespeare's incomprehensible, rarely produced comedy into a musical of the 1930s, and the result is poor Shakespearean and bad musical comedy, since actors rarely own one or the other of the two styles, and in some cases flounder is bad in both. Especially painful is Nathan Lane, who seems to be under the impression that he is absolutely hysterical, like Costard, but he is mistaken, and Alicia Silverstone, who treats Shakespeare's language with all the power of a teenage Valley Girl, who reads aloud this script in her English lesson language in high school. <br /> <br /> Musical numbers are based on the experience of the school production “Dame at Sea”, as a result of which the actors look awkward and unprofessional when they sing and dance, with the exception of one. Adrian Lester, who proves that he is a great singer and dancer. The only other salutary elegance of the film is the contribution of Natasha McElhon and Emily Mortimer as a bait for the eyes, but they showed much better results than in this film, and you would be wise to check out some of the other titles in their filmography and give it a brainless mess.
