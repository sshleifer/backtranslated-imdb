Sometimes I hang my head and think about the reasons why films about killer sharks and / or crocodiles are still being made. They have been making these lame “jaws” copies since the 70s, not that they become more popular. The idea is the same. So, we have an animal that starts killing people. First, he removes some minor characters, then he begins to attack the main characters, which are usually played by a couple of nonentities, except for someone who used to be a little more famous, who usually plays a specialist. One of the main characters usually dies before the others somehow kill the animal, usually with an explosion. Then we usually get the last shot, where we see that the animal is still alive or is already laying eggs, etc. Crocodilus basically uses the same overly used ideas and does absolutely nothing to create even a little variation. If you do not take into account the fact that the “specialist” is the captain in this one variant, in this case your standards are rather low. It's funny that Duncan Reger plays him, although he, as before, was Zorro. Gosh, I'll get a bonus point for this.
