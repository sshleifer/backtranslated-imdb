If Deborah Messing had not yet starred as “Grace,” this could have been a tolerable film. However, this is just another story about a broken maid with problems, who hires a paid escort (Dermot Mulroney), which she reads in an article in Time magazine to go to London for her sister's wedding in London. How new is this plot? <br /> <br /> Not funny and not romantic, the date of the wedding slips along the storyline of the bride’s deceptive sex and the best man and pays for the accompaniment to impersonate the movie “Four Weddings without Hugh and, of course, a dead end deal for the naive groom who does not know his bride's sexual history (Amy Adams). While Messing improved the repressed princess, a 30-year-old woman with an unsuccessful relationship history, her neurotic and drunken movements on the next artificial cavalier are just a repetition of her series. If this woman is an actress, get a role that does not override what is already in prime time. <br /> <br /> A lot of drunken women's connections, cricket jokes and Mulroney in a towel (nice!), But the film is a bore with an obvious happy ending. Expected continuation Messing: Date of divorce.
