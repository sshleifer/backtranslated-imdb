1914 was an amazing year for Charlie Chaplin. It was his first year in the movie, and he starred in more than 30 films! Although most of these films were not particularly good, they gave him the opportunity to slowly develop his personality on the screen. However, thanks to this film, the familiar character "Little Tramp" was still in development. Of course, Charlie looked the part, but his character still lacked sweetness and decency, which he later developed. Instead, Chaplin often beat, kicked, or did other unpleasant things to people, seemingly for no reason. <br /> <br /> With regard to this very small film, it is interesting to look at the cast. Although they are not familiar today, Chaplin stars, along with Mabel Normand, Chester Conklin and Mac Swain, are all exceptionally popular stars with Keystone films. The problem with this film is that although there are some good scenes in it, the plot seems very vague and incorrectly designed. Chester and Mabel got to the race track (a very common theme in Keystone productions - it must have been close to the race track). Charlie and Mac appear and make their way inside. The police are after this while Charlie slaps Chester and steals his girlfriend. In the end, for no apparent reason, the police take Chester and Mac, leaving Charlie with Mabel (which, oddly enough, did not seem to be Charlie’s abominable behavior). <br /> <br /> Unless you're a huge dumb comedic amateur or film historian, this is a very forgotten film that is only important in Chaplin's evolution. The fact that he and other actors are actually doing on stage, although not something unusual for the film “Keystone,” is not particularly funny if you look today.
