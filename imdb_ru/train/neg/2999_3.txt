Another robbery on Friday the 13th, even with the participation of some of his music! A group of young people is going to a small high school reunion and starts killing a la Jason Voorhees. Could it be the same nerd they tortured at school? <br /> <br /> The usual slash festival is very interesting for fans of the genre and contains the usual T & A quota for films. The ending is a bit more creative than that of a regular slasher. <br /> <br /> MPAA: rating of violence, blood, sexuality, nudity and drug content.
