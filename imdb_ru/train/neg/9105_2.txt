What can I say about cruel intentions 2? Well, I can honestly say that I will watch this film again only if I am fastened to a chair and my eyes open in a clockwise direction in an orange style. <br /> <br /> The Stars movie is Robin Dunn (No, I never heard of him either) whose terrible impression of Ryan Phillip made me cringe. In the case of terrible casting, Dunn tries (and cannot) to leave, playing a handsome charismatic caster. Since the actor is not handsome, not charismatic and not charming, the character remains absolutely incredible. Amy Adams, (she was in an episode with Buffy once), trying to figure out where Sarah Michelle Gellar stopped, and revive Catherineâ€™s intrigue ... However, Adams is not as good as the actress, and her performance was flat and lacking in any real emotion, she often looked like she was reading replicas right from the camera. However, there were two good actors in the film, Barry Flatman (Saw 2 & Saw 3) and Mimi Rogers (Mrs. Kensington in Auration Powers), who played very good and entertaining performances as parents of Sebastian and Catherine and are the only reason why I appreciated the movie as 2, not 1. <br /> <br /> The film itself is a bad version of the original, with such low figures as a copy of the dialogue and imitated scenes that lacked the originality of the previous film. <br /> <br /> I think that, as a TV show, it could work, but if it was redone with people who could play leading roles.
