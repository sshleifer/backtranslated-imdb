As was to be expected, Gregory Peck’s game was excellent, and the cinema was stunning even when playing right into some melodramatic “moment”. But the rest of the film was overworked and hard to watch, for me anyway. I liked it, but I had to fast forward the last thirty minutes or so. I feel like I wasted a couple of good hours. If it were not for Gregory Peck, I would not have lasted fifteen minutes. 4/10.
