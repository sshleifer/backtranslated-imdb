Dooohhh! My Bwainn Hurrrts! Well, it is, of course, after this endurance test of the film. How the hell did I manage to keep moving without pressing the fast forward button, only the lord knows. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's me !! Maybe I don’t understand the premise of the film ... or maybe I don’t appreciate its supposed mystical atmosphere. In my humble opinion, the film has the same mystical atmosphere as a trip to McDonalds. <br /> <br /> In addition, all the characters were terrible, and there was more character development in the Tom and Jerry cartoon. Yaarrrghhh! Why am I doing this? Why do I watch such pranks? This is enough to escape and join the monastery or the Foreign Legion !! YAARGH !! Absolute horrible movie in almost every way. In addition, it is not so bad.
