Well and a joke. I watch it on channel 1 and I think that dry paint is much more interesting. What happened to Caspar Van Dien caused him to become entangled in this nightmare. Awful game, very boring plot and terrible direction. This is so terrible, this is ridiculous. It is assumed that he is full of expectations, but it is rather a comedy. If you want to see a horrible game, a ridiculous scriptwriting and storyline, watch this movie. If I were Van Dien, I would not only ask my agent for 10%, but also fired the bastard. What a turkey It doesn't even fit to be on MST 3K! It would be a good movie to cure your insomnia. I especially like the part where Wang Ding throws overboard, and then returns in a few minutes! I can only imagine that it was not written by trade union authors who took advantage of the authorâ€™s strike. What a horrible movie !!!
