This so-called “documentary” is trying to say that the United States rigged the landing on the moon. The year is correct. <br /> <br /> Everyone who really studied this case knows differently. <br /> <br /> First of all: there is an unequivocal proof. When the astronauts were on the moon, they brought a LOT of pounds of stone from the moon for geological research. They have spread around the world to hundreds of laboratories that have tested them. And they all came to the conclusion that they came from the same planet, and not from the earth: because the internal isotopes of the basic elements differ from those found on the earth, but they are similar to those calculated on the moon. I.E. conspiracy theorists never learn anything: they take only what fits into their theory and ignore everything else. <br /> <br /> Another wrongful allegation from them is that their wind was in the hangar, where they shot at the moon landing, IE flag moves. There is a logical explanation: the astronaut moved his hand, so he moved. And what this proves is: well, if the conspiracy theorists even studied the footage, they would see that the flag NEVER moves after the astronaut allowed it to be, i.e. conspiracy theorists are bad scientists, they cannot study the subject properly or study it only until they get what they come to make a lie out of it and make a profit (i.e., this is the so-called “documentary” )). <br /> <br /> The statement says that it was impossible to take pictures on the moon, because all the shadows come from different places, because there are different sources of light, artificial lighting from the studio. Once again, conspiracy theorists are wrong (as usual), the same thing would happen in the earthly desert at night, without sources of light. But I doubt that any conspiracy theorists have ever been outside their grandmothers' basements for more than how many days the Star Trek convention took place. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy theorists have denied BIG TIME. They see only what they want to see. Thus, they constitute all these lies in order to seem important - that is a fact.
