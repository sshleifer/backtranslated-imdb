This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, the best part was Christian J. Meoli "Leonard" trying to jump up and down behind the bar, sort of like I wanted to do on DVD to save the rest of humanity - the agony of watching this shitty the movie. He has a great cast, so you keep watching how everything will be fine, I mean Sean Astin "Andrew" (he played his part perfectly, did his job perfectly, itâ€™s very bad that it was in this film) Kira Sedgwick "Bevan", Ron Livingston "Chad", Renee Zellweger "The Poet" (her name is written on the cover, she has only 1 line and less than 4 seconds in the whole movie ... <br /> <br /> If the cast he had any merit, they went out and bought all copies of this film and burned them along with the writer / director George Hickenlooper and the writer By john enbom
