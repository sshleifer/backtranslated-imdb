“Rambo: Part II of the First Blood” by George P. Kosmatos - pure fulfillment of desires. The United States clearly did not win the Vietnam War. They caused damage to this country beyond imagination, and this film continues the fabulous story of innocent soldiers. The only bad guys were the leaders of the nation who made this war happen. The Rambo character is perfectly aware of this. He is extremely patriotic, regrets that Americans-Americans did not appreciate and did not celebrate the achievements of one soldier, but he only has a lack of confidence in leading officers and politicians. As with any film that defends war (for example, “We were soldiers”), this film also avoids the need to explain the cause of the battle in South Asia. And in this respect also the cause of every single American-American soldier who was there. Instead, Rambo is avenging the wounds of the whole nation. It would be better to work on how to deal with memories, rather than suppress them. "Can we win this time?" Yes you do.
