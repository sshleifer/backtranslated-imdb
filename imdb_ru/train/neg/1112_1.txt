I like to watch western movies, but this movie takes cookies. Scenario and dialogue are ridiculous. The game was terrible, where did they get them from? The music was fine, I have to say. Fortunately, I did not buy or rent a movie, but now it is recycled. <br /> <br /> I was set up from the very beginning, when a stranger (Martin Sheen) began to tell his story. I have to admit that I really enjoyed the confrontation between Hopalong and Tex when Hopalong shot a finger off Tex and told him to practice for 40 years to reach his league. But then it all became pear-shaped. I had to watch the whole movie in the hope that it would be better, never done.
