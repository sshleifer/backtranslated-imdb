from the very beginning of this film, you will soon find out that the name of the film has nothing to do with the film itself: from watching a naked woman who is pursued by people in very stupid masks to servants running around in the worst clothes I have ever seen and everything it’s in the subtitles that makes this kind of film that you have to think twice about, and when the movie moves slowly, you soon realize that the vampire is not a vampire, you need to wonder where the name comes from in some parts of the movie. A bit of sense with Pierre and his father, but when the film comes to its really stupid ending, you have to think about why the movie ends this way, and, unfortunately, they had a better ending, unless it’s in their minds a movie to watch.
