I have never seen this movie, but I can tell you one thing about its production. During the DJ comedy / old radio in 1988, the producer called me. They asked if I could write and record a little, and they would fall into the soundtrack as sounds coming from the TV (the television screen itself would never be shown). I said, of course, I wrote a parody of the 50s clich√© with fantastic monsters, collected several sound effects and invited another DJ, Pam Landry, to play the female role. When she got on the air at that time, she recorded a long song, joined me at the microphone in the production room, and we tore up the voice track at a time. Giggling, she returned to her show, and I mixed silly sound effects. We would never have done this if we knew that the "massacre in the forest" would be such a turkey, but again, we were never paid for our efforts! - Gary Theroux
