It gets worse, the series is experiencing a serious fall. The first two sequels were acceptable, and since then we have seen a lot of really awful movies. Robert Englund gives another great performance in the role of Freddie, but the rest of the cast cannot act. The story of Alice, who survived the previous edition of the Nightmare series, discovers that Freddy Krueger’s death dreams begin again. This time, the mocking killer pierces the sleeping mind of Alice’s unborn baby. His intention is to be “born again” in the real world. The only one who can stop Freddie is his dead mother, but can Alice release her spirit in time to save her own son? Check out the first three, skip the next three, then look at the last.
