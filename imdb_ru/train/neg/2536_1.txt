My wife and I just finished watching Bûsu AKA The Booth. She fell asleep during some parts of the film. I would really like me to take a nap with her, but the unfortunate fact is that the voice of the main character is so loud and annoying that I could not sleep. When our main character speaks, I want to hear Regis Philbin and William Shatner sing karaoke. He also has no redemptive qualities. I hoped he would get on the bus five minutes after the movie began. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I love Asian horror cinema, but The Booth is extremely annoying and full of scenes that really makes no sense at all. If you want a good Asian movie, watch “The Tale of Two Sisters” or “In the Mirror”. Avoid Booth as a plague, especially if you suffer from frequent migraines.
