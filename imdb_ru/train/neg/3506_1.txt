I would not look so quickly at all the good reviews and say that this could be a good show. This show is good only if you do not know what “talent” is. I won’t even say how offensive it is (I know that it can be offensive to many people) because it’s not quite what bothers me in the series .. I’m worried that people watch it and think it’s funny ... It makes me feel that our generation is becoming stupid, and I'm actually afraid that one day it will be managed by people who are watching this garbage .. <br /> <br /> In fact, the plot is simple ... we are talking about abusive, self-centered, spoiled women (Sarah Silver people) making our way through everyday life s .. <br /> <br /> So .. Like a million times was not ... In fact, almost every joke or was made or racist. <br /> <br /> Sarah also loves to sing .. I like her voice .. that's all .. not words .. lyrics are terrible .. she likes to sing about many things .. <br /> <br /> If you like to see how hot women put everyone else down and make them feel like shit, while farting at the same time talking shit about every race, then this show is for you ..
