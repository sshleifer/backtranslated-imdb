This film is nothing more than a religious treatise promoting classical Hinduism and New Age occultism, dressed in Western images, which are swallowed by those who do not know the basic religious comparisons. The main tenants of Hinduism contain elements of reincarnation. (Some characters appear both now and in the 1600s), obviously, reincarnate. God is impersonal power. Animal life and plant life are the same. (This is pantheism). Redfield tried to mix Eastern mystic with Western Christianity. His attempt at syncretism may deceive or confuse those who are not seeking the truth, but this film is a weak excuse for any ultimate reality. As advertised in the old Berkeley Barb for $ 10.00, you will learn how to start your own religion. As one famous prophet said: “Use the Power, Luke.”
