Great actors. <br /> <br /> A lousy scenario and not a very good direction. My main problem was that I simply did not care for any of these people. Not a killer, not a victim. The settings were pretty gray. Dennis Quaid's character was so poorly written that I didnâ€™t care when the end came He returned his child. Big deal! I wanted my money back.
