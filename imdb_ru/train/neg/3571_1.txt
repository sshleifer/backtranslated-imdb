The supersexual actress in the movie “B” has another role - the girlfriend of the future star “Goodfellas” Ray Liotta in this box-office bomb. She plays Marion, has only one line of dialogue, well, in fact, one word of dialogue in fact. She screams "Joe!" because Ray's character breaks poor Pia Zadora with a plastic garden hose sprinkler. This film is so bad, although sometimes it becomes funny, funny. The guys from Mystery Science Theater 3000 will love it! Look at the hysterical scene at the end, where Pia suffered a nervous breakdown, and all the silly edits and effects they make to try to show how awful Pia’s character is. In this, Pia plays a novice Hollywood screenwriter. Pia Zadora as a screenwriter? Yes, right. Pia can barely speak, let alone write! Pia is completely and absolutely not in this stupid role. But who cares? The real star is hot and fresh Glory Annen in her role, in the opinion of this cat! Rock on glory!
