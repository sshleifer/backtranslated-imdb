A decent sequel, but does not pack the beat of the original. Murderous screenwriter (Judd Nelson) takes on new personalities to direct his own novel, Lake Cabin. Still a ruthless murder, but the movie seems very mocking. Any humor is not funny. It seems that the whole project has the quality of speed, and from time to time Nelson turns out to be on top. This film is about a script that is being rewritten before going to the screen ... it should have happened with this script.
