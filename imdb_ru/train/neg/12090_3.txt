Although I can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film due to its intrigues, I probably thought that the painfully long nature in how the structure of the scene was played was too large to be asked for by most viewers. Huge holes in the script, such as the never-explained comment of the mother “your father died today”, made it even harder to try to figure out these characters. <br /> <br /> This took first place in Cannes in 2001. This is a shock given. Perhaps that year the French were eager for a film noir and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film. I perceived long scenes as a device that allows the viewer to feel as awkward as possible, but combined with the inability to treat the main character, this went too far for me and kept me at a distance from the story. <br /> <This film is intended only for the most loyal fan of the film noir and one who does not expect satisfaction from watching the film after it ends. I loved films such as “Trainspotting” or “Requiem for a Dream” - which were much more disturbing, but at least gave the viewer something in terms of editing and stimulation. Watching the teachers slowly and painfully silent, the scene behind the scenes became so excessive that I found it tiresome - and I really wanted this film to be liked at every turn.
