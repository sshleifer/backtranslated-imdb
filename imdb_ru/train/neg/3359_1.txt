They screwed up this story! In the end, Nell is all heroic and takes responsibility for the team in order to save all her asses from Hill House and a bunch of all sorts of nonsense! They added that they cut heads, wires cut people's faces, and the ceiling turns into a giant hand! What the hell is this about ??? I own and love the original film, I read the book, and I like it! The reason why the original film and the book are so good is that they are very scary, not even showing the ghost. There is no blood here. There is no ceiling arm. This is only advertising ghosts, as ghosts can really kill a person. They cannot kill us, they cannot throw us around the room or plunge a knife into our head. Not. They can drive us crazy. Removing all our feelings of security. Nell was a selfish woman. She wanted only good things for herself. Yes, she cared a little about others, but not too much. David Self and Jan de Bon took care of this wonderful story! I hate this damn remake!
