One two three four five six seven eight and back, haha. This must be seen, above all, to see the work. A lot of work has been shown, look at these close-ups, mate, you'll like it. A video clip was probably based on this film a few years ago. This is a slasher, but without waiting. The end is funny too, and the clothes that she wears in the woods in front of the copper, Jesus, looks like a clown. Murders are mostly done off-screen, blood flows, but never too bloody. There are also many scenes of struggle, and no one was hurt. And what about weapons for murder, never seen so much, do not spoil it, you have to see it. And being a slasher is also a lot of T & A. Guess who the killer is, you will fall into the trap several times, and this is the best part, but what about the copper story in the forest? But still, because of his cheerfulness, this is still one that many would like to have. I am glad that I have my copy, one of those mishaps. But man, these clothes and not to mention the hairstyles! If you are over 40, then this is one of those who returned to the line of memory.
