I do not know where to start. Tara Reid needs to be stopped before she gets into another movie. Stephen Dorff looks like he got his character's motivation from Val Kilmer in Top Gun. Slater moans through this dusk. Direction, editing, sound (do we really need a heavy metal video in the middle of a shootout?), Suits (bulletproof vests with muscles on them), and hey, there is also no noticeable plot. It surprises me that none of the project participants stopped and said: “Hey, guys, it just doesn't make any sense, let's start all over again.” I hope Slater’s career can recover from this disaster. <br /> <br /> Hand over the worst movie I've ever seen.
