I am sure that people on the border of Texas and Louisiana must have laughed or two when the B image unit Paramount put it on the martial public. Very simply, the area along the Sabina River, where the film opens, is a cotton country, like the rest of the deep south, or at least the deep south was after the Civil War. There are no large cattle empires, they are much farther west in Texas, further than Richard Dix and Preston Foster could go to establish their empire. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the fact that they are both partners in a river vessel and when Leo Carrillo tries to steal their services without paying them for transporting his cattle, they keep cattle. And this is the beginning of a large Ponderosa, similar to a ranch, which they begin. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Foster marries Dix's sister, played by Francis Gifford, and is at war with his much smaller neighbors. They also have some further encounters with Leo Carrillo. <br /> <br /> In any case, we Easterners who like westerns usually don’t worry about geographical details, and this is still a good western from the Harry Sherman mill that Hopalong Cassidy’s westerns produced for Paramount. The climax is brilliant, and I mean, literally, the shootout, which perhaps should have been used in the production of A. <br /> <br /> But I would not want Western fans to look at it.
