First of all, Jenna Jameson is the best actress in this film, and sheâ€™s just terrible. This film has every horrible movement cliche in the imagination, and everything is badly played. Super sexy teen couple. Ridiculous (not) horny athlete. Snotty cool chick. Eerie local flavor. A pair of parent type. The virgin maiden who surprisingly never dies in these films. The dialogue is so terribly awful and delivered with depth to wade. As if you want them all to die before. I saw a draft version of this film a while ago, but for some reason it only got worse. Of course, the funniest thing here is a ghoul trying to eat Jameson's implants, but it hardly appreciates even the rent of this dog. Avoid at all costs.
