I was looking at Richard Burton’s movie list when I came to this title, which I remember very well when I first saw it on cable in 1982. I remember the dialogue with Tatum O'Neill, which was simply startlingly bad. I remember how Richard Burton's character looked so hopelessly lost, and then remembered how his motives did not translate me. In short, I remember Circle Two, because it was so phenomenally terrible. <br /> <br /> This film came out at a time when America was experiencing a rather disturbing period of obsession with unhealthy or distorted adolescence. sexuality. Remember the Blue Lagoon (and other troubles of Brooke Shields), Lipstick, Little Lovely, Bo Per, and other films that seemed to only talk about teenagers having sex, especially with adults. As a teenager at this time, I found that obsession in conjunction with the sexual excesses of the 70s and 80s was created for a subconsciously disturbing environment in which to understand all this, so to speak. <br /> <br /> “Circle Two” doesn’t work as well as the Blue Lagoon. In fact, he solves the question of love between young and old in a bold, if not entirely successful manner. But, to be honest , this is one of those films that you will never see if you haven’t seen it for the first time, because it was really terrible. Nobody would like this garbage to ever appear in public.
