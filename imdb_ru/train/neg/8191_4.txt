“Fred Klaus” somehow avoids becoming “Grandfather Frost” this year, at least having a bit more funny moments than that star actor Tim Allen, but that doesn’t mean that he has enough for it that is worth the trip. to the theatre. <br /> <br /> In the course of the festive films, everything is thoughtful and sentimental. But in fact, this may be the smallest problem, since “Fred Klaus”, boasting that David Dobkin is at the helm (“Shanghai Knights”, “Wedding Crushers”), contains almost no really funny moment, as he clumsily steps on him the line between Vince Vaughan's boorish car and a fuzzy Christmas movie. In the end, it is not so much. And with the cast, which includes Paul Giamatti, Kevin Spacey, Rachel Weiss and Katie Bates, all the more so as it leaves disappointed. <br /> <br /> Vaughn plays Fred, Nick's older brother (Jamaatti), who is alienated, once, leaving him and their parents (Bates and Trevor Peacock), fed up with the favoritism of their parents and his younger brother. Nick grew up to be Santa Claus (and, as voice-over tells us, time freezes on you and your family when you become holy), while Fred becomes a weary repo yuletid in Chicago, who find it difficult to remember his girlfriend Day the birth of Wanda (Weiss). <br /> <br /> He has problems with the law, and he had to call his younger brother (who looks eerily ten years older than him) to get him out of prison. Nick agrees, but only if Fred agrees to help in packing toys at the North Pole. Fred reluctantly agrees, but his cynicism conflicts with Santa and the ever-cheerful nature of the elves, even when an efficiency expert (Spacey) checks the work of the toy factory, and is just glad that all activities in the Arctic will be closed if something goes wrong . /> <br /> The film, as already mentioned, has its own moments, but the soft running length stretches them over the entire duration. Between them lie piles of Christmas cliches that were better processed, say, in “Elf,” and the attempts of sentimentality are as sweet as last year's cake. <br /> <br /> Vaughn, as usual, brings his coarse charm to the table, but Dan Fogelman’s neutered script does not allow him to really do his job. Giamatti under a bad fat suit gives a cheerful old charm to his cult character, but, unfortunately, he has to play a minor violin in front of Fred. Spacey brings his playing face, but his moves usually end as meaninglessly meaningless. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, “Fred Klaus” becomes a forgotten film, which falls lower than those who participate in it deserve. Of course, there are worse ways to start the movie season, but, of course, there are much better ones.
