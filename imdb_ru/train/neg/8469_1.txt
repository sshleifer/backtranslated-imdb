"Children like these" could be a worthy movie, given the subject. But instead, he became the usual television movie of the week, in which not so much. The action is obsolete, the plot is predictable and the direction does not exist. For a better movie on the same topic, try the excellent “Le Huitième Jour”, a film that really cares about people with Down Syndrome. In Kids Like This, they are simply used as an excuse for sentimental sentimentality. Pretty awful. 1/10
