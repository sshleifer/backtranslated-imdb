After reading the comments on the site, I feel obliged to write for the first time. It seems that this film is similar to Marmite and divided the audience. I have to say that, although I agree that films should not make sense to be enjoyable (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE), they still have to draw you to the characters. Now that I have been completely absorbed in the murderous lesbian romance in Lynch’s opus, I must say that I could not find fault with Mr. Green or the other cardboard gangsters who inhabited this world of everyday life. <br /> <br /> Besides, despite the fact that many people try to say that you didn’t like it because you didn’t understand it, I wouldn’t agree - I didn’t like it because I was bored. I wanted the film to end, and constantly listening to these quotes did not help again and again. Call it smart, if you want, - I think it's boring. <br /> <br /> However, my main reason for writing this article was to ask all the other reviewers a question - there was no end credits on the print of the film that I saw, Just music on a black background. Did I watch a dim imprint or is this proof of GR pretense? Or did everyone who participated in the film watch the draft and delete their name ???
