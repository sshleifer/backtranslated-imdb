How do I start watching a movie that will soon be recognized as the “worst movie of all time” “the worst director of all time”? A film that can develop a cult of followers, because it is "so bad that it is good." <br /> <br /> The analytic approach that criticizes the film seems pointless and part of the group-turning syndrome — let's be free to play without worrying about the negative reaction. because every other person on earth does this, and people who like the film like the flaws that we bring. <br /> <br /> The overall poor quality of the film goes without saying - "Sixteen Years of Alcohol" that this film may go the distance. IMDb does not allow enough words to cite all the failures of films, and it would be much easier to find elements of "Sixteen Years of Alcohol". Unfortunately, these moments of glory are so deeply buried in the shadow of the poverty of this film, that this task should not be performed. <br /> <br /> My impressions? I thought I knew what I was getting involved in, I was warned to drink a few cups of coffee before I sat down to see it (it’s a pity that this offer was vodka cups). Despite my low expectations, “Sixteen Years of Alcohol” could not entertain me even at the level of “poke fun at a bad movie.” Not just bad, but disgustingly bad, as if Jobson intentionally tried to make this film a poetic yawn, but he fell into amazement and pushed poetry into our throat, making it not deep, but funny. ... and supposedly Jobson sincerely tried to make a good movie? Even after viewing the advertising literature “Sixteen Years of Alcohol,” it’s hard for me to believe in Jobson’s sincerity. Senseless and unpleasant to the end, a few moments of grin / laughter (everything, I'm sure, not intentional) spiced up the film, and these few elements did not allow me to turn off the DVD. So bad is good? Not. Simply enough, "I can not believe that this is a serious movie moments," to not let me turn it off, and nothing more. <br /> <br /> Definitely a movie to watch with a group of bad people. movie lovers. Get your own running comment. This would greatly improve my experience. So bad that Mike Myers comments on the Scottish accent on him in his cod when he runs to turn this whole piece of silt into a comic farce: "Okay, man, tell me good luck."
