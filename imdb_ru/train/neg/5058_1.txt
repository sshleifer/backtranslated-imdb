(When will I ever learn?) An enthusiastic NPR reviewer made me think that this turkey was another citizen of Kane. Please allow me to pour out my spleen ... <br /> <br /> I admit: the situation, apparently, New York, has never been so frankly ugly and unattractive. They remind me that the 70s were a bad decade for men's fashion and cars. And everyone smokes! If the plan was to cheapen the characters, then it was a success. <br /> <br /> For a film to work (at least, according to my simple estimate), there must be at least ONE handsome character. Only Ned Beati approached, and I couldn't wait for him to finish off Nikki. If a random shot hit Mikey, well, perhaps he caused the most indifference. <br /> <br /> I don’t remember when I hated the movie so much. I believe that I am a ruby ​​who doesn’t dig for "feature" films. Well.
