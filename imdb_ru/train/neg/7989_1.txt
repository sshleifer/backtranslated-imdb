I had high expectations after “My beautiful laundry”, “Beat like Beckham” and (less) “East is East.” In the history of British Asians who fit into their foster home, there were many good jogging on the big screen, as well as many excellent television and radio programs (God, gracious, etc.). This one has no success. Despite a good start, he quickly went downstairs. <br /> <br /> In the end, it was a terribly typical BBC job with strong regional accents, crazy characters, a “these were the days” soundtrack and many “problems” in an effort to be worthy. <br /> <br /> I discovered that in many moments of this film I clung. The letter is predictable. All possible cliches were stretched and broadcast. In fact, it’s hard for me to think of any cross-cultural / cross-generation devices that could be used but not used. The characters were skinny and stamped: an eccentric nonconformist minister; well-meaning but ultimately racist old woman; overweight, domineering aunt; persistent indian parents; working class neighbor; "Wise" deep grandmother; gangster riding a motorcycle. The script was weak, and everyone shocked the public with a frank racist dialogue of two-dimensional racist white characters. And why it should have been set in the 70s (except for the need to justify for the 70s soundtrack) is a mystery. Perhaps this makes the incredible characters a little more believable for people born after 1979. I dont know. <br /> <br /> Even apart from this, a good acting game could lead to respectable ambiguity. Instead, the usual suspects "BBC comedies" were taken out to pick it up. “Bend like Beckham” showed a much better comic game (and in fact a serious acting game) than this, with a virtually unknown composition. <br /> <br /> In general, a lazy cliché scenario, an overly active, boringly predictable story. Skip it. <br /> <br />
