Tashan - the title itself explains the nature of the film. <br /> <br /> This type of movie is actually made for the flop. What a pity that Yash Raj Films releases such films that are worth nothing than class C films. Or even some class C films have a better and more enjoyable history than Tashan. Strongly promoted and overly confidently advertised "Tashan" badly bombed at the box office, which he certainly deserved. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the worst film ever made from the banner of the honorary Yash Raj Films. How did it happen that they coped with such a heavy project for the new Vijay Krishna Acharya, who has no real sense to film the action? He tried to imitate Sanjay Gadhvi’s ways of becoming like Dhoom, but in the end he suffered. The action scene is more like comics or cartoons designed to exhaust the audience. <br /> <br /> History also loses its meaning and essence in order to gently conquer the hearts of viewers. In most scenes, Anil Kapoor reminds me of the southern Tamil star Rajnikant in body languages ​​and worldly expressions. I am not a fan of Saif, nor Akshay, but Karina’s reward should have finally come to Saif, not Akshay. From the very beginning, I expected this, but in the end he was not happy with the true climax. Saif stands behind the whole adventure, and Akshay joins him. In any film, the final must be judged on all the characters in the whole story, and the reward or, say, the reward must be given to someone who is trustworthy. And Tashan loses in this way, and suddenly could not become a hit. <br /> <br /> Akshay has nothing new to show his talent as a comedian, but he still recalls his previous films. He should seriously create a new image for his fans, which will impress them again and again. Between Sayf, there was a great job in the race, and now he is back in his cheerful nature thanks to this film. But he fully developed himself in the field of acting. And last but not least, about Karina. She looks very hot with a bikini dress that some people complain about when she got too thin. But I myself do not think so, instead she became slim. Yes slender !!! for a woman, attracting big people (or, say, men) is a good factor. Next to them it is nice that the son of Saif Ibrahim appears at the beginning and the last as a young Saif. I hope that now he too will be inclined to become an actor in his career. <br /> <br /> Those who like this Tashan are either mentally immature, either still want to return to childhood, or they say they want to be taken to a shelter. Thanks to debutant director Vijay Krishna Acharya who didn’t cope with the project proposed by Yash Raj Films. In the future, he should experiment and study the script for at least 5 years before proceeding with practical instructions. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I don’t like to rate good stars in this type of unwanted movie.
