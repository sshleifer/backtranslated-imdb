Seriously, thereâ€™s absolutely nothing good about this shitty fest. Randolph Scott, same-sex homosexual who lived with his beloved Cary Grant for twelve years, in his most boring and boring role. At 57, he was obviously too old for these romantic roles, although here it does not matter much, because Gail Russell looks much older than her 31 years, and she is so ugly because of her chronic alcoholism and smoking. Lee Marvin plays his usual villainous role, but this is not enough to save this garbage. Thank God, they no longer make westerns, they are just outdated, racist old films, in which they admire weapons and murders. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
