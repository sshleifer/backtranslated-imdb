It seems that this is the only film that John Saxon ever made, and that he had the common sense to stop after that and stay in front of the camera. This film is a dog, from beginning to end, and it is boring and wooden, and nothing special will go for it. The hero of the Vietnam War gets a job for the mafia boss, becomes too friendly with his wife, and then the mafia boss himself kills him, and the hero of the war is framed and sent to prison, in particular, to death row. Now this particular prison is experimenting with prisoners and testing some formulas that will turn people into a perfect killing machine (zombies). Of course, everything goes wrong, and then all those infected people go to prison, some of whom turn into zombies, and the rest, who suddenly just donâ€™t want to be there anymore. It just goes on and on and nothing special to show or say to myself, and I stopped it to the end, which seemed to come several times, but no, obviously, he was only going to take off on another and equally boring path. If you look until the end, they themselves can become zombies, so do not risk. 2 out of 10.
