Start with a good one: several times Swayze speaks Zulu with friends or this language is heard among the tribes. This is a big plus, as usually viewers in the US and the UK think that all people on this planet speak English (just in case if you are one of them: no, they don’t). <br /> <br /> But the acting game “tenenkrommend,” as we say in the Netherlands (it makes your toes curl - and not very well) I like Swayze, but this is terrible. The muscles in his jaws are doing overtime, and he frowns the whole movie - someone must have told him that it looks terrible. No Patrick: it looks stupid and compensates for the lack of character. Alison Doody (Elizabeth) chose a style of play that does not match the style of her colleagues. Her game is so relaxed that this film could be filmed these days. And it is not. Your dress was the key, Alison. <br /> <br /> The best acting game came from people from the African continent and sided with Onylo in the role of Umbops, which I liked the most. Clear, warm and characteristic, his performance is a joy to observe. <br /> <br /> General Information: on a rainy day entertains. A pity. It could be better. Remove the director.
