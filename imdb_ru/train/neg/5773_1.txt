Another sophisticated effort by the most underrated American director. His knowledge of racism is amazing and impresses me on several levels. The accusations that Lee is in fact just a cunning little racist, a poisonous dwarf who opportunistically uses the Hollywood system “Positive actions” to create low-quality films, is a complete minority, just the right propaganda. The very idea that Lee will resort to the misuse of America’s current climate of political correctness to produce anti-white films filled with hate is simply FALSE and maliciously. <br /> <br /> Some of Lee's detractors have even gone as far as GOTB can be supposed to glorify African Americans by suppressing other races: obviously, another FALSE is spread by people AGAINST peaceful coexistence between different races in America and elsewhere . <br /> <br /> My favorite scene in the film is a long dialogue between the rich and the republicans on the bus. The opinions presented by this person are simply WRONG - all in all directions. 100% not true. He is ABSENT, as opposed to brilliantly informed guys, who are completely CONSTANTLY throwing him out of the bus. <br /> <br /> The TERRIFICs and the INTELLECTUAL screenplay create a viewing experience that REALLY competed with any political films shot since then. <br /> <br /> I also want to point out the incessant lie that only 80,000 people took part in the Millions March! <br /> <br /> (And now all you have to do is take the antonyms of all words written in capital letters ...) <br /> <br /> What message does Lee send here? If someone disagrees with your political views, you simply use violence and throw him out of the bus. I thought the movie said “get on the bus” ...? <br /> <br /> Obviously, Mr. Lee, after all, is due to segregation on the bus, that is, no different from the crazy people who were before him in the KKK: the bus is only for blacks who agree with the Democratic Party . So much for the “liberation of slaves” ... <br /> <br /> End credits: “This film was fully funded by black people.” It is distributed and sold by a large Hollywood studio, run by Jews and whites, whom Farrakhan despises ...
