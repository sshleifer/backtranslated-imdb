Do not be deceived by all such big names as Burt Reynolds, James Woods and Ann Archer. They are simply renowned extras. Their scenes were probably filmed in one day or so. Whatever their motives for participating in this film, if you have an actor like James Woods, you'd better use it. For me, this is a sign of bad direction through and through. The plot itself is not so bad. And the play of most of the actors was above average. However, Cuba Gooding Jr. was terrible. He was so incredible that I almost laughed at his dramatic scenes. And since it was a serious film, it cannot be a good one. The scenes were not bad, but they lacked this special blow to make it more exciting. Again the best direction was needed. In addition, the storyboard was wrong for such a film. The main character took almost half an hour to get into action. For an action movie just 90 minutes, which is too slow. The only saving factor is Angie Harmon. She does her best to make it all work. It is a pity that the director left her alone. Yes, this film could be much better with a great director. Andy Cheng is too inexperienced as a director to handle this. And for the action / stunt coordinator of his caliber, you expect at least more exciting fighting scenes. Do not waste your time on this. Avoid!
