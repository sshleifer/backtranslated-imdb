I wanted to read other comments before leaving my review, and most definitely rules: this film is terrible! From action to unrealistic animation to countless mistakes. I actually hoped that the flaps would have been enlarged by the imagination (you cannot move flaps without engines). Chassis cannot be lowered unless you have electricity. That tiny fan that walked was not enough to lower the chassis. The only thing that seemed rather strange to me was that when they landed, the rear wheels touched and then a nose broke, which caused the plane to hang with both rear tires. How did the captain apply the left and right brakes to tires that did not touch the ground? Did they forget spoilers? Talk to the director: find out * everything * that you can about planes before trying to make a film about an airplane. Sorry for the technical rant, but I give this film 1/10.
