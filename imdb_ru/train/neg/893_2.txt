When I bought this DVD, I thought: â€œIt seems to be a good light comedy about love and relationships, built according to Portuguese standards. I was totally WRONG! What a disappointing movie! First, it is not a comedy; This is a cheap drama that can be so melodramatic that it is even worse than in many Portuguese TV shows! Secondly, the plot is so boring and leads to nothing ?? Does it have no structure, does it just flow like the wind in one direction or another? Production is also bad! Sound mixing is terrible because sometimes voices are muted. Did it make me recall some old Portuguese films from the 80s ?? The game was supposed to be better too ?? To summarize, you can't say that Portuguese cinema will not improve with movies like this one! In fact, it was one of the worst Portuguese films I have seen in recent years! Bad argument, bad game, bad production ?? I did not have high hopes for this film, but it was much worse than I ever imagined! Just forget about it!
