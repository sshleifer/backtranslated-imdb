I have to preface this by saying that I am a fan of Dolph Lundgren. The man turns out to be one of the funniest combat clich√©s you can imagine, and detention is probably my personal favorite. * Spoiler *, although there is no such thing as a Dolph spoiler, since the scenarios are so absurd from the very beginning: a chase scene with a disabled child carrying a gun and a Harley guy with a gun through a high school corridor and the child will win? Good game, Oscar goes into Delay. Dolph, if you read this, thanks for the laugh, old friend. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: a terrific movie, guaranteed laughter. I recommend inviting some friends for this and forcing them to sit through it. Fun.
