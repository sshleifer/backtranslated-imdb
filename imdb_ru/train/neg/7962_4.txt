Sequels have a nasty habit of disappointing, and the best credit I can give is that they support this old tradition. These three stories are not as good as in the original Creepshow. <br /> <br /> Of course, the best of the trio is a wooden idol that comes to life to take revenge on the bandits who killed its owners. The second story about the lake monster, which seems to be nothing more than a lot of floating biases, makes you wonder how someone might be afraid of it. The third story includes the episodic role of Stephen King in the role of a truck driver, but apart from that it is a rather memorable story about a victim of a traffic accident that returns from the dead for a man who knocked him down. <br /> Look instead for the original Creepshow, or if you have already done so, be happy with it.
