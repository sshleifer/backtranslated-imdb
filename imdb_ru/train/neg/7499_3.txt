John Leguisemo, a wonderful comic actor, is a New York Hispanic who can penetrate many characters, both male and female, to show the strange weaknesses of an ethnic group trying to cope with a foreign culture. However, he is not Italian. He does not look, does not think, and does not behave in Italian ... Especially Sicilians or Calabrians, groups of immigrants who live in Bensonhurst or Beyridge Brooklyn. Each scene in which he interacts with his "Gumbas", sounds fake, as if he was wandering around the student production of "West Side Story", while the other guys were shooting the low "Streets". This is only one problem with this ill-conceived, mean act. Spike blew this big time. By the way, CBGBOMFUG means “Country, bluegrass, blues and other music for uplifting gourmets [or, perhaps, gourmets]” Ask Hilli Crystal who founded the club. <br /> <br />
