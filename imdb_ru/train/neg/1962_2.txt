The only scary thing about this film is the thought that the one who made it can make a sequel. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning to the end, the Tooth Fairy was simply terrible. It was like a poorly-played children's film that got confused with the melting of the witches "The Wizard of Oz" and the happy kids, ending in combination with the bad effects of blood and curses. <br /> <br /> Half of the actors seem completely unnecessary, except that itâ€™s convenient to be killed in some way. The sister of two brothers, reader of the aura Cherise and Mrs. MacDonald, does not make any sense in the film - they could include them in the main plot for some interesting side stories, but apparently could not be concerned. People who watch the movie know that the characters are present at some bloody death scene, but come on, at least try and they have a little plot for them. In general, the story is weak because of the unpredictable behavior of the characters, because of which you want the witch to eat them all. <br /> <br /> Add a weak plot and a weak one playing together (children, in particular, wooden ones), and the film ends in complete failure. If only MST3K could try this ...
