First, it is a very outdated film, not focused on the exposure of the left political revolution. Honestly, when someone says that the only way to be truly revolutionary is to stop being intellectual (which in itself is completely meaningless, because the answer was received by an intellectual), this leads me to despair; as if we all have to go back to being monkeys in the name of equality — this is simply ridiculous. Our intellectuality is only one of many human qualities, but this does not mean that we should not learn as much as possible. But, undoubtedly, this non-educational message is connected with the use of rock music by Godard; from here The Rolling Stones. <br /> <br /> The song “Empathy for the Devil”, the creation of which we observe and from which the film takes its name, is really nothing special. The chord sequence, which is not particularly original, was used for a much better effect in “Thank You” by Led Zeppelin (Led Zeppelin II). In addition, “sir” Mick Jagger states in his usually vague manner (rather like Bob Dylan) - notice how the first melodic phrase is inconceivably repeated again to form a verse. <br /> <br /> In addition to the fact that the Black Panthers depicted in this film do not seem to know that they are fighting for the most interesting scenes connected with the equation of fascism with pornography; a message that actually undermines the sexual “liberation” of the 1960s and of today (indeed, a message that would believe in the behavior of the Rolling Stones at the time the movie was made). <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, the DVD was released for free from The Sunday Times! For a truly profound historical presentation of leftist sympathies, listen to Luigi Nono’s masterpiece, “Al Gran Sole carico'd'amore”.
