Originally broadcast as ABC Movie of the Week. This applies to two young innocent female students who are sent to a prison camp in a small southern town. They are not allowed to call, and no one knows that they are there. This is followed by rape, torture, beatings, humiliation and humiliation, which lead to a very disturbing conclusion. <br /> <br /> The television version was (for its time) grim. No nudity and beatings were quite tame, but the general feeling of untidiness was exhausted. The unappreciated version is even worse - naked nudity, extreme violence, and in one particularly disgusting sequence we see a crying female prisoner, forced to undress, while the lesbian guard "uses" it. YUCK! There is nothing wrong with running movies, but this one just goes beyond the limits. You get the feeling that the filmmakers love it when these poor women are tortured and humiliated â€” it all blows your face, as if you should enjoy it. Unreasonably sad ending doesn't help. <br /> <br /> I give him 3, because the game is good - but in fact the film becomes harder to watch. Sick, dirty movie. Not recommended.
