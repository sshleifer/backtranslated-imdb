"The Mistress of the craft" Celeste works as an agent for the London office of Interpol Bureau 17, which specializes in (I think) occult criminals. She has an Eye of Fate, good in her hands, dangerous if anyone else gets it. <br /> <br /> Bureau 17 caught the satanist from California, Hyde (no relation to Dr. Jekyll). Detective Lucy Lutz from the Los Angeles police is flying to England to return him to the United States. Lutz is a link to earlier films about Witchcraft that Stephanie Beaton played before in Witchcraft 9. In the 7th part of Lutz another woman played; at 6 lutz was a man! <br /> <br /> Lutz's role at 9 was not very big, but she is one of the main stars in this. Although she left her high heels and short skirts, she still has blatant tops in it. And this time she has nude and sex scenes. Beaton is quite attractive in this role. <br /> <br /> As usual, there are a lot of sex scenes. The anonymous club fan has a fatal threesome with two vampires, the satanist and the main vampire don it with some perversion, Lutz finds an English friend, and Celeste and her boyfriend make love. <br /> <br /> Witchcraft's main recurring character, Will Spanner, does not appear in this, although Lutz mentions him to Bureau agent 17 Dickson in a vampire conversation. She also calls her partner, Detective Garner (parts 6, 7 and 9), although we do not hear his end of the conversation. <br /> <br /> Hyde jumped out of prison by a group of vampires led by Raven for the Walpurgis ritual relating to a god named Morsheba (I think). Hyde delivers all his lines in a very flat manner, while Raven overdoes to a lesser extent. The battle scenes are awfully set. <br /> <br /> The sound in the film was poorly recorded and poorly edited. In addition, some dialogs are lost with loud music or sirens. Cinematography is also not great. Making a film and making it in the UK was something of a novelty, at least for this series. <br /> <br /> Wendy Cooper is very good, like Celeste; attractive, of course, but more importantly, she is easily the best actor in the film (despite the bad battle scenes). I am very surprised that her filmography is so small. If Sorcery XIV is ever found, and I would argue that they will, they should return her, even if it means that she will fly to California! <br /> <br /> Sorcery X is available separately or on DVD. Hotter Than Hell collection along with Witchcraft XI and two unrelated movies.
