I would like to write about the story, but it was not. I would like to quote a couple of tough dialogues from the film, but “hinglish” is funny for only 5 minutes, after which it is a bust. I would like to faint due to the uncertainty of speculation, but it was as predictable as ... uh, Yasha Raj (?). I would like to talk about action, but I don’t really like cartoons. <br /> <br /> * sigh * <br /> <br /> In general, this film is perfect for: 1. people trying to commit suicide - I promise that it will push you over the edge 2. sadomasochists - this film is much more effective than the barbed wire that Silas wore in the Da Vinci code. 3. People exploring alternative ways to spread terrorism - I swear, the audience coming out of the room seemed to be in the mood to kill someone 4. Pirates of the film: more power for them. If any films deserve that viewers do not spend money on watching - that's all. 5. Mollusks, most species of plankton and green algae - because almost all other living things require an IQ of slightly higher than what the film offers. The idea: the director of the film is obviously his own kind. (And I hope that he is one of a kind ... one is enough). <br /> <br /> What could have made this film better: 1. History 2. Choreographer 3. A Scriptwriter 4. Stunt coordinator 5. History (I already said that?) 6. The director is preferably the one who no mental problems (although even someone who has a call could do better) 7. Anil Kapoor = Bubonic Plague - Avoid at all costs 8. A statutory warning - “Watching movies Yash Raj harm your mental health”? <br /> <br /> What I liked about the film: 1. Karina Kapoor - For obvious reasons 2 English subtitles - “Measure Dil Ho Gaya” becomes - “My heart is in emptiness”, “Chalia Chalia Chalia” turns into “I flirting, I'm a lover, I'm a vagabond ”... priceless. <Br /> <br /> In short, Tashan is for me, as opposed to the Rubric cube - the cube should increase the player's IQ, Tashan promises to lower his IQ, and this ... in just 2.5 hours! Woot! <br /> <br /> * sigh * * But it's just me. I could be wrong. You were warned anyway.
