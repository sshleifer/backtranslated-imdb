And how many actors can he replace with his neurotic, obsessive Uber-New York persona? In this film, Woody plays Will Ferrell in what is, fortunately, a less direct personification than what Kenneth Branagh did in Celebrity. Now this is an annoyingly repetitive story: an impolite neurotic man with his wife or girlfriend falls madly in love with the queen of shiks, on whom he projects all sorts of perfection. Everyone lives in beautiful giant apartments in magnificent areas of Manhattan, everyone constantly patronizes expensive, exclusive restaurants where all characters tell fascinating jokes and discuss secret philosophy, a trip to Hamptons always happens, during which the protagonist Nebishi crumbles about sand physical tension and possible impact of diseases, and then, of course, said that the main character feels guilty because of his passion for the queen Shiks, but pursues her in any case, sometimes succeeds Yes, sometimes unsuccessfully, etc. This is a weary formula and proof that Allen is not really a great film artist. He just looks like a dirty old man with a libido and the emotions of a 20-year-old who intends to tell the same boring old stories again and again.
