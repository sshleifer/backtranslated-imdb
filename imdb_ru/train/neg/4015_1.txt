a friend gave it to me, saying that it was another classic like "Debbie makes Dallas". Nowhere close. I think my main complaint is about the most unattractive leading role in the porn industry ever. Even worse is that it is on the screen almost all the time. But I read somewhere that in those days porn was to have some kind of "artistic" meaning. I could not find it though. Look only if you are interested in the history of porn in the mainstream, or can appreciate the art in porn movies. I know not. But the film's director is a talented person. He even tried to get Simon and Garfunkel to give him permission to use his songs. Of course, they are rejected.
