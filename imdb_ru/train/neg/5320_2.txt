This is a dry and fruitless filming of one of the most interesting events of the Second World War and the history of hostilities behind the front line. A bad dramatic composition is the worst in this film, since the story of the murder of Hitler may seem like a rather dramatic event. There is no development of character at all, and the idea that Tom Cruise suggests playing a high-ranking commander who questions his deepest inner thoughts about patriotism and betrayal is completely insane. I believe that Mr. Bean will play better. Generally speaking, the film largely looks like a cheap copy of a good German television film “Stauffenberg” of 2004, but cannot approach this film with respect to any aspect of the film at all. Nevertheless, the film, obviously, gets its financial goal with a popcorn audience that cherishes Hollywood mood swings and small artistic values.
