1 of 10. This is a film in which you can not believe that you have wasted 2 hours of your life, seeing the role of the role. Honestly, I think I could make a better movie about vampires ... and I don't know anything. The only thing that doesn't just suck (harder than a vampire) is Jason Scott Lee ... his character, at least a little cool, has some mystery and kicks ass
