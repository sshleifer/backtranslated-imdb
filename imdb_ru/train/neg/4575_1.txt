I admit that at the moment I am only a college student, while English is. At the time when I watched this film, I was a high school student - I want to say a junior year, but perhaps he was the oldest, it is difficult to remember. My experience with quantum physics is largely related to my course in physics with honors, my interest in quantum mechanics, which prompted me to read this subject in a number of books on the theoretical aspects of the field, as well as in any article I can find in Discover for yourself and the like. I am by no means a Ph.D. <br /> <br /> Still ... <br /> <br /> This movie is just awful. It is designed to appeal to the scientific mind of the average New Age guru, who desperately wants to believe how special everyone is. My mother is such a person, and since she watched this movie, she tried to get all her friends to watch it and bought a copy of the movie. I tried to point out various shortcomings and problems that I saw with logic and film science - and there are many of them - and she rejected my demands, because â€œoh, so a high school student knows more than all those who have a doctorate ". In this case, apparently, so. <br /> <br /> Leaving aside the fact that obtaining a doctoral degree does not necessarily require that a person be correct or, in fact, intelligent. Leaving aside the fact that my basic understanding of physics is enough to debunk half of the film. Leaving this behind, the filmmakers completely manipulated their interviews with at least one of the participants to create the impression that he supported their beliefs, although in fact he completely opposes them. <br /> <br /> I could continue and but I think the intuitor did an excellent job of debunking the film, so feel free to read it if you want. <br /> <br /> http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/bleep.html
