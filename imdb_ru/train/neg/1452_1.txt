Germany from 1919 to 1933 looks like the capital of the Czech Republic after World War II. Sorry, this is the Czech capital, and 2003, how ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most horrible movie stories in the near past. Rem is head and shoulders taller than Adolf and looks so damn good, Goering looks like 40, when he is only 23, and the Fuhrer always looks like 56. And buildings, people, even buildings were young, sometimes. Especially in 1919 there were many houses in Germany, almost new ones (the First World War did not get to the German cities!). No crumbling plaster! Then Reichstag building. There have never been city canyons around this building, never. And it may seem like a miracle to you: in 1933, the fire crew of the Greater Berlin owns many cars with engines, some even with turntable ladders, but none with a hand pump. <br /> <br /> One last thing: what is this PLAYMOBIL lock in the final sequence? For me it was a kind of "Adventures of Adolf in Wonderland"
