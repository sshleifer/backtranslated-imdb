First of all, it is Gujarati Theater, then Bollywood. Both have their strengths and fans. Director Vipul Shah should look elsewhere instead of Gujarati theater when creating Bollywood. He first made Aankhen (adapted from a Gujarati play) - which had a unique plot, but could not stand like a Hindi film. Now he adapted another Gujarati play and called it Waqt - a race against time. As a result, emotions are alien. The plot development is not for Hindi films. For example, the role-playing game between father and son is best left in the Gujarati theater - do not show it in a Hindi film. Even the comedy track is best left on the Gujarati stage. All the performances are average - nothing to shout about - except for Shefali Chaya Shah, which is just fantastic.
