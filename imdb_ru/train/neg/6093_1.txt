It must be the worst movie I've ever seen. I bought a DVD and it didn’t work, well, the DVD worked fine, the film just didn’t work, in fact it’s so bad that I think none of the actors have worked since (or before judging by acting ). There is no real plot and horror. Production figures are rubbish even for a low-budget film, and some external scenes are hard to hear because of the wind on the microphone. <br /> <br /> In general, the film was so bad that the viewer could think that it was a film. turn into porn if they are better (which was an improvement) do not know. There are only two funny lines in the film, each of which revolves around a transvestite prostitute. (Although they hardly deserve to watch all 76 minutes) <br /> <br /> As for the DVD marketing, I feel completely deceived. I mean reading the back, I expected it to be bad: <br /> <br /> He chose his weapon. He chose his victims. He was picking his nose. He turned into a GIRL! <br /> <br /> But I thought it might be funny. In addition, in this case it is stated that it was re-processed in digital form, I would like to see it in advance, the imprint is so grainy that you can use it as sandpaper. The case also says that this is an absolutely disgusting film “WHAT WAY?”, A disgusting production, acting. <br /> <br /> This film remains desirable for the first five minutes (if you plan to buy it, I would say, buy "bad taste", this is a much better film, and it's funny, it also has Peter Jackson, director LOTR.) By the way, does anyone know anything about the actors (or director Patrick J. Matthews) and what they have done since then, please post here, as I would like to know, just to find out if there is the worst movie or someone in this movie has ever tried to learn how to play
