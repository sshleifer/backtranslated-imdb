I recently watched it again, and there is another version that is shorter than 1999. I have the feeling that this is the same movie, but I would like to know the difference. <br /> <br /> One of them is Japanese, and no short Pikachu is all I can think of. Otherwise, why vote for the same movie twice ?? <br /> <br /> Professor Ivy was pretty boring. She sounded as if she was almost asleep, completely expressionless with the few lines she had. <br /> <br /> It was nice enough, but there was nothing at all special. <br /> <br /> The collector (who has no plan to destroy the world after Lugia) and ordinary characters who try to stop him, because an attempt to capture Lugia leads to great destruction. <br /> <br /> The following Pok√©mon movies are a little better, deoxys (poke 7) is great, no. 8 almost here.
