Woody Allen, when at his best, has one of the sharpest pens around. He can make a keen observation and wrap him around a raisin like no other. However, when he is worse off, his films may smell like pretentiousness. Unfortunately, Melinda and Melinda has this smell from opening to closing. The script is one of his most intriguing ideas lately. Four friends sit in a restaurant, discussing whether the essence of life is comedy or drama. To help settle a dispute, one person connects the beginning of a story and asks two other men arguing (one comic playwright, another dramatic playwright) whether the story is a comedy or a tragedy. Then the two men continue the story, and the film reproduces the stories they weave. Now, when I first heard about this film, I realized that they tell the same story, the genre (comedy or drama) changes only on how you look at it. Now it would be interesting. However, stories have only one main element and several side elements. These are completely different stories with big plot differences. The drama is so rigidly written and pretentious that in fact it can only work as self-parody. If this made sense, then it did not succeed, because these elements prevented viewers from feeling any emotional investments in any of the characters. This comedy has moments of success, but they are still short and fleeting. Obviously, Will Farrell was supposed to be a replacement for Woody, but he could play this character much more believable without resorting to Woody's stuttering and ticks. Woody is the best in woody. When someone else tries, they do not play a character, they model a recognizable actor. Such things only distract the public from the plot. <br /> <br /> My favorite Woody Allen films make me leave the theater a little easier in spirit than I entered. This one made me wish that I could get my money back.
