<br /> <br /> I'm not sure who decides which category the film belongs to, but this movie is NOT a horror movie. As for the story, it was quite interesting, but rather slow. I was especially disappointed with the ending. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** <br /> <br /> Tell me why the hell did she run to her uncle’s house (?) At least without calling the detective or the police first turn? She knows exactly what is happening at that moment, plus she has videotape as evidence. Instead, she runs there and starts to go crazy and say: “I know everything, I have proof! You didn't expect proof, did you?! ”Then she wonders when her uncle gets up and starts walking toward her, as if he is going to harm her. Well yes! Of course, he is going to harm you, idiot, you just told him that you know everything and you have evidence to expose everything. What a dumb end.
