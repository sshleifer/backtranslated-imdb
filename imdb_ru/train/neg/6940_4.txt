When you have two high-rise buildings opposing each other, the least you can expect is an excellent partnership, and this is the case when we have 64-year-old Amitabh Bachchan, who performs the songs of the 34-year-old Tabu. Wait! In fact, this is all that is in the title of the plot, so instead of “cheeni” it was the content of “Kum” in this “Adman” that turned the first work of the screenwriter-director R. Beamy. <br /> <br /> Trust two senior actors to destroy your home with their wise and bitterly sweet moments when love happened in this unconventional couple, and that’s all you will find in a slow but refreshing first half. Places of London captured during the rainy season are fascinating. By the end of the first half, the novel is completed and the mission is completed. Not much left to say. Therefore, in the second half, a strange opposition manifests itself in the image of the girl's father, since he goes to the satyagraha - this is really a test of patience. Equally strange how he gives up. As a result, the second half is dry, flat without energy. There is a story with a girl dying of cancer who has no particular effect. However, the film is recommended for its fresh approach and performances.
