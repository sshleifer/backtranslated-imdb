Lipstick is another setback in a glossy film. I'm trying to come up with one good thing that I can say about the film, and it's hard for me to think of something. I think the red dress that Margo Hemingway wore at the end of the film was the best part. The writing and script were not the worst I've ever come across, but it could have been much better. Lipstick was very pleasing to the eye. The sets were very glossy and nice to look at. All was good. I felt that the character of Ann Bancroft was the only real character in the entire film. It was sad to see Chris Sarandon spending his time on this film.
