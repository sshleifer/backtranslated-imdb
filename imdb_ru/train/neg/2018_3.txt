Don't get me wrong, this is a terrible, clichéd film, but it’s a joy for Olivia Hassi’s fans — perhaps the most intoxicating beauty that ever graced the silver screen. On one poster it was said that it was unpleasant to look at her - I wonder how his ideal woman looks like - Paris Hill-whore? The blockbuster must really establish a subgenre for this type of film, since the plot of “Deadly Attraction” has become a genre in itself. When will Blockbuster accept the Adult section? It will fit well between the dramatic and combat sections, right? This film revolves around Olivia Hussey, who spends a night of passion with the unstable yacht owner, who may have killed his ex-wife, who is remarkably similar to Mrs. Hussey. This prosperity continues to haunt Olivia and thus makes her life a real hell. I like Olivia Hussey, but I don’t feel sympathy for the characters in the films who cheat their spouses, so I really didn’t support Olivia to deal with this smelly live. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$ (There is a bit of violence in the film. Don Murray and Anthony John Denison get caught up in a fight when Denison says he won't stop seeing Olivia, Murray's wife, because she is too good bed.Olivia also copes. shooter and can squeeze out of the round - I'll let you see). <br /> <br /> Nudity: $$ (Olivia is the queen of short nudity and stores a little here. She has a love scene with Anthony John Denison, and also has a scene in the shower - shot from a distance). <br /> <br /> STORY: $ (We have seen this story before - a hundred times, and often did much better. The culprit trying to understand why this film was unsuccessful is William Riad. The dialogue of the person is moronic and moronic. He has no ability to tell stories, and he cannot believe it. Real human reactions to the plot. These people from the higher strata of society speak like high school kids - with the habit of sleeping in English classes. I put Riead on the list "Never to be seen again" . <br /> <br /> ACTION: $$$ (The action was not "phoned", as insiders say, but it was difficult.) Much according to Riad’s youthful scenario. Olivia Hussey resorts to calling Anthony John Denison “strange” and “crazy” on his face when he begins to stalk her. Hassi, who is still beautiful, shows the best performance here, but Denison was equal to the task of portraying a crazy, crazy stalker. Don Murray was mostly just there - his character was not revealed, and Edward Asner, a terrific actor who is given something with content, is poorly used in this film ).
