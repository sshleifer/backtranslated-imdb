“Sleeping with the enemy” is a predictable thriller “I've been there before,” which never seems to be inspired, no matter how desperately the actors and crew are shot. I cannot believe that a group of my friends persuaded me to see it in the cinema about sixteen years ago. <br /> <br /> The complete lack of originality in the script of Ronald Bass (based on the novel by Nancy Price) does not help, nor is Joseph Ruben’s not-so-crude guide or very average work by Julia Roberts. The supporting line-up, including Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson, is of little help. <br /> <br /> In fact, nothing special to say. Just skip it. <br /> <br /> Sunday April 14, 1991 - Hoyts Cinema Center, Melbourne
