Well, now I know that millions of Americans believe in the Rapture: that moment when all people born again in Christ will be raptured to meet with God, and the rest of humanity will remain on earth to perish in calamities and fire and heartbreaking psoriasis when the antichrist fights him against Jesus (in an uncharacteristic belligerent manner). And I know that books were bestsellers. In any case, among the believers. And I mean disrespect for all of this. <br /> <br /> But I have to say that they put this film in a bag and beat it with a Suck Stick. <br /> <br /> I am sure the books are much better. Really. <br /> <br /> The plot does not need to be repeated. If you watched this movie, most likely you read the book. I may be one of the few people on earth who actually watched this just because I was feeling bad and I was not disappointed. Especially not by Kirk Cameron, the creepy little creming "Growing Pains" who came of age on this show, found Christ and decided that the SHOW should reflect his Christian values. Well, Kirk, your career went to the dogs, but now you can be happy that you are so bad at spreading the word of God in films that they don’t even go to theatrical shows. Well, that’s not quite right: I think it was the only film ever made on DVD FIRST, with a free movie voucher when it was briefly released in theaters! I still have a voucher! How many people do you think have appeared? I do not know about you, but it never came to my city. Of course, I live in New York, where we, godless liberals, sit and tear out pages from the Bible and use them to roll shoals. So let's go. In fact, I bet that out of three million people on the island of Manhattan, no one will be delighted. <br /> <br /> Check out the DVDs for more details behind the scenes. of these films. , .CAST and CREW should have the same religious thinking. They do not come straight in and say it, but listen attentively to what the directors say. This is similar to how a group of people-pods got together to make a film about pods. How scary is it? Honestly, this stuff just preaches to the converted, isn't it? Can you imagine someone who does not subscribe to this whole apocalypse, watching this, slapping yourself on the forehead and saying: “HOLY GUVERS DAM! I better escape PRONTO! ”Anyway, I got hooked. I have to see the rest of these Christian films about the fiasco, especially the film with Gary Buzie, which I think is called “TRIBULATION”. At least Bucy has a reason to take part .... he smashed his head against the asphalt when he broke his motorcycle. <br /> <br /> Oh. <br /> <br /> Oh, and one more thing. What with all the shots of poor, innocent dogs, whimpering, their leashes uselessly pulled on the ground, because their masters were called to paradise? What's up with that? Should we treat dogs badly, and if we do, what should we make of God? Doesn't it annoy people that there is no place in heaven for man’s best friend? Fu <br /> <br /> This is another reason why I am agnostic. Good night and good luck.
