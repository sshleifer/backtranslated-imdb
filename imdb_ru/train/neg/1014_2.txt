Timberlake's performance almost made the screen attack. It was not so bad, I just think that the role of reporters was wrong for him. <br /> <br /> L.L. Cool, Jay played the typical role of a rapper, the coolest, coolest guy of them all. I do not think that a smile broke out in the whole film, even when he was offered to his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman pretty much shot the entire movie. He had funny scenes that are the climax of the film. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey was not good or bad, he was just "there." <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a boring movie. bad plot. many bad actions or wrong roles for actors.
