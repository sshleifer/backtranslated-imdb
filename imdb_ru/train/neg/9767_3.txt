I think that if you like things of the sixties, like me, you have to spend about 80 minutes of your life watching this barely noticeable shipwreck by rail. The salutary graces of this oddity include a surprisingly good social commentary about the values ​​of the sixties, along with a number of relatively well-known actors caught in the early (and embarrassing) shots. It’s as if the producers of Laugh-In sat down and decided to write a full-length film covering all the important moments (and more) of the problems between the flower girls and the establishment, and then hand it over to a couple of hippies and gave them about 10,000 dollars on completion This is hardly a classic, but in its own way it reflects how strange that time was: stupidity, excessive idealism and perseverance of the establishment. Obviously not for everyone.
