This is a horrible movie, a horrible script, bad leadership and a meaningless ending. In addition, bad performances, with the exception of Clancy Brown, who is criminally undervalued, and Michael Pollard. Watching this movie was purgatory - you do it to unload bad enough movie kits to actually see the good in the future. <br /> <br /> The film presents father and son, who look as if they could not all be connected. Part of the male role is not well written, and in this role it seems charismatic. You can see the plot points per mile. The actions of the lead woman and her brother, the policeman, also do not make sense. Thus, a major action on her part at the end of the film does not make sense in the script.
