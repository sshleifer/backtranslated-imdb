How can Barry Levinson gather talented comedians Ben Stiller and Jack Black, the magnificent Rachel Weiss, old professional Christopher Walken, and still deliver such a bleak disgust? <br /> <br /> Stiller and Black remain friends until the last time they invented the spray so that the dog's mess would disappear and become a consuming multimillionaire. <br /> <br /> The room is thin, but strong enough in the right hands to become a springboard for some big bitch between two stars, but all interested parties replay each hand, every chance. <br /> <br /> Stiller and Black are simply not ridiculous for too long, Weiss looks sensational, as always, but criminally undervalued and, with the exception of Waken, as a cruel fly that convinces Stillerâ€™s character to take revenge, this is a cruel delusion to the end of this intense farce.
