"What happens when you give a homeless person $ 100,000?" As if by asking this question, they are somehow morally exempt from what ultimately happens. The creators of "Reversal of Fortune" are trying to get their voyeuristic giggles by disguising their tricks as a kind of responsible social experiment. <br /> <br /> They take Ted, a homeless person in Pasadena, and give him $ 100,000 to see if he changes his life. Then, with only the most superficial guidance and advice, they allowed him to go on his merry way. <br /> <br /> What are they trying to say? "Money can not buy you happiness?" "Homeless are homeless because they deserve it?" Or how about: “Lift a person — it's more fun to watch him fall from a great height.” They took a man who has nothing to lose, gave him something to lose, and then watched him throw it all down the drain. Is it supposed to be entertainment? They dress this sow with dark music and impressive camera shots, but in the end she has all the moral superiority of the accident video - only this time they designed the accident and asked: “What happens when you stop? sign?"
