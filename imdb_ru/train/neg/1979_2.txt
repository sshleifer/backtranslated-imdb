Hmm, hip-hop music of the era of Western. Modern phrases such as “cool” and too many others to track. "Sistah in the house"! French well-groomed nails on hard girls. Microphone packages Clearly visible on the back of Le'l Kim. I just can not continue the list of mistakes made by the director and editors. <br /> <br /> The game is not as bad as I have ever seen. Women coped with the bad script quite well. <br /> <br /> It was strange to hear Louis Mandilor speaking with a native accent. <br /> <br /> The girls are beautiful. The costumes are fabulous, albeit completely unfaithful. I just can't believe that they failed in what could be a great story. I would be offended by believing that this film was loaded with such attributes that it would play well in the city center. <br /> <br />
