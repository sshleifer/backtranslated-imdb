It was one of the worst films I've ever seen. Branau seemed so hard to remember his accent that he could not express his words. The plot is definitely not worthy of the name of John Grisham. Not surprisingly, it was never published as a book or released in theaters. I have not even watched it all. I decided that I didn’t care who did it, and then I realized that I don’t need to worry about my own block!
