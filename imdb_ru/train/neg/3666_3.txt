This is one very confusing movie. The film is very difficult to follow, and the plot simply does not make any sense. Wolf Rage was made in Spain, and I think that when any film is duplicated from one language to another, it is not translated exactly as it was intended. Perhaps this is part of the problem, but I doubt that this may explain all the problems with this film. Rewriting is pretty bad, and the voices do not correspond well to the characters. The scenes are changeable, there are a lot of strange and irrelevant characters who confuse the viewer only a little. What I really liked about this film is the look of the wolf itself and the scene where he attacks. Now, if they could put it all together and make some sense, they could have something. Do not waste your time on this.
