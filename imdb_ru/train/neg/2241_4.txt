I remember enjoying it a few years ago, but, returning to it again, I wonder why. I think it always looks good, and the girls feel pretty good, and men, rather, lower their heads. Why in many English sex films we have to have such inept men along with beautiful girls? Moreover, it starts quite predictably as a sex farce, similar in nature to the films “Confession”, but about a third of the way (while we start to enjoy the presence of the beautiful “I, me, Lai”), the film asks us to start shooting it . seriously. Not only that, the central rock club and hemp are very consistent and just look unnatural. In short, it is not so innocently stupid and not as reasonably serious as it seems. Richard O'Sullivan, perhaps as a central figure, could help, but I think this is one of his worst performances. Just standing for the ladies.
