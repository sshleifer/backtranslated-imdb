I consider this movie one of the worst in the TV series Nightmare. It was so boring that I could not remember anything 20 minutes after the end of the film, I was even tired of writing a review of it. <br /> <br /> Okay, No. 4 was a joke, and Freddie was a joker. Number 5 tried to return to the roots of the series. It was darker and more atmospheric than the Nightmare 4, which is good in principle. They tried to make a horror movie instead of a comedy. Unfortunately, they forgot to add suspense and scare. Because of this, Nightmare 5: The Dream Child is not funny and not scary. In fact, we get a boring movie with the usual bad actors (perhaps with the exception of Lisa Wilcox). <br /> <br /> The plot (Freddie kills Liza's friends using dreams of Liza's unborn baby) has a good foundation, but that is simply not enough for 90 minutes of the film. Sometimes the story gets very confusing (perhaps because it doesn't exist), and you can't stop wondering what the filmmakers were striving for. There should have been more holes in the script than in Swiss Cheese, and therefore the film itself was very cheesy (let me say that I don’t like cheese, even if I’m from Switzerland). Even the special effects were not as good as, for example, in part 4. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about renting / buying this movie, if not for the sake of completeness, this is quite a mess. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (getting used to it, # 6 is also dirty ...)
