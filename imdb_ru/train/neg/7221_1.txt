.... THE REASON IS THE COVER! The film that makes you want to go and hit the director and say "WHY?". Awful camera work ... count how many times the camera tries to remain stable on one person and cannot. The dialogue is ridiculous. The game is comical. Looks like they captured a ghost town in the west to see if they could make a film for the smallest amount possible. I bet that for $ 10 they used home video cameras. Either that, or most of the operators were drunk. Indeed, trailers are more interesting than the movie. If you ever want to have the “Worst Movie Party,” bring this one. Want more fun ... look at the wall.
