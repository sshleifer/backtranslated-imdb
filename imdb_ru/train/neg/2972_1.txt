My teacher recorded it on tape and showed us in the child care department to demonstrate how teenage pregnancy affects people. It only showed how teenage pregnancy affects child training, not quite properly trained in how sex works, and a whimpering, unloved girl who throws fruit when she is angry and cannot say that she was not with that man, even he wore a sign stating that he was. I would not be surprised if the father of the child has about eight girlfriends in the first edition of the script. Stacy's mother (child carrier) is a riot. She does not notice the fact that her daughter is already four years old, and she doesn’t seem to be shaken when people watch her through the window of her dining room. The best friend of Bobby (the father) is named Dewey, and he clearly falls apart from the character of Sean Penn in the movie “Fast Times at Ridgemont High.” This film is terrible simply because none of the characters is believable. Thank God, this is done only for television, limiting the chances of viewers to watch it.
