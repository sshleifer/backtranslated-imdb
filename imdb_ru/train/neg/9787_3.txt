... but the problem with this production is that it is very far from a good musical. <br /> <br /> Of course, one cannot always expect such witty masters as Sondheim, Bernstein or Porter; yet the music of this piece makes even Andrew Lloyd Webber look witty. It is deadly boring and not inventive (with one or two exceptions), and right after I watched it, I could not recall a single significant melody â€” quite tragic when someone recognized a whole hundred people from three hearings. <br /> <br /> This is also strange not theatrical. This happens on an incredibly large stage (you really need to feel sorry for those people in the front rows who broke their necks to see that something is happening 50 meters to the right or 100 meters to the left), and does absolutely nothing about it. When there should be one person singing on stage, this is exactly what you get, and the rest of the huge scene is empty. As a novice theater director, it was almost painful to watch. <br /> <br /> The fact remains: Cole Porter seems to have captured French culture in his works better than these non-talents can even come close. And I am puzzled by the popularity of this legendary musical.
