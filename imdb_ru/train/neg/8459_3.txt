Some very interesting camera work and a story with great potential. But it never comes across as anything more than a student’s thesis at a film school. <br /> <br /> There are two main reasons for this. Firstly, there is not a single pleasant character, not even a villain, whom we could admire for his / her arrogance. Secondly, all actions are terrible - even from veteran Willem Daphoe. There are so many hams, you feel like you are on a picnic - but this is one of those savory picnics for company employees where you drink too much cheap beer and hangovers before you even stop drinking. Then you eat the underrated hot dog and tear. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm a little rude to a young director who can still go to different places - as I said before, the camera work is pretty good. <br /> But I feel betrayed - the ad of this film says that we will see “Modern Western”, and there are photos on the DVD packaging that you can assume too - but in fact no one was associated with the film. It seems that in the film they know that this is the film that they have to do. <br /> <br /> This treachery is what hurts; but even without that, the fact remains that we don’t like these characters, we feel embarrassed for the actors, the story is hopelessly confused, and ultimately we just don’t care. <br /> <br /> I took it out of the DVD player about halfway through. but a rental shop would not give me back my money. <br /> <br /> Now it really hurts.
