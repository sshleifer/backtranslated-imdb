This is a high-class cheese food from Kung Fu movies. Bruce "wannabe" Lee plays Bruce Lee ... I think. Of course, let's show Bruce's quick clips and make close-ups of his eyes, and if you look at right angles at a certain time of the day during the winter solstice, it will be like Bruce. You will be delighted to laugh at the fact that the glueing of the film is not very good, but some cool remote scenes from “War with the Dragon” are added to the mix. According to the film, Bruce Lee was killed by a dart when he was hanging by helicopter. Of course, they think that this could justify Bruce Lee for trying to be Bruce, although his character must be Bruce's brother (who for some reason still repeats the gestures and Bruce's fighting style is very BAD). See, Bruce is alone with a cowardly lion. You see, the props department stopped KB. Bruce also doesn’t find anything wrong with beating a cripple cruelly. At the end, the director decided to “let's remember” the scene shown 3 minutes ago !! They must have thought that only unicellular organisms with attention deficit disorder could fully understand this film. <br /> <br />
