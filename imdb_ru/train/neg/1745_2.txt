The first half hour of the film took place at a steady pace and represented the characters. however, all of a sudden everything happened too quickly, which caused Akshey Kumar to meet three girls, very loudly because of the actions of Akshi and John Abraham. Neha Dupia was the highlight of the film, Paresh Rawal succeeded, but not as good as his performance in Gera Fery. In general, this film was the biggest disappointment, the film does not pay tribute to its trailer. save your money and donâ€™t watch this movie, watch Gera Pheri and Hungamu again! <br /> <br /> To summarize, you can say: a cheap stage performance and the appearance of a film without a plot or creature, the plot was extremely feel good music from Pritham, the person who bought us Dhoom! Keep it up! the film was all in the same room, the novices (female cast) were fine, as it was their first film, but famous actors such as Akshey and John completely disappointed a well-known director such as Priyadarshan who shoots his worst film in whole story!
