This Italian sex-horror film begins very much like a soft core porn film and turns into a mystery that has several many loose ends to be good, and the fact that it's pretty boring just makes this film quite unwatchable for my taste, The only thing that is really worth seeing is the tits scattered throughout the movie. This story has a boyfriend who, at the beginning of the film, lures the girls into his castle, where he takes them to his dungeon, goes berserk and seems to kill them. They show nudity, but they never show murder at this moment in the film. Then the guy finds a pretty redhead at the party and begins to deal with her and marry her. He has something of redheads, as you can see, since his beloved ex-wife Evelyn was also such, she also died in circumstances that must not have been the work of the audience. After many conversational scenes, killings involving snakes, foxes and the like begin to occur. At this stage, it is easy enough to find out who is responsible for the killings and what the motive is, then you have a meaningless end, where everything is not so good. This film simply did not work for me, it left me with many questions, and the last third of the film simply did not have the boobs of the first two thirds of the film. Explaining Evelyn's death would have helped the film as well as some end, where Evelyn really rose from the grave. Yes, the title is not entirely misleading, since she really left the grave, but not by her own power. The mountain is for the most part very light, as there is a scene with foxes and a scene at the end, where there is also a lot of blood. I just thought that for the most part this film was a bit boring.
