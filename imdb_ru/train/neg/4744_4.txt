The worst DCOM I have ever seen. Ever Well, maybe not as bad as Smart Home. It was just bad. The acting and plot was great, but the effect sucks! <br /> <br /> They were so unreal! The only good fight scene was between brother and Shen. It was probably the only scene in which I was excited. <br /> <br /> In general, I found this film very boring, and the film suddenly ended. <br /> <br /> I'll give her a four for Branda Song, who is a very funny actress and this fight scene. <br /> <br /> 4/10
