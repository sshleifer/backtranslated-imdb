Wow, that a total let down! The fact that people think this movie is scary is ridiculous. The special effects were a direct robbery of the "Ring". Story? Was there one? Not in my opinion .. Just a bunch of vivid images. The whole movie was a boring, silly, mess. I think there is always a market for bad movies with good marketing campaigns. However, this is the worst horror movie I've seen in recent years. And this Buffy Chick? Well, she is a bad actress! As plastic as Barbie and as talented ... No, wait, that would be an insult to Barbie's talents! I believe that many kids have helped this movie at the box office, since it was PG-13, and if it were rated as R, it would have blown up IMO! Stupid movie!
