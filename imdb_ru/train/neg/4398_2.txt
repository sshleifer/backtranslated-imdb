Tim Robbins and John Cusack are two actors I have valued throughout my career, and this was the only reason I decided to watch this movie. Well, all I can say is, I was completely sorry about that! These two great actors all the time humiliate themselves by performing a series of irrelevant, unimaginable and incredible (not too bad) sketches that are supposed to make people laugh, but they do not. The only reason I can think is that the director was their friend, and they decided to support his film, playing the main role in it - I can't think of anything else, because this film is SO cheap! Fortunately, Tim Robbins and John Cusack have not disappointed me since. I would recommend you to avoid this film, unless you want your opinion of the two actors to go bad.
