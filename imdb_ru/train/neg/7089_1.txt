A chef with a sexual obsession leads a double life: one as a “happily” married man with a ten-year-old child, and the other as a sex villain. Much of this documentary film accompanies him for five days in a row and is told in retrospect along with Nastasya Kinski as a clinical sexologist who listens to his story and intelligently investigates it. The role of Nastasia is very restrictive, and she is the only main adult character who does not take off her clothes. If she had, I would rate this film with a big fat "F." As such, it values ​​F +, implying that it is still a failure if you don’t like to be bored. It is probably much more interesting to spend ninety minutes cleaning the garage. The Diary of a Sexual Addict falls into the category of films in which they see him once and wish someone.
