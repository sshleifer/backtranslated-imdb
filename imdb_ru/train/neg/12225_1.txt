My personal vision of hell is locked in a room without the ability to close my eyes or close my ears, and this film will play forever on all available surfaces in this room. The very notion that Streisand plays a boy / man is only beginning to scratch the surface of how ridiculous the premise of this film is. The most important thing in watching any movie is the concept of “voluntarily suspending disbelief.” This is impossible to do in this film.
