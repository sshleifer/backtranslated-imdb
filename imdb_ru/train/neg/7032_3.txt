When Carol (Vanessa Hidalgo) begins to study her brother's death, she begins to suspect something more sinister than "natural causes." The closer she comes to the truth, the more she threatens her daughter-in-law Fiona (Helga's line) and the rest of the local Satanists. They will do everything necessary to put an end to her curious ways. <br /> <br /> If you like tedious satanic movies, Black Candles have a lot to offer. The film is filled with lots of nudity and ritual soft sex. One scene, in particular with the participation of a young woman and a goat, should be considered as faith. Unfortunately, all the scum in the world can not save Black candles. Most of the film is a bore. In addition to one scene, which I have already mentioned, numerous sex scenes are not shocking and, of course, not sexy. The game is spotty at best. Even the favorite genre of Helga Line gives disappointing features. The plot really doesn't matter. It seems that his main function is to bond boring sex scenes. I am familiar only with another film directed by José Ramón Larraza. Compared with their “Daughters of Darkness”, in which eroticism and horror are skillfully combined, “Black candles” look like amateur ones. 3/10 is the best I can do.
