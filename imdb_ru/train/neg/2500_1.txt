Wang Ding should be embarrassed by the memories of this absurdly bad movie, as, indeed, every single person. Honestly, I'm rather ashamed to admit that I watched it from beginning to end. Production figures are somewhere between the original Crossroads series and the H prison cell block. Most five-year-olds will manage to come up with a more realistic dialogue and a more believable storyline. As for acting performances, if you can imagine the most trash porn you've never seen - one of those, where action is complemented with some endless “stories” to explain how some plump old blonde peroxide boiler came to get a spit roasted by a couple of guys with a mustache, you will have an idea of ​​the standard of acting in Maiden Voyage. Worse, you can't even quickly go to sex scenes, because there aren't any. Scary horrible movie.
