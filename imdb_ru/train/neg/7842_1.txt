Caught it by chance on tv. showing - and could hardly believe how terrible the whole experience was. For comparison, the original “Man by the name of the Horse” was a spell, because he had an interest in everything. But this nonsense - the words let me down. It was bad enough to present some kind of “story” with all the effects of a wet loaf of bread, but this mistake was exacerbated by the apparent lack of subtitles everywhere when the so-called “Sioux” spoke. For God's sake, could the filmmakers find enough North American Indians who were also actors and close actors to act as “Indians” on this farrago instead of impostors they actually used? I was also rather embarrassed to watch Richard Harris jumping all over the countryside under the explicit instructions of the director, who was right behind the camera, telling him to run and jump from point A to pointless point B just to shoot the footage and minutes. Absolutely terrible in every way!
