What happened to all the Turkish actors? No offense, but I thought that all these actors were for nothing. The film did not have a script to test acting skills or abilities. It required almost nothing that I bought this film to see Michael Madsen. He is one of my favorite actors, but this film was another setback for him. The script was very bad. They simply had nothing to absorb, and all the characters were two-dimensional. Madsen tried to act like a tough ass, but the script and the direction did not even allow him to do enough with his character to make it more interesting or three-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Even the sound effects of the shootout at the beginning of the film sounded like the noise of cannon balls when they shot at a shootout. It was really strange, and they did not look like real weapons. Video games had better sound effects than this movie. There was also a really annoying type at the beginning of the film who was a member of a robbery gang. He had an American whining voice, like a girl, who shouted out lines like “Let's get F # $ k out of here” and “What are we going to do, man.” He sounded like a girl. As a positive. It was funny to watch, and it made me laugh, too. In a few seconds. Oooo! Dumb movie. Poor Madsen. He will recover
