Could this be interesting ?? is the history of the haunted house in Japan in terms of the newly established American family ?? but fails due to oversimplified handling and the improper role of both actors and directors. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from the same problem that I often encounter with the popular modern revival of such native fare, i.e. that spirits show themselves evil without a single real reason, except the one from which they expect! In addition, it does not deliver much in the department of intimidation ?? giant crab attack just stupid ?? because, as a rule, ghosts inhabit a certain character and force him or her to act in a completely uncharacteristic way, for example, Susan George seduces the diplomat / friend of the family, Doug McClure and Edward Albert, who force-feed his daughter with a bowl of soup! <br /> <br /> At some point, an old monk appears in the house to warn Albert of the danger if they stay there? in the end, he is called to expel the room. However, history must repeat itself, and tragedy is the only result of a tense situation created properly. leading to a brutal, but unintentionally ridiculous climax, in which Albert and McClure, obsessed with the spirits of their Japanese predecessors, enter into an improvised karate duel to the death! In the end, it becomes a harmless waste of time? tolerable in just 88 minutes, but in any case not necessarily when viewed.
