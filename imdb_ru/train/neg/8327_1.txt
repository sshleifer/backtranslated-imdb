OK. So this is a low-budget “movie” (I used quotes because it was shot in Hi-8 video). The game is ugly everywhere, the makeup is ridiculous (the blood looks like it came from Sherwin-Williams, and I saw more convincing bruises made from sets of hooligans), and the lighting usually looks like they used someone’s Toyota pick-up to shine lights on actors. <br /> <br /> I could forgive these low-budget features if there was some real content, if the film tried to tell a story. But this collection of videos can not boast of any plot, no real characters, no impulses. This is a self-deprecating mess. <br /> <br /> And do not worry - there are no spoilers, because there is absolutely nothing to spoil.
