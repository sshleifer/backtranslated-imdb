I think it could have been a decent movie, and some of its parts are fine ... but in general, this is film B. The same with the plot, the parts are in order, but it has several holes and oddities that do not quite add up. Basically this is normal, I also saw the worst. :) <br /> <br /> Beginning sets the level: cars traveling through the desert make “steep” but completely unnecessary jumps over small dunes (in slow motion! sand earlier ... From there it gets a little better, but not much . <br /> <br /> If you are going to rent it, take another one and use it as a warm-up. Keep your expectations low and it might work for you.
