The film was a huge disappointment. Moreover, it was directed by Priyadarshan, it was sad to see such gloomy standards. Bad script (almost absent) and sequences of songs with bad songs every minute and in the most strange times any humor the film could offer was killed. some scenes were funny, but it probably was only 5 minutes of the whole duration. Editing was pathetic. Gloomy! Overall, the film was disappointed, as the lack of history was too obvious. In fact, only a few people remained to watch the second half of the film after the break. <br /> <br /> No one would have missed anything if you hadn't watched the movie. Do not spend valuable tickets for this film. wait until he appears on TV ...
