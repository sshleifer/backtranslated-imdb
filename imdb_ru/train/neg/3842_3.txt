Our teacher showed us this film in the first grade. I have not seen this since. I just watched the trailer. Does this look like a first class movie for you? I do not think so. I was so scared by this movie that I could hardly watch it. It was mostly a scene with Shirley McClain, who cut this little girl in half, and then there was a boy with ketchup! I was excited about this movie. Now that I am 20, I probably would not have felt that way. I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe young children should not watch this film, even if it is PG. Be aware of the possible results of showing this to children. I do not even remember what it was about, once it was enough!
