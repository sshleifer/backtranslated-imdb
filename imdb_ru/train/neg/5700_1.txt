How this movie gets a rating of 6.7, I can not believe. He deserves nothing better than 2.0, and, undoubtedly, should be among the top 100 IMDb films of all time. “National Treasure” is an insult to national intelligence and another attack by a Hollywood American audience. Critics told about the holes in the plot, through which you could drive 16 wheels. <br /> <br /> I like the fact that this film is good: "Nicolas Cage is cute." C'mon, no wonder people all over the world think Americans are stupid. This is supposed to be the stupidest, most insulting movie I've ever seen. If you want to watch a truly worthy film this season, think of Kinsey, Woodsman, Million Dollar Baby or Sideways. Unfortunately, The Treasure of the Nation has received much more publicity than these amazing films. I can argue that most of you who read this have not even heard of them, because some have not been widely released yet. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage is a terrific actor when he is filming suitable films. Over and over again, I saw Cage spending his amazing talent in horrific, stunning films such as Con Air, The Rock and Face-Off. When his talent finds good use, as in "The Adaptation of Charlie Kaufman," he is an incredible actor. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that I would rather put my hand on a wood crusher than undergo visual atrocities again.
