When a film like The Dukes of Hazzard brings in more than $ 75 million, it makes incredibly sad statements about the state of our own society. Either we are collectively too stupid to stay away from such garbage, or maybe I just don’t understand how many people will contact this type of garbage without effort. <br /> <br /> Hollywood had no incentive to make good films, because if he throws out trash, people will still see him, because there is nothing else on the screen. This is what. I went out, despite the fact that I received a free pass to the cinema. Dialogue can not be dumber. The stunts could not be more excessive and outrageous. Perhaps this “big, big” image attracts Texans, but neither I nor anyone else in the theater liked it. None of the "big names" participated in this film, ending his career, except Bert Reynolds, who says everything you need to hear. Jessica Simpson - don't make me laugh. <br /> <br /> I would not even recommend this movie for video, even if you were in despair. It was all about fooling the public to earn enough money after the opening of the day, to equalize or to do better than it did with marketing. They did, despite warning the public. Stupidity abound.
