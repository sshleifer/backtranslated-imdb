Is it a coincidence that Orca was made two years after Jaws? Orca doesn’t really clean my jaws, but it’s obvious that she was trying to capitalize on the success of Jaws. Firstly, Orca, in my opinion, was a bad film, not terrible, but definitely not a good one, on average, at best. <br /> <br /> The plot is mostly male killer whales (orca), upon seeing their partner and unborn calf. dead fisherman seeking revenge. I could not watch this movie again. The direction of this film is bad, and in comparison with The Jaws, the director, producers and screenwriters look almost incompetent. <br /> <br /> As for acting, it was very average and believable, but the real characters are not at all likeable. The effects were good for their time, and the shots of the killer whales looked pretty good. <br /> <br /> Violence is confusing, bloody, and not recommended for more sensitive people. The music is overdone and very loud, drowning out sound effects and annoying from time to time. I hated how they exaggerated the intelligence of the killer whale (the killer whales do not mate with just one assistant, as shown in Orca). <br /> <br /> Overall, this film was bad / bad, in my opinion, due to the reasons listed above. Some people may appreciate this film more because of the concept of revenge among animals and people, so I'm not going to make this film, and I can understand why some people like it. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 10 (but for his concept maybe 5/10)
