I went to the cinema as a preview in Austria. So had no idea what I was going to see. The story is very normal. The film is very long, I believe that it could be reduced to 1/2, without creating problems for the story. This is a type of film that you can see on a boring night, and you feel like missing more! Ashton Kutcher was very good. Kevin Costner is fine. The film tells about the US Coast Guard, how they are trained, what their lifestyle is and the problems they face. Since the film is not so many effects. So if you want to watch it, then you do not need to spend money and time to go to the cinema. It would be more effective to watch it at home when it hits the DVD.
