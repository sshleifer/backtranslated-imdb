Wow. Some films just make me speechless. This is undoubtedly one of those films. When I left the theater, I did not get a single word. All I had was an incredible desire to hit my head against the wall of the theater to help me forget about the last hour and a half. Unfortunately it did not work. Honestly, this film has nothing to recommend. Humor was first class, at best, the game was overly stupid, and the plot was astronomically contrived. I hear a promise to never watch another movie with Chris Cattan or other SNL actors.
