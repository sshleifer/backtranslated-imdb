[I saw this film one day late on a public television station, so I don’t know if it’s on video or not.] <br /> <br /> This is one of “Baby Berlezka” (sic) that Shirley Temple made in the early 1930s. It is hard to believe that someone would let their daughter be in this colorful little film, which today may simply consider this side of “child pornography”. <br /> <br /> The stars of Shirley Temple are in a cast that probably has an average age of 5. They are all in diapers and in the cabin, where they serve milk instead of alcohol. "Money" is presented in the form of lollipops. <br /> <br /> Shirley plays Sasha the “femme fatale” in a bar and talks with soldiers who make impressive comments about her (!). But Shirley doesn’t really need their lollipops / cash, because her wallet is full of other "men's" things. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a little black boy is dancing on a nearby table (!). br /> <br /> What a weird movie. Babies using colorful dialogue, playing the role of adults in the cabin. Who came up with this thing?
