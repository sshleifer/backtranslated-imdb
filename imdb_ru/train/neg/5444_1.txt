It was 1974, and Martin Sheen starred in it. <br /> <br /> Already one speaks about what to expect from this film. <br /> <br /> And it was a movie. According to the film, Slovik was reformed, got a good woman and did not want to fight. <br /> <br /> In real life, Slovik might have been a naive innocent, or he might just have wanted to manipulate the system. <br /> <br /> No matter whether Slovik or not, history decides it, but it was a film that told about desertion at a time when the country wondered why she fought, and the film took sides. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the servicemen who were in Vietnam in 1974 (as Willy Nelson would say, let’s tell the truth, it was a war in Vietnam, not World War II), propaganda, like Gong Ho was in the forties. <br /> <br /> According to this film, Slovik stated his position clearly and simply. He had a nervous problem. Damn it, I have a clinical nervous condition, and, believe me, if I was performing a military duty, I wouldn’t have a problem either to just let go of my nerves and fail when performing my tasks and get demoted, or put to service in KP or duty without problems. <br /> <br /> If you believe the film, Slovik did not have such an opportunity, no doubt because of his criminal history. <br /> <br /> Whatever the viewer believes, depends on the viewer. I learned that films of this decade or of that decade concerning service or military service will largely take the same position again and again. <br /> <br /> The 1940s and 1950s serve your country. /> The 1960s and 1970s, mock your country. <br /> <br /> This is a story. <br /> <br /> The whole movie seemed to me predictable Hollywood. He refused to serve, and only when he was brought before execution, did he show emotions. <br /> <br /> Such an emotional outburst could easily have worked in his favor when he announced his nervous condition, but obviously the film wanted to show him as a person, and only when he was about to die would he be saddened. <br /> <br /> I am not a Catholic, but I thought about reading the city of Mary Ned Beattie and Sheen at the end, with the Lord's prayer, was funny because it sounded like they were trying to figure out who could say it faster. <br /> <br /> I don’t understand how it was possible to watch this movie without even realizing that it was aimed at Tricky Dick Nixon and the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> I hope it was worth it for Slovik and all those who decided to follow his example.
