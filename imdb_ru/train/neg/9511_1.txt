I wanted to watch this movie since it was first shown on television. I went to Tinsel Town to see him last night at 7:40. I regret the day when I wasted my ticket for this garbage, when I could see something better. The beginning was all a bunch of sex trash and stamps. They exaggerated the way love works in reality. All the girls were stereo. The guy was too stupid for his age. Passing gases over which the pregnant girl continued to laugh. Bank robbery was completely boring with gags, which were used in other films. Their running car was an old, battered Chevy van, which they claimed had no interruptions. Hey, why didnâ€™t they get a good girlish robber car instead? This could enhance the viewers opinion about the film. This film was very low, low and low budget, as there was nothing damaged or destroyed. There were a lot of things in this movie that drove the Christian people crazy. Hey, I even expected a car chase scene, because in all the films about bank robberies there are car chases, but I never had them. Thus, I rate this movie b, which stands for low budget and 1 out of ten stars.
