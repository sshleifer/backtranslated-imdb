Investigating some caves with his wife, the doctor bites the bat, which causes some disturbing side effects ... <br /> <br /> Sometimes a creepy atmosphere and some decent (though not used) effects of makeup do not save to be a part of man-becomes-being. Bats people, also known as Night, suffer from their senseless history, which is clumsily prepared and weak in rhythm. The plot seems to go nowhere, and the film never offers an explanation of what is happening, or even a satisfactory conclusion for all of this. The cast is rather mediocre in their actions. <br /> <br /> However, I give the film a few points for its obsessive topic and good places to shoot. The make-up of the late Stan Winston is also pretty good, but not so much here. Missed opportunity for sure. <br /> <br /> Definitely, one of the smaller human beings flashes there. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
