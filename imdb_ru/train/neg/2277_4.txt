The Vampire Bat is certainly interesting, as it is one of the earliest genre horror films of the 1930s, but taken in isolation, all too creaky for any sincere praise. <br /> <br /> The film is set in a European village somewhere in the 19th century, where suspicious locals attribute a series of murders to vampirism. This is very similar to the “Frankenstein” by James Weil, and this is compounded by the introduction of Dr. Niman’s character Lionel Atville, supplemented by his erroneous ideas for scientific advancement. <br /> <br /> The vampire theme is arbitrary and is only used as a red herring when suspicion falls on the village lover of Hermann bats (Dwight Fry), thereby giving the mob a torchful crowd to go on a rampage - as if they need it . <br /> <br /> This is one of three early horror films in which Lion Atville and Fay Ray played one of the main roles (also “Doctor X” and “The Secret of the Museum of Wax Figures”), and, like their other collaborations work, the film suffers from rashness. comic relief and a tendency to deviate from horror to the basic elements of a thriller. Taken in context, though, the 'Vampire Bat' is still weak and derivative. <br /> <br /> All that we remain is a poor-quality imitation of Frankenstein, with vampire elements, merely a means to deceive Dracula’s admirers. But because of the title of the film, it will be difficult to even call it horror, and it is worth noting that the director Frank Streier was shooting Blondie films several years later.
