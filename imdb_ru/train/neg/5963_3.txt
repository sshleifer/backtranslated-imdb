This film begins with the execution of a witchcraft practitioner and his mistress. His head is cut off and buried separately from his body ... sounds like "The thing that will not die", is not it? Well, this is a bit like, but as soon as the body reunites with the head, all the interesting and terrible deaths are completed, and the film moves very slowly. I mean, the film only lasts 88 minutes, and I kept thinking: “When will it end?” The characters in the film are mostly idiots, and they pretty much deserve to die for being really stupid. The villain is also very bad, as he slowly moves, and you really wonder how he manages to do something if he is afraid of jewelry. The only thing that makes you look after the head is attached again is the fact that so many tits are highlighted that you really start to lose track. However, I want to watch a horror movie, not a soft core porn flick and as a horror movie it is a way to slow down moving with the path of many slow stretches to be even somewhat enjoyable. And don't read the back of the box, because it says there are zombies attacking meat attacking the city, no ... just a small scene where three or four zombies attacking a house and so easily reflected do not play a role in the film and their scene is pretty pointless. So for the most part, I say that you should avoid this movie unless you find it really cheap.
