This song continues to buzz in my head. Not the best song, but it's the 80s. This film tells about a vocalist who is “supposedly” killed when he is accused of murder, when he stalks his girlfriend, who sings the vocalist in his group. The soloist, whose name is Billy "The Eye" (yes, right), died two years later, and his group returns to the concert, but this time the lead singer is the vocalist. Billy pursues her and, in the end, kills all these people and terrifies the girl, causing others to think that something is wrong with her, and this she imagines. In the end, she decides to go to the cemetery and dig up his grave to see if he is still there. She sees that he is dead, but still sees and hears his voice. At the end of the film, we find out the reason for all of this, Billy has a brother named John (right again), and John admits that he was jealous of his brother and that he killed all these people to take revenge on him and take his brother’s fault, and then pick up his girlfriend and terrorize her because she called him crazy. The ending is very funny, and the game is very lame and wooden. But .... I still like it. I look at this song. I would like to have this.
