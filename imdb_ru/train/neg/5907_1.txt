Yes, that's about it. This film was terrible. Two minutes later I wanted to knock my eyes out. This is rated as an “innovative comedy comedy”, but it’s not even good for members of this church! I do not think that any person should undergo such a victimization in order to watch films of such poor quality. <br /> <br /> First of all, you can say that there was absolutely no effort in this film. It seems as though a terribly dull, banal, banal plot was composed by two crazy caresses, somehow impregnated with the gift of connected (at least semi-cohesive) thoughts. Then there is an act that is gloomy for all involved. Even cameos can't spice things up. <br /> <br /> And let's not forget the fact that our main character is a petty moron who, as we would like to believe, can be changed, but this path is full of awkwardly bad dialogue, horrendously disgusting "jokes" and many Mormon "jokes" that any sane person, LDS or not, should be considered purely * stupid *! This is supposed to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen!
