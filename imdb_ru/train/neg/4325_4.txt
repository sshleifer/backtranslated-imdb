The second place in the “Holidays” series is perhaps the least pleasant, since Clark Griswold wins the trip for the whole family to Europe. <br /> <br /> Tasteless, below the belt of humor, which worked so well for the first time, practically does not exist here. This mistake is certainly related to director Hackerling, who is obviously far from being such a good director as Harold Ramis, and a very boring scenario in which only a few decent lines are scattered. <br /> <br /> The actor does what he can; Chevy Chase introduces some form of life into the process, but this is simply not enough, and very funny Eric Idle is completely lost in the small role of a very unfortunate Englishman. Some potentially funny moments are not fully revealed and leave the viewer mostly annoyed. All images of Europeans are one-dimensional and almost universally not at all ridiculous (for example, as the British are polite). <br /> <br /> In addition to several scenes, one can hardly see laughter, and the end of the turn is one in total farce. But if you're a Chevy Chase fan (like me), you can watch a movie, but no more.
