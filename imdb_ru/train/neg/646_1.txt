I saw this film by chance, and this film was an accident ... well, it should be. when blondes are chased, the villain appears, and then disappears, moving from one place to another in a minute, then disappears and reappears, hiding. He was not even a superhero, so I do not know how he did it. he could not scare the Cat, and it is not difficult to do. <br /> <br /> The old “bathroom mirror” is no longer scary, in fact it ceased to be scary many years ago. you had a policeman following the villain’s trail, another cliche (played by Idris Elba with a very convincing American accent, he is from London), the director had no idea and made a movie full of cliches and making a “terrible move” "It was scary. pathetic !
