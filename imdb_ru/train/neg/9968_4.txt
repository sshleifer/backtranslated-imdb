As a former teacher (!), I must admit that I made my way through many scenes - although I continued to look through to the end. I wonder why?! (Maybe boredom?) :-) <br /> <br /> The initial opening scenes seemed incredibly confusing and not focused. The plot, too, although there were some good ideas — for example, the plight of an aid teacher — were not sufficiently concentrated in any one direction for three-dimensional development. <br /> <br /> Not one of the best mister Nolte moments. As for the young Mr. Macchio, does he say that in every * movie? <br /> <br /> In addition to the plot and current complaints, only hairstyles were a nostalgic (if nauseous) trip. <br /> <br />
