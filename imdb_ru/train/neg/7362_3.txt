The average quality of a television film is a completely formulaic story of a religious fanatic (Ron Perlman, who says well: “I’m not just the president of Psychos R Us, I am also a client”), who gains control of a biochemical virus. (remember the virus from the movie "The Rock"). Too bad for him that he also gets stuck in a bank building during an earthquake with bank robbers and government agents trying to stop him (led by impressively developed, gently entertaining wolf Larson, supported by Fred Dryer) along with the standard " time and in the wrong place: “a courageous female (always polite Erika Eleniak) and“ lived like a wimp, but at the last moment died like a hero ”male (Brandon Carrer). It has a standard background to express sympathy for religious fanatics (wife and son died during a police raid several years earlier). <br /> <br /> In fact, this is a good film about a rainy day. <br /> <br /> A favorite line uttered by Ron Perlman after he discovered a virus bottle hidden in the splitting of Erica Eleniak: "Woman and her mystery." "<br /> <br /> Worth renting.
