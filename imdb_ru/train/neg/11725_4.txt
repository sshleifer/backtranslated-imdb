RATING STARS: ***** Saturday evening **** Friday evening *** Friday morning ** Sunday evening * Monday morning <br /> <br /> James Dial (Wesley Snipes) hides on his ranch in Montana after an unsuccessful capture the notorious terrorist. Then the agency again turns to him to go to London to go again. His target was detained there and under strong police protection - but they do not want him to just catch their man, they want to be killed. Everything is going well, but then the mission fails, and when the chief police officer of Windsor (Charles Dance) is killed, the fault falls to Dial's feet. Hunting as an animal, he takes refuge in a nearby house and makes friends with a young girl named Emily (Eliza Bennett) who deals with her own problems and becomes his unwitting assistant when he is going to clear his name and find out who has betrayed him. <br /> This last Snipes escapes right out of nowhere on DVD, with minimal advertising even for such a short time (I don’t recall advertising or trailers for this anywhere.) With that in mind and after the story of Snips Daf on a DVD, it might seem that Snoop Dawg would tell you to quit, as if he was hot. But I still had to try. He is not among his worst, but he does not reach a level that exceeds the standards of some of his best (“Detonator”, “7 seconds,” speaks for itself). <br /> <br /> It is, at best, slightly alarming, with minimal actions, to sweep the path of steep dialogue, and Snipes is not quite at its best in the main role. Likewise, in the main role of support, it is quite clear that the Dance appeared only for paycheck checks, and this is usually the one that none of the actors are going to shout about the hills in any of their resumes. <br /> <br /> It says a lot about the fact that in the end the only “contract” that interests you is when Snipes stops working with Sony, and with it the end of any additional DVD fighters. **
