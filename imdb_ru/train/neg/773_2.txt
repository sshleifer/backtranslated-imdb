No, not the administration of GWB, Decider / Strutter / Smirker - but the Monarch Cove mini-series. Life must have realized that this was a dog, because the series burned down two episodes at once, most of which were broadcast between 11 o'clock in the evening. Friday evening and 1 am Saturday night. As for why I watched all this, I can only refer to weekly sudden convulsive bouts of masochism. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors are unknown, who are likely to remain unknown. The only two recognizable names are Shirley Jones and Rachel Ward, who show the only decent performances (Jones does not go through the entire series - a happy woman). Ward, by the way, is aging well since the days of the "thorns birds." <br /> <br /> The only main thread of the plot - who killed the heroine’s father, who was mistakenly convicted of killing his father, but released after six years in prison - stretches for so long and comes to such a hasty conclusion that it will be especially indifferent to you pursuing him. There is a lot of “sex” sex, several murders and all kinds of rude behavior - almost none of which is neither interesting nor credible. Most of the cast is not particularly attractive and definitely not talented. Letter and direction along with the actors. <br /> <br /> If you stay until the end, the card will be (very insignificant) beep. <br /> <br /> LOOK, YOURSELF WARNED!
