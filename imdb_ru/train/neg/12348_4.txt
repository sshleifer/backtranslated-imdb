This film is very similar to Flashdance, you know, this dance film from Jennifer Beals. This film is probably the most boring movie I've ever seen, because it’s not so bad enough to be funny. “J. I. Jane is much better than this film, but it says little. Here, Demi Moore sweats a lot, there is high music, and we see her fight and all that, but this, of course, is not very attractive. I really think the idea of ​​the film is quite interesting, but the script is too clichéd, and Ridley Scott can't do anything about it. Well, as I said ... This is better than "Flashdance" ... (4/10)
