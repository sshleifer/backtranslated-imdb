Well, I love movies B ... I know that movies B should represent. But it's just terrible. I am amazed that I got such a decent overall score. The only redeeming qualities of this click are (mostly) marginal spray. Don't get me wrong, blood in this movie is abundant - but a few effects really jumped out at me (for example, an anal sampler ... it was great!). <br /> <br /> I believe that this film was filmed on video. Come on. - rent Betacam, at least I saw porn with better production values ​​(and better act, as well) <br /> <br /> duties - sucked! But not in the style of Tromy or Full Moon. <br /> <br /> History - contrived! But this is what you get from such films. Very free! <br /> <br /> Sets and props - sucks! My 16-year-old brother makes more complex decorations for our Halloween home. <br /> <br /> Duplication and communication sucks! Awful voice acting (I don’t even have to call it acting), and every other word is "S ** t" or "F ** k". <br /> <br /> There are tons of good classics and horror rated B / Splashes appear, and they are not so difficult to track. Do yourself a favor without wasting time on this shit!
