I felt the brain is dead, I tell you. This is the worst movie I have ever bought. (in my ignorance, I thought it was a Peter Jackson film with the same name). The performances are so terrible that they are ridiculous. The special effects did not stand the test of time and look terrible. The script promotes this type of television film, closely looks at the average distance of acting. The actors look as if they were taking lessons from Joey Tribbiani, they have one look at them, and they stick to it. Plus, I never got confused with the movie until I sat down to watch it. Sleep or not, the plot is so horrible that disappointment comes in a few minutes. Avoid the plague.
