1st viewed 12/6/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Deer-Walter Lang): a disappointing musical in terms of character development, in my opinion, from this promising work by Rogers and Hammerstein. There are a couple of good songs and a decent comic picture, from time to time, King of Siam Yul Brynner - but the film doesn’t really represent the situation and settings very well. I can only blame the script and perhaps some actions for why we do not fully understand the nature and its situations. I know that maybe asking too much about a musical intended to enjoy songs and dances, but even this part didn’t really stand out for me. The main storyline tells about an Englishwoman who comes to Siam to teach children high-class European things. Later we learn that the King is actually the biggest student. Between the young wife of the king, played by Rita Moreno (a Latina in the role of an Arab - come on!), And a former lover, who causes some complications, but nothing really fascinating, there is no love affair. Deborah Kerr, as the main character of Annie, is fine, but not so convincing. The king learns some things because of her presence, and then the film disappears as he does. This is really a tiny story with some songs and dances, but in reality it is not a very good experience for the viewer.
