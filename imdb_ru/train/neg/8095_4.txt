The meaning of Wolfe's original novel — in fact, the whole story — is that everything happens because of a carefully calculated sense of expediency. The goal is survival in a certain way of life. The novel is full of malice. The only relationship that sounds emotionally true is the relationship between Sherman and his daughter Campbell, and this is only affected. In addition, everyone craves advertising, power, money or self-deprecation. <br /> <br /> Wolfe was criticized for hitting all the characters and all the social segments of New York on the head. His answer was denial. After all, he himself lived in New York and belonged to the District Improvement Committee and other great organizations, he would like to get such a qualification in his resume to deny that he doesn’t like New Yorkers. (Wolfe has a doctoral degree in American studies from Yale University, and he is not a fool.) These supposed weaknesses made the novel unforgettable. No one was good. And Sherman McCoy went bankrupt, a professional protest for social justice. The film discards all this and imposes a moral framework on the story, which simply does not fit. Wolfe did his homework. The novel was based on reality. Each event was not only possible, but also quite plausible. Wolfe could be a great cultural anthropologist — he knows how to penetrate the system and record its details. <br /> <br /> Yes, any of us could be, like Sherman and his mistress, stuck in the South Bronx, which is threatened by a pair of black children and who ran away after a collision with one of them. This scene is neatly transferred from print to celluloid. <br /> <br /> But after this scene, the film seems to mistrust its audience and sometimes it goes berserk, trying to present its message, however vague it may be. <br /> <br /> Sherman may accidentally hit a child and be arrested for it, as he is in the novel, but he will not immediately return to his phenomenally expensive apartment, get a shotgun and start shooting at the ceiling with him as he does it in motion. In what should be a funny scene, the ceiling plaster falls on the party guests, and they run screaming away. It just wouldn't have happened. The film left an inexpressively detailed reality of the novel in the dust. Wolfe's sensitivity, the work he invested in creating the present, is lost. Instead, we get a noisy, fantastic and stupid scene that does nothing but wake the audience. Such empty scenes follow, shouting Wolfe's believability. <br /> <br /> The film also fails because it throws a lot of sin and redemption into the entertaining history of moral nihilism. Here we see "Don Juan in Hell" in the opera. We receive lectures on redemption from the poet with AIDS. We see a lot of guilt in Sherman. A black judge who preaches from the bench and makes one of the last speeches about how we should all start to behave again. A reporter who feels sorry for Sherman after turning him into a sacrificial lamb. And the happy ending in which Sherman comes out, breaking the law with an idiotic grin. The scene in the film is like a jester's cap on the head of a circus elephant. <br /> <br /> The film not only emphasizes banal and non-original moments, but also exaggerates them, as if the audience was unable to absorb any subtleties. <br /> <br /> This is not acting or Direction is a bad one. The film is not bad in this respect. And the photo is also pretty good, including two pretty spectacular shots - the gargoyles of the Chrysler building and the landing of the Concorde. This is a script that is completely flawed. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film is about good in concept and performance. Here are kept some stuff from the novel. Dog Sherman and Judy name is Marshall. Who the hell would call a dog Marshall? In the second half, he almost completely loses focus, and in general it is hardly worth observing. <br /> <br /> Wolfe’s cynical right movement can be offensive to many people, but he has koyons to postpone his actions. perceives. Alas, the writers and producers did not have the courage to raise them, and so they missed the opportunity to conduct an exciting study of New Yorkers.
