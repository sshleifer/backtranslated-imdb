The British cinema heritage industry is out of control. There is nothing wrong with shooting classic novels, but why should they be removed by worthless anyone? This film pulls courage from Orwell’s tough novel, turning it into a harmless, fluffy romantic comedy. Aspidistra may not be Orwell’s best work, but no one who reads it can forget its superb depiction of poverty. Orwell emphasizes not only cold and hunger, but also the humiliation of poverty. In the novel, London is a cold, gray, cold, heartless city, and Comstock prays for a squadron of bombers to blow it up. But this film inflates everything that could be disturbing in any way, and instead creates a fun nostalgic trip to charming London of the 1930s, in which everything is lit by the rays of golden sunlight, and even Lambeth slums are picturesque and filled with fresh bushes. hedgehogs and happy prostitutes. Comstock's poems about the biting wind coming down the littered streets seem completely out of place in this world of chocolate boxes. Worst of all, the script is ruthless, ancient jokes and awkward dialogue. This is so frustrating because Richard E. Grant is the perfect person to play Gordon Comstock, and the film is full of great actors. But it's all for nothing. This movie pissed me off! British literary history is something to be proud of for its wealth, complexity and power. And what should we do about it? We hire insignificant people to turn it into a soft-centered anodic dad for people who want to feel that they are “getting some kind of culture” while they drink their horkad and doze quietly.
