I am amazed at how many comments to this show about how “real” he is. Perhaps I do not belong to the same universe, because if Veronica Mars is something, then it is very important. <br /> <br /> The scene chews the scene enthusiastically and there are holes in the plots that you could drive through the truck. This is not what I call real. <br /> <br /> The desire to be “relevant” is so serious that it shows how torn from reality Rob Thomas and his staff are. <br /> <br /> Overall, I found it to be a dormant festival at best, and a bit annoying at worst. Kristen Bell looks like she can be a good actress, but it's hard to tell by the unsurpassed style of the whole show.
