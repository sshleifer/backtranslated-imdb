I always wonder how different people are and how almost in every movie you get both extremes. People who think this is the best movie, and people who think this is the worst movie. <br /> <br /> The stigma will not be the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's there. First of all, sound. The producers spent more time on the soundtrack than on editing. It was so loud when the soundtrack sounded and no one spoke, and then, when Patrick spoke in her monotonous voice, she was hardly heard. <br /> <br /> I usually like Patrick and Gaberial, but they were both flat in this film. Patrick had mostly 3 emotions. Silent, with severe pain or very angry, she has stigmata. The first was the dominant, the second - screaming pain, the third - raising his voice. It was the volume that shared these three, not the emotions. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I missed a lot of deep meaning and plots that everyone was talking about, or maybe I was distracted by horrible filming and style similar to MTV. When you watch a 3-minute video, you need fast shots and slow motion to convey a short story, in a 2-hour feature film it causes nausea. I do not see the point that she saw women crossing a star and throwing a child. And in none of Pittsburgh there is such a frequent rain !! <br /> <br /> I think that perhaps the real story with something that could be said was conceived, but the entire budget was spent on buying music and equipment for a slow rain. take pictures and shoot the terrible apartment Miss Arquette lived in to end up firing the guy with this story.
