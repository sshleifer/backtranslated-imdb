and no joke. it is just a bad shock that people have published positive reviews about it here. the story sucks, the acting is bad, not terrible, the special effects are not special - oh no! there are hands on the board! oh god - the mirror turned into water! hair, clothes and make-up in the scenes of the 50s are not accurate, and they had a middle-aged man with balding hair to play his version for high school. It looks like a nightmare on Elm Street. I love to sit to watch a crappy horror movie just like everyone else, but there are also the best bad movies to choose from.
