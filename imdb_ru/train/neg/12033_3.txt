The film is about a small town with an equal number of Mormons and Baptists. A new family is entering, for example, a rewritten dialogue, a mediocre game, green jelly salad with chopped carrots, and all the other “Mormon jokes” known to man. Anyone who has nothing to do with Mormon culture will have a hard time making this film. Anyone who is in the Mormon culture will be slightly surprised by the laughter here and there. It will be much better for you to watch other Hess films (“Napoleon Dynamite”, etc.) than try to watch this movie. The game is mediocre. Jared Hess picked up much better films, such as Saints and Soldiers and Napoleon Dynamite. I would recommend both films for this moan.
