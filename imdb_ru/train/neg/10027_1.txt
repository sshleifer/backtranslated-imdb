The action in this film beats Sunny Bhai in Gadar. Akshay Kumar has Leonid's superpowers in 300, Neo in the Matrix along with Spider-Man and Superman. It's fun. With the exception of the typical comedy Akshay Kumar and Anil Kapoor, I do not see anything positive in this film. The story looks as if the author told his 10-year-old son to write. The film is so unreal that shooting Anil Kapur from a long-range shotgun with a gun is the director's smallest mistake. Besides the directors of Tashan, there is no other Tashan to create this film. I regret spending my money on this film and I would not recommend it to anyone. 1/10 is the minimum I can give on IMDb, otherwise I would give zero.
