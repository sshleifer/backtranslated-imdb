Terrifying! Avoid the plague. I would rate this in the top 10 worst films ever. Special effects, acting, mood, sound, etc. It seems to be made by full-time students ... wait, I saw programs better than this. It opens like a soft porn show with a blurred nude woman doing a shower scene, then spoils from there. Good nude scenes, but that's all. Problems with sound and light were constant throughout the film. Sometimes I swear I hear the roar of the camera engines. YIKES! I would like to see another film on this story, but filmed by different people. This group of actors and film crews need more lessons in acting and filmmaking. Voted 1 out of 10.
