I made this film yesterday and I can hardly express my disappointment in little Lore Ingalls for doing something so poorly prepared. I'm not sure if it was a terrible piece or bad direction, or both, but it leaves the viewer very disappointed that he took the time to watch this voyage. It consisted of a weak naive storyline, very bad plots, and relied solely on beautiful landscapes and pretty people to sell it. Unfortunately, this was not enough. You'd better rent a tape full of static than spend time on this nonsense. Lindsey Wagner also played a rather pretentious role as a rancher who apparently works very hard, doing nothing, anyone who has ever been around the ranch knows that it was written by a young man from Los Angeles not someone who knows a lot about the world
