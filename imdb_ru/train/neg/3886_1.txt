Is this a stupid movie? You bet! I could not find a single moment in this film that was creepy or scary. Silly moments? Lot. Stupid characters? You put. Bad consequences? Everywhere! Rick Baker may have gone and done more and better, but this is not one of them. Oh, well, people should start somewhere. Dr. Ted Nelson Cheese. He is the most whiny doctor I have ever seen. He is somewhere in Ventura district, some thawing man wanders, he is not too happy that his wife is pregnant (probably because she is 55 years old and weighs 90 pounds), and there are no crackers anywhere. In addition, on his shoulders is not too useful a general who wants to find astronaut Steve. And the local sheriff wants to know what is going on, although Mr. Nelson cannot tell him anything. There are also random characters who meet a melting man. In the end, the film ends, and our monster falls into the bin to become compost. In the end, this is exactly what you need for a great MST episode.
