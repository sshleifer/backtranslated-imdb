I can not believe that someone thought that there was something original or interesting in this film. I'm a science fiction fan, just like the next guy, and I can even enjoy old movies with funny backgrounds if they are written by someone other than a monkey. (See, for example, my brilliant review of “Altered States” [1980].) <br /> <br /> A monkey could better explain why I should take the basic idea of ​​this film seriously for a second. The problem is not that the producers had a limited budget, but that they didn’t care. <br /> <br /> Now publicly humiliate useless magazines, whose brilliant reviews appear on the box: <br /> </ b> The Chicago Tribune <br /> <br /> Chronicle of San Francisco <br /> <br / > The San Francisco Bay Guardian <br /> <br /> (Actually, I like to read the last two. However, their film plausibility test went through the floor. But I know that if I ever make a film with a hand-held camera, a wacky storyline and silly effects, I will show it to these journalists and remind them what they said about the Conception of Ada.)
