Now I will be the first to recognize this when I say something that may be blasphemous or unfair, so I would like to apologize in advance for my ranting about how much I did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> This is about taking stock too. I did not like this movie. To be more specific, I didnâ€™t like the concept of this film. The cinematography was good. The mood was pleasant. And the game was satisfactory. <br /> <br /> However, the story is stupid, inaccurate and misleading. It is also insulting. <br /> <br /> I am the fourth Indian Cree, and for some reason I feel insulted at the personal level by the character of Whitaker. First of all, he is a black guy. And this is not a racist remark, I swear. The idea that a white, Hispanic or even Native American shakes a katana on the roof offends everything that represents a katana. A katana is a samurai soul, imbued with the souls of his ancestors, who direct and protect samurai. For the Ghost Dog, using his weapon instead of a katana is also an insult to the blade and the soul inside, and where the hell did he even get a katana? It must be one of those copies that insult the samurai caste even more. <br /> <br /> In addition, the ghost Dog showed no honor. Toward the end of the film, he shoots a bodyguard in the back through a window, and then kills a man by shooting him in the face through a tap drain. This is not only a cowardly way to kill an enemy, but also a ninja; silent killers; a group that samurai deny exists, but nevertheless hates. <br /> <br /> Then he tries to kill his boss when he finds out that his boss is a villain. Do you know what a real samurai does when he finds out that his master was bad or dishonest? He kills himself to prove that he would rather die than fall to the level of his canine master. <br /> <br /> Everything in the character was a gigantic contradiction to the real code that all samurai follow: the bushido. <br /> <br /> So we have excellent cinematography, a good atmosphere and so-so actions covering the plot and background of the satirist (which, unfortunately, is the most important aspect), which makes it an unsatisfactory film in general and an insult to everything, that respects respected Busy (Samurai). <br /> <br /> 2.5 / 10 Blea
