A group of extremely unattractive holes A is plagued by lame puppets, whom some elderly night watchman-handler has been locked in a cinema for twenty years without any reason. <br /> <br /> Many people know this film simply from the exact rippling of MST3K. But I saw a real movie and I can say with confidence that yes, this is bad, really, very bad. From one of the worst horror scenes I've ever seen, to soft aliens that suffer from a lack of movement (I had My favorite monster, which was worse) to the cruel game (I had My favorite monster , which was more charismatic) However, as they say, Rick Sloane's films "Vice Academy" are somehow, and, believe me, I have no idea how much, much worse. This does not mean that this film is nothing but shit, because it is not. Just throw it there. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: in the film itself there is no nudity, but on DVD there are two pairs of boobs. Introduction to the film <br /> <br /> My rating: D- <br /> <br /> Retromedia DVD Optional: Introduction by Jim Vinorsky; Photo gallery; and the trailer for this film
