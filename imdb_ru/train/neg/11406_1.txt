But I survived it. It seemed to me that even the author of the book approved Caroline. I was very sorry for the character Louise, and she was constantly compared to Esau, who was angry, I just felt that the comparison was a bit harsh and unrealistic. True, the film was bad. I really wouldn't see it if you weren't ready for a big disappointment.
