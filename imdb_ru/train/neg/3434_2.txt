I'm a big fan of horror / spray, I even enjoy horror movies that some people think are silly. I also like blood. The more, the better, as long as it has meaning. <br /> <br /> After reading the reviews of other people on the site, I was sure that this film would be a small decoration. But, to my great disappointment, it turned out to be one of the most meaningless films I've ever watched. <br /> <br /> The game was terrible, the dialogues were silly, the plot meaningless, the special effects useless editing was probably done by someone who was dead in the last 2 years. I usually find that all these characteristics make a great horror movie. But not in this case. <br /> <br /> I asked for 11 euros to get this DVD. <br /> <br /> If you don’t really enjoy meaningless blood (like “violent shit” movies), then avoid it at all costs!
