I read somewhere that this film should be a comedy. seeing this, I would call anything but anything. the meaning of this film eludes me. the dialogue is very superficial and absurd, many of the sets seemed to be belated thoughts, and despite all the nudity and implied sexual content, there is nothing erotic about this film ... everything makes me think about what this thing is the title premise could provide the basis for a funny (if politically incorrect) comedy. instead, we are treated to cheap, amateur, unfinished sketches, viciousness, and weirdness for our own sake. if I want this, I'll go buy a Grace Jones CD.
