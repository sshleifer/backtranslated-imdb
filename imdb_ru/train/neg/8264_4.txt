This is a film in which all the actors are fine, especially Bridget Bako and Eric Palladino, in a film where each of the three couples meets in a situation where it seems that she has to be either cute or set the story in motion. In other words, it seems that they are contrived scenes of the film, and not like in real life. Even if women who work in peep parlors ever meet one of their clients, it does not look realistic, as written in this film. In addition, when one of the characters meets an overweight woman in the film, it looks artificial, the way they look at each other a few seconds after the argument. Again, the actors are all good, and the moments of this film are good, but in general, another indie that could use some rewriting before the production begins.
