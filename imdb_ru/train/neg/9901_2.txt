In fact, it should have been a single star, but there were so many cliches, predictable turns that I saw all of this before the parallel snap clicks, that I actually gave him an extra star for making me laugh ... though this is never the intention of the director I'm sure. <br /> <br /> I don’t often write comments about films, they must be either sensational or, in this case, very bad. <br /> <br /> To be honest, as soon as I saw Jeff Fahey in him, I realized that he would be poor because he has a unique nose for choosing the worst films. <br /> <br /> Somehow all this made me look at all this. through perhaps for the funniest voice of MR T, (don't pass Mr T, but you will understand what I mean if you are tired of watching this), if you really watch it, make sure you don’t pay to see it, It could work if they actually put a target comedy in it, but I'm sure you will find strange laughter here and there in the farce of all this ...
