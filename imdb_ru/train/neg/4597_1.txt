Having endured this inaccurate film, I admit that it is a more modern story than previous versions. However, it is so inaccurate and was made so politically correct that it made me angry after watching. Davy Crockett had a very bad idea of ​​Billy Bob, whom I think it would be better to play, since Sam Houston, given the love of both men for oratory. I think a self-absorbed Dennis Quaid (a true Texan) would be perfect Crockett, and this would definitely contribute to his hungry sense of self-sacrifice. As a Texan and a true supporter of Texas thinking, I feel that Davy Crockett was a typical Texan, although I was not born here. Our unofficial motto: “Do not brag about if it is a fact” was created for Crockett. And the last scene in the Alamo, where Crockett is the last survivor, should be the biggest insult to Davey Crockett. Even to assume that this giant man and an experienced fighter would allow himself to be taken alive, ridiculous. Three different eyewitness accounts indicate that he was dead among the bodies of a dozen or more dead Mexican soldiers after an apparently bitter hand-to-hand combat. Finally, this unfortunate film finale, supposedly depicting the San Jacinto battle as a mutual battle of 600 Mexicans against 700 Mexican soldiers, when in fact there were about 1,500 well-trained Mexican loyal customers. Every Texas schoolboy who pays attention in his first Texas history lesson knows that the battle took the Mexican army off guard during a siesta, and the Mexican army was so embarrassed that it could not form ranks and ran away because it was not trained to fight in the border style . arm.
