What a disappointment! <br /> <br /> This film seemed to be trying to copy the “advanced” comedy, but the script and the script were sloppy, painful and sentimental in the worst traditions of the film. The acting role / role of Jack Black was condescending and self-deprecating ... and the other characters were equally indecent and uninteresting. The soundtrack was tedious. We (WERE) are black fans, but none of us has done more than coped with a forced titter over the entire time. Why did he feel that he needed to make this mistake? <br /> <br /> We will not watch another of his films without first reading the reviews !! <br /> <br /> Was he drunk when he read the script before subscribing to this nonsense?
