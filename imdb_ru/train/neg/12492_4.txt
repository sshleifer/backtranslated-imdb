This is one of those films in which there is an amazing video box, but in which there is a video camera and unknown actors who speak with a bad dialogue. When the murders take place, it is so dark that they are difficult to see, plus the film is difficult to understand. The only star in this is Vanessa Sanchez from WCW (Tigres in WCW before she was turned off), and she is a good actress. I like low-budget films, especially those in which there are mistakes, because they are interesting to watch, but “Disconnected”, unfortunately, is not one of them. You can watch this film if you like voodoo and severed heads, but this is not a blockbuster, but if you need to watch something new, then rent Sered.
