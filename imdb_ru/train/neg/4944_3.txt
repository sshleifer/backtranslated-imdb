So why does this show suck? Unfortunately, this is really the only question, because there is no doubt that this is so. <br /> <br /> For those unfamiliar with the premise of the show, Doomed for a Short Time, Cavemen focuses on a series of Neanderthals and their struggle for existence in modern America and is based on the characters shown in a series of television commercials for Geico Insurance. The concept is complete, and there is every reason to believe that it can be successfully implemented. <br /> <br /> I should have thought about it for a while, but then the slogan from commercials was something like “We“ Not much different from you, ”gave me the key to the show. Despite the fact that cavemen / Neanderthals are actually different from humanity, the main characters of this show, as it turned out, are exactly the same as those of us who are boring assholes. <br /> <br /> Maybe this is my background, as the author of games, and not a soulless hacker, a writer based in California, based on committees, but this show had so much potential, and none of this was realized. To begin with, the producers had to focus on funny things that distinguish cavemen from us. <br /> <br /> What could be funny, for example, providing them with such classes as a regular graduate student and furniture dealer when they would be more convincingly attracted to such things as underground workers and guides in cave parks? Why should they play prose games such as squash, when a whole episode can be devoted to trying to get hunting licenses to hunt spears? Such a show could have written by itself, and in order to make it so boring and boring, you need to intentionally bad writing. <br /> <br /> Another tedious aspect of this show is the attempt to portray cavemen as subjected to a number of stereotypes associated with various human minorities. To yawn! It has been done so many times before, and never more depressing than that. And, as noted earlier, Neanderthals are really a different kind, so using them as a metaphor for racial stereotypes is not only inappropriate, but inappropriate. <br /> <br /> Answers are welcome, including from those who want to tell I why I am wrong. I would love this show and I just regret that I still could not. <br /> <br /> Michael J. Varhola, Skirmisher Online Gaming Magazine
