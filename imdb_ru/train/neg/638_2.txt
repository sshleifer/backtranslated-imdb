Good Land is perhaps the most boring film I've ever seen in my life. The plot is slow and absent. The game is bordered by comic. Although I love Paul Mooney, now I can say that I have seen a film that does not reflect his true ability. The only saving grace I found with this film is the cost of production. The use of hundreds of add-ons throughout the film creates a very believable and interesting setting. In addition, the beautiful effects used to create the illusion of millions of wasps are sold easily and were revolutionary at the time. In addition to the value of production, I can say a little more that is good or interesting about this film.
