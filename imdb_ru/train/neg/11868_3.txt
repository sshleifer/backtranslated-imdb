At first glance, this film has everything the psycho wants: a story about vampires with a restriction "under 18 years old", filled with hyper-violence, drugs, blood, sex (including lesbian sex), fanatic fanatics and even necrophilia-gay . a cop! But then, this film is a series of bad stories (so thin), a bad acting game - with a funny English accent, which makes you believe that you are watching bad Monty Python - bad music (hard rock of the 80s), the video is terrible shame ... Plus the sex scenes are funny, the blood is not very impressive. And these vampires are reflected in the mirror and are not even afraid of daylight! You will be very disappointed if you do not see it as "Space Rebellion" or "Troll 2". I hope that one day the Bloodlust will reach the bottom 100, because this is its real place. <br /> <br /> I would say that looking at it can still be fun if you have friends and enough beer. <br /> 3/10
