(spoilers) Wow, this is bad. I made a double take when I watched the old Star Trek episode the other day - it was the one where everyone gets infected with this cosmic disease, and then they go a little crazy - and there was Stuart Moss, who is also an unsightly "hero" It Lives at night! He played the first infected crew member who dies from incurable depression. All I could think of was that he watched his own movie too many times, that's what caused the depression. This film is full of really unattractive people. There is no expiatory character in the film, not one. It’s very hard to feel bad because Dr. Beck has become a bat (or by all means) because you just don’t like him. And you don't like his piercing, bony wife or nasty slug. Ward, or Dr. Mustache Love ... So why do you invest time or energy in this film? Where there is no sympathy for the characters, there is no reason to worry about it. Not to mention the terrible cinematography that looked like they were making a film through urine, and the special effects of bats for five cents, many of which seemed like pieces of paper thrown into a fan to simulate bat flying. Not the worst movie I've ever seen on MST3K, but definitely there in the lower ranks.
