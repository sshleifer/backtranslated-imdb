Of course, Flatley is not quite the perfect name for a dancer, but I think Michael really pushes the irony with this new name: “Feet of Flame” <br /> <br /> No one really can not recommend retired (and obviously ill) Flatley. <br /> <br /> I can add that, like the sick London crowd (as described below), I also enthusiastically perceive him as his last live performance. <br /> <br /> “Hinting that this may be his last live performance, Flatley is inspired by the London crowd.” ~ Perry Seibert, all movie guide
