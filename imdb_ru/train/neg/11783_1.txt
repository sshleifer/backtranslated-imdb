What a crappy movie! The worst of the worst! This film is as interesting as the dead slug. Worthless actors, stupid conspiracy. Who wrote this script ?! Was there ever a script for this stupid movie, or did the director just accidentally press the record button on his camera, and then decided to make a movie along the way? Is it a children's film, a comedy or what? The younger brother of my friends is in sixth grade, and he and his classmates have just made an amateur film for their school project, which surpassed this disgusting film. This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life! There is no excuse for this film!
