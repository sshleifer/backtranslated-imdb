Ha, boy, it was a real test to go through. The DVD case shows a Tom Hanks mug, and this is the only reason anyone buys it. He looks about forty on the box, however, the film was shot in 1982, so he still has a desire to make him “Best Friends” and, of course, forty pounds lighter. The plot concerns a game like Dungeons and Dragons, in which Hanks and his three friends play, and Hanks thinks that all this is real. Chris Makepeace is a genius boy named JJ, and the best thing about the film is that he wears a string of funny hats. Oooh, look, he has a yellow helmet with a tuxedo! Now he is dressed as a pilot of the First World War! It was a really awful movie, but in a bad way. A group of veterinarians appears mainly as parents of children. There is Ann (I’m honey West, damn it!) Francis and Louise Sorel, who actually look pretty hot. Murray Hamilton, the mayor of Jaws, has the ungrateful role of a policeman. Wendy Crewson, a love interest in Hanks and the blonde, whom I have never seen before or after. There is some thick music here and there, and there is no tension, no danger, no excitement in it. There is a monster that only Hanks can see, because he, you know, is crazy. The monster is played by the late great Kevin Peter Hall, he is a Predator fame. My friend pulled it out of the old discount bin at MallWart and advised me to throw it in the bin without even looking at it, so naturally I had to see if it was as bad as all that. It was. The night before I watched Apollo 13, and after that this film was a shock. Do yourself a favor and leave it in the trash. Oh, yes, after Hanks nearly jumped out of one of the towers of the World Trade Center because of his delusion, he goes home to recover, and his friends visit him. Hanks' mother, drunk Vera Miles, says that now he is walking together beautifully, but when they go down to the lake to visit him in their tennis clothes, he is crazy more than ever. the end
