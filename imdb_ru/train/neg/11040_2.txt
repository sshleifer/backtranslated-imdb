You need to watch this show once to see them all, the formula is the same in every episode. Jim does something in his own way that he has in mind, but he grieves his wife, in the end she learns that what he did was for her, she caressed his cheek and smiled grimly until he looks shyly. In fact, the storylines are so unconvincing and formal that now I will try to make one hit. <br /> <br /> The Valentine's Pay episode <br /> <br /> Jims' wife notices that all Jim's weekly pay has disappeared, then he explains to her that he lost her at the casino. She screams and leaves the house, complaining how terrible he is. Then on Valentine's Day, he appears in a limousine with tickets to the ball (and therefore explains the missing salary). She understands “His” mistake and the usual “Oh Jim, you're so cute.” End <br /> <br /> Another obvious point is the fact that the character of Jims is based on Homer Simpson, who as a cartoon character can get away with the militant and ignorant when it is done with People. not a job, and Jim just comes in as an arrogant self-centered jerk. <br /> <br /> IMO, the only reason this is possible is simply because there are a lot of us now from the point of view of people with televisions, these days you could have a show about a person who isolates walls, and you would get an audience. <br /> <br /> “Two and a half people,” on the other hand, are fantastic and funny.
