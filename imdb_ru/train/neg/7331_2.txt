this film was clearly made poorly and in a hurry. I understand that funding for any such film is hard to find. However, if there were some original content in the plot, someone would see that he received the necessary funding, this is not the case, and films like this are not needed by themselves and have no meaning in existence. The plot for this film was made and made better, I might add, many times before. There is no reason to make a film that has no chance to compete with others. My computer told me that I needed at least ten lines to send my comment, so the following lines are just bulls to fill the gap. In my opinion, nothing more needs to be said about this film. what I have said is enough, and if you have spent enough time reading this review, then for God's sake, do not spend more time watching this movie. The only exception to this is if you are the kind of person who likes to watch crappy movies that are broadcast on the women's entertainment network at 2 am, in this case, look what interests me.
