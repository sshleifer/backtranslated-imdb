I could not relate to this film. It attracted me neither intellectually, nor emotionally, nor aesthetically. The dialogue was very tight and unappealing. I could not contact and therefore take care of any characters, and it is difficult for me to find a lot of positive things to say about it. <br /> <br /> I read it in order to understand this properly, you need to be familiar with some of the darker aspects of Catholic theology. I recognize that as an atheist, I’m probably not familiar with many of the subtleties of Catholicism, but I also saw a lot of films about religious issues that touched me, because their themes are still universal for the human condition and don’t rely on special knowledge or beliefs.
