If the director wanted the audience not to like the title character, everything would be fine, but I know that there is no such thing as a Hollywood director who would criticize the American movement for Marxism of the 60s, especially not the director from the 70s. There is so much idiotic dialogue going on here that sometimes I ask myself if Iâ€™m not really watching a comedy. You will not be guilty, thinking that this is a satire ?? so naive is the movie. Spacek was in her role in the films for the left, which leads me to the obvious, inevitable conclusion that the redhead bang is one of those Hollywood liberal morons. But I mean, isn't everything? Nice tits, but with ** t for brains.
