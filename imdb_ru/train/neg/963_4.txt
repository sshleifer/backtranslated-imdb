"Chances" is a big mistake to see. You might know the director Emil Ardolino from Dirty Dancing and Sister Act and expect something funny from him. But I think I disappointed you. He made a very, very bad movie. <br /> <br /> According to the story, Christopher MacDonald dies to return as a child. The child grows up Robert Downey Jr., and the younger returns to his former hometown, where she meets his former daughter Mary Stuart Masterson (difficult, huh?). <br /> <br /> They fall in love with each other. Then comes the younger ex-wife Cybill Shepard, and the youngest also falls in love with her. I think I don't even need to mention that she loves Ryan O'Neill. <br /> <br /> In one of his first roles, Robert Downey Jr. is at the worst. He copies Michael J. Fox. <br /> <br /> After Shepard from "Moonlight" proves that she is not suitable for filming a movie. <br /> <br /> In any case, this unfunny comedy can only be used for one thing: as an antidote to insomnia.
