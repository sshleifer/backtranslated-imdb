First three words: READ THE BOOK! In fact, guys - this demonstrates the difficulty of genuinely performing esoteric questions. I loved the book and was completely disappointed with the film. It was funny, with half a heart and a bad story. Roman - first! - not meant to focus on adventure! This is just the environment. In the film, the emphasis shifted to this, and the message faded into the background! In addition, the visual effects, to show the energy of all living things and the clarification of events at the end, were stingy! They screwed up! ... I will never watch it again!
