Nick Millard, he is Nick Phillips, should have been left alone when he made “Criminally Insane” 10 years before the release of this terrible waste of time and effort. The fact that the original “Criminal Frenzy” lasted less than an hour should have told him that he probably milked this storyline for everything he was going to extract from it ... but instead he decided to use TONS of footage from the original in this, also, up to the reuse of the original opening credit sequence! Unfortunately, the return of the rapidly aging Priscilla Alden did not save this. What a small part of the original shooting was in this film looks like it was taken from a rented handheld video camera! If this film were worth more than $ 100, I would be very surprised, and I would also be surprised if it came close to this amount! Avoid this and see the original!
