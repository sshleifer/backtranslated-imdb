<br /> <br /> As usual, I was really looking forward to a new TV / movie on my favorite topic - making a good transition from the * strangely familiar * documentary about Kursk or Stalingrad on the History channel. <br /> I eagerly waited for Pearl Harbor and the enemy at the Gate - but was rudely brought down to the ground because of the awareness of the evil, stupid and offensive power of Hollywood - and his ability to waste an absolute state on a trip. <br /> <br /> So, I was again inspired by the “Rising of Evil”, especially when I heard that Ian Kershaw had participated in it, since I enjoyed his books. I can understand why he left. <br /> <br /> I quote some guy responsible for this garbage: <br /> <br /> “The book of Kershaw was an academic part,” he said. “It was very dry. We needed more incidents. ” <br /> <br /> Incidents? Are they completely nuts? It’s not that Hitler’s life without an “incident” - yes, Hitler Kershaw’s two voluminous biographies were long and detailed, but they had to be like that. <br /> <br /> The “Revival of Evil” thesis looks like this: <br /> <br /> Hitler was a very bad person - no, he was a VERY bad person who hated Jews, in case you miss it , we will emphasize this fact on EVERY scene in the film. <br /> <br /> There was no effort to try to explain the mood of the time, and why Hitler might have adopted the views and strategies he made. Needless to say - unlike the generally excellent 'Nazis - Warning from History' - this film did not mention the fact that almost all the leaders of the Munich uprising were Jews, and this may have changed his views on this topic. - and its axiomatic connection between Jews and Bolshevism is an absolutely important aspect for understanding most of the Nazi era. <br /> <br /> But there wasn’t much understanding that needed to be made - the filmmakers weren’t going to go there, so we just got everything we knew about anyway. Of course, we do not understand the surprising fact to which Kershaw refers when Hitler briefly became a socialist / communist immediately after the First World War. This, of course, would be too difficult for the film, and even could distract from the relentless mantra "he was very bad," which is continuously heard. <br /> <br /> We know that he was a bad person. However, we also know that he was a fascinating figure both as a public speaker and in more private situations. He could be polite and even sympathetic, and, of course, supported some attitudes, such as vegetarianism, anti-alcohol and smoking, which many Guardian readers could accept. He also loved animals, and therefore this completely invented dog whipping scene was so absurd. <br /> <br /> In addition, according to all the reviews that I saw, he was a brave soldier in the First World War. Although we saw him with his Iron Cross, we never saw how he won it (of course, there was no courage in the script). We also have no idea why he was so excited about his military experience, while Sassoon, Owen, Brooke, Remarque and many others found it so disgusting. And again, as in the paragraph above on the connection between Jews and Bolsheviks, this is vital for any understanding of the subject. Why does he love war so much? Why did he think it was always a good idea, despite massive evidence to the contrary? Why he did not care about his colleagues who died? Or maybe he did it - but still made the wrong conclusions. <br /> <br /> There was nothing interesting about this movie either. <br /> <br /> How often they are These days, the film is a classic example of how to “make the story relevant to the present” and come up with something new or leave clumsy facts to fit the “real” that too often means the least The common denominator you are in does not trust your audience an inch, so you just pounce on their throats, knowing (unfortunately, correctly) that you always get away with it, because there are so many stupid fools in the world. <br /> <br /> History is what makes us relate to the past and see how it colors our present, for better and for worse. This rubbish was a great opportunity, lost again. They spent millions on it, and the places and the big scenes were impressive, but they didn’t tell us anything, which we didn’t know, and didn’t contribute to an understanding of this dark period in the history of mankind. <br /> <br /> WT
