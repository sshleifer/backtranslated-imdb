I read that "The Girl in My Soup" came out during the low period of Peter Sellers. Watching the movie, I'm not surprised. In the film, almost nothing happens. Apparently, the presence of Sellers and Goldie Hawn should help the film; this is not true. The whole movie seems like they just accidentally shot what happened without writing anything. I may not have seen every movie about middle-aged and elderly people trying to become hippies, but this film gives such films quite a bad name. <br /> <br /> In general, both the Sellers and Hawn have done better films than this, so donâ€™t waste your time on this. Pretty useless.
