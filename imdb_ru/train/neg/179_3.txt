Returning to the Lake Cabin was just ... not enough. He must have had a very low budget, because a decent amount of film had to be filmed on a regular video camera. So, in the same scene - you will have several shots with the quality of the movie And simple shots from the camcorder. It makes for a very strange mixture! I think they should have found a SOME way not to make a “home video” effect! <br /> <br /> I think it's worth seeing if you saw the original CBTL, because then you can compare and see the differences. But if you have not seen the original CBTL .... you will never want to see it if you see it first! This may seem too silly and will distract you from taking care of the original.
