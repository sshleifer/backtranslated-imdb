Weak plot, predictable violence, only semi interesting characters. As a writer (also one of the stars?) I made up my own mistakes and added incredible fantasies about drugs and murders to make him “hot.” From predictable rap and house soundtrack to family conflicts - it acts badly, is stereotypical, and ultimately terribly boring. Even the title was made before - IMDb lists FIVE films with the same name, released in 2007-2008! <br /> <br /> Note. Saw it on Showtime, which gives a brief overview of one of the other films. I was halfway there before I realized that no one was a secret policeman. Even a different stereotype would make it interesting if it happened.
