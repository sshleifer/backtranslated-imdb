This animated movie "Inspector Gadget" is pretty flimsy. The story is very weak and there is little action in it. Most characters have little to do. The film is a little interesting at best, but in fact it’s not going anywhere and it’s pointless. This is watchable, but only fair and far from the caliber of an animated television show from the 80s. This is not a movie that has a replay, at least in my opinion. It's only about 74 minutes, including loans, so I think this is good. Unlike the TV show, the characters here are not worth it to root for them. In the series, you wanted Inspector Gadget to save the day, but who cares? In any case, this is just my opinion. For me, the Inspector The latest gadget case disappoints 3/10
