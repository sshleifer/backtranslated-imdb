I have to admit that I caught it several times on the US Network. There is something in this nonsense that makes me want to watch it when it's on. Yes, you are right about acting, a plot that only a seven-year-old child, etc. would like. But I can't help but feel sympathy for some actors. On the other hand, some of these actors have signed up for an even more horrible sequel.
