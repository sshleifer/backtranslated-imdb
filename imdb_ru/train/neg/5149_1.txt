This film is about a rape victim / comic book writer from New York who decides to run away from all this terrible glamor of a big city and move to a dirty, running little town where she finds shelter in a one-story dirt trailer in the middle of 12 go and nowhere. Citizens are mentally ill, but she also invites the insane to her trailer. Annoying is the fact that she has the ability to do absolutely the right thing to put herself in a dangerous circumstance after a dangerous circumstance. Speech d.B. Sweeney was a high school at best. He is one of those cute young actors with a sweet smile. Unfortunately, the career was not good, and Mother Nature was right in tow. To the previous commentator who said that the game was "so real", I agree. In fact, it did not work. The two main characters are really pathetic, weak and unable to make mature, healthy decisions. In short, this movie sucks like no other, take it off to make fun of it. Real crime scene? The brutal wood panel in the trailer is enough for ME to kill. And finally, she is an artist / writer, so she could not afford a double-wide trailer and something other than the sunny yellow Chevy Chevette for the love of God!
