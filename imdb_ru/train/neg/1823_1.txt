The character of Jack Black, Tim Dingman, "The Dreamer" in Envy, finds wealth and success in the idea of ​​an aerosol spray "Vapoorize", which when sprayed on dog droppings causes urine to disappear into the air. <br /> <br /> For a while I was hoping that Vapoorize was a real product, so I could spray it on this “stinky” film and make it disappear into the air. <br /> <br /> Although Envy is not the worst movie I have seen in the last 12 months (this honor is awarded to Cat in the Hat), he won the honor of the second second. <br /> <br /> Not funny, not sad, nothing. This "Stinkeroo" !!!!! <br /> <br /> 0.2 out of 10 !!
