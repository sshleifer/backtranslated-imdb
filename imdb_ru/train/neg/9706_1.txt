... and I actually gave him ZERO on my personal 1-10 scale. I have been visiting films since 1952 and have seen more than 1000 in the theater (I do not appreciate films that I see only on TV). This is the only film I've ever rated ZERO. <br /> <br /> My wife and I took our four children (then it was 15, 11, 8 and 6), and even the children thought it was terrible. Actually, it was my daughter (now she is 26) that warned me about this site (amazed that the film received a general rating of 4+). <br /> <br /> The animation of the dinosaurs at the time looked amateurish (and even worse in retrospect), the action (especially by Sean Young) is terrible, and the storyline is just silly. <br /> <br />
