I didn't expect much when I saw this at the Palm Springs festival this weekend. It was an alternative choice when two other films were sold out. And yet I gave hope. It sounded a bit like Bride and Prejudice (a guy from Los Angeles falls in love with Indian beauty, parental conflict, blah blah blah). B & P was not perfect, but it was a nice movie with a good laugh and nice characters. <br /> <br /> My Bollywood Bride had none of this. The game seemed unnatural and capable of quantity. The characters were so clich√© that the story seemed written by a freshman high school student. Technically, the sound really bothered me. It seemed that there was a lot of duplication of dialogue. I mean a lot. I know that sometimes it is necessary, but it sounded like half the movie was shot in the closet, and it was very distracting. <br /> <br /> Two stars are pretty generous.
