Normally, I would never rent such a movie, because you know it will be bad just by looking at the box. I made seven films at the same time, including The Nightmare on Elm Street 5, 6 and the New Nightmare of Wes Craven. Unfortunately, when I returned home, I found that the guy from the video store gave me the wrong record. In the box of Wes Craven's New Nightmare, I discovered this inconclusive film. <br /> <br /> This film is incredibly boring, a bad game and the plot does not make any sense. It's hard to write a good review, because I have no idea what the film is about. At the end of the film you have more questions than answers. <br /> <br /> In “Scale Max. Authorities from 1 to 10 ”I rate this movie: 1 <br /> <br /> PS I would like to correct the Corinthian’s review (right below mine). He says that Robert Englund takes off his underwear, rides a horse, and so on. The guy who did these things was Mahmood, who was played by Giuliano Mer, and not Robert Englund.
