I could not, in life, follow, understand or understand the story. As the story progresses, it also remains incomprehensible. I am going to guess and say that there was a problem with the plot / plot that was not solved. Producers will never be able to separate the many details that a novel or any novel has time and space to create from another idea that was supposed to make a film about a serial killer and the pursuit of a killer by the police. They ended up with too many things happening in the forbidden game time limit. Very bad, because they had a solid cast, a director who knows how to move on, and excellent cinematography. In fact, a well-made film that you can enjoy and relax for a couple of hours.
