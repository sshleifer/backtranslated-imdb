The first film of the actor, as a rule, you can afford to miss - often this is the first work where the lack of experience of the film for all the participants is really demonstrated, and this film is no exception. <br /> <br /> But worse than that, even by the standards of 1982, it is so bad, hysterically ridiculous. Filmed entirely in the Chicago area with a clearly small budget, most of the cast of the entire actor is tough, wooden and cartoon - a cross between a high school play and a poor public theater. The noise from the nearby movement often drowns out the dialogue, and the dialogue is really bad, very declarative, which looks like a forced and expedient, rather than natural and organic. The scenes are invented and changeable, and although the characters pass through the years, neither the children nor the adults ever get old. <br /> <br /> I truly believe that a Christian film can be made that will be acceptable to a large secular audience, but all too often the creators of such films are so focused on the “Message” or, in this case, on their own autobiographical ties to by a project that good filmmaking values ​​are discarded. (I’m sure it’s not by chance that the main character has the same name as the producer / director / editor - and the cast.) <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Michael Madsen was much more interesting - and more likely - to watch in his subsequent films. Such a career, of course, is not based on films like this.
