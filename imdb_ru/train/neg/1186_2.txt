Walerian Borowczyks La Bete (1975) was obviously perceived differently: some were shocked, some were shocked, others applauded courage. However, I’m completely untouched, I miss you and I can’t stop asking myself why displaying inconsistent, inconsistent images that vaguely revolve around a central theme is considered an intellectual journey. <br /> <br /> What is this movie about? Growing woman sexuality? I have seen great films on this subject, but this is not one of them. How can you try to portray the growing sexuality in a girl, at least not trying to characterize her as a person, and not only as a narrative device for sleeping (naked) animals. Where there are no characters, no learning of the characters. The woman pursued by the beast was not a teenager, the girl who has sex with the black butler (also called the beast?), Has grown very much in sexuality, so where is the sequence? Is this a movie about religion? If so, we will need a little more thematic material than a priest without functions, character, and charisma, but with a strong desire for two young boys. <br /> <br /> Are we talking about bestiality? The metaphorical sensation of the film prohibits any realistic study of bestiality, especially because realistic research requires realistic characters. So there is no real bestiality here. Some mythical beast and two priests are talking to each other about the sin of atrocity. Enough for a college essay on this topic? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Is it about sex? Is it about anything? I dont know. I only know that showing a shooting weapon does not make a film a war movie. Working with a topic should mean more than showing its own associations with this topic. <br /> <br /> Look at the controversy. Do not be afraid of bestiality, nude, ejaculation, masturbation and other things. Not me. Look at it the same way as any other story, and you may find that it is badly made, poorly edited, poorly worked, really badly written (well, some pictures are pretty good, and the main character is really beautiful girl) cerebral masturbation a director who thinks that hypnotic slow movement around the bush will make the story sensible. This is not true. It makes it boring.
