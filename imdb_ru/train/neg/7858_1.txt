I appreciate the need to hire unknowns for horror films of this kind, but they should at least hire some suitable actors. Especially the sergeant is guilty of using his monotone for the bulldozer on every line he has. But let's face it, the lines are not very important. In fact, there is no recognizable plot, so most of the writing includes the words f ** k, s ** t, m ***** f **** r and other various obscene expressions instead of the correct dialogue. <br /> <br /> “History” as it is, mainly consists of seemingly random blood and death, with a couple of unpleasant “surprises” that occur about 10 minutes after you will see exactly what is happening. it happens. Not only that, but there are some glaring gaps in the plot and continuity errors (why are they going there? He didn't have a weapon? Isn't he dead?) So the whole movie looks like it was cut by a few hours, which would be necessary to fix them. <br /> <br /> Another movie that just relies on blood and blood, not on real cinematic experience.
