Somewhere deep in this film is buried a half decent movie trying to go out. The only tracks are a few early scenes in Los Angeles (at the bar and at the cemetery), and then a couple of design works. As I said, buried very deep. One of the biggest problems that films face with the supernatural is how to make the characters react plausibly in unbelievable situations. Annie Mtsenroâ€™s reaction to the fact that she was told that her sister (presumably Dee Wallace from the first film) is (was?) A morph, if I recall, on the model; "Oh really?". Not one of the best answers to this challenge. Nesekviteriry continue when the story moves to Tranvenel in search of Stirba (presumably self-styled) "The Werewolf Queen". Like Stirba, Sybil Danning are two of the best things in the film. Yes, even better than a werewolf group sex scene, Reb Brown's acting skills and weird werewolf-looking monkey costumes. The final credits have acquired a minor status of a legend and are available in all their glory (at least until the censor finds them) on Youtube. Check them out to see why, and remember that the whole movie has about the same amount of meaning. If you were lucky enough to catch it on American television, the credits were edited to replace Danning's endlessly repetitive snapshot, tearing her from the top with another, endlessly repetitive snapshot of her tearing raincoat, only this time she has some kind of top down, This is something sort of absurd, cherry on top that defies satire.
