Beverly Festoon was born at the wrong time. She was ahead of her time and brought strength and grace even to such unfortunate films as Corman films in which she starred. In Strelka, she is the wife of the city sheriff. He is offended, so she takes over his job to pursue his killers. It is much better than the material with which it works. The film is gray, untidy and mostly boring. Traces of some (unintentional) humor, tire tracks, people running behind one building are suddenly appearing in front of another (I heard of false fronts, but it's funny!), And the really stupid storyline of the recently widowed Sheriff fell in love with kill her. Even if she had not loved her husband, only a week or two had passed since his death! And in the end, she eventually shot the guy to death. No luck with men, this one. <br /> <br /> The villain of this work is another woman, the owner of the salon. She plans to buy a lot of land in case the railway passes and makes it rich. Her plan of action, if he doesnâ€™t do this, is pretty lame - she will just steal from the city as much as he can and jump. Hell, it's only she and her mercenary pistol at the end against the whole city. Are you telling me that these people are not armed? Look at what happened in the real cities of the Old West, when bank robbers came to rob a bank, and then were bombarded by a hail of bullets by armed and dangerous urban people. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of senseless conversations and trips, interspersed with several lame shots. The final is as gloomy as usual in the Corman film, although, thank God, he lacks the moral proselytizing at the end, which was in "He Conquered the World." The sheriff passes his badge to Sam Bass and leaves for sunset, although the film was so gray that you never saw the sun.
