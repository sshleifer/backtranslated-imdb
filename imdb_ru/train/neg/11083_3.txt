This film was late at night when I saw it. It was interesting from the very beginning, but did not convince me as a whole. I am not a fan of Tyson. In fact, I donâ€™t like boxing at all. It is barbaric, obscene and two-faced (for society) that some get paid for beating each other. <br /> <br /> However, I felt that the beginning of the film was fine. The actors are fine, especially George Scott (like Cus D'Amato). I do not know how reliable the film is. I have not read books or books about boxing or Tyson. I don't know anything about the person, but it was quite interesting. <br /> <br /> When the film continued, I felt that he had lost a bit of his charm, and I also lost interest. Although I managed not to fall asleep, but the last hour was not good enough.
