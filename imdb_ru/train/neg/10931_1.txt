I went to see this film with rather low expectations, believing that it would be a good piece of fluff. Unfortunately, it was not even the case. I could barely watch a movie, not wanting to leave. I went with my two children (aged 10 and 13), and even they kept asking: “How many more?” After holding out until the end, I just kept wondering who would endorse this scenario. Even reliable Fred Willard could not save the banal dialogue, jokes about the state and the banal conspiracy. I would suggest that someone who wrote and shot this film (I use this term fluently) should take an online scripting lesson or go to a local college to study the film. At the very least, there are many books on directing, screen writing and film production that will teach them something about structure, plot, dialogue and rhythm.
