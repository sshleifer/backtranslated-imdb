I really hate most doomsday movies. They show that exhausted Hollywood people think about the rest of the world, and they clearly think that we are a bunch of sadistic idiots (or at least watching how sadistic idiots react to things in a funny way). I have been to Los Angeles many times, I have a family that works in show business, and I just want to say that these are the “last” people we should look for in order to test reality. Some films about disasters, at least, paint a clever picture: “Children of Men”, 12 “Monkeys”, but usually it’s just “people will do everything to survive, everything is dark, sad and aimless, we all should be ashamed of ourselves . /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of ​​a story that tells you how to throw away the social order and experience the courage of people in the face of horror, and I believe that some people will act like this film. but sadistic idiots aside, I seriously doubt that society would simply dissolve in every person for itself, it is simply insulting.
