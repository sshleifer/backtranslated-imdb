I watched an early preview of this film, and I hope they have time to edit it in any way possible to improve it before it comes out on August 3rd. It is played by Andy Samberg from "Saturday Evening Live" as "Hot" Rod Kimble. He plays a teenager in a small town who wants to become a gimmick like his late father. When we meet him, he jumps on his scooter with a mail truck, yes, a scooter, and almost does it. It would be worthy of the film "Jackass", if he honestly did not try to do it. Isla Fisher plays Denise a little older and much more mature neighbor. It seems that she likes Rod enough to join his "team". Jorma Taccone (also SNL) plays her half-brother Kevin, who records tricks with a video camera. Sissy Spacek plays Rod's mom, Marie. She remarried to Frank Powell, played by Ian McShane. Frank is a real tough guy who likes to beat Rod in fights. It is clear that Rod does not deserve the respect of Frank, until he can beat him. We learn that Frank needs $ 50,000. a heart transplant, and Rod intends to raise money only so that he “can beat his ass,” as soon as he is healed, and prove himself to be human. A long descent from the mountain side convinces Rhoda to "become big" on one trick. Rod is going to get the initial money by charging for performing tricks that would make you cringe if you saw them in real life. As a human torch - at children's birthday. At the show were those who managed to laugh at most of the tricks. At that moment, when all hope and money is lost, a sponsor appears who saves the day, taking 15 school buses that Rod wants to jump. He receives exclusive broadcasting rights and sets up phone lines for donations. Rod gets a new outfit and a real motorcycle. The whole city turns out, and the world is configured. Does he jump? Does he get a girlfriend? They raise 50 thousand dollars? Rod got his ass from Rod? Wait until this 90-minute film goes on video to find out.
