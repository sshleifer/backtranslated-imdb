At the end of The Heat of the Dragon, all I could think about was why I bothered to watch it all. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film is interesting, and this, like Maggie Q, attracted me. to the film first. But was I ever disappointed. Writer Daniel Lee cannot hold a candle in front of people like John Woo, Ringo Lam and Corey Yuen. <br /> <br /> This has to be one of the most annoying movies I've ever seen. Lee is so passionate about his visual style — and I use this phrase incredibly loosely — that he fills the film with completely unnecessary black-and-white frames, freeze-frames, slow-motion shots, fast-motion shots, and other visual nonsense. I believe he did all this to make up for the absence of a good story or dialogue. <br /> <br /> The action scene is not special and unfolds, like some kind of downloaded music video, more than anything else. There is little to take care of any of the characters - including two supposedly professional snipers who could not hit the wide side of the barn from the inside! - who is then laden with some of the most amusing dialogues that I have seen in one of these Hong Kong militants. <br /> <br /> The plot is devoid of any twists and turns — from the initial setup everything unfolds in a predictable fashion — and Lee feels the need to constantly remind us of past character stories in case we don’t get it the first few times. This is terrible amateur writing and filmmaking, and it wastes the talents of Sammo Hung, Michael Bean and Maggie V. Although, frankly, it's hard for me to remember that Bean is shot in any good movie that was not made by James Cameron. <br /> <br /> If you're really tuned to the great Hong Kong action movie, you'd better stick to some of the staples — John Woo's Killer (1989) and Hard Boot (1992), City on Fire Ringo Lam (1987 ), which Quentin Tarantino stole for Reservoir Dogs (1992), or his remake "Point Blank" (1967), "Full Contact" (1992). Or even watch “So Close” by Yuen (2002), an extremely interesting, but ridiculous movie with popcorn. And there is always a terrific French police fighter "The Nest" (2002). <br /> <br /> True, most, if not all, are a bit over the top, but these were films that remain exciting, exciting and even stressful. They have characters that we care about and amazing action sequences. <br /> <br /> “The heat of the dragon,” on the other hand, is simply terribly mediocre. The problem is that Lee didn’t take off a bad fighter, he did boring.
