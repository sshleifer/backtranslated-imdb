Most recently, I was so carried away and looking forward to this film, that I almost had to see it. Well, having just seen it today, the rating of 5.8 is quite understandable. I think that if you foresee something so big that it becomes an urgent need, it turns out that it is not worth it. <br /> <br /> Of course, The Hills Have Eyes 2 has its moments. He has a very cool and well-developed storyline that goes well with the product itself, but all this indulges itself so much that it becomes so difficult to follow. And if not for the production of Wes Craven in this film, it would have nothing to do with the original remake. <br /> <br /> But all this makes you think: "Should it be horror or comedy?" because there are a lot of ridiculous, randomly located moments of jumping and stupid liners (that is, “You have a hand in shit!” or “You fucking fucking fool! I'll kill you all bastard sons b ** tch!”) and acting skills ( God doesn't even remind me how bad everything was. <br /> <br /> STORYLINE: (this part contains spoilers, be careful!) The film begins with the fact that a woman gives birth to a mutant child (oo la la!), But then the screen turns black with a film title and a monologue. Then we go to this office, where the mannequins of war veterans are randomly placed. m, that this is for this one scientist, tracking people searching for mutants. The box for tracking audio channels has disappeared and everyone is dying! After this opening of the tone setting, you expect more. <br /> <br /> Then we go to this team training military recruits in Baghdad. As the captain shows them "Good work with stupidity", their last training day is in New Mexico, the wilderness where the family in the last THHE stayed because they were stuck using. While in training, things are not going well, people are dying, and ... do I need to tell you more? Because now I have the attention of a goldfish, just forcing myself to sit here and print it. <br /> <br /> In THHE2, the fact that it simply does not work is wrong. There are no memories here, and the final is pretty safe ... but with a twist! This is stupid. I’m almost sure that Ultra Super Director's Cut with a holographic cover and a ticket for The Hills Have Eyes 3 will show all its alternative endings, but at the moment I’m not sure if I care. <br /> <br /> So, if you loved the first OH, so much that it is almost no sin not to see it, then by all means see it. But if still, then avoid at all costs. This is for your own good. <br /> <br /> 3/10
