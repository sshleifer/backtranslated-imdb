When I first saw this film, I thought it would be a good sasquatch film. Usually, when you have movies of this type, there is usually ONE sasquatch, but what is that? 7 or 10 of them? It was good to act, the plot was fine, I liked the scenes where the sasquot kills the first few victims, very good camera work. I expected it to be a terrible movie, but it was very small. This film was much better than Sasquatch. The SCI-FI channel really needs to do more sasquatch movies, I mean, I really liked Sasquatch Mountain, Abominibal was not good, the one I watch is fine, but the Sasquatch movie was not, but I donâ€™t see it that way let me get back on track. This film is good for a rainy Saturday, but not for any other occasion.
