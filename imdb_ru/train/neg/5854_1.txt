I just watched this movie on Flix after a timer recording. I grew up watching F Troop, and Wrangler Jane had serious problems, so I was shocked, literally shocked, when after watching this film I learned that the degenerate nurse killer was Melody Patterson, who looks pretty good, but looks completely otherwise, and unfortunately badly photographed. I would never have guessed that it was she for a million years. What the hell is she doing in that picture? I agree with the guys that the film lacks what it promotes. No sex, no blood, no teasing. It is also a remake of the Atomic Brain, called a monster (1964 or so). Most of the action is tedious; the protagonist spends an enormous amount of time running around the doctor’s lunatic asylum in the basement and in the neighborhood as a whole, or scared by the cops, it’s all boring and fills the time. Now, if the Italians had done this, half the film would have been an improvised blade / Uncle Ernest / Jack Elam, caressing naked unconscious girls. But you only get it in 20 seconds.
