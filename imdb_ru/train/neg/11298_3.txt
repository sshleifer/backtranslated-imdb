This is a direct continuation of The Mummy's Hands (1940), because the main character Stephen Banning (played by Dick Vorand) is now thirty years older and links the story (using archival materials) to his son's fiancé. There are only two unusual aspects to the film: Banning’s early death and Turhan Bey’s presence. <br /> <br /> Lon Cheney, like the mummy of Haris, receives the highest score, although, given the nature of his role, he no longer needs to do anything but limp or touch his hands. In his presence there is nothing terrible, except for his attempt to lead the groom Isobel (Alice Knox). Dick Foran gets a second count, but he gets killed in the first fifteen minutes! We would have to wait until Psycho (1960), when the main character (Janet Lee) dies long before the end of the film! Banning's boyfriend from the first film, baby Jenson (now Henson), appears a little later, looks much, much older and does not do the comics that he did in the original. Hard to believe that this is the same actor! Unfortunately, this great acting job is in vain, because Haris killed him after two short scenes. Then it came to the son of Banning John (who plays beat player John Hubbard) to track the chase in the cemetery - NO! The sheriff leads a mob with a torch to Banning's house to burn him and kill the mummy. Sounds familiar? <br /> <br /> Turhan Bey is presented to the audience as a new high priest Mehmet Bey, who takes care of the tan leaves and serves them to the charis. With his "exotic" voice and appearance, it is very unfortunate that he is so easy to kill. In the best film, “Baby,” claimed responsibility for tracking the mummy of the von Helsing type, with the last decisive battle with him and Mehmet Bay. But instead, we have a pedestrian paraphrasing of various scenes from previous Universal horror films, created by hack Griffin Jay, who wrote many other Universal works, although he also did Don Winslow from the Navy (1942) and also Don Don Winslow from the Coast Guard '(1943), in which Alice Knox also participated. <br /> <br /> Alice Knox played Ann Howe in six films by Joe Palouka (1946-1949) and, of course, Turhan Bey with 43 films. and television captions, are great in the title role of "Amazing Dr. X" (1948). <br /> <br /> Cinematography is much darker and more atmospheric (with a lot of noisy shadows in the sheriff’s office) than the first film about the mummy “Haris”, but little that is interesting or exciting. <br /> <br /> I will give him 3.
