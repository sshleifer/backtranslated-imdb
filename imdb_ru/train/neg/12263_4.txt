Watching this movie, as I just did in Turner Classic (in which it is called “Dangerous Woman”), can only increase your rating of the 1941 Bogart-Astor version. Ricardo Cortez must have gotten money from a grin. I hope he remembers his dentist and his seller Brylcreem; they made him the actor he was. Women are fine, but not better than that. Well, Una Merkel is a little better. More interesting are the “original” Joel Cairo and Mr. Guttman, who competently perform with many of the individual ticks, but almost nothing of the setter-changing atmosphere of their successors in the roles, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor somehow surpassed the essence of their characters in the remake; here Sam Spade and Ruth Wonderley (!) cannot. <br /> <br /> This film does not really stink; he lies there, like a big piece of ham. Its main value today is a reminder that such great films as The Falcon of 41 years do not just happen. On a scale from 1 to 10, I rate it 4, mainly for working with the camera and supporting players.
