After a rather long, partly uneven naked shower scene, we go to the races for this Blair Witch Project, a horror film about three girlfriends who decided to go to a deserted hut in the depths of the forest to get away from their hectic lives for girls. Weekend and smoking marijuana They meet two guys who seem friendly enough, so they drink and tell ghost stories, until at the end of the movie some of them are gone. <br /> <br /> This is a rather slow movie with unnecessary stretching of the unknown. Scenes, a bad game cannot carry countless scenes where nothing happens except a senseless joke, and the film as a whole is nonsense, deadly boring nonsense in this. Nothing happens until the last half hour, and when it happened, I was numb to really take care. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Ashley Totin shows T & A; Evie Lutski is briefly topless; and Jennifer Hart is showing her correct chest. <br /> <br /> My rating is: D
