OK. A good film making, if it were in the original script. BUT THIS IS NOT NECESSARY! <br /> <br /> What part of Haggard’s “directors, directors, and writers” introduction from Haggard’s introduction didn’t understand women in this story except Fulata and Gaguly? I mean, it's pretty simple English. I figured it out at 10 years old! The beauty of KSM is that it contains a fascinating description of three different worlds, colonial Africa, the inexorable desert and Kuquanaland, a hidden and isolated kingdom. This should be more than enough for even the most mediocre manufacturers. But, ohhhhhhhhhhhhh, they should throw "romance" at him. Pathetic. Offer to all your poor souls who really thought it would be close to the book. Drop it. Until imitator Peter Jackson appears and “does everything right,” you can continue to re-read the book. By the way, there is a book of sequels (actually a pre-quel) called Allan's wife. This provides the basis for the Quatermain story. It's a little creepy, but good.
