I gave it more than 1 because I really thought that there were some moral lessons in this story, and this caused some thought and comment from my wife and me. The game and the dialogue were mediocre, and I must admit that I came out feeling that I had been beaten on the head by God, by this God, and Christ is our savior. The film and storyline did not need this. If you, like me, are a convalescent Catholic or Christian, avoid it, it will make you nauseous. The film well demonstrated the fine line between a good citizen and how someone could become a potential stalker focused on what could be.
