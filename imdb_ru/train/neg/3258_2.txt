DOC SAVAGE: THE BRONZE MAN (1 out of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> A horrible, horrible movie ... based on a series of magazines / paperback books by Lester Dent / Kenneth Robson ... about superheroes and hero of 30s his and his five assistants, all experts in a particular field of activity, which allows them to fight evil. It was a pretty funny show ... but it was fun to read when I was a teenager. I knew they made a version of the movie in the 70s, starring Ron (Tarzan) Eli ... but I never had the opportunity to see it. He never played in theaters where I lived, and never appeared on TV. Now that I finally saw the movie, I can understand why. The plot and characters are never taken seriously ... it's all mocking and indecent ... kind of like the old Batman series ... only without being funny ... or having some kind of visual effect. flair. Corny dialogue, cheese special effects, stupid stereotypes, obscene fighters and bad, bad behavior. In fact, I find it a little awesome in my own badness ... what could they think of? It was rumored that Arnold Schwarzenegger was filmed in a modern remake ... but I don't think it would have turned out much better.
