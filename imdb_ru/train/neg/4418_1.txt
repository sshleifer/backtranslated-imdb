This is a film that requires some digestion. On the one hand, we are offered a tough outer shell, a story that not only leads the Catholic Church, but does it stupidly and ignorantly. On the inner layer, we are offered a history of orthodoxy over ortopraxis, and what happens when people blindly follow faith, which they should not understand. <br /> <br /> At first glance it turned out that this was supposed to be a comedy. If so, then Mr. Durango needs to open the dictionary, because he clearly does not know the meaning of this word. The jokes are pale; humor awkward and poorly delivered. In particular, Mrs. Keaton has disappointing and unsurpassed figures, much lower than her days, Annie Hall and the Sleepers. Jennifer Tilly is once again a model of rage, with her piercing voice and aching style. All this could have been forgiven if it had not been for the last 20 minutes of this film, which, obviously, was a controversial game made in 1981 <br /> <br /> *** Beware, spoilers are ahead *** <br /> <br /> Everything begins with the appearance of four former students of sister Maria Ignatius (by the way, Ignatius is a male name, and the nun will not accept him after her vows under any circumstances simply because of this fact). just to show you how much tireless research went into the project from the very beginning.) When they all recognize that they do not correspond to the teachings of the church, the sister begins to become irrational and insults them in the way the audience does. I believe she was in the distant past, when she was in banal, too pronounced memories in sepia. When one of them confesses that he made two abortions, the nun becomes even more insulting until the student pulls out a gun. Taking her away from her, the nun kills a student, allegedly for self-defense. She then starts screaming, killing a former gay student because of his sins. The last shot is a dead student, lying in the pose of Christ, when the shadow of the cross hangs over it. Can you say "heavy hands"? I knew you could! <br /> <br /> I know that abusive nuns were in the past, and I know that as a result, many people suffered emotional harm, but these images burn in our throats in almost every other picture of this movie crash . I heard from a writer and director that this is a film about hysteria and why one should not adhere to Orthodoxy as religiously as a pun. This explanation is hard to swallow, nevertheless, simply because we are never given an authoritative point of view that is not in any way inclined against the Catholic faith. This film is just an anti-Catholic joke, which in the name of justice and equality is mean-spirited and hateful. <br /> <br /> This is a film that I would recommend to a Catholic, namely, to wake him or her the reality of the cynicism and ignorance they face today. If it was “Rabbi Ray explains all this” or “Imam Mohammed explains all this,” there would be turmoil on the streets, and Showtime would lose all of its subscriptions. But, unfortunately, since this film amazes what is considered the majority, it is accepted and even applauded by those who hold the same evil point of view. <br /> <br /> I certainly hope that every participant in this cast is a practicing Catholic, so not only ignorance led them to make this film. <br /> <br /> I give him 1.5 stars out of 5, not because of his offensive nature, but because it was poorly written, badly directed and just a bad movie in general. Don't even waste your time.
