"It could mean the end of the white race!" the general gasps as a dozen indigenous zombies roam the battlefields of Europe during the "Great War." The expedition is sent to the long-lost, backward-designed city of Kennif-Angor to stop such things and keep the battlefields clean so that decent honest white people kill each other in tens of thousands. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to say when people in this film are zombies or not, because the acting is so wooden. Even by the standards of 1936, this film is bad. From the previous decade. It seems that it came out of the correspondence textbook "How to act" <br /> <br /> ------------- Chapter three: Emotions ------- --------- <br /> <br /> "How to express fear and disgust (woman) Squeeze both fists. Put the fist of one hand in your heart. Open your mouth to scream. Put the other fist with your palm out, Hold for 10 seconds longer than you are comfortable , then quickly turn your head 90 degrees from the direction of the hated object and sob. " <br /> <br /> "How to get a complicated, highly emotionally charged scene with a former groom explaining your love for someone else. DO NOT make eye contact. Do not move. Do not show any emotions. Do not overdo with your eyes reading the lines from the studio wall. "To give us a break from the lead role, the director slyly interrupts long pauses, in which nothing happens, except that the film continues to pass through the projectors. Thus, the story is completed in 35 minutes to 60 minutes. <br /> <br /> Zombie rebellion when it comes is so slow! Freed from mental slavery, the armies of the former zombie minions turn to their former master, slowly climbing the hill, and then knocking on the door a little and breaking the window. "Yes ... let's ... oh, I don't know, yes. Let's take it, grrr. Frankenstein must be destroyed â€” manana." (although I just discovered some hidden symbolism. Jagger was shot by the Aborigines as a kind of ironic counterpoint to all the natives who were shot by the Germans at the beginning of the film. See, even the oppressed natives don't want the End of the White Race!) call it) through the swamp projected back is ridiculous and only the entrance price is worth. Roy D'Arcy has a hell of a time, but he is completely useless, like Colonel Mazovia. <br /> <br /> In this film there is one interesting point. Cute little montage of zombie natives and white actors who fell under the spell of evil eyes. face behind, go over each other. This works, although in every close-up there is a strange little splash, as if a frame were cut out. I suppose it should be Neg Cutters footage between the attenuations. <br /> <br /> It is best to look with friends and in a silly mood.
