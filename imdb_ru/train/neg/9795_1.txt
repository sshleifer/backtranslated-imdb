C'mon, what's the deal with this show, Power Rangers? I always felt that the show, which was originally transferred from Japan in better shape, took what was great in Japan and turned into one of the most ridiculous and meaningless excuses in the history of toy merchandising! There is absolutely no point in this show. <br /> <br /> Bad haircuts, bad suits, earrings, etc. Show that it was absurd in the 1990s - from two idiots, Balka and Skull, to "duhs", from the main composition, Jason Trini, Tommy, Kimberly, Billy and Zack, I just want to say one thing: GIVE ME A BREAKTHROUGH! <br /> <br /> Saban brought it from Japan, and then from Disney bought the rights to this show about five years ago. <br /> <br /> Now the public has to transfer replays of this show on Disney Channel and the like. <br /> <br /> All I can say once again is to give me a break!
