Someone should Ang Lee apologize. In fact, many people do. And I will start. I have never been interested in the movie of Ang Lee Hulk because of the almost unanimous bad reviews. Even premium cable channels seemed to rarely show it. In the end, I decided to watch it yesterday in the US network, and wow .... <br /> <br /> SPOILERS FOR HUAL ANG LEE AND AN INCREDIBLE HOOK <br /> <br /> It was boring! I almost did not go through the Hulk Ang Lee. Eric Bana was indifferent, Nick Nolte was terrible, Sam Elliott was incredible (and this is not funny, he is usually a cool character). In fact, I sincerely think that they chose Eric Bana, because his indescribable face was the easiest to imitate computer graphics - and it was clear that Ang Lee Hulk should have resembled Bruce Banner outwardly in his angry state. When Hulk fought a mutant poodle, I was ready to recognize Hulk as the worst superhero film ever. <br /> <br /> But then something happened. At about 3/4 of this tedious film was really exciting and - I dare say, quite convincing - the extended scene of the action, which begins with the Hulk breaking out of the containment chamber at a military base, fights with M1 tanks and comanches. helicopters in the desert, then flying the F22 Raptor into the stratosphere, only to be captured on the streets of San Francisco. It was one of the best action films ever made for a superhero movie. And I have to say that CGI was pretty good. This is not to say that the Hulk was completely convincing. But this did not require a much greater suspension of disbelief than many non-hero superheroes require. And this is a real feat. <br /> <br /> Of course, the finale became really stupid when Bruce Banner’s father turned into a kind of shape-changing villain, but an earlier sequence of actions made any of the short heroes of Iron Man shame. And overall, aside from the lively mutant dogs, it really does seem that the CGI in Hulk has tried its best to convince you that it is real and really interacts with its surroundings. It was definitely better than I expected. <br /> <br /> Okay, what about the Incredible Hulk? Guess what ... It's boring too! Hulk has only a few appearances, and that's the point - CGI is terrible in this movie. Perhaps the Hulk in Ang Lee's version at times looked fake and caricatured on others - but he had some convincing moments. The Incredible Hulk looked completely ridiculous. He had a skin tone and a muscular tone that didn’t even look like a living being, just some kind of computer texture. It was really ridiculous. Lighting, environment and facial effects did not look 5 years newer than those of Ang Lee, they looked 10 years older. And this is really no excuse. We really live in an era when programmers can spoil a movie as thoroughly as any film director, actor or filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Worse, the screenwriter and director of this film seemed to have learned almost nothing from Ang Lee's “failure.” All the same mistakes are made. Bruce Banner with little or no emotion. The general is so unswervingly, improbably one-dimensional, that it seems more gloomy than the Hulk. Love interest is unconvincing (I have to pay tribute to Liv Tyler for being more emotional than Jennifer Connelly, although both are fairly easy for the eyes). Tim Blake Nelson replays almost as much as Nick Nolte, although he is only a few minutes in the film. Hulk really does little in this film, of course, no more than in the version of Ang Lee. The Incredible Hulk was a bit faster, but since nothing really happened, it costs nothing. Oh yes, the villain looks as false as the Hulk. In fact, he is much more interesting person than a monster. <br /> <br /> This is how I can unequivocally say that Ang Lee’s version was better: if I ever had the opportunity to see Ang Lee’s version again, I could look at it to see good action sequences, or more to try to evaluate the dialogue a bit more (more likely, I would just rewind to the good parts). But in The Incredible Hulk there is absolutely no scene that is worth watching once, not to mention two. This is really the bottom of the pile of superhero movies. Cartoon CGI is an insult to the audience - at least in the version of Ang Lee it seems that they tried to make it realistic (except for, of course, the giant poodle). <br /> <br /> This is absolutely reasonable. stunning as the filmmakers intended to erase the evil feelings associated with the Hulk Ang Lee, creating almost the exact same film. <br /> <br /> To the credit of Edward Norton, he seems to distance himself from this film.
