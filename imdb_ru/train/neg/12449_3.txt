Sondra Locke stinks in this film, but then she was still a terrible "actress." Unfortunately, she drags everyone else (including the then real-life guy of Clint Eastwood), but what was Clint Eastwood thinking about when he agreed to star in this film? One reading of the script should have told him that this one was going to be a real snore. This is an extremely weak story, almost no story or plot at all. Add a bored, bad game, even from the usually good Eastwood. There is absolutely no action other than a couple of arguments and, as far as I knew, this film stands on top of a pile of natural sleep enhancers. Wow! Can a movie be more boring? I think watching the paint dries up or the grass grows can be more fun. This abomination. Do not worry about it ,
