Well, if it were not for Ethel Waters and seven-year-old Sammy Davis Jr. (stated here without a junior), Rufus Jones for the president would have been one of the worst performances of African-American stereotypes from the early talkie era and would not be worth seeing because of this. Miss Waters sings great, "Am I blue?" and “Under our Harlem Moon,” while Mr. Davies shows us how his childhood experience in show business prepared him for his superstar status in adult life. He dances so well here that for a while I thought he was a little man with years of experience. So, if you are ready to ignore negative connotations, Rufus Jones for the president should please you. Postscript This is the fourth time that I have seen and heard the song “I will be glad when you die, you are a crook,” played in the film, this time by Davis. It must have been a very popular song about this time.
