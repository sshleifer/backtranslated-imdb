I did not know what to expect from the film. Well, now I know. It was a really awful movie. The script, direction and acting was equally bad. The story was stupid and stupid. The director could have made an intelligent and thought-provoking film, but he did not. I wriggled in my chair during the last half of the movie because it was so bad. Where was the focus of the film? Where was anything in this movie? Christians should boycott this film, not promote it. It was done terribly and a waste of my money. I do not see this movie.
