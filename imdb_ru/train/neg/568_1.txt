It debuted today on SciFi, and all I can say is I was speechless, I recorded it today to watch it tonight after work. I had high hopes. Now I tear the cabinets in search of a rope to hang myself. Perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. I would like to say something pleasant, like “It was fun to laugh at this film,” but this film gives me nothing to do with work. I know that you should not publish spoilers here without prior warning, but I'm still going to "This film sucks" There I said it! They must show this film to the students of the film to show them what NOT to do! My nine-year-old niece could have made a better film. The only decent thing in this film is the sound and / or soundtrack. OH! I just found a rusty C-shaped yoke in my old toolbox. I am going to put it on the thumb of my left hand and strain it until the pain erases the memory of what my eyes have seen. I could just stick this VHS, but I think I'll burn it in the fire instead. I could wash with soap and water, but I'm afraid I will never be clean again. Christmas is coming. Buy this movie and give it to people you hate. -Mike
