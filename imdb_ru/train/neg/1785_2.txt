.... And, seeing this bunch of crap, you will not be surprised that it was not published <br /> <br /> !!!! SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> This is a terrible movie by any measure, but when I point out that this is one of the worst films with Stephen King’s name in the credits, you can imagine how bad it is. The film begins with two characters watching with an open mouth at a horrible scene: <br /> <br /> “My God. What happened here? ”<br /> <br />“ I don’t know, but they sure hate cats ”* <br /> <br /> The camera shows the outside of the house where hundreds of cats are dead and disfigured. Boy, this guy he is right, someone hates cats, and with that conclusion he must be a policeman. Oh, wait a minute, he is a policeman, and when the film starts with a policeman who makes oh so obvious observation, you just know that you will watch a bad movie. < br /> <br /> The reason why SLEEPWALKERS is bad is that it is very illogical and confusing. Finally, we we find that the monsters of this title need the blood of virgins in order to survive. Isn’t they better not look for a virgin in the biblical belt of the Midwest, not an American coastal city? Having said that, at least, we know about the motives of monsters - this is the only we will find out. We will never know how they can change shape or make cars invisible, and this annoying ending that seems to have been stolen from the Terminator. Monster mother walks, killing several cops with bare hands or blowing them up with a handgun (!), Released by the police, but if its breed of monsters is invulnerable to police firepower, then why do creatures need the ability to change shape or become invisible? The death of creatures is as badly thought out as the death of domestic cats. If they can be killed by cats, then why didn't the monsters kill all the cats that lay in the garden? A whole crowd of magicians sat around, but the monsters never thought to kill them. I believe that the production team could come up with an end. The fact is that they started the film "My Complaint Lies." <br /> <br /> We work in several scenes where famous horror movie directors are shot, such as John Landis, Clive Barker and even Stephen King. I think that the reason for this is that whenever a struggling unknown actor read the script, they immediately decided that, in spite of everything, they would not appear in the film so badly, therefore Stephen King had to call his horror friends to fill out the cast. That's how bad the SLEEPWALKERS are <br /> <br /> * Incredible, because it seems like it's not the worst scene in a movie. The worst line - "This cat saved my life"
