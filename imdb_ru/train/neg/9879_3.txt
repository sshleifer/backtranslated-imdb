After watching the movie, I was really shocked to see such a high rating on IMDb. <br /> <br /> “Fantastic Mr. Fox” is a film version of your favorite children's classics, depicting a smooth, smooth story. the protagonist, Mr. Fox (or Foxy), when he is trying to steal the last robber from the terrible Boggins, Buns and Bean. That's right, one is short, one is fat, one is skinny or whatever. <br /> <br /> I don’t quite understand where to start with my criticism. <br /> <br /> Well, I was a teenager and I was never a fan of Roald Dahl, but I liked his material enough: I read several of his books as a child and saw Matilda, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory again and again. This film, however, is fighting for an audience. Is it aimed at children? Adults? I'm still not sure! Many of the “jokes” will tire a child, especially when Mr. Fox visits a lawyer, for example, or complains of poverty. It is also expected that the audience (I guess) children will sympathize with the character who steals and kills chickens. I am behind the food chain, but you practically see Mr. Fox biting their neck! Of course it's a bit much? And also the plot ... well, it's a bit boring. I was left only with the hope that everything would get better, but instead I was more and more annoyed at Mr. Fox and his son Ash for making stupid decisions. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the humor collapsed. I laughed only once or twice, although I specifically admitted trying to joke. I think that in part this is that the voice acting is incredibly flat and monotonous. Voice actors have no sense of comic time; instead, they tend to the subtlety of humor, which only works with certain mediums. George Clooney seeks to portray Mr. Fox charming and graceful, but his voice has no character. Meryl Streep shows no emotion, I did not even suspect that Bill Murray played the role until the end of the titles, and Ash, a twelve-year-old fox, seems to be about 30. <br /> <br /> I love animation, in particular, stopping the movement but the visual style scared me off a bit. Characters are tall, thin and devoid of any heat design. They move with very little fluidity, and often the animation is jerky and weird. There is also a characteristic feeling of “mixed media”, since 2D components are added from time to time and without success. The characters look straight into the camera and talk; it was very embarrassing. There was one or two moments when Kylie looked straight into the camera, did not move, and he had curls on his eyeballs. It really worried me. <br /> <br /> Fantastic Mr. Fox had enormous potential. Many people still like it - look at the reviews. Maybe it's just not for me.
