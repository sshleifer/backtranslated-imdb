I was pretty much convinced to write this review for a number of reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) This is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen 2) If he doesn't get more reviews, he won't included in the list of the worst films of all time - which he deserves to be 3) I was a little lucky - I paid five pounds for it. I saw it in stores for 15 pounds. Do not pay much for this movie! You will be very angry 4) There are many horror films that do not have a fair rating (in my opinion) and give this movie a higher rating than they are criminal. <br /> <br /> Summary of plot: a guy without friends meets a vagabond who promises the world - well, the magical ability to appear to everyone else, like someone else. Our hero slyly turns into a teenage girl and joins their gang - sitting on a swing, sitting on the ground. He kills them one by one until he is tracked down and discovered by the police. <br /> <br /> Why is it so bad? Starting with acting is VERY VERY bad. Someone compared it with school production. No, it's worse than any acting game I've seen on the school scene. <br /> <br /> I bought several previously banned films from a vipco DVD company and was not as disappointed as this one. well, the acting is bad, but the film makes no other sense. What is the point of making this film when there is not even blood! well, no blood. What else can a movie like this offer? Breats? No, not even some amazing! <br /> <br /> It is true that this film may have a certain charm in its unique arrogance, but any potential buyer / viewer of this film must be rightly warned that this film, at best, is only one out of ten.
