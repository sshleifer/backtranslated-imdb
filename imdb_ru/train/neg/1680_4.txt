Even with actors who can boast of such generally reliable names as Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow, Wonderland is not able to give this film any meaning. This barely affects the surface of the incidents that occurred on that July night in 1981. Kilmer just goes through the motions, since John Holmes and Kudrow and Kate Bosworth both, we hope, erred in two other major roles; as Holmes' wife and minor girl, respectively. The rest of the cast has such small roles that it is impossible to get any measurements from them. The film also starred Carrie Fisher, Ted Levine, Frankie J., MS Geini, Dylan McDermott and Cameo from Paris Hilton.
