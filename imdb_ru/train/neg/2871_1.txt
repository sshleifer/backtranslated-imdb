I made this terrible movie. The worst, I think I have ever seen. I believe that 1st class could do better. Worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen some bad ones. It's okay, except that I paid 1.50 to rent it, and it was 1.49 too much. The acting is terrible, the characters are worse, and the film is just a piece of garbage. Scenes in the house of those killed are so low-budget that they make B look like an Oscar candidate. All I can say is that if you want to spend a good evening and spend some money on renting this terrible movie. I'd rather watch the killer clowns from space, sitting in a bucket with a razor, than sit on the flop again.
