Before this new season, I was a big fan of the Little Mosque. However, the new season has absolutely ruined it. <br /> <br /> A new Christian vicar destroyed all the intentions of the show. It has always been about living together to overcome prejudices. The new vicar destroys this premise and shows Christians in a very bad light. <br /> <br /> I am not a Christian or a Muslim, but I liked to watch the show and see the camaraderie between Amar and the reverend. No more. <br /> <br /> Just cancel it and get it over with. No more watching. <br /> <br /> It may still be saved, but many changes need to be made. <br /> <br /> Return the old format.
