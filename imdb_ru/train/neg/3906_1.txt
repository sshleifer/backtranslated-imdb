I managed to sneak away one night and go to the cinema to see this one, thinking that I was in for a treat. Boy, I was wrong. Given the talent involved, it must be one of the worst films I've ever seen. Everything in it was clogged, and I find it incredible to read on this site that there are people who really liked it.
