Three Russian aristocrats absorb the decline of Monte Carlo, despite the fact that they are up to the last franc. In order to support their luxurious lifestyle, they use the services of a counterfeiter and use banknotes in the casino, hoping to exchange fake currency for a jackpot. Andrew Hughes, the American envoy, arrives in Monaco with his wife Helen, and all three decide to make friends with visitors, hoping for financial assistance. One of the three Russians, Count Sergiy Karamzin, plans to go further, continuously moving towards Helen, disappointing the servant of the count who loves Sergius. In the end, circumstances play into the hands of three aristocrats. Obviously, Von Stroheim tried to convey a message (with the stupidity of American women and the inappropriate behavior of aristocrats) rather than telling a story, and the film can really easily inherit a modern audience, like me, in this way. Even acting, which is great in later evs such as Greed and Wedding March, is just a mill here. The film could use enhancements at different levels. Rating, 3.
