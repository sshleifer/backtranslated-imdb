this film is really trying. if you're going to make a horror movie, at least give him a reason to believe that you hooked the viewer. <br /> <br /> You are waiting for a movie, waiting for some great explanation, but it’s not. instead, he tries to be too clever, ending up and revealing nothing. <br /> <br /> What's the point of the movie? where does it actually go? and more importantly, what the hell was going on. <br /> <br /> Why were they there and how is this related to something? just another weak science fiction horror. I like fake reviews on IMDb, which say how wonderful it is that the corresponding press releases raise the film (either this or the people have a low outlook). It is not worth your 2 hours at all. <br /> <br /> I’m not saying that the film is better than fragile, but at least it gave you reasoning and an explanation of why everything happened and has an end result. it's not, and it's just a wafer with tons of stuffing so that everything is scary. this film is about as low as when a stranger calls. God, who was also lame <br /> <br /> Great advice: if you are going to make a horror, make it believable with the help of reasoning and explain to the viewer what is happening to get your story hooked. because if there is no reasoning or credibility, then there is nothing strong, and it cannot be scary. disrespect for the cast or crew because they did a good job. it's just a bad letter.
