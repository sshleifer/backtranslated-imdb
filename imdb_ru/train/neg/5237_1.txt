One of, if not the worst, film that will come out of Britain in the 80s. <br /> <br /> This clumsy story about a middle-aged libertine who “seduces” two teenage scrapers who look after him and his skillful wife has nothing to buy him back. <br /> <br /> In turn, gratuitously This film, childish, clumsy and unrealistic, plunges into the depths, as it fails miserably in attempts to be funny, provocative, intellectual and controversial. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the worst thing in this film is how the strong cast of George Costigan, Michelle Holmes and Siobhan Finneran is completely stitched together in such a flimsy script. Not surprisingly, this was the only work of the late Andrea Dunbar to do it on screen. Full and full trash on every level.
