The only real highlight in the film is the death of a floating person and the reaction of the surviving characters to him. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this film is a very deplorable Jaw robbery, Lake Tranquil and Alligator, with the addition of a small amount of Godzilla (1998). <br /> <br /> As is customary in the horror film in the style of the 1990s, two women without roles take off their clothes at least once. There is no female leader, as she is clearly the best agent. <br /> <br /> The entire film is about shooting a truly stupid extreme sport called blood surfing, in which surfers cut themselves and wander in shark-infested waters. In this film, a giant salt water crocodile also finds itself in the area. People eat. The film ends. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t mind a bad horror movie, but I really hate the boring bad horror movie that it definitely is.
