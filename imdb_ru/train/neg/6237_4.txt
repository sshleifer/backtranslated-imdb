The statistics in this film have been well studied. There is no doubt about it! Al Gore, of course, is very good at his work, and it is not surprising that this film received praise. Al Gore is definitely a real actor. He sounds so worried. But things speak louder than words! In this film, there are political tidbits and references to his political career scattered throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Carter, unlike Al Gore, is a man of good faith who not only speaks, but also walks. also. When Carter thought we needed to save energy, he turned off the thermostat in the White House and warmed up, wearing a sweater. <br /> <br /> Al Gore tells us that we need to save energy and declares that we are creating global warming while he is traveling in his private jet. How much energy does his jet use and how much pollution does his jet create? How much energy does it take to heat the pool of the Mountain behind his house? It would be nice if we could save electricity by using smaller appliances and setting a goal to turn off everything that is not being used. But if we had done this, the power company would have reacted to a 50% reduction in energy consumption, calling it a “loss of 50% in revenue” and reimbursing its losses, raising rates by 50%. So "just turning it off" would not be a very good idea. <br /> <br /> This film is a veiled call to allow the Great Government to take control of everything, in order to save planet Earth, that is.
