A collection of deleted scenes and alternate duplicates, edited together and with an added voice-over, so that they appear to occur after the events of the first. A pretty cool idea, but the deleted scenes for some reason remain on the floor of the cutting room, and this is another proof. Since it is not as funny as “The Leader,” and in fact let's face it, this film wasn't just comedic gold either, so you get a “movie” worse than one that was moderately funny. In my opinion, this still puts one or two tags above the words "Kicking and screaming" or "Enchanted." Throw fingers, that “Wedding Crushers” is a return to the old school uniform (not a pun) <br /> <br /> My assessment: D
