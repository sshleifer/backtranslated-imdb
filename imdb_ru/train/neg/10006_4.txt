I do not know who to blame, timid writers or an ignorant director. It seemed to be one of those films where the stars (Angie, Charlie, Denise, Rosanna, and John) were paid so much that it really wasn't enough to actually make a movie. It could have been very interesting, but a curtain of timidity, even of cowardice, hung over each stage. Since he got the R rating anyway, why was the ubiquitous bubble bath scene filmed with a 70-year-old woman and not with Angie Harmon? Why does Shin lunate through a potentially hot relationship with TWO of the most beautiful and sex actresses in the world? If they were only looking for laughter, why not play Whoopi Goldberg and Judy Tenuta? It was so predictable that I was surprised to find that the director was not five years old. What a waste, not only for the audience, but also for the actors.
