Dreck about three beautiful women in California who go to some festival (or something). All hotels are booked, so they have to spend the night in a creepy old house. What they do not know is the fact that there is a creepy resident who loves to kill ... <br /> <br /> Yawn. A boring, meaningless, totally stupid horror movie. Bach and her two friends are certainly beautiful, but the film itself is boring, boring, boring! Bach and her friends are not actresses - their faces are always empty. The last "revelation" is predictably ridiculous, and there is no blood and no blood that might interest you. There are some expected gratuitous female nudity, but this is not enough to save it. Boring, meaningless and unknown (for good reason). And 1 completely.
