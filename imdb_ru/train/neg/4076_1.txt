This item deserves a much better script and end result than this movie. The script is full of holes, because it was never conceived as a story, but rather a scenario of nightmarish scenarios loosely interconnected. Gaps and loose ends in the storyline are numerous. The scene where a kidnapping victim is told that her parents are not dead and have been looking for her since she was kidnapped is just weird. It is written as a moment of cathartic therapy, when the head of the asylum, who managed to escape, gives her the “missing poster” when she was eight years old. In the real world, if the head of the refugee refuge found out that abduction had been discovered under his roof, the next call would be an immediate call to the police. This is a law enforcement problem, not a 12-minute segment for Oprah. Everything that follows from there to the end is so short that I can only conclude that the first 90 minutes were for clean, free use. It's funny, this is what this film should condemn. In the end, seems to have joined.
