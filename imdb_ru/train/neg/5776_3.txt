bad game, bad southern accents, inconsistent cinema, terrible script ... <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to this film at a recent film festival and was very discouraged after watching it. Contains citations / does not quote the names of talents, but they do not deliver. Of course, the reason for this is the uneven and uninteresting story that is told. <br /> <br /> don't worry
