(Maybe very light spoilers.) <br /> <br /> Usually a fan of Diane Keaton, I tried to watch it tonight. I had to turn it off before the second hour, because I found that I absolutely did not sympathize with my daughter or mother. Both looked submerged in themselves with little respect for others, with their daughter also adding in a coarse, disrespectful and reckless mixture. When my daughter died, the only thing I thought was: "At least we will no longer have to watch her." Keaton did a good job moving into her dazed state and into the bereaved, but by that time it was too far for me. I just did not enjoy it, so I stopped watching. If you want me to take care of the main character, you need me to take care of the characters much earlier - if it's almost an hour, and I don't care, it's too late. <br /> <br /> Support The cast was sincere and well-played - I felt towards them *, and the gay best friend was wonderful, but even united, it was not enough to carry the film for me.
