The invasion of the Star Creations would definitely be in the “so bad it is good” category if the film were not so sexist or racist. The fact that this is so makes it just bad. <br /> <br /> He has the same type of hard stereotypical sexism that you saw in “The Queen of Outer Space” and racist stereotypes (in this case, Native Americans) that you usually find in the thirties and forties. From the point of view that this is not funny, the same walk through the cave is repeated more than ten times during this rather short film. Ray makes a good impression of Jimmy Cagney (but cannot make him work on two impressions of Cagney in a row and not deal with Peter Lorre when he tries to do this). In fact, there is no point in talking about any production values, since the Star Beings make Ro-Man from Robot Monster or Tor Johnson in Plan 9 from Outer Space look like the creations of Industrial Light and Magic. <br /> <br /> This film was definitely one of the avant-garde of what you would call early independent cinema ... not tricky for those theaters and not good enough for anything other than the last function of the all-night vigil. <Br /> <br />
