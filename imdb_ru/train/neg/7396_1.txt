Unfortunately, I have to agree with the critic, written by Halopes. <br /> <br /> For a short film, movies, costumes, scenery, sound, montage and everything else is very, very good. At first, this may seem surprising, but I was told that the technical team working on this is made up of professionals, so quality should be expected. The problem, as usual, lies in the story itself. <br /> <br /> The fact is that this is not really a story. To tell a story (or in the case of a movie, SHOW a story), you need a plot and a conflict. You need things that happen to the main character: events. These events occur because the main character wants something and for some reason cannot get it. Tim Watcher has no problems or goals. He is a kind of supernatural being that observes humanity. That's all. So we have a clean exposure. Instead of showing the story, we’ll just learn something about this man, Tim Watcher. Of course, given the specific nature of Tim Watchcher and the short duration of the film, it is difficult to give enough information about it, so the film resorts to off-screen text. In this case, it is used in the worst sense to give information that we would otherwise never have found. In fact, if it weren't for the action, we would think that the character was just a strange old man who looked at things. What is worse, VO also explains what is happening on the screen! The images we show simply decorate the text we are listening to. <br /> <br /> I can say that this short film will be a good video for a group or something like that, but since the image is not I can not say that. What remains is obviously important as a measure of the crew’s technical capabilities (not incredible, but good), but it cannot entertain, entertain, hit or at least show the story.
