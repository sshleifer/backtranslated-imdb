This movie was just awful, the first movie was not so good, I mean, it is ridiculously silly, if they didn’t have enough with the first 5 movies that needed to be added another, why not just turn it into an ongoing series, like James Bond. I’ll tell you exactly why, because linking films are really very, very good, and these films just stink, I don’t understand if this should be something between such genres as horror and comedy for God's sake , my 1-year-old Niece would not be afraid of such an absurd attempt at terror Lev in the face of people who even want to at some point get a fright in the so-called horror film. Please do not need more of these films.
