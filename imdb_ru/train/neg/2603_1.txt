I was interested in this topic, and only Drew Barrymore’s dance lovers on David Letterman’s desk will find something remotely interesting in it. Well, she shows a chest (or maybe a double). The plot is torn to pieces, and the game is terrible. None of them have material to work with, since the direction of the film leads nowhere. Do not waste your time. Instead, watch Donnie Darko, if you need Drew Barrymore's creepy movie, and if you want to watch another, skip it and see Darko again. <br /> <br /> Handling the legend of Doppelganger is also absolutely criminal. Refer to the Descent to Hell novel by Charles Williams for something to consider instead. This is just an excuse to make a film “B”, to go directly to the video and suck the life of people from “Blockbuster”. <br /> <br /> What makes one of these people think that the performance is worthy of praise? Give me a break.
