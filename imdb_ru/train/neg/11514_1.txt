No doubt when Madonna and Guy Ritchie got married, it was because they both thought it would help their film career. If you went through the “Swept Away” test, then you know that at this level it was a match in hell. After nearly 20 years of trying to become a respected actress (or “actress,” as she could say it in “The next best thing”), she still can't get out of herself long enough to play in a play that anyone with call decent. And this is what makes people not like her so much on the screen: this is an intuitive feeling that her ego is so bloated that it does not allow her to just let go and connect with her audience. If there is justice in this universe, it simply spoiled its last chance.
