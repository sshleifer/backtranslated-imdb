Tim Robbins, oddly enough, is benevolent here, as a garage mechanic in the 1950s in New Jersey, who falls in love with a cheerful blonde who turns out to be Albert Einstein's niece! Although he is on the screen most of the time, Robbins does not take into account the inner workings of his intense persona and recedes into the background (it is easy to forget that he is even in the picture!). Romantic comedy comedy with a trick: Walter Mattau plays Einstein (who does everything he can, with a cartoon-like character). Otherwise, it is sweet and sunny, directed rather drowsy by Fred Shepisi, which shows the heart, but not wit or brains. Meg Ryan is her usual friendly person, and the chemistry between her and Robbins is charming, like that of a tender sister and her older brother. ** from ****
