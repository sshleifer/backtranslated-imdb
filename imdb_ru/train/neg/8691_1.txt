If there was a zero rating, I would give it to this film. Today I tried to watch it for the second time, but so far I have not been able to pass through it. I cannot believe many stars given by others, and I can only assume that they either know the actors, or are a disguised publicist! Everything is terrible, blah script, the guy playing Nicole does not show any emotion, even when she is threatened. The “southern” accent of the actress playing Amber's mom is ridiculous - I'm from Georgia and I have friends from Texas - trust me, no one says that! None of her emotions seemed real in any scene. The subject is very serious and deserves much better treatment.
