Karina Kapoor in a bikini hmmmmmmm. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar ... <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor .... <br /> <br /> Maybe Saif .... <br /> <br /> Karina Kapoor in a bikini ..... <br /> <br /> Good banner .. <br /> <br /> Karina Kapoor in a bikini ..... <br /> <br /> There is not one good reason do not watch this movie .... <br /> <br /> Or so I thought ........ Don't these people do JBJ ... <br /> Why? Why I forgot about it. <br /> <br /> Despite all the criticism, the first half of the film is not so bad ... <br /> <br /> There is some intrigue and you feel a bit of an annoyance mixed with excitement, which I he felt when he saw how the guy Ritchie loves locks and latches. <br /> <br /> Karina Kapoor hisses very thin model. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is Akshay Kumar as he can be. <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor is annoying, but rather funny, YOU ALMOST KNOW THAT MORE TIME YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT. <br /> <br /> Saif - a la Main Hiladi supporter .. again. <br /> <br /> Laughs and chuckles sometimes happen, and some goosebumps during the Karina-Saif love story (Karina in the rain, behind me on my bike, hmmmmm). <br /> <br /> BUT MORE THIS SHALL DOES PROMISE MORE THAN IT DELIVERS ..... <br /> What makes the second half even more unbearable .... <br /> <br /> There was almost a bang when the interval came not only because of the wet Karina because people thought there were things that should have come. <br /> <br /> INSTEAD OF WE TURNED TO A REASONABLE TORTURE WHICH DIFFICULT TO DO IN WORD. <br /> <br /> Saif suddenly seemed to me to be a joke, like a comic chum ... <br /> <br /> EXTERNAL SEXUAL KARINA LOOKING ANOREXICALLY, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE SECOND LAST FLOOR NOW IS EMPLEMENTABLE AND YOU ARE LOOKING YOUR CHAPTERS, I’RE UNDERSTANDING I’T CHAPTER OTHERS I’TRE YOUR COLLISTS. FOR HIS BODY (only girls can notice this, and other guys noticed that my last floor was my observation). <br /> <br /> ANIL KAPUR AND ITS SIDEKES GET ON YOUR NERVES. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the only one who tolerates insanity to some degree, but even after a while he becomes unbearable. <br /> <br /> EVERYTHING WHEN YOU CONFIRM ONE ABSOLUTE AFTER ANOTHER. <br /> <br /> WHY ?? !! WHAT KIND??!!! WHEN?!!! WHERE?!!! WHAT I HAVE DONE TO MEET THIS ... <br /> <br /> A collective sigh passed through the audience before each song in the second half, which was common even without a movie around. <br /> <br /> I can no longer ease the injury .... <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION. <br /> <br /> THIS FILM BEGINS AS A BOOZH, WHICH YOU FEEL, THAT EVEN CHOOSE A HIGH, BUT ENDS TO A HEADACHE, and then quickly turns into a complete migraine attack. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this film for any reason other than academic interest. <br /> <br /> + s The cast, Akshay Kumar, the first half. <br /> <br /> +/- what, when, how, who is strongly confused. (Need a book to fill it in). <br /> <br /> a whole second half (you need a lot of pages to fill it in). <br /> <br /> only 3/10 (I try to avoid 1 and 2 do not seem too extreme either, but I’m not mistaken, this film cannot be seen no matter how decent it is) the first half is).
