Just watched the movie on the last weekend, I am upset and disappointed with this. In fact, the film says that immigrants, especially from the former Soviet Union, come to this country, bring with them everyone they can from the old country, and also invade and capture what the Americans worked for. This is a very wrong view on immigration and a much worse way to tell people about it. This is the main thing. Another thing is that the overall composition, direction and video are at the level of village lovers. The actors did quite well, but they hadnâ€™t been able to save this bunch of shit before. A few jokes were funny, but most were bad and stupid. I can't wait to leave the theater, I want my money back.
