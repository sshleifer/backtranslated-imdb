I shot it back in the 80s and, frankly, I can't remember anything concrete about the film - only that it is the worst film I've ever seen. This is not one of those "it was so bad, it was funny." This is not one of those films "it was so terrible, it leaves you in a bad mood." It wasn't even one of those "what the hell was that?" films. I can not remember the performance of the actors, but it was poorly filmed, the story was fragmented, and she did not have a certain style. When it was over, I got angry that I wasted my time. <br /> <br /> I saw a lot of films that I didn’t understand because of unfamiliar culture, styles and / or story-telling, but it was clear that these films have some of these properties. Incubus has none. <br /> <br /> I was actually thinking NOT to comment on this “piece” because of the fear that someone might watch it out of curiosity, but I’m forced to warn anyone who appreciates the film to skip this film,
