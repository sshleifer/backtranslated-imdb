I saw this obvious celebration of Schlok on the shelf of a video store. And even before I received my first VCR, I thought that I should baptize him with this little gem, and this is bad work on the film in all its glory! <br /> <br /> Careless dialogue is ridiculous. And it has a cameo with Donald Trump. Anthony Quinn in this inexplicable. And just like Christopher Walken, he seemed to want to act in every bad movie in the years to come. This film is the Country Bears of Mr. Quinn. <br /> <br /> It has lines like “Shut up and let me fight !!!” <br /> <br /> And “You say a lot of shit!” <br /> <br /> And a priceless return: “Unfortunately, this is sh_it, cruel evil sh_it!” <br /> <br /> You will be amazed at the fight scene when Bo makes SOMMERSAULT through the pool table! And makes a good kung-fu kick when she comes out of the roll Cracked crazy action and the thrill of T and A !!! <br /> <br /> What movie fan can ask for more? Oh, and when Mr. Quinn's character commits suicide and returns to chase Bo like a ghost , she asks him why he committed suicide instead of coping with his debilitating disease? He says: “Real men don't eat quiche”. <br /> <br /> Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh if Bo were a smart cookie, she would immediately invite an exorcist!
