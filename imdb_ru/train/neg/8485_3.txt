From the terrible scenes of death to the weapon that shoots, without emitting sounds, a character named Fiend. It's all tedious, slowly moving, unimaginable nonsense. It was normal to see a guy with a cape and a hunchback hiding around. Visually, it was creepy and probably took the viewer of that time, but even in 1936 one would think that there would be a little more imagination and believability even for such a film. I just kept waiting for something to happen, when someone is important, when they give speeches and behave as if they are posing at an office picnic. And then there are those bullets that the previous commentator mentioned. Perhaps the best tip would be to look for a water stain on someone elseâ€™s trouser pocket.
