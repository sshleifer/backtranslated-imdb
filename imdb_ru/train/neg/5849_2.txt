Being a fan of silent films, I was looking forward to seeing this picture for the first time. I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, the film seems to be one long, long, commercial for Maxwell's car. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, if the scene of the pursuit was about twice as long, then maybe I would have liked the movie more. But he very quickly grew old. And although I admit that reality is repeatedly stretched in films, without diminishing the viewer's pleasure, what happened to Mexican gangsters? I mean, they are chasing the car through the mountains, the car that most of the time moves at a speed of about one mile per hour, but they can't catch it?
