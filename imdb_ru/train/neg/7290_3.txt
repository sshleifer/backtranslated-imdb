What a long, protracted, meaningless movie. I’m sure this movie is historically amazing, but in terms of entertainment, it’s just not successful. Ralph Fiennes starred in some science fiction films “The English Patient,” “Schindler's List,” but this one was such a disappointment. It seemed that this was not going anywhere, his character at the beginning was so superficial and agitated that it amazes me that his “sister” would be interested in general. Do not pay for the rental of this film, buy yourself a copy of the "English Patient".
