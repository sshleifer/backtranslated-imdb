This is not a bad thing, but only because it appeared in 1994, when they seemed to be tired of all this in Britain. This is 75% repetition of the Boogeyman, and I would be banned for the same reason - whatever it is. <br /> <br /> I was initially embarrassed because I thought that Annie (Kelly Galindo) might have had another Lacey, but she had problems with mental visions of a boogieman, similar to the one in the first film. Fans will immediately notice that they are not the same person. <br /> <br /> After seeing the murder in the bathroom, and also saw the address, Annie, her psychiatrist and parapsychology student, very similar to the guy On cheap romantic novels and commercials, go to the house, and, of course This is the same bathroom. 24 hours later, the murder is as she described. Of course, we have no idea who this violent woman is or why she was killed. <br /> <br /> The film then goes on to repeat the “Boogeyman” plot with some additional frames that we have not seen in the original. It is noteworthy that the Boogeyman is shown in contrast to the original. Unfortunately, some of the good scenes were cut, but 90% of them are there. Why restart this movie? Did they find the shots in the bin? What was the purpose? <br /> <br /> We will never know, and despite the fact that a psychologist tells Annie that she is cured, we all know that the eccentric will never die.
