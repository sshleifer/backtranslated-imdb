Words can't just describe how awful this movie is. Last night I watched it in the video and just could not believe what I saw. In fact, the Snakeeater tells about a former military man (Lorenzo Lamas) and his search for a kidnapped sister who was captured by instigators in the style of liberation. Acting, screenplay, directing, photography and film editing are regrettable, as well as a song called “The Soldier”, which should be one of the worst themes of all time! <br /> <br /> However, there is one pleasure. , "Horshack" (Ron Pallio) from "Welcome Back Carter" in the film plays a funny bad guy. Otherwise, please avoid this mess at all prices.
