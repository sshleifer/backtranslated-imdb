I am very open to foreign films and I like to think that I understand what they are trying to achieve, although some things are lost in translation. But the simplicity and “quickness” of this film was boring. I often thought how interesting it would be to make a film that simply shows a typical day or a period of time that really does not make sense. Now that I have seen such a film, I will no longer think in this direction. There are tones about society, racism and some desire ... but South Park has it. And when I watch South Park, it really makes me feel. The closest thing I experienced to emotions during this film was a yawn, which I experienced after the first five minutes. I rate a typical movie seven or higher, because I love most of each movie. I gave this movie one.
