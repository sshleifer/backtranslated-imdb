This film is announced as a sort of continuation of Full Monty about unemployed men in Sheffield. <br /> <br /> As a person born in Sheffield and still connected to the city, I was extremely disappointed with this film. Someone said that it could be done in Oklahoma, and that’s about it for me. It looked like a romantic view of northern England, made for the US market. Probably, many Americans - and many southern British - do not understand that Sheffield is a big city with a population of about half a million people, with a complex urban culture. In “Among the Giants,” he was portrayed as some kind of gloomy dead-end semi-rural town, where everyone in Sheffield seemed to drink in one old-fashioned pub, and where the folk idea of ​​the party danced in some village hall. It was a small cohesive community, not a metropolitan city. <br /> <br /> Workers from Sheffield are completely different from their real colleagues, who are usually silent and communicate with each other in brief and brief terms. dry remarks. They do not chatter and, of course, do not sing in the choirs. <br /> <br /> Even the countryside, presumably in the Peak area, looked alien to me. I learned a few places where I used to go hiking, but some of the air shots of the pylons that stretched over the dull landscape reminded me more of Wales. Indeed, in the credits at the end I noticed a link to Gwynedd, Wales. The peak area in the summer is teeming with pedestrians and tourists in cars. It is located between two large cities. This is not some wilderness. <br /> <br /> As for the idea that a young woman could fall in love with Pete and crave for it, it was funny and could only be a man’s dream. Her reasons for becoming his lover were never obvious. None of the men were shown as having a partner or family; they existed in a vacuum. <br /> <br /> Anyone who would like to watch a film about unemployed sheffield would be led astray. This Sheffield existed only in the heads of middle-class writers and directors. <br /> <br /> It was a giant fake! <br /> <br />
