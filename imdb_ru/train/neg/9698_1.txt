Now in Germany there are a lot of talented directors and actors. None of them are associated with this “film”. <br /> <br /> Why in the world do manufacturers really invest in something like this? You could make 10 good films with the budget of this garbage! It is not interesting when seven adult men run like gnomes, pretending to be funny. What's funny is that the producer of the film (who turns out to be the oldest guy in this group) plays the youngest dwarf. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with moments that scream about the signature: must laugh now! Hard to believe this shit should be a comedy. <br /> <br /> Many people got up and left the cinema 30 minutes after the movie began. I should have done the same thing, not wasting time ... <br /> <br /> Pain!
