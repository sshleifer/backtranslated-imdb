When I saw that IMDb users rated this movie for 250 lower movies, I thought it was too sharp, but I didn't know much that the low rating was absolutely correct. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of the Vayan brothers, I loved their Scary Movie 2 and even enjoyed White Tiptoes. The Little Man, however, had very little laughter, and the jokes were stale. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the joke will revolve around Marlon Wayans, who plays an adult dwarf who was recently released from prison. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, are stealing a diamond meant for a gangster. Everything goes wrong, and the dwarf has to place a diamond with an unsuspecting pair played by Sean Wayans and Kerry Washington. To return the diamond, the dwarf pretends to be an abandoned child, left on the threshold of unsuspecting couples. Of course, it is accepted, and the drama begins about the search for a diamond. <br /> <br /> The film has several actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live, such as Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider, as well as In Living Color. All these talents, however, cannot help a bad script and jokes that were simply not fun. <br /> <br /> Special effects to make Marlon Wayans look like a dwarf were fine. I mean, it was not 100% believable, but everything was in order ... nothing good. I would just like the Wayan brothers to put more effort into developing a script with good jokes, rather than trying to strengthen their bad script with cameos from their famous comedians and actresses. <br /> <br /> Wait for it by telegram or television. It really is not worth any amount of money.
