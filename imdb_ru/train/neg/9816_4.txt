This movie was like a train wreck, no matter how awful it was, you still had to keep watching. My boyfriend and I rented it and wasted two hours of our day. Don't get me wrong, the game is good. Just the film as a whole just pissed us off. There was nothing positive or good about this scenario. After this movie, I had to rent something else that was a little easier. Jennifer Tilly is, as usual, a very dramatic actress. Her character seems insane and not everything is there. Darryl Hannah, although she overplayed, she does an excellent job of playing the situation in which she finds herself. More than once I found myself screaming on TV, ordering her to fight back or forcibly. In general, a very cruel film ... not for the faint of heart.
