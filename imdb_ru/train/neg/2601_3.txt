I just watched the movie for the first time. I wanted to watch it the way I like Drew Barrymore, and wanted to watch one of her earlier films. <br /> <br /> The film tells about a girl (played by a young and beautiful Drew Barrymore) who moves from New York to Los Angeles to relive her recent lost loss. Shortly after moving to the guy who falls in love with her, it becomes obvious that she has an evil double = double, who is chasing her. <br /> <br /> The film is pretty poor and lousy. Both dialogue and acting make the film really not worth watching it. To summarize, this is just something for Drew Barrymore fans.
