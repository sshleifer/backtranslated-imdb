Reasonable effort is the summary for this film. A good film of the sixties, but lacks a sense of achievement. Maggie Smith played a decent role that was plausible enough, but not as good as it could have been, other actors were just awful! Scary image. It was not very funny, and therefore it did not reach its genre, it was not particularly funny and not dramatic. The only genre that reached a satisfactory level was the novel. The target audience was not hurt, and the film sent tangled messages. A very simple plot and a very basic storyline were not performed or were not performed at all well, and people were puzzled as to why the film was not so good, and who was the target audience, etc. However, Maggie was pretty good and the storyline was good with moments of ability. <br /> <br /> 4.
