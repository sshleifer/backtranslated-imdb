I saw this boring waste of time on the HBO comedy channel, so I innocently and obviously suggested that it was a comedy. But there is nothing funny. A good cast is basically spent on a script that I could write with my left cheek - after being beaten up senselessly by the tortures of the 15th century Inquisition. The first half is especially bad, as there are some of the most boring, meaningless dialogs I've ever come across, and zero commas. The fact that stars such as Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones are present in this small film, and yet this film has less than 1000 votes on this site, I have to tell you everything. A few good shots of waves falling on the cold British coast, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> This film is shot only because the people who wrote it have good connections (family ties, preferably) and / or a lot of money lying around.
