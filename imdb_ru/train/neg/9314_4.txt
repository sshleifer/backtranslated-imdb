Well ... overall, this film was pretty much useless, and it was basically a horror movie that eventually became a comedy. I just shot this movie last night, when my friends and I went to the blockbuster in search of a scary movie. This is definitely not what we were looking for, but it satisfied us with humor. The actors in this film (especially Brandon) are so bogus that it's funny. And especially this girl Tracy, when she in the boarded up room tells the clown to leave. They show almost no emotion, and it is so obvious that they act. And also, when the clown looks through this black paper box and grabs Mark, he doesn't even look frightened, although the clown grabs him and starts attacking him. But seriously, would you just JOGGING if you were persecuted? I would run for my life! (Even if someone can outrun this clown, because he weighs 300 pounds.) Not to mention that the effect is not as great as whenever a clown cuts off Susan's head in the woods, then whenever he throws her head in a boarded up board. A room with Denise and Tracy whenever Denise throws her head back. Just like the guy’s previous comments, the beginning makes absolutely no sense, and I don’t even understand why it was even included in the film. So, this film was made in 2003? The music made her sound like it was made in the 1980s, and the camera (?) Doesn't even look professional. Half the time, it seems that the camera cannot even remain stable when it should be. In general, I would say that I liked the movie. I would not recommend it, although if you are trying to find something to scare you, but if you are looking for something to possibly ridicule or ridicule, I would recommend it for sure.
