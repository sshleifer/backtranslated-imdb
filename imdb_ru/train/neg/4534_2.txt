The book on which this film is based has seriously changed my life. But to say that this film was a disappointment is an understatement. The acting, directing, cinematography and storyline were terrible. I never recommend this movie to anyone. I told countless people about the book, but now I’ll tell them all that they definitely shouldn't be watching a movie! I didn’t expect the plot to follow the book exactly, but they missed too many key components of the book. The film tried, but failed, to deliver a powerful and inspiring message and only humiliated the central theme of the prophecy. Putting myself in a position that had not yet read the book, I saw in the Celestinsky prophecy a group of mystifications B.S. I’m totally disappointed with Redfield for how this movie turned out.
