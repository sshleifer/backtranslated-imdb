Well, apart from the psychedelic background images, the information presented here was good. Music, without which I could do (not that it was bad music, it just did not fit for this film). <br /> <br /> Regarding film content, the director often recalls the lack of a pagan view of the existence of Christ and a striking comparison of the actions and events of Christ’s life with the lives of mythological personalities / deities such as Mithras and Dionysus. He then raises the chronology of the origins of Christianity and presents a “good" case, but not the one that struck me. <br /> <br /> If the director stuck to the facts and continued with them, this film would be good. However, at this point in the film, he splits into a group of personality-pleasing attacks on Mel Gibson's “Passion of the Christ” and a private Christian school that the director attended in his youth. During an interview with my old director (who, as it turns out, it turns out that the director was framed under a false pretext), I felt that the director was being childish. He asked good questions, but, like the film itself, the interview collapsed in an attack on the rules of this particular private school, and not on Christianity. <br /> <br /> In general, if you are interested in some kind of information, watch the first 30 minutes or so, and then turn it off.
