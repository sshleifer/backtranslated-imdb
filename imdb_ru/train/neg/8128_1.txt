Well, don't let my resume fool you. This movie sucks hard. But the worst movie ever? This film was terrible in the sense that people do not need to rack their brains to describe. But this is no worse than Manos: the hands of fate, hobgoblins, the horrors of the island of spiders or a small handful of films. As the review of the film sucks, it's terrible. Do not look at it without MST, otherwise you may have health problems. But there are worse films.
