This film has all the hallmarks of too many chefs spoiling the stew. Based on the autobiography of Shila Graham, it seems that the forces that can not be left alone. They could not decide whether it would be Graham or Fitzgeraldâ€™s story, and also how much they should gently twist, whatever the story. So a film that could become a story about two charming (Fitzgerald) and notorious (Miss Graham) characters becomes a boring soap opera, about which little tells us both. In addition to this, there is absolutely no period other than 1959. The awkward scene follows the awkward scene, and we have no idea where we are in history or how much time passes. However - and this saved the film for me - Kerr never looked nicer, and Peck, as always, is a very handsome man. They really make up a beautiful, mature couple, and I just wish they had the best material to work with. There is one scene that really works - Scott goes after Shiella while in a state of intoxication, and to see how these two usually refined stars knock each other, is very disturbing and gives some passing insight into what happens in relationships . In addition, the film is a missed opportunity and does not reach the classic height of the other works of Wald of the 1950s (PAYTON'S PLACE, THE BEST OF ALL).
