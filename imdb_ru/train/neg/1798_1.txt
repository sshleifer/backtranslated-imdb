How can the film be Ozzy Osbourne and still sucks? I just do not understand Trick or life managed to do it. It sucks and enjoy. <br /> <br /> “Trick or Treat” is one of those films that I have to warn people about. It is a vomiting vile atrocity, just pleading to see so you can feel so much worse. Trick or Treat has no redeeming factors. <br /> <br /> In a heavy metal film, he doesn't seem to understand what heavy metal is or what it represents. In this film, heavy metal looks unconvincing, and it was in 1986, probably in one of the most powerful hours of heavy metal. This is a real feat, albeit a negative one. <br /> <br /> Trick or Treat = so bad you’re mad at yourself for watching him. We hope that this simple equation will protect you from this brainless and limp movie.
