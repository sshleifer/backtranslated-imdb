The film is bad. Nothing special - just a children's film, in which there is nothing serious. Although there is one reason to watch this: animal talk. Some of them are so funny in what they say, you just can't stop laughing. So if you want to hear a dog in a pound of a dog saying “I am a Keyser Soze”, or another animal saying “You walk with a dead cat”, or many other funny liners, look at it. Because there is no other good movie to watch it. Vote: 4 out of 10.
