Wow, and I thought that any movie about Stephen Seagal was bad. Every time I thought that the film could not deteriorate, he argued that I was wrong. The story was good, but the actors could not stand it. In addition, they made a lot of mistakes in how to properly conduct archaeological excavations. For example, you do not process artifacts until they are cataloged and recorded. The biggest crime in casting was an archaeologist girl. She is a weak actress, and I felt that her game really made the film less realistic than it already was. The idea that the Templars had been underground all these years seemed to me rather stupid. I like the idea of ​​how they disappeared and stuff, so it seemed almost depressing. I thought the characters didn't explain well enough. You did not find a lot of background, and this complicated the relationship with them.
