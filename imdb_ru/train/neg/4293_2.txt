“Raincoat”, released in 1956, is one of the best actors of its time. Katherine Hepburn, Lloyd Bridges and Burt Lancaster are major players. Even they cannot save it completely according to the current melodrama. First, Hepburn is terribly mistaken as a shy girl - despite her great actress, even she cannot cope with it. She is too strong to be believable, because she is too simple and too old for this role. Lancaster acts to the extreme, and Count Holliman is too boorish and looks like Jethro Clampett. Only Bridges and the ever-reliable Wendell Corey seem to rise slightly above the actors — but even they can do so much. It seems that the 1950s were a time when Katherine Hepburn wanted to spread her wings as an actress a little, and that’s fine. She just made a bad choice here. Fortunately for her fans (I was among them), she did not make too many of them. Despite the excellent composition and good performance, it does not work.
