This piece of shit, since I cannot call it a film, can be summarized as follows. <br /> <br /> - A stereotypical black criminal with a black dwarf partner got into trouble - A black dwarf pretends to be a child with a fully developed adult face, body hair and genitals. The black dwarf is mistaken (somehow) by men and women who want a child. They, and commit more crimes - a happy ending <br /> <br /> Honestly, this could be a good satire if there wasnâ€™t such a superficial director and there were such mediocre bastards in it.
