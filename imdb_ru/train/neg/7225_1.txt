I watched this movie, and I must say that he managed to keep my attention. The film would be a bit more tolerable if I didn’t have to watch the awful CGI for future use in the industry, if you’re going to use CGI, take a look at it so you know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> Apparently this should be a graphic novel for the screen, but all I saw was a bad film that has no resemblance to a graphic novel. <br /> <br /> In general, the story was not as bad as CGI. I was very impressed with the acting skills and thought that the casting was good, and a little more information about the character would be nice because it sometimes led me embarrassing, but this is not surprising, since I said that it only held my attention, but frankly, I would like me to miss it.
