If Todd Sheets came out and admitted that this film was intended to replace the zombie genre, I would change my rating to eight. Try to present a film in which every scene, scene and even every acting nuance was conceived as a parody. I could probably do with the alphabet soup, rearrange what was left of the letters, and still have the best script. I especially recall two scenes when I think about this film. CAUTION, SPOILERS! First, when Mike's dad and another dad walk, I repeat, going down the stairs filled with zombies. This is a small staircase, and although they come into contact with floating undead, nothing happens to them. When they reach the end, the former marine turns around, says, “God, you're an excited bastard,” and only one shoots. The other is in the military complex. Girl strikes a zombie with a machete and immediately surrounds. The camera moves around her for about forty seconds while she is surrounded by a zombie at arm's length. Then she almost casually runs out of the crowd and joins other people. SPOILER WARNED! These scenes must be visible to be believed. However, I enjoy this movie just like almost any comedy just because it's so damn funny. Kudos to Todd Sheets for having so many people in his film, and he has a desire to make him, but not for something else.
