I get a little tired of people misusing the name of God to perpetuate their fanatical world view. Well, I do not reject the idea of ​​Armageddon or the coming of the Antichrist, I reject the idea that only some people who live a really good life (they seem to be mostly white Christian children) will go to heaven and the rest of us must suffer the millennia of hell on Earth just because we are not good enough. God may be the judge, but I do not think that He will measure every level of goodness. Give the Creator some confidence.
