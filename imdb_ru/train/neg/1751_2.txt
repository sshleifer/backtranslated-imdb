We looked at Hulu (too much advertising!), So it broke the pace, but even so, it was like watching a really bad friendship film from the early sixties. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, where both roles are played by Jerry Lewis. If I were an Indian, I would protest against all men being corrupt, and women shrews. They deceived music videos for Western sales and used a lot of western models so that men could touch them. I usually like Indian films very much, but it was a big disappointment, especially for a modern Indian film. The story does not occur in India (uncle continues to refer to when Mac returns to India), but I can't figure out where this should be happening.
