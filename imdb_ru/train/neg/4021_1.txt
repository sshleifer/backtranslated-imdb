This is probably the worst movie ever made, it’s just bad that Roger Corman’s name is associated with it. I could understand this in his early years, when he had smaller budgets, but at present there are no excuses for giving birth to this! I'm a pervert of the movie "B", and from some people's point of view, all the films that I love are put off by "ordinary viewers", but, take my word, the vampire club ranks first on my list of the best of the worst. It's hard to imagine, vampires without fangs , the music is completely irrelevant, the sound effects are simply not effective, and finally, Mr. Savage does not seem to know that he is in a film about vampires, because he is too bad because he had a "not bad" career. Let me know that if I am very diligent about this, because when I do not like the film, I tend to forget about its good side.
