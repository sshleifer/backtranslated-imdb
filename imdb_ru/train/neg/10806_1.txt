If you're a fan of really bad movies and think it's funny there, then you will play Shaq well. First of all, itâ€™s almost never possible to put professional movie players. Shaq was the worst actor I've ever seen, alongside Dennis Rodman, who also made some bad films. Well, in any case, this film is also bad because of a disgusting child. I would give it a zero, but it is impossible.
