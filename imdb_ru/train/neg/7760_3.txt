In the Fiji Islands, the greedy and dishonest owner of Valalola Resort Primal Park invites investors and guests to the opening party of their hotel and zoo complex, with the goal of finding partners for their discoveries. When a bunch of little thieves from college injects a virus into the security system to participate in the hunt for rubbish, the zoo's greatest attractions ?? saber-toothes from the prehistoric age, developed on the basis of DNA found in fossils ?? run away, killing the hosts and guards for fun. <br /> <br /> The incredibly lame and cheap "Attack of the Sabretooth" is one of the worst films I have seen recently. The characters are terrible, not funny and not pleasant, and the story is a terrible robber of a Jurassic Park with a bad collection of clichés. Basically, all the lines and situations are poor and stupid, but the winner is when the guard explains that the Sabretooth is bulimic and loves to kill for pleasure. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): “About Attack to Dente de Saber” (“Attack of the saber-toothed”)
