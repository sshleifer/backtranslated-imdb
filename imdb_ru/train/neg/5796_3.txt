I saw this feature as part of the American Asian Film Festival in New York and was horrified by the graphic, BDSM, child pornography that I saw. The storyline is hidden under too many graphic sex scenes - and none of them is erotic - the more painful the feeling. The director seemed about to shake the value, and not explore the different levels of why these characters are like that. See if you can survive this - I still have memories.
