This embarrassment is for everyone and everything that was used to create this joke. I personally don’t care, Jessica Simpson and her talent or something else that many people find interesting in her. Just like a movie, this is something that will not even get a passing score in film school. The script is a mess, the game is terrible, and the fact that Luke Wilson (co-author of The Bottle-Rocket) did this makes me wonder what the hell he was thinking. He made Old School for a loud scream! This does not even refer to the same condition as my "Old School" DVD! Please for some reason DO NOT LOOK THIS! I see that there is a comment that it’s so bad, it’s good, but honestly, it’s too cute. When we stop seeing singers who obviously can't play, keep trying, I hope the end is over. Worst of all, there are some decent actors (Penelope Ann Miller, Rachel Lee Cook and Luke Wilson) who are part of this dump. As for the plot, it almost does not exist and is so poorly written and written (yes, I know that this is another paraphrase). I very much doubt that anyone will remember this. Please, whatever you do, do not waste your time, but if you do, take pity on the ACTUAL actors involved in wasting your time creating this bomb. Jessica Simpson, you're pretty, but you keep singing, although I'm not a big fan of that either. And whoever makes this film, I would not include it in your resume. 1/10, because you can not give zero.
