The fourth “Tremor” function dates back to time, to 1889. "The Legend Begins" in the small town "Perfection," then called "Rejection, Nevada." As the story begins, seventeen miners are murdered by horrible "robbers". Some characters in modern films “Tremor” in the past had ancestors, both figurative and literal. The most obvious is the ever-returning Michael Gross (like Hiram Gammer). Unlike his descendant, Mr. Gross does not know how to handle a firearm; so he hires the shooter Billy Drago (in the role of Kelly's Black Hand) to shoot them with “dirty dragons.” <br /> <br /> You need to get used to it - as it happens in the distant past, It’s like a western with miniature versions of the original monster of the film Graboids. These taming "dirty dragons" are not at all as terrorizing as their "tremors" (1990). Consequently, in this film, the characters spend a lot of time on the ground, which would not be the case in the original film. And it was strange that the citizens so quickly abandoned the struggle when Gross temporarily decided to leave the city. Why so helpless? Why did Brent Roam (like Juan Pedill) not immediately unite people to fight without Gross? Disappointing. <br /> <br /> **** Tremor 4: The Legend Begins (2004) ss Wilson ~ Michael Gross, Brent Roam, Billy Drago
