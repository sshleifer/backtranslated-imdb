One of the worst movies I've ever seen. My only thought was: "How can I get my money back from a Hollywood video?" It is in no way worth four dollars or any dollars. I think it was an attempt to disrupt Mexican films or Vin Diesel films, but it failed miserably. <br /> <br /> The game was terrible, I felt sorry for the actors, whom they could not find something better to do with their time. The story was ridiculous. We called the lines ahead of the actors, it was so predictable. The leading lady's Mexican accent was offensively exaggerated, worse than caricature. <br /> <br /> Skip this.
