Funny folly in London makes a treasure hunt, when a young woman involuntarily corrects her married politician father with a strong, independent pilot who has never been in love. An intriguing early machine for Katherine Hepburn, playing an air matrix like Amelia Earhart, who was too passionate about herself to indulge in any man. The director (Dorothy Arzner) and the screenwriter (Zoe Akins, who adapted Gilbert Frankauâ€™s book) were obviously assigned to this project to get a feminine point of view, but why do all the old cliches remain intact, like frozen artifacts? Billy Burke plays the role of a simple, weeping wife who goes to bed when something goes wrong, and the last scene of Hepburn is another bummer. Curious artifact, but not classic for observers Kate. ** from ****
