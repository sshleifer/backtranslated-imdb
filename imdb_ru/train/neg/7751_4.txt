First, the CGI in this film was terrible. I watched it during a marathon of bad movies on the SciFi channel. In the end, when the park owner is killed, this is probably one of the worst examples of CGI I have ever seen. Even the Night of the Living Dead had the best animation. <br /> <br /> However, there was almost no plot in the film. Why were they on this island in particular? Well, it was not indicated in the film. And why do people keep entering the cat area? It makes no sense. <br /> <br /> In this film, a moderately good acting game stood out. In what could be called the film "Made for Television", the acting was very good. Particularly distinguished Parry Shen. <br /> <br /> If you have absolutely nothing to do on Saturday, watch this movie. This may be good for some memorable quotes.
