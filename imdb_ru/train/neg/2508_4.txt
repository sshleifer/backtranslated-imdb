About the time they released this movie on DVD. I know that some people say that WB is in a hurry with the release of this film because of The Dreamgirls. But how can you rush to the release of the film, which is in your catalog since 1976. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed with the release of this film on DVD, without any special features, without the sound of 5.1 DD. come on WB, you can do much better than that. The sound and image quality in this film needs serious help. <br /> <br /> It seems that WB did not devote so much time and attention to this film because it is a black film and I have good sales. They could save a CD, which, by the way, does not contain all the songs that are on the original CD. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this DVD for purchase. Yes, because it is a classic film. But the WB need to add another feature. Take notes from other group films, "Five Heat Shocks" or "Temptation", where you can watch only the show, and the sound on both is much, much, much better than on this DVD.
