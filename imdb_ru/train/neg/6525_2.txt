I gave this film 2, and although I consider myself a fan of science fiction, it seemed to me that this film is very difficult to be taken seriously. One day, late at night, he was at AMC, and I'm glad I saw him for free. This film is probably good for some laughs, but not by much. <br /> <br /> Special effects are about average for a period of time - not terrible, but not very good. Of course, we now know more about Mars than at that time, but in fact we cannot accept this. The main reason I didnâ€™t like this film is the story. <br /> <br /> There were several parts of this film that I would like to study in more detail - the trauma / condition of the astronaut, the city on Mars, the creature in the lake, etc. In general, the film is in many ways similar to the long episode of The "external borders" of the 1960s, culminating in an inconspicuous finale.
