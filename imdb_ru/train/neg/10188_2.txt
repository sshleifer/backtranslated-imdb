This youthful, soft film is intended exclusively for teenagers in the bodies of old people who desperately need to experience the hormonal problems of adolescence. How ? Burning gas and equating a fast, reckless car (or plane) to freedom. <br /> <br /> The plot was heavily borrowed from the Mr. Rogers area (if he ran my oil conglomerate) and from Logan's Run (if this was largely calmed down and lacked a clear sense of style). <br /> <br /> Starring Lee Majors and Burgess Meredith this film is set in a post-gas crisis world in which the omnipotent government does not want you (* Um *) to drive and burn gas. Like the antithesis of today's Enron-and-Bush, an oil company, introducing government SUVs. <br /> <br /> This overlap alone makes the film laughable. But wait ... that's not all. Despite the fact that the film will be shown in the future, we will not be shown any signs of future technology, except to return to bicycles, golf carts and horses. You will believe that the future looks ... just like today. The same clothes, the same suburban houses, the same green lawns as today, when the film was shot. There are no solar panels, no windmills, no concessions to alternative energy. <br /> <br /> The game is flat and odorless. Even scenes that could be sandy or moving, friendly blows, honor, romance, horrors ... all flatter like a paper doll under a briefcase. <br /> <br /> Continuity is absent - the jet Character Burgess Meredith changes color and configuration from moment to moment when directors insult our intelligence again and again with unsurpassed shots. <br /> <br /> The plot is as moronic and only half as exciting as the episode with the dukes of Hazzard. <br /> <br /> Even stubborn fans of automotive films and science fiction films should avoid this film, for example, the monthly insane murder, unless you like the beaten-up Exxon executives who are trying to make the movie as empty as the heroâ€™s gas tank.
