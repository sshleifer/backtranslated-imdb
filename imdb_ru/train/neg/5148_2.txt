There are a lot of mistakes in this picture, starting with a script that is obvious and redundant. Courtney Cox plays a comic book artist who runs into a small deserted town after he was twice raped in a big city. She is immediately haunted by a local who looks rather upset (Craig Schaeffer), and who seems to be trying to emulate Mickey Rourke on the third level. D.B. Sweeney is a local policeman who allegedly protects and serves. Meanwhile, the script manipulates the audience as to who the really good guy is? The logic flies out of the window in the first ten minutes and never returns, and there are more unanswered questions than there should be. If you think the Blue Desert can be saved by the wonderful Philip Baker Hall, you will be disappointed. His role is insignificant, like the whole movie. - MERK
