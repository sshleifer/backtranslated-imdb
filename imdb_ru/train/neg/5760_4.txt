Well ... I was going to wait until it was videotaped to watch it, and I would like me to really catch the scary movie 2 on the cable the other day, and it made me crave more of the same thing that I have there was an PLANE on the CRACK ... I mean, if you love the Plane or any other Leslie Nielsen transport, then you will probably find yourself in heaven, but if you are used to usually WAYANS COMEDY, then you will be disappointed More eye candy in this one that will keep young hormones furious happy, therefore, It was a box office hit in the first week, when he came out. I liked the scary movie 2 times ten times more than this feed, and part one - 5 times more. It is strange that the best of 3 is part 2, but again, I always liked Halloween 2 better than the original. Maybe it's just me. The funny thing about the film is how foreigners say goodbye. But it was not worth the 11 dollars that I spent to catch the matinee with my fiance. Save money and catch part 2 on the cable again until it is released on videotape and then rent it, do not buy it.
