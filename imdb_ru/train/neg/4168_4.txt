Well, this movie started funny, but quickly deteriorated. I thought it would be more “adult-oriented” humor, based on the first few moments, but then the film switched to poor mode created for the Disney channel, especially in the racing kart scene, which was incredibly long. Alana de la Garza is gorgeous, but has a really fake Italian accent. The film looked and sounded very independent and with a low budget. There was one very cute moment, which I will simply call the serenade stage, but overall it was a yawn. Laughs very little and far from each other. The ultimate surprise for "Mr. Fix It" is so ridiculous that it left me more insane than anything else. It may be worth seeing if you can catch it for free or on TV, but don’t spend your money buying or renting this movie.
