One Star That's all this documentary deserves. I did not feel disappointed in watching a movie, let alone a documentary, for quite some time. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m a BIG fan of "Walk with ...", including his Nigel. Marvin stood out despite all his fun but informative information. And although the subject of a prehistoric person never interested me as much as other prehistoric creatures, the subject is still interesting and unique to study. After reviewing all the other documents in this series, I decided that I needed to see this one too, especially after seeing relatively good reviews in other places. <br /> <br /> Good for those of you who have a good overview of this document ... what did you think ?! lol. <br /> <br /> Although the information they were able to receive was interesting, the presentation failed in all possible ways. He had a terrible flow, he was incredibly focused on what he was trying to say (with information encrypted and sometimes inappropriate), terrible effects (including a few CGI moments and especially makeup effects) and excessive use of the MTV camera effects. <br /> <br /> Speaking about the effects of makeup, one reviewer mentioned how funny the scene was when cavemen run into this giant monkey and how it looks like a horror movie in a 70s costume, Well, there is there are many moments when people depicting monkey men looked ridiculous and behaved absurdly. None of this helps the horrific positions and compositions of the camera. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, none of them are shown in an interesting or dynamic way or look remotely real. It doesn't even seem like it was taken seriously. Also lacked an emotional blow, like the predecessors of the series. Remember the episode from "Walking with dinosaurs" about the fate of ornithoirus (sp?)? This episode still makes me cry every time I watch it. It is this kind of interaction with the subject that is most lacking here. When you are more busy with the subject and its own personal history, even speculation, you care more about the facts surrounding it. <br /> <br /> The only salutary grace of this production is a pretty good story. (at least in the BBC version I saw) and music. Otherwise, DO NOT THINK even rent this one if you do not want to laugh (which I often did, but usually followed by rolling eyes). This does not apply to the shelf with other documents "Walk with ...". <br /> <br /> Does it make sense to know that this document was NOT prepared or directly related to the same people who did the others in the series? Hmmm ...
