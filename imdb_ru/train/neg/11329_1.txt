Elizabeth Taylor could never act at all, and she was just her usual annoying, incompetent me in this film. It was before she got so fat, but she still looked very short and dull. Rock Hudson was fine, like Bick Benedict, but undoubtedly, an actor with a great range, like William Holden, would have been better. James Dean certainly proved that he knows how to mumble his film. The whole movie is incredibly slow and lasts too long. The actors were too young and light, and none of them got old because of bad makeup. Hudson looked ridiculous, because Dean and Carroll Baker were the same age. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
