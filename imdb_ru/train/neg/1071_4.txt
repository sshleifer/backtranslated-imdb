A very weak film, mainly because of a bad story, but also a bad game in the case of Robert Downey Jr. and the irrational behavior of many characters. If you like to turn off your mind and just watch a movie, because this is a creative approach or criteria for acting, then you might like this movie. Personally, I can not do this with the help of drama and I think it is too contrived. <br /> <br /> I’m especially annoyed when the main character, who is supposed to be an intelligent person, constantly acts like a total deranged person. In this film, if the main character acted as a person usually behaves in these situations, there would be no film. <br /> <br /> The first extremely unlikely action is when the main character, a successful lawyer named Magruder performed by Kenneth Brana, leaves the party and meets the girl Mallory Doss, played by Embeth Davidtz, who shouts that her car has been stolen. They stand around in a tropical rainstorm when he forces her to take a trip home. <br /> <br /> She tells him about her strange father, who belongs to some strange sect and does crazy things. When they arrive at her dilapidated hut in the poorer part of the city, they notice that her car is on the road. The lights in the house were also turned on, and some items in the house were broken. <br /> <br /> Everything is very strange, she is strange (she looks like a tramp, she undresses in front of him until she is completely naked? Yes!). In addition, the strange father, the house was destroyed - everything had to say to Magruder: “Hey, this is too strange for me, I'm leaving here!” But not Magruder, he sleeps with her, and then, motivated by her history and sex, begins an affair with an attempt to betray her father. It all screams about creation! <br /> <br /> Then, being the chief flight counselor who he is, he is late for the office, wearing the same shirt that he had the night before (a fact that all women in the office noticed). Is a successful lawyer likely to behave like a 16 year old? Magruder upset the police in some of his cases, so when he goes to the police, claiming with sufficient evidence that the father is terrorizing them, the police ignore him. I could believe I asked for help. But no help at all - hardly! <br /> <br /> This is too unlikely.
