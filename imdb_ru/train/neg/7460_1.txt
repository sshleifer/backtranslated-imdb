Corky Romano should be one of the most awesome and awesome comedy pieces ever created. <br /> <br /> Although sometimes funny Chris Kattan shot a very funny performance in a fun undercover Fellowship, his character Corky is so stupid and so funny - and that's a shame, because the premise is a great idea. Unfortunately, they ran out of them when they got to page 3 on the original.
