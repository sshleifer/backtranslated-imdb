If you want to see a backward gay karate expert beat several Mexican gangsters several times, then this film is for you. if not, choose another DVD from bunker 20c, which is the only place where this movie belongs the action was so terrible that I had to force myself to watch it to the end. Coverage makes it look so cool, but it's just another cheap gangster movie of class “b” in the spirit of 2 g and a key, bloody stritz and threat. I would not buy or rent this film if you do not plan to become stoned and plot, editing and acting are not really important to you. this is really the worst film in human history !!!
