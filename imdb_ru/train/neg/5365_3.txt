“Private Practice” stands out from the rather successful and well-written “Anatomy of Gray”. The cast is fabulous. The premise may even work. But the letter is just awful. <br /> <br /> The first pilot disguised as Gray's Anatomy was to be my first warning. The plot was just blah. I thought maybe it was an accident. Therefore, I set up the DVR to record the pilot and all other episodes. <br /> <br /> While I was looking at the pilot, I just wondered how a show with such a set of great actors could put together a boring pilot. It is assumed that the pilot absorbs people and makes them come back again and again. There should be excitement, a flash, excellent writing, an intriguing storyline with a climber to answer for the rest of the season. Surprisingly, there was nothing of the kind in this show. <br /> <br /> Thinking that it was an accident, I just watched the second episode, hoping for the best. And although a little better, it does not come close to what should be interesting, I can not miss the TV. <br /> <br /> I just deleted this show from my list of shows to watch. Not worth the effort IMO, and I would be very surprised if this show was even in the middle of the season. Pass it on to people.
