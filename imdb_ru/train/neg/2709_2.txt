The only way to get something from this film is to approach it as a comedy. In this light, it really delivers. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a serious film, look elsewhere. This film has absolutely no depth and offers only a superficial and one-dimensional analysis of the “questions” without any insight. <br /> <br /> Making a movie about stereotypes, and then turning each character in your movie into a stereotype. very bad strategy, especially when the same characters break their battered forms in a predictable, stereotypical way. <br /> <br /> Busta Rhymes and Ice Cube make the movie almost watchable, and Michael Rappoport makes a good presentation, but the script is so terrible, and the comments on social networks are so banal that it’s hard to find something useful.
