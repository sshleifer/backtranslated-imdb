This is probably the worst film I've ever seen, and I have a big appetite for horrible (and good) films. He could (simply) deal with some kind of humor humor, if he was constantly mocking - like ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, which was really very funny. Other films, such as NINE FROM OUTTER SPACE PLAN, can be fun, while (obviously) trying to be serious. As for acting, they seem to have gathered teenagers with dead brains and asked them to advertise the whole production. Compared to them, Tom Cruise looks like Alec Guinness. There was one decent interpretation - the fact that the older shikar on a motorcycle.
