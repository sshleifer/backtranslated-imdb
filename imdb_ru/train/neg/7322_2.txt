I will pay tribute when necessary, and say that Linda Fiorentino performs well in the role of a drunken actress who does what she wants. She is cheeky, cheeky, sharp-faced and very sexy; she is much better than this film deserves. <br /> <br /> But this is IT. This boring, unknown film is a fragmented mess trying to immediately become a pursuer thriller, a murder thriller, a tale of loyalty and betrayal, and a complete erotic thriller. The film, my friends, in no way care. <br /> <br /> For example, who thought about playing K. Thomas Howell as the desired lead character? He is not ugly, but in order to cry out loud, it seems that the goddess of hard cookies Fiorentino wears it with a kindergarten teacher. Howell has neither the authority nor the presence on the screen to play the main role. <br /> <br /> The script is by far the worst aspect of the film. There is no stress, as Fiorentino's character gets terrible phone calls, there is no mystery about her guilt in the killings that are in the spotlight of the film, there is no feeling of liberation, as Fiorentino becomes weak Howell to lose his inhibitions. <br /> <br /> Look for interesting, but poorly made cameos by Adam Anton and Isaac Heis, and one really, really good sex scene between Howell and Fiorentino. In addition, my first motivation would be to remove this pitiful piece of garbage and go rent something else.
