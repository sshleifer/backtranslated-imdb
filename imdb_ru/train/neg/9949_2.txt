This movie could be much better if you rewrite the script. Not that I expected a lot of credibility in the films, but you might think that even the homeless and urban Jack Mason wonders why a group of experienced hunters would like to hire him as a hunting guide. And, having reached the hunting grounds, poor Ice-T plays its role, as if intending to lead these people through the forests that he had never seen before. <br /> <br /> And how does Jack Mason find Thomas Burns in Seattle? <br /> <br /> I assume that this film is based on Richard Connellâ€™s The Most Dangerous Game. Several years ago I showed this film to 9th grade students after they read the story. I reissued the film, cutting out all meaningless scenes and all the profanity. This ended for 43 minutes.
