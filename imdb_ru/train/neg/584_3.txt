This film, like the first (“The Man from the Snowy River”), has the same good and bad features, perhaps even more than the original.

Tom Berlinson is still a nice guy, like "Jim Craig." Bruce Rowland also worked well with music. <br /> <br /> BAD - Once again we got the extremely nasty feminist heroine "Jessica" (Sigrid Thornton), who is a world class pump with an extremely annoying face and manner about her. In this film, we also get a big drop in who pays the father. Previously, it was Kirk Douglas, now it has always been replaced by the profane Brian Dennehy. Speaking of which, it is a shame that the Walt Disney movie will involve using the name of the Lord in vain. This was one of the reasons why the work was almost completely stopped in the 1980s.
