I wanted to break through the TV. Watch it was a torture. I hated it. Never watch this movie. Terrorists are annoying. Adam Sandler is annoying. I usually like it, but not in it. I wanted to break the DVD. This is the most annoying movie in the world. The comedian he envies is disgusted. The only distantly funny part is the black-rocked rocker who gets all the girls. It was so annoying that I wanted to break through the TV. DON'T BUY THIS FILM IF YOU DON'T WANT A FEW If you even like Adam Sandler a little, do not buy it. It just makes you hate him. Do yourself a favor if you see it in the store, hide it to keep everyone from buying it. This is a waste of $ 1.99, which I paid for it.
