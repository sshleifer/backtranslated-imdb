The film begins with a couple of holidaymakers, a man and a woman, supposedly together, hiking through the vast desert. Of course, the person hears something, and this is so torturing him that he goes to investigate it. Our killer greets him with a blow to the stomach. Then he chases the girl and cuts her throat. The camera during the first scene - from the point of view of the killer. <br /> <br /> Then we meet with our four main characters, two pairs, one of which is on the rocks. Men joke about the fact that a woman will never be able to cope with a hike alone on a double date, which awakens the desire of a blonde blonde to leave a week earlier. Suddenly, the men leave the same day, and their car breaks down. They end up arriving in the evening. When the men arrive, they are warned about the disappearance of people in the woods by the crazy doppelganger Ralph. They ignore the warning and go to a black night, and in the background the song of the eighties plays with the lyrics of a murder in a dark forest. Men get lost. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, we realize that this is not just another Flaming Clone, but a ghostly story! Women, frightened and lonely, huddled by the fire. Two children appear in the shadows and decide to play peeping Tom. Well, they are obviously ghosts by the way their voices sound! Their mother appears with blood dripping from a hole in her forehead, and asks the two ladies if they saw her children before disappearing, of course. <br /> <br /> Children run home to dad and tell him about two beautiful ladies by the river. This causes a real stir, and he gets up, grabbing his knife from the fireplace. “Daddy is going on a hunt,” exclaims a little girl with a bad game. It is obvious here that dad is not a ghost like his children. <br /> <br /> Excited by something in the forest, the symbolic blonde breaks up, blindly running at night, carrying a knife. She meets her father, who explains that he is hungry, and it will be fast. It does not make sense because of the growl of the panther we heard earlier (Maybe he is allergic! Are the panthers honest even in California?) She ends up hurting him a little before getting a headache. The storm breaks out, and people seek shelter, which turns out to be where dad lives. Obviously, someone lives here because there is fire and something strange is being fried over it. Children appear and warn them about dad, who appears in a moment. They disappear as soon as he arrives. <br /> <br /> For some reason, our killer only persecutes women. He invites men to eat and tells the story of his ex-wife. We remember how his wife was caught cheating. However, the old man does not tell them that he subsequently kills her and her lover, but dreams of it. We are not given the cause of the death of children. Men go to bed and remain unharmed. The next morning, the men discover the empty camp of their wives. After a brief discussion, they broke up. One of them is to stay in the campsite, and the other leaves and receives assistance. Whoever returns to his car, breaks his leg. Then we reunite with the children when they explain to the surviving woman that they are ghosts who killed themselves because of sadness about their mother. They agree to help the woman reunite with her friends. <br /> <br /> The next scene defies the logic of a movie when dad kills a guy waiting in a camp. He also met or married a blonde. Somehow, the children understand that he was killed, and tell the woman about it. She decides to see it herself and, obviously, encounters the murderer. Fortunately, the children make him stop, threatening to leave him forever. You know where it goes. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film deserves four stars out of ten, and this is generous. Despite all the concerns, the musical score is well done. It is still watchable too. There are several angles that look professional, and some sets are well made. The plot is incredible. There is such a thing as a voluntary suspension of unbelief, but with a toad 6 miles away; I can not imagine that the symbolic blonde will soar at night. I mean, come on! <br /> <br /> - Alan "Skip" Bannacek
