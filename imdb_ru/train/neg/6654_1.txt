I usually do not think that Hollywood productions can be called cinema, so I call them "movies." But this piece of ivory dung is not even suitable for being called a film, so there are quotes in the title. <br /> <br /> How do I start? 1. If this is not the beginning of a geriatric refusal, it is certainly its embodiment. It is assumed that Stephanie Powers will play someone, even LESS than half of her age, she must play at the age of 18, and she URGENTLY turned TWO !!!! <br /> <br /> 2. The horrible and stupid senseless image of Paris and France, where we see such cliché characters as: the responsive owner of a grumpy store, the bitchy queen of models, the fairy-tale mother goddess, the former queen of models, etc. This film is surpassed only in this respect for the Da Vinci Code (which the reviewers correctly identified was a comedy). <br /> <br /> 3. It’s very, very funny not to have nudity in a movie about the time and place where nudity was so common, especially if all the attention was focused on that <br /> <br /> 4. Terrible accents !!! <br /> <br /> 5. Music of the elevator Nana Muskuri !!! <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think that is enough. And I was able to make these observations after seeing this shit in just half an hour, while surfing the Internet and talking with friends about mathematical equations ... I mean ... !!!!! <br /> <br /> I invite everyone to add to my list. :): P: D
