An anthology is always a risky business, and I think this undertaking deserves praise. There are many talents involved. A lot of talented actors, directors and writers. Unfortunately, I could not really enjoy this film, based on the three problems that I had. <br /> <br /> First of all, the segments are incredibly different in tone and quality. And, unfortunately, some of them face others. <br /> <br /> Secondly, some segments seem to me to be underdeveloped. Like the seeds of good stories that never come true. I'm not talking about happy ends here (or even about the end of the period), rather, they lack even basic development or even solid installations that attract you. <br /> <br /> And last but not least, I didnâ€™t feel New York and its inhabitants were depicted properly. <br /> <br /> What you have left are short, short films that may be interesting for some, but leave the average viewer unsatisfied.
