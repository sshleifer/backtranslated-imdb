I assume that this film is based on some true story ... He talks about two young girls who molested an adult man for 48 hours; I donâ€™t see where terror comes into play here ... There are some "weird" and "surreal" episodes in the film. And the two girls (Sandra Locke and ... ah ... oh well) play a roll of two psychomachine haters to the hilt ... they do a pretty good job (although some of them are just a little higher). The film is not good, and it is not terrible, it is just really outdated! I mean, this thing has been dripping since the 70s ... It's not so bad if you like these things ... do you know ... thank you?
