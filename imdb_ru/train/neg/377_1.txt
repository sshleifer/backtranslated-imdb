Don't even ask me why I watched this! The only excuse I can come up with is that I got sick with bronchitis and was too weak to change the channel. :) It's too scary for words, it's a movie, not a bronchitis. The action is terrible, Richard Grieco considers him a happy trigger with a serial killer with a gun in his hand and a tendency to shoot down policemen. Nick Mancuso calls in the play as a cop on his way, and Nancy Allen manages to play the only sympathetic role in the whole film. The script is grim, dotted with cliché lines: “Are you ready, Pardner?” Richard Greco purrs to each of his victims. Dire. Avoid.
