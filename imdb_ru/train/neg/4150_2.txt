Oh, it really is. I saw films that I no longer liked for any reason, but I never saw a film that just fails in every aspect of filmmaking. He does not even fail when shooting a film, as one might say about Hercules in New York. This is not the movie that I like the least, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Acting is the first thing that hits you. I have never seen a worse film acted outside pornography. In fact, I have a lot of pornographic films that acted damn site better than that. This is really terrible. <br /> <br /> Technically it's terrible. Camera work amateur. Editing is meaningless. I assume that they could not afford proper sound equipment, and this meant that each scene in the car (and there are many) makes them drive at a speed of about three miles per hour, and each scene goes beyond the same forest area. (and there are a lot of them too) actually duplicated from the studio, again began to give out loans more bad porno vibe. <br /> <br /> the plot is meaningless, as many have already noted. I will protect the vampires walking in daylight, because, despite the fact that Nosferatu popularized them, it was not originally an integral part of the vampire myths. <br /> <br /> Speaking about the vampire myths, the writer obviously read Carmilla or at least saw the Vampire Lovers. I’m not sure how I feel about it, swaying from the impression that this horrible film has at least some aspirations for a gothic novel, which I love very much; or annoyed at best with a sledgehammer link and at worst a complete desecration of the source material. At least the “General” is an insult to Peter Cushing. <br /> <br /> However, he gets two stars, simply because I cannot bring myself to vote for one star for a film that has, or at least means, vampires and zombies. By the way, on the same day I watched Lifeforce (another film in which vampires and zombies were depicted viciously), and, despite the fact that it is in itself a rather incorrect film, it really became a masterpiece compared to this. <br /> <br /> So in the end, it's not such a bad movie, it's good or bad, but in any case, pleasant, even drunk. It’s just a mess and you shouldn’t watch.
