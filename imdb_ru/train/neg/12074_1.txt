A funny horror film about a rich man (John Carradine) who dies and leaves everything to his four children, and his servants need to be divided equally. One condition - they have to spend one week in their estate to get money. And if one of them dies, others will get more. Guess what will happen next .... <br /> <br /> I saw a new print of this movie on the cable. The colors were bright and vibrant, and the house itself looks beautiful. This is about all the good things I can say about it. <br /> <br /> Let's list only some of the problems of this film: the killer is obvious; servants name is Igor and Elga - come on!; part of the sound recording was so bad that I could not make out the dialogue (I am sure, without a great loss); blood was rare and very poorly made; the other murders were just boring, stupid or impossible, and there are really disgusting actions in this film - so bad that you just look incredulous at the screen. Even about Jeff Morrow was awful! The only pretty good game was from the Faith Domegge troupe (which deserved better) and John Carradine (who looks painfully old and fragile here). I have to admit that the final line in this film is a pearl! <br /> <br /> Why this name was renamed “Blood Legacy”, I do not know - there is another 1978 horror film with such a name! <br /> Whatever his name is, this is a bad movie. Avoid at all costs.
