"Home Alone 3" - the first of the films "Home Alone", in which Culkin and the same villains do not play the main role. Nevertheless, the plot is very similar to the original film "Home Alone". Instead of two comedic villains, we get three or four of them. There are several pitfalls in this film, but it also has a long scene with a remote-controlled car. The humor of the farce is also constant, but the young man and the villains really cannot make an impact in this film. (No pun intended.) This film does not offer anything new or different from previous films, and in fact there is no such warm, festive feeling or storylines as the other two films. It’s rather a pure comedy, but it couldn’t make me laugh, because the characters really didn’t do that for me. I would not recommend this film; it's pretty boring. If you're looking for a good family movie with comedies, watch the original Alone at Home movie.
