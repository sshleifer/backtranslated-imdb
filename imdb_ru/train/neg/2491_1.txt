Maiden Voyage is just like that. I would like to immediately say that I watched 5 minutes of this before I just could not bear it anymore. As mentioned in another comment, this film does not fall into the whole thing “so bad, it's good,” it’s just bad. The game is terrible, the sphinx is poor, and the story is boring and stupid. Even extras suck, “guards in bags” and the like seem to hold their weapons like water pistols. <br /> <br /> Don't even worry about watching this movie, the only thing special about it is that how low your expectations are, you will still be disappointed.
