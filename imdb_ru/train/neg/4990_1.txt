I can enjoy guilty pleasure, but this is just bad. And not as bad as you could see, as MST3K makes fun of it. It's just sickeningly bad, because you can't find anything to enjoy it, no matter how hard you try. I'm really sorry I spent 2 hours of precious life on this shit. After watching it, you can say that no one was asked to play, and everyone in it knew that this film would only bury their careers. Apparently, “Walking High” earned enough money so that someone would decide that they could make money on their investments. If this is not the worst movie I've seen, it is so bad that it erases the worst movies from my memory.
