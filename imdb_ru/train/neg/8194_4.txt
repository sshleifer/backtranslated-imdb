How difficult is it to write a watchable movie with Vince Vaughn, Paul Jamatti and Kevin Spacey? Apparently VERY difficult for authors here. <br /> <br /> I still have no idea how Santa is younger and looks 20 years older than Vince (who plays the BIG brother). I must have missed that part of the story, but in fact it didn't matter. Many scenes seemed out of place and contrived; The plot of the "ridiculous concept" in which drugs go too far from the place where the sense of comedy is lost. <br /> <br /> The director / producer at the end tried to make a “tear-pull”, which would be nice if ANYTHING leading up to this point were worth following. <br /> <br /> Ugh, a big disappointment. I can see how some people will like it, as many people will take any trash that feeds them, but I highly recommend waiting for a DVD on this. It does NOT cost the 23,978 dollars that are required to bring your family to the movies these days.
