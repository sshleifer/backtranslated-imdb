An indecisive attempt to attract Elvis Presley to modernity, but despite the sexual emotional scene and plot of pseudo-playboy, Presley is surrounded by the same old shy click cliche. The woman chooses E.P. on the beach, and then continues to capture his life - and he seems to care! Dick Sargent is frazzled on the other sidebar, but Don Porter and Rudy Valli (!) Do their best, like Elvis’s two bosses (you see, he is moonlighting). Some of the songs are pretty good, especially “Almost Lovers,” but if you want to see Elvis's freer, hippies, rejuvenated sex comedy - look elsewhere. When Elvis and his Fateful Attraction fall together in bed, between them is actually a wooden board! Become a real one. ** from ****
