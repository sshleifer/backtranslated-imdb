A wonderful composition cannot raise this ordinary story about a secretary killed by her married lover. In fact, in this one-sided story of the novel and the murder, there are more questions than answers; and since we are only given the prosecution, none of these questions will be answered. This is the type of fare that applies to American clubs "He Woman, Man Hater". As presented, this is a story about an innocent woman who, as it turned out, was “stuck” in a novel with a married high-ranking lawyer. Is it possible that if she hadn’t chosen her two girlfriends and started an affair with a married man, it would have been possible to avoid the whole disgusting, murderous, dirty incident? When you watch this, do not worry about going to the refrigerator, you do not miss anything.
