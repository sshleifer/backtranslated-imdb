It was a disappointing film for me. He came to me through a boxed set called “Classic Film Noir”, which was donated by someone who knows that I usually like movies made in this style (I insist that noir is a style, not a genre). I do not think this is a film noir at all. It seems that today there is a tendency to label and advertise every black and white B-film, shot from 1947 to 1955, as a noir, and this label is not always suitable. There is a pursued male protagonist, Ed Cullen (Lee J. Cobb), and most of the film’s action takes place indoors. These are almost the only elements of noir that I could see. There is no widespread paranoia or any real reason for sympathizing with Ed Cullen. Jane Wyatt was dressed and unconvincing as a femme fatale. I do not want to spoil this movie for potential viewers. However, I would be interested to hear what other film lovers of the film have to say about it.
