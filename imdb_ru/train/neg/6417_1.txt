As comments like the one that the high school students were heading to even appear on this site, it was the stupidest film I've ever seen, it was funny how any dumbass could sit and say that just because the film does jump you is a good movie, it may be the most idiotic thing I have ever heard, I could sneak up behind you and go “Boo” and it would make you jump, but that does not mean that I am qualified to write or send the film, not to mention the fact that "they all tied up in a con This is not a good reason for the film to be well received. Whatever film it was, if they hadn’t tied it all together, I think it would make it half and not the whole film. So basically this idiot complements them for finishing the film, and I like the fact that today's young people keep the media and production companies at such a high level. No wonder that the political system of this country can get away with whatever they want, such idiots appear in our country, what happens if this girl really ever leads something, it’s a scary thought. Take life and go see a real movie someday, try “Escape from the Shoushenk” or “On the Embankment”, or something like that, and do not comment that it was “boring” after you see it, just use that little brain that God gave you to analyze it a little.
