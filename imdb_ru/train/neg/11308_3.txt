<br /> <br /> Take your brewskies and enjoy this incorrect fighter. Speakman's kempo's considerable mastery (good blows to the back, decent with clubs is a bad couch!) Is the only redeeming quality of the film that simply screams about a bad game. The plot is not half bad; just done pretty badly. But if you watch this film for anything other than martial arts, you completely miss the boat. And for the film, to be held in Koreathaun, too few Korean actors (even extras).
