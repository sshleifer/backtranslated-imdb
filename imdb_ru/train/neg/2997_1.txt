It was taken down closely with the reprinting of the famous Lost World novel by Conan Doyle in 1992. And it shows. <br /> <br /> The film starts quite promisingly, with a ruthless organization intending to exploit the lost world, and the Challenger and others. They return to protect the prehistoric plateau, but then they go down. Everyone was stuck on a plateau, and we still have a weak, boring, overly long rehash of the first film. <br /> <br /> Dinosaurs (which are almost never seen) are ridiculous. Should we take this pleasant toy, which should be ankylosaurus seriously? And the tyrannosaur seems to be rooted in place. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and use the quiet version of the Lost World of 1925. Incredibly, in our age of CGI and other advanced effects, the twenties version is the best and will remain so until someone finally decides to make a decent rework.
