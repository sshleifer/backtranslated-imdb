I just had evidence that confirmed my suspicions. A group of children from 14 to 22 years old are recording a fantastic mega-screen for home entertainment on the Titanic DVD. Only two of them have actually seen this before. But they all saw the moment Kate, Leo and Celine Dion so many times that most of them felt they had seen the whole movie. Shortly after the epic began, they began to worry, some of them left to ask others: "Call us when an iceberg appears." One and a half hours in the film, only two girls who saw the film were still there before. They started shouting: iceberg, iceberg. A crush followed, and they all returned to see the sinking Titanic. They sat with their mouth open, emitting Oh and far. So, as I thought when the movie first appeared on the scene. What is it? An hour and a half waiting for the bloody thing, but what about the rest of it. For example, Dr. Zhivago had a similar time, but think how much everything happens in this film over the same period of time. In "Titanic," Leo teaches Kate how to spit. Look at the faces and hands of the supposedly cream de la creme in the first-class dining room of the ship. Look at the historical details if you can find them. The storyline is so thin that they have to introduce weapons and shooting into a ship that is about to sink. The real tone here is cinema standards. All efforts are focused on special effects and first weekend. The film has become the highest grossing film of all time, so I know?
