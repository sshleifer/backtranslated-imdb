I made this film in the library (it is difficult to find it for a good reason) simply out of curiosity. I am a big fan of Plat, and this film was a complete disappointment. The Bell Jar (1979) is definitely one of the worst films I've ever seen. The script is terrible not because it deviates from the original text of the novel, but because it deviates from the goal or intention. Scenes are poorly constructed and do not lead the viewer anywhere. What a hoarse voice over Plat's poetry? Lady Lazarus has little to do with the situation with Greenwood; Plato's poetry was completely misused. Marilyn Hassett is completely unbelievable in the role of Esther Greenwood (or any 20-year-old in this regard), partly because of the casting (she was 32 years old during the shooting, Plath’s age was when she died) and partly because she wasn’t can act. Hassett is all emotion, no craft, no skill. The direction is mediocre; the director simply talks about what is there, and that is not much. The only reason I give film 1 is because 0 is not an option. Sorry, Sylvia, you have to wait until someone else adapts your beautiful work to something more appropriate.
