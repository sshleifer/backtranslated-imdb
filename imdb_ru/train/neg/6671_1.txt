I felt that this movie started well. The game was in place, and I felt the situation of all the characters, although the true family unit was not fully disclosed. We have never had enough information about his father to truly feel his pain for all his involvement or the growth of his enmity with Tobe. I mean that in one scene you see how he admires her, and in the other - he almost tears off her head. Another problem with the film was that it just fell apart and lost all attention by the end, and I begged him to just end it. Any film with such a long and painful finale should never receive an automatic rating of 7 or higher just per action. We look at all the quality of the film. In the case of this film, the end is so bad that I seriously thought about just getting out of the theater. This film pulled me, and then just spat out.
