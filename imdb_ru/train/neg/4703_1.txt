"Show me your tits!" it's not funny, and certainly not on the channel that shows cartoons, if you know where I'm from. I do not want my 6-7 year old daughters to think so or hear it. I am sad that Nick unwound this nonsense SO, and then this is what we got, stupid little children who act like stupid adults. I know it must be funny, but keep in mind that we have cute little innocent girls in K and 1st grade who can't wait to see it. I had to comment on how disappointed I was when I saw this. My daughters will not watch this. I would love to block Nick, but I wouldn’t have the heart, but if Nick continues to produce such nonsense, I’ll have to.
