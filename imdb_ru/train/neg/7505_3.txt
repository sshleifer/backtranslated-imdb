It turns out that this multi-layered film is not so much about Berkovitsa and its influence on New York City, but about drawing caricatures of some group of Italians-Americans whom the locals call “Gvidos”. The problem is that Guidos are uninteresting, no matter what story or setting they are immersed in. They are already living cartoons, so Lee only strengthens them, not just portraits. <br /> <br /> When someone makes a caricature of himself, he doesn’t go home and say, “Hey, let's make our ears and nose even bigger!” This is what Lee did in this film. The most interesting characters in the film are the two (Adrian Brody and Jennifer Esposito) who want to avoid the Guido lifestyle. Complete this uninteresting storyline for the characters, especially John Leguizamo, and you will get a good movie to fall asleep. Especially when you consider that he runs for a long time. <br /> <br /> Another blow to him: for someone who has declared himself a Yankee fan and grew up in New York, Spike Lee should know how to spell Phil Rizzuto what is written wrong in the closing credits.
