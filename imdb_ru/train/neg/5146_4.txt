For a long time I was looking forward to seeing this film, here in Latinamerica, Japanese or some Oriental films are not distributed in cinemas, some of these films can be found in some underground stores, and I just found Avalon, I was expecting something is good, but the only good thing about this film is the first scene, the rest of the movie is boring and meaningless, just silly, with a lot of useless scenes and a boring story. I spend my time even writing about this film. Sorry, but this is true.
