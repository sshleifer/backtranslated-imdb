Ah, Channel 5 of the local Mexican television. Every day, at 2 am, they show horror films from the 70s to the early 2000s. It was the movie "Return to the Lake House", which was released yesterday. Sorry to watch it. <br /> <br /> The original “Lake Hut” was popular with people on a budget and was well received. The problem is that this continuation is terrible, not even by accident, and is trying to imitate the original. Ugh. The plot is really stupid in every sense of the word. <br /> <br /> In some moments, the film looks like a soap opera due to its absurd dialogues, cinematography and direction. <br /> <br /> My advice: avoid it at all costs. This is a movie that no one should watch. Even for fans of mediocre filmmaking. <br /> <br /> You have been warned.
