I read about this movie in a magazine, and I was intrigued. A woman who once sees her driving by. Well, I thought it might be interesting ... <br /> <br /> ... but it is not. First, the name. Broken? Broken ... what? What is broken? ... oh wait ... I understand, the name itself is "broken"! Wow, smart! Unfortunately, this is practically the only thing connected with it. <br /> <br /> The essence is not so bad, but I think that Kiefer Suderland has achieved much better results in Mirrors. It is a cross between the invasion of the kidnappers and body mirrors and is rather mediocre. A more appropriate title would be “Boring,” as it paints every scene for bloody ages. Or, maybe, “Fallacy”, since it doesn’t explain anything at all, either in the narration or in the story itself, only some vague idea of ​​evil copies and the like, strewn with cheap scares and scenes that were used to death, but nothing tangible. It is just confusing. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, acting and special effects are pretty good, but again, this is not a difficult role. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie twice, I still feel dissatisfied, perhaps a little embarrassed, and not in the style of EA Poe or Stephen King. Do yourself a favor, and do not watch it. Simply put, there are better thrillers out there.
