This movie is not as terrible as most movies on the Sci-Fi Channel. I’m used to seeing gray CGI drops and amateur special effects, such as close-ups of fake blood, which make it very obvious that the blood is strawberry syrup or some other type of syrup. However, I thought I had seen all the possible minimums that a science fiction channel could reach. Then I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> Imagine a hand inside a rubberized sock that is glazed with syrup? These are the main alien vampires in this movie. You can clearly see the fingers inside the puppet's rubber socks. The talking hand comes out of the victims' guts, and the vampire who is part of the Vampire Hunter team can talk to these puppets from the rubber toe in Transylvania. How did the alien vampires learn the Transylvanian language? Isn't Transylvania in Romania? So shouldn't they speak Romanian? Why is there a language in some small town? If you can stop your gag reflex and walk past talking rubber socks with fingers that move clearly in the heads of the aliens; then you will have to deal with other alien vampires. There are “Leather faces” that love to wear the faces of their victims. Then there are just ugly ones that all seem to have a lot of facial scars. Then there are the annoying Girls from the Valley and their boys, who are human traitors and sneak into space colonies so that they can sabotage the Defense Systems so that these Space Vampires can attack. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you think that all of the above is ridiculous and worth laughing, you have to deal with the third failure rating of Network Television, which make up this team of stereotypical evil heroes who constantly fight each other. Why do almost every movie in the Sci-Fi Channel use protagonists that are annoying, abrasive, rude, or simply not sympathetic? I was hoping that talking rubber socks would win.
