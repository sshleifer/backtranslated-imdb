Do you know this feeling of joy that arises when you watch a film that tries so hard to be serious, thought-provoking, and fail? When you can't stop laughing at the terrible nature of the garbage littering your screen? The House of the Dead is struggling to achieve even such a low level of cinema. <br /> <br /> From start to finish, the House of the Dead manages to recreate the feeling that you just woke up to find out. that the cat gently laid a curl on his forehead while you were sleeping. From the outset, it is clear that female actors were chosen for their split size (which they use shamelessly), while men are for their hardcore "fucking" attitude. I honestly didn’t care about any of the characters at any time in the film and found that I really wanted to die to save me from this painful hour. Uwe Boll had to consider showing a two-hour footage from the game itself as a movie. At least, then, will we play better? However, not all the blame can be placed on the actors, since it is not an easy task to create a convincing film, faced with the script of this film. This is perhaps the worst section of the film and in fact contains such lines as: “These are zombies, clean and simple” and “No, do not, we should not go there! This evil!". <br /> <br /> We all know that movies about zombies will never be especially provocative or meaningful; at best, these are harmless two hours of action, bloody and hidden horror. Rubbish, yes, but entertaining rubbish. Not the garbage that comes out of your garbage bag when you drag it around the room and strangle your shoes in boxes of sour milk and decaying banana peel. According to IMDb, The House of the Dead received such bad reviews that not a single cinema in Denmark bought this film. If we had the same privilege. <br /> <br /> Final score: 1/10.
