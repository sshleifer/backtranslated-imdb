I totally agree with jamrom4 .. it was the worst movie I've ever seen ... damn it, it was terrible .. I was warned not to see it ... and stupid I watched it anyway .. after about 10 minutes after the agonizing experience, which I was completely disappointed in watching the evil deed ... but stayed through ... just to see if I could ... well, I did, and now I would like me not to have it. .. it was disgusting .. nothing happened and the end is all lost .. but the film that bad has the right to survival .. I beg all of you to excite myself from the horror of fatty bus drivers .. if only I had taken into account the same warning .. please save yourself from this film .. I have a feeling that those who highly appreciated it were involved in making the film .. and all must be erased from the face of the planet ..
