I just watched this film, and I must say that, although at first some effort was made to produce a decent film, it was absolutely terrible - but not in the sense in which I was sure. <br /> <br /> It was like a child directing this insult to the mind with the conviction that all potential viewers are morons OR extremely difficult to entertain OR both ... Thank God for rewinding! I can not imagine the type of viewer that the producer had in mind when making this film. I mean, you have actors trying to be serious, although hardly, and a script that requires a complete rewriting ... I just can’t say it anymore. If “Harlequin Romance” decided to make horror films, it would be a good effort. <br /> <br /> If you found this movie fascinating, I strongly recommend that you find a guide for the purpose of films. There is much better fare. Join the club, READ REVIEWS, but above all, avoid this kind of crap.
