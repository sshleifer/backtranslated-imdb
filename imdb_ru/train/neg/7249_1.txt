This film competes with Plan 9 as one of the dumbest films ever made. Always be concerned when the same person: <br /> <br /> 1. Star 2. Director 3. Producer 4. Writer 5. The stuntman and 6. The editor. Unfortunately, Justin Crainbrink completed all 6 tasks! IMDb shows that he and his father were Western “stuntmen”. So perhaps this was the problem. <br /> <br /> Here is just one example from the film: in the film, the sheriff must take a witness to another city for protection. Of course, the bad guys will find out and wait for them. But what happens? The good guys go ahead, shot out and hit the tree beside them. When the camera shows us the bad guys, they all just sit on the log and chat. What is wrong with this picture! <br /> <br /> I could continue. Perhaps this film was conceived as a comedy. If so, this is also not very good.
