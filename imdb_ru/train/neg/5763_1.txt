<br /> <br /> "Stand back for the veterans of Hollywood?" (Wayne brothers "asked") is what hollyweird required, and this is what he got. However, like many of his recent decisions, this was a colossal mistake. <br /> <br /> Directed by TAK does not communicate with today's audience, trying to return the physical traps and jokes instead of a funny dialogue, just a disaster. I knew it, the audience knew it, and CAST knew it. <br /> <br /> What a shame, why did they EVER consider a change of directors? Not only that, but also two Wyhan brothers played for two of the four main characters, without them itâ€™s just a farce and sad. <br /> <br /> SP <br /> <br />
