A rural family drama — perhaps with the slope of Ordinary People — concerns a young boy who retreats after being fatally injured by his elder brother in an accident. Despite the depressing theme (given the ruthless grim interpretation of director Christopher Cain), there is some dynamics in this sad story, which is worth studying. Unfortunately, the isolated rural atmosphere and the reluctance of adult characters to take responsibility for the situation make the film a stunning experience. With Robert Duvale, Glenn Close, and Wilford Brimley in the cast, the film is an almost small-scale reunion of "Natural." It is a pity that this project did not have the necessary talent behind the camera to really create an exciting, memorable picture. * 1/2 of ****
