I actually watch this movie when I write it. .. If the following comments "prove that I am not developed as a real, artistic director," so be it. . <br /> <br /> but I thought (I still think, as I see now) that this is a film. To put it mildly, very, very overvalued. Again, very. <br /> <br /> It sounds like a very, very bad student film made by a man with extremely limited resources. , and which did not pay so much attention to details. <br /> <br /> I don’t want to go on and on to touch on all the different ways that I miss this film, but. , , Well . I just don’t understand (remember, I fully admit that maybe I’m an idiot and not the creator of the film - for not having received this “piece of creative genius”), I rented it on a whim, because that the reviews were very, very outstanding. . <br /> <br /> Shish. ,,
