This film is one of the worst I've ever seen. The dialogue is not only terrible, it never ends. You will think it ends, but it is not. How long, 140, 160 minutes? I don't even know. I know that I will never watch it again. It was as if someone took a romantic comedy, made a comedy, and then decided to play down the romance, leaving us with a bunch of crap that managed to get to the screen. But don't take my word for it, find out for yourself how terrible this film is.
