Stephen - x-con, who five years ago married Marie. Their marriage remained stable until Stefan caught up with them, and he was not offered to do a courier job. Stephen's job is the delivery of heroin from Germany to Sweden, which should be easy. <br /> <br /> In Germany, Stefan meets Elly, a girl from Bosnia who was sold to the owner of a strip club. Stefan does not like what he sees, and he decides to help Ellie from her suffering. Due to the fact that Ellieâ€™s father fled to Sweden during the war, Ellie now travels with Stephen to Sweden. To make up for the past, Stefan promises Ellie to help her find her father, whatever that may be. Finally, in Sweden, the whole situation seems more complicated than Stefan ever thought. <br /> <br /> This film does not fit into the usual class of Swedish films due to the fact that it was Americanized a lot. Regina Lund and Cecilia Bergquist do everything on average, but the effect makes the film a little too much. Take a look and see for yourself. <br /> <br />
