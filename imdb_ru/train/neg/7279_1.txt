I just saw this movie on a local television station (Big Chuck and Little John on TV8 in Cleveland, Ohio), I had never heard of this movie and decided to watch it. <br /> <br /> Thesaurus does not know it may even help me describe how bad this film really is. The script is terrible. An action other than one of the two exceptions is meaningless, since there is nothing in this material that deserves any real effort. <br /> <br /> This looks like a bunch of little ideas left over from different writing sessions that are thrown into a blender. This is not just funny. The “parody” aspect is tense at best. Some links are almost outdated (even at the time of release). Not surprisingly, I have never heard of it, it’s really bad, worse than anything on Saturday, live, MAD TV or even In Living colors. A great example of how NOT to make a movie. Whatever you do, DON'T LOSE CENTER. <br /> <br /> adam
