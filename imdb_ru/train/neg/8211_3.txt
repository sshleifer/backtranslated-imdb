I read the book "7 years in Tibet" from Heinrich Harrer and was fascinated by it. Then I immediately took a DVD and started watching a movie. I remember when I first saw it in '98, I liked it. Well, now I looked at it again, fully knowing the book on which it is based. and soon I realized how WRONG it all was said: <br /> <br /> when they enter Lhasa, people start to stick their tongues out of their mouths, and Tulis and Pitt get the impression that this is the way to say hello in Tibet so they welcome ... in the book Harrer explains, sticking your tongue out is a sign of absolute humility and devotion in Tibet, and they can do it before the Dalai Lama, but certainly not for these two Europeans! not only his mother, but even the Dalai Lama himself wore glasses in public. in the book, Harrer mentions that at that time no one in Tibet wore glasses (sorry, I forgot the reason, but this is also explained in the book). The young Dalai Lama did, but only when he was alone and no one could see him! What about that twin of Mao Zedong destroying the mandala in front of the young "living buddha" ?? childish ... and the tailor made Tibetan clothes Harrer and Aufschnaiter by non-European designer costumes! Why are so many events that really happened excluded from the story, just to fill time with a fictional love interest (female tailor ...), which is completely irrelevant? just like the whole story about the son of Harrer, Rolf. not a single word is mentioned about him or even about a member of the Harer family in the book. but it was good for me because “7 years in Tibet” is not a book about a man-hunter. about Tibet. I am very disappointed with this “adaptation” of the famous book. I bet Heinrich Harrer was also ... 3 stars, only for cinematography.
