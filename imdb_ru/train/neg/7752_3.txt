The film tells about the saber-tooth, which is lost in an amusement park, where teenagers hunt for garbage. Since there are no rules, they burst into the building and begin to kill. Death is cheesy and dull. But at least he had better effects than saber-toothed. I gave him three, because Stacy was there, and I liked the Sabretooth film. I thought everything was fine, but some deaths were off-screen. There was a dull scene where two teenagers kiss, and the saber-toothed head pops out, and the boy throws his girlfriend, leaving her to look like a completely fake-looking red intestine. Then the saber tooth rises into the vents and bites the head of the children. The end of death with the owner was completely fake graphics. Even this death was stupid, because the tooth of the statue passed through his mouth and hung there so that it would support him, and there is a scene when the gothic girl loses his contacts, does not find them, and it seems that she does not need it. The film is idiotic and a waste of time.
