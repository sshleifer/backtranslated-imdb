"Freddy's Dead" did the smartest thing they could do after the disappointment of the fifth film. It started from scratch. Of course, this “last” film in the saga is stupid, but at least original. Some of the visual effects are even a bit exciting. And the story of how Freddie’s child (Lisa Zane) returns to the city to meet her evil father is unique. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is nothing but another cartoon created to attract children to the theater. He has a bunch of good actors (Zane, Japhet Cotto, and Leslie Dean) who mostly look stupid and roam like sheep ready to kill. This is a one-sided, magical trick, and, in the end, it is nothing but silly, childish entertainment. <br /> <br />
