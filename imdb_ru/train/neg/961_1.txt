Stupid, simplified, and short, GUN CRAZY (VOL 1: WOMAN OF THEM) goes nowhere. <br /> <br /> This short (a little over sixty minutes) story is not as inspired by classic spaghetti westerns as Sam Raimi’s “FAST AND DEAD” plagiarism (his acknowledged respect for spaghetti westerns) presented in modern setting. In FAST AND DEAD, the character Sharon Stone seeks revenge against the mean sheriff (played by Gene Hackman), who, when she was just a hedgehog, passed the fate of his father (a short cameo to Gary Sinise) into her hands; she accidentally shot him in the head. In GUN CRAZY, Saki (played by deft Ryoko Yonekura) is seeking revenge against the mean Mr. Tojo (playing with Shingo Tsurumi’s minimalist appeal), who, when she was just a hedgehog, put the fate of his father in his hands; she let her foot slip off the clutch, and dear dad was raised and housed in the floor of the truck. The only significant difference, despite the settings, is that Tojo sadly cripples Saki ?? Well, I won't spoil it for you if you decide to watch it. <br /> <br /> In short, Saki ?? is the pale imitation of Clint Eastwood's "Man without a Name" ?? going to town ?? Mostly, there is a car shop and a tavern near the US military base, so I think this is enough for the city ?? corrupted Tojo, a local criminal with an incredibly high head price for reasons that were never explained or explored. Recognizing his true nature as a bounty hunter, Saki fights with local militants in shootouts, whose choreography reveals more than a fleeting resemblance to the work of Johnny To and John Woo. Of course, by the end of the film, Saki suffered a fair amount of torture at the hands of the bad guys, but does it fit the occasion ?? on your knees, in a ridiculous attempt at an unexpected ending ?? and defeats all his enemies with the help of rocket launchers. <br /> <br /> Don't ask where she gets the rocket launcher. Just see for yourself. Try not to laugh. <br /> <br /> Image quality is average for DVD release. In several sequences there is a grainy quality, but, in general, this is not a bad transmission. From time to time the sound quality leaves much to be desired, but, again, this is not a bad transmission. <br /> <br /> Rather, it's a bad movie.
