I did not know that it was a silent film with a narration. I don’t care about silent films - banal humor, flickering lighting, movies, etc. I’m sure that I attributed this to a low score. It was about chapter 8, before I discovered any interest in this story, and if I had popcorn, I would have thrown it on the screen. Maybe it attracts a sci-fi crowd? Lacked only the scene of zombies and brain transplants. On Friday evening I went with two other people, and there were only 6 people in the theater. Isabella Rosselinny narrated this film - one of the nicest aspects of the film. No one left comments about how much they liked it, and did not appreciate the unusual approach to the story of this story. I can not recommend this movie.
