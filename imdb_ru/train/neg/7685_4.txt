Funny melodrama taken from the story of William Gibson, created by John Houseman and director Vincent Minnelli! Richard Widmark heads an elegant, high-quality rural nervous retreat where his free wife fights the self-styled queen bee, Lillian Gish, and Widmark himself lost his way in search of a newcomer, Loren Bacall, who restores life after death to her husband and child. Face and bustle, located in indiscriminate time and place, and with the love story of "David and Lisa", hidden in a plush swamp. Widmark and Bacall have some good chemistry, but this scenario gives them nothing to build on. Exactly within an hour, most of the dialogue concerns what to do with curtains hanging in the library (this topic is not used as symbolism, rather, it is a red herring, which is not a mystery!). The picture hopes to show the quarrels that disparate people come to when they work in the same profession, and everyone thinks their opinion is correct, but unfortunately, the detour that Minnelli unravels this stew is neither informative, nor enlightening, nor interesting. ** from ****
