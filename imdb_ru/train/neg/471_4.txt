The outdated saga of "losers in the army", which, without much enthusiasm, is trying to be both surrealistic (foreign subtitles) and vulgar (nonsense with a sigh), but in the end is a mixture of many different kinds of humor followed very successfully. Barbara Bach, the Bond girl from The Spy Who Loved Me, has only two or three short scenes. What a waste! (* 1/2)
