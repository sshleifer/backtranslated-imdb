This movie is without a doubt the worst horror movie I've ever seen. And it says a lot, considering that I have seen such nasty people as “Demon of Paradise”, “Lovers” and “Blood Kill” (which is close). However, I love bad horror movies, and, as you can tell from my username, this one really bulges. At times there is nothing more interesting than a poorly made slasher. As for this film, the opening scene in which a woman is fried in a tanning salon seems to have nothing to do with the film, especially since the film does not tell you that the event happened 2 years before the rest of the film. Acting does not exist, and most of the pictures from the camera are made of female areas in shrink film. The policeman was the most monotonous stone-faced actor I've ever seen. The best / worst part of this film, however, must be the murder weapon. Giant pin ?! What were they thinking about? Who is the killer? Angry employee "Huggies"? I had to give this movie a complete zero, but damn, if I didn’t have a blast watching this
