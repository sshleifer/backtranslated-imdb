Cash (currently played by Kristin Hage as Angelina Jolie) went to the wasteland after the apocalypse (after her defender died of old age, said Elias Kotas, a decent actor, played the defender), and now she finds people wandering crushed stone is looking for cyborg for exchange for scrap and money. She leads a group of burnt cyborgs (including William Katt, Evan Lurie and the human scientist played by Zack Galligan) against the bounty hunter Richard Lynch. Malcolm McDowell has two minutes of screen time as an Lynch employer. Cyborg 3 may indeed be better than the other two entries, but this is still a pretty boring feature. The problem this time is that ideas with potential are never used properly, sequences of actions are routine, and names like McDowell, Catt and Galligan have little to do. Hajj is really a tearful heroine, and Lynch is too excited (as usual), and the film lacks inspiration or ambition to be as funny as its cheerful predecessor. (The one with Van Damme, the second is just boring.) The view of science fiction is also disappointing, which almost aggressively resists any good idea. As a fighter, this is a common thing and, judging by the number of B-films, and it is done correctly, this is the only thing I can say about it. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of 4- (Bad)
