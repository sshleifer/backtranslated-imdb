I am stunned to know how many fans this show has. Do not say that “Friends” was, at best, an “average” comedian, and not as great as the others. Let's face it, if there were no casting Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston and Matt Le Blanc, then who knows whether this show will last as long as before. I very much doubt it. Although the series “Friends” was becoming more predictable, lame and boring, and I didn’t give a damn about the characters who were most overestimated in the history of television, or their plight, nor those who slept with. And it was from being fun in the first four seasons to sometimes funny. And even when all these Hollywood actors from world cinema were in it, I still did not bother to tune in. The letters in “Friends” are outdated due to the fact that I have lost interest in this show since the sixth season and as for the final Well, it was predictable, if not more. <br /> <br /> What was annoying was that it lasted ten seasons, while some of my favorite shows lasted, for example, just three, four seasons and were eventually canceled and lifted from the air forever . The show was supposed to be immediately stopped by the time the actors wanted to get a big salary. In truth, despite the fact that the show was weak, it was a show that was more than the actors themselves, and not vice versa. <br /> <br /> When it ended in 2004, I was relieved to see the back of this comedy film. Now they are saying that soon a reunion show will appear on our screens. And yet, for example, I will not look forward to it.
