I was looking forward to seeing this movie after reading a positive review in the New York Times. In addition, I am also Shanghai, so the interest in the topic was not just fleeting. However, after watching it, I was extremely disappointed. <br /> <br /> The pace of the film was painfully slow and monotonous. The director lingered on some scenes for too long. There was no passion or chemistry between lovers. There was almost no dialogue. The dialogue was badly needed to compensate for the lack of action. At the end of the film, you didnâ€™t feel compassion for the characters. This film lacked everything. The script was weak, the acting was bad, and there was no editing. The director tried to imitate certain styles of noir films, but failed miserably. A good film is a film that attracts your attention, supports it and successfully completes without feeling that time has passed. This film felt that it would never end. Do not waste your money on this movie.
