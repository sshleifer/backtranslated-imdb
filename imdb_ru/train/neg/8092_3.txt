The stretching, brilliantly observed satirical novel of the life of Tom Wolfe among the New York snobbery looks glossy here, but, nevertheless, is not very well served. The film is suffering not only due to the fact that every person Tom Hanks is mistaken in the role of a caring yuppie, Kyupi dolls, Melanie Griffith as a manipulative southern beauty and Bruce Willis (?!) As a favorite New York literature. The most serious mistake was in the director's chair. Robert Altman could breathe life into these incredible characters and make them interesting, but Brian De Palma, despite all his visual sophistication, never paid attention to the nuances of human experience. The resulting film looks good, but does not seem to belong to the subject of dehumanization in favor of status. Honestly, if satire is not angry at the viewer, what's the point?
