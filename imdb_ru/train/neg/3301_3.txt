The standard procedure for Swedish films today seems to begin with the ejection of credibility from the window and continue this journey to the end of the process. Ronarna is another great example of how there is little meaning in the film. <br /> <br /> Banks in Stockholm are robbing a highly efficient gang of robbers in a military style. Two policemen begin investigating the case, which soon becomes more complicated than it might seem at first glance. <br /> <br /> As usual in a Swedish film, the actors are mainly composed of the same people that you have seen again and again. Mikael Persbrandt must be in every Swedish film over the past few years! But this is normal, I believe that Persbrandt is one of the few who work well here (as usual). The problems with this film mostly revolve around the story itself. First of all, looting is felt mainly as a background. Rather, it is more like a film about a young policewoman who fights to prove herself in the male world (as it was not done a thousand times earlier with a decent actress instead of Sophia Helin). Also in the end there is a completely unbelievable plot twist that seems as believable as an alien landing. But, nevertheless, I thought that it was a rather pleasant touch, considering that I was almost asleep at the time. This somewhat enlivened the situation (and in fact saved the rating from dropping another step). <br /> <br /> In the end, the main problem is the same as in most other Swedish films of this kind. It’s just that action and obscurity do not meet the standards we are used to in other films of this type (mainly in Hollywood). It feels cheap and rather weak in comparison. In my opinion, Swedish filmmakers should try to focus more on the plot and acting, and forget about trying to make a “Hollywood action movie,” as they are doing now. Because it becomes another forgotten effort of the Swedish film industry. I rate this 3/10.
