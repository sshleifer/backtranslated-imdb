I started watching this film with low expectations, in fact, I noticed it only because it was an adaptation of S.K. a novel (a novel that I never read). <br /> <br /> I am glad that my expectations were low, because the film was not something close to good, but he manages to interest you. What really delays this story is the work of the director and actors. The film is too long, there are no “good” shots and no panic, the dialogues are stupid, and the special effects are crap. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is good is that, as I said, it keeps you interested (I think the book should be good) without using a lot of horror. <br /> <br /> My voice is 4/10.
