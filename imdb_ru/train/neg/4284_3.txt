Jason Lee's pecks are back! If this is what you are looking for, look no further. If not, it is better to move on ... <br /> <br /> But about the film. Cliches are abundant, some poorly filmed, but rather exotic battle scenes (used JKD) and a lot of bad actions and cheap effects. Poor Lee looks like he was hurt throughout the entire film, and this is not surprising. Not a pleasant return. <br /> <br /> The film is not even filmed as a B-film - of course, it was German, bleached by blonde Rutger-wannabe, a bad guy, but no useless sex scene or even a single booty shot. No one. Zip Nada Even in Starship Troopers 2 they had the common sense to include the obligatory scenes of naked people (as for the rest of my comments on this magnificent sample of classic cinematic perfection, please refer to our upcoming review of this stunning sequel ...). I had a feeling that the writer is taking revenge on someone with this - so I will not go into the “plot” of the film or almost everything else associated with it. Except that there were some non-heterosexual shades in it, so, ”said Nuff. <br /> <br /> However, in this film there is one thing - no, Jean-Claude :)
