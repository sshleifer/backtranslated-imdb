After watching this film, I felt an urgent need to express my disappointment a bit. Selma Blair is an incredible, currently underrated actress, and Max Beasley was quite charming in "Kill Me Later". The story, although not quite original, certainly showed some promise. Although all this did not matter ... in general. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t know what its essence is, but director Dana Lustig has practically no director talent. She slowed down the shots, sped them up, turned the shots over, used uncomfortable camera angles, used annoying color filters, made a billion quick cuts, jumped back and forth on the timeline and crowned it with an unpleasant "modern" soundtrack of crying garbage, I can't remember when was the last time I saw such an incompetent work on directing a film. Her ego must be huge to throw away the acting and the story and put its direction forward and into the spotlight so that the audience will notice. He is hammered down their throats. <br /> <br /> In Kill Me Later, there are a couple of good scenes that show what could and should have been. Unfortunately, just when things started to make promises, Miss Lustig dug into a bag with film school tricks and again mixed things. It's a shame, because Blair and Beasley had good chemistry, and you could say that the film really had a good heart. 3/10
