This film has nothing to do with its predecessor, Robot Jocks. This should also be the reason that its most common name is “Robot Wars” and not the alternative name “Robot Jocks 2: Robot Wars”. <br /> <br /> “Robot Jocks” was basically a fun movie to watch, because it had a good premise of giant robots fighting each other in the near future. This concept was abandoned for this film, and instead it contains a completely boring story, which, moreover, is not very original or cleverly written. It is a pity that he tried to differ so much from his predecessor, because otherwise it could have been a more funny movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Just like “Robot Jocks”, this is a B-movie, but with how big the difference is that it is simply not very good. Perhaps this is also due to the fact that “Robot Jocks” was created in the 80s, when B-films still had a certain charm and class over it, even if the film was released in 1990. It really can't be said about this movie. It's just lame, poorly made, bad looking and not exciting enough. It also has an ending that makes you think, “Is that it? That's all? ". <br /> <br /> What is missing in the film is a clear storyline. Perhaps a good main villain would be a good idea and some other things, such as a factual indication of a story, some actions or cute main characters. <br /> <br /> Seriously, what did they think when they chose the actors? for this movie. All of them are simply not cute in their roles, and especially Don Michael Paul is annoying as the main character, who behaves as if he is God's gift to a woman and Mr. Perfect, who can compete with anyone. Didn't they just get the actors from the first movie? <br /> <br /> For such a futuristic film, in which there are big battle droids, this film clearly lacks its action. If they had added more and more action to the film, the film would at least be more interesting to watch. Instead, we now have a film that does not impress in almost every possible way. <br /> <br /> You can better watch the episode "Mighty Morphine" to see more action and prettiness. <br /> 3/10
