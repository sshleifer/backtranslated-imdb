This film is by no means as bad as The Perfect Stranger, but it just wasn't funny. It could not be tied to one type of comedy - it went from SNL to Adam Sandler, to romance, to little guys, to big score, to farces, to comedies like “Loser”. Although there were some pretty funny moments of farce (falling from a hill), no one was very particularly funny or outstanding in any way. Schindler's List was funnier (and felt shorter). You never knew whether Andy Samberg should attend high school, drop out of college, or just a loser living at home with his mother, Sissy Spacek, in her worst choice of roles. And poor Jan McShane, a serious actor, if I only needed to name one, they give shit to read to the camera. The story stretches and is completely predictable up to the end (there are no spoilers in case Adam Samberg's mother wants to see her). Don't spend ANY money on watching this movie, and maybe Lorne Michaels will take the hint and start shooting quality (yes, Wayne's world and Tommy Boy are quality).
