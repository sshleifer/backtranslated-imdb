Well, I had to be generous and give him 2. This was mainly due to the unreasonable holes cut in the shirt of the lady where her breasts are. I found it a bit funny. Other than that, this film is nothing more than a pleasant laugh with a friend. It's funny if you are ready to throw comments to someone in the “Theater of Mystical Science”, but this is no better than 2. And 2 pretty much sucks.
