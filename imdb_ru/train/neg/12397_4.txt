I read somewhere where this film was supposed to be a remake of the 1949 Noir film Cross Criss. The latter seemed to me disappointing, but still it was better than this film. <br /> <br /> This film is “neo-noir”, as it is modern and colorful, two things that purists will make it disqualified for the status of film noir. <br /> <br /> However, the biggest negative point was not cinematography (it was good), but a tangled storyline. Hi, some of Dashil Hammett’s 40s stories were similar, but some of them didn’t bother me either. The filmmakers did not help the situation, putting the memories in a story that looked every three minutes. Not surprisingly, this did not lag behind this story. That was funny! What happens is that with the 45-minute mark there are so many of them that they don’t care. I know not.
