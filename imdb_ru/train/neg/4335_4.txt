The film and acting skills are not bad, and Jay Hernandez plays great Kalito Brigante, but the film forgets that it should be a prequel to a popular film. The creators of this prequel clearly did not look at the original Carlito Way, or at least did not care about continuity. This film is a prequel, which means that the original film has already laid out to us some history, and this film should end where the original begins, or at least lead to it. None of Karlito’s closest old friends from the original appeared in this film, they are not even mentioned. Louis Guzman, Pachanga in the original, in the film, but he plays a completely different character. The original takes place in 1975, and the prequel in 1969-70. Considering that this movie has been happening less than 5 years earlier, don't you think that one of Carlito’s long-time friends will appear? In the original, Carlito start was released from prison after spending 5 years in prison. These are just a few months between the end of the prequel and the beginning of the original! *** Poluspoyuler *** We know from the very beginning of the original, Carlito spent 5 years in prison, so when the prequel gives us this Hollywood happy ending, it offends the intelligence of the fans of the original. What happened to Gale? This lack of continuity made this film go directly to the release of the video.
