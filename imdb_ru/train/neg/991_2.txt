If you want to watch a good movie about how women can fight sexual abuse, then this movie is not the movie you want to watch. It was a social commentary about a woman who became a victim and resists. Spoiler: Rosario Dawson turns the tables on his attacker. Instead of using the criminal justice system, the victim resorts to vigilance. It essentially nullifies the judicial system. The film “The Accused” was much better because the victim uses the judicial system and wins. What does the "Descent" do to tell the victims of the attack that they should resort to violence? Is the victim better than the accuser? Not !!!
