The stars of Stuart Moss as a scientist who is on a working trip with his wife, and there is a feeling that he was chosen for this role for his ability to roll his eyes back in his head ... imagine listening for this ... " ... no, this is not quite so, thank you, the next one! "Anyway, he was bitten by a bat, and then he either turns into a creature with a bat and kills people, or ... no. No one else sees his strange transformations, but he himself seems to think that he is changing, because his wedding ring jumps out when his hands turn into claws, etc. To the credit, the film seems to be holding back, is it just mind or it actually turns into something almost to the very end. There are sometimes some good places here and something like a decent atmosphere, but, unfortunately, none of this can compensate for a somewhat flimsy story and a surprisingly bad game. Something like “so bad, it's good,” but more inclined simply to the bad. 4 out of 10
