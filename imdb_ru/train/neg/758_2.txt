This show stinks. For parents, they usually want their children to see something good for them. It is usually educational, funny and vivid. <br /> <br /> Is it educational? No, Doodlebops sing and that's it. Usually they sing about themselves, they do not try to teach anything. <br /> <br /> Is that funny? Not. Instead, the Doodlebops say something that is not a joke, and laugh at it. <br /> <br /> Is it bright? It is so bright, it hurts. As for the color, everything is very bright, so it is good. But in the world of Doodlebop, ANYTHING is not wrong. Therefore, they are always happy. a child in distress will become depressed because he never had to be sad. <br /> <br /> The show is also very stupid. Each syllable is uttered at the highest level of exaggeration and very banal. This is unnecessary. <br /> <br /> This is interesting for children, but after two years you donâ€™t want your children to see it. They will never know how to grow.
