This version of Moby Dick insults the audience by claiming that it is based on Melville's novel - even to the point that it shows a fake sentence from the first chapter, and not the famous “Call me Ishmael.” In addition to the brutal acting, even from John Barrymore, this is perhaps the best example of how far Hollywood (especially early Hollywood) can go to revise and change the famous novel, just to increase its chances at the box office. All the beautiful, poetic language of the novel was completely destroyed, and Ahab was turned from a brooding, blasphemous, obsessed madman into a dashing, misunderstood hero who wants to kill Moby Dick only after his fiancé (!) Turns away from him, seeing his wooden legs . To this is added the standard evil brother who wants the bridegroom for himself, and the other end!
