... not that all Disney films were rubbish. <br /> <br /> Anyway, for the first time I saw Legend of Bogey Creek and loved the movie very much. When I heard that he has 2 sequels, I was delighted. I finally found a copy of it and watched it one night. I do not understand how they can film the continuation of the horror movie. The original is a film / documentary about the monster Fauke, and can scare anyone. "Return" is intended for children, and no one should watch him. I do not remember the plot very well, as it has been quite a long time since I watched it, and I will no longer watch it, but ... Itâ€™s about those hunters who come to the city and are going to kill the snowman. Three small children left the house to stop them. The big monsoon is coming. Hunters are injured, saved by children. Then they all hide in a boat with a large piece of tarpaulin at the top and try to survive the storm. Then a snowman comes suddenly and does something really sick. I do not want to spoil the ending for any of you, but it's not scary. Well....
