Low budget efforts from Texas, which, at least, were filmed well, but this is not comforting. A bad game, or, I would say, a bad game, a rather soft storyline, in which there is nothing new, bad special effects, bad, bad, bad. It looks like a group of young people are assembling a haunted house on Halloween, which is held every year, but this year everything is different. It has a long lesbian theme, which not only annoys, but also fills empty places, of which there are many. Putrid, childish, of course, can be avoided at all costs.
