It was a disappointing horror film about a snotty young girl and her nightmares. For a horror movie or thriller and hype, this is too boring. There are only a few tense moments here, not the same as they should be for a movie of this genre. Even these "tense" scenes were not very. Music made them more dramatic than they really were. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of symbolism here, so critics of the elite call it the “horror film of a thinking person.” Well, if they think about it, I am sure that they will come to the same conclusion that I am a waste of money in a video rental store. <br /> <br /> Summary: onlookers who offer an incredible hero and generally a bad game. Significantly overvalued and, of course, not what it is advertised.
