I first learned about Wendigo many years ago in one of Alvin Schwartz's book “Horror Stories”: according to this story, Wendigo — after you name your name in the wind — drags you forward and then lifts you into the sky and sprays you. Although this sounds rather strange, the history of Schwartz turned him into a rather consistent idea. <br /> <br /> The film "Wendigo" - no. Basically it consists of every horror cliché: the family moves to a new home, and strange things start to happen, everyone who harms them, asks for it, and everyone better listens to the old Indian guy. I have seen this material so many times that I no longer bothered to count. <br /> <br /> Avoid this anyway. Patricia Clarkson and Eric Per Sullivan (Dewey in Malcolm in the Middle) did much better than that.
