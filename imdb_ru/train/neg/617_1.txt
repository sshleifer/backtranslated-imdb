First of all, let me start with a quote that my friend said while watching this film: â€œThis whole film was supposed to be brave. You know, like, "Dude, I couldn't make you the worst movie ever." With this film, they put a lot of effort to achieve this title. The effects, of course, are bad. The plot / dialogue is like a collage of bits stolen from all horror films ever made. I guess the actors should be in college. Yet parts of it (especially at the beginning) give the impression that they should be in high school or high school. It makes no sense. An effigy that kills people is by no means a pleasure. (SPOILER: At the end, when they repeat the name of Lester, and he appears again, the black guy and Scarecrow laugh, probably out of relief when they were on their last stage and in an obscene dialogue.)
