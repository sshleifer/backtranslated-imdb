Absolutely pathetic waste of film !! Nothing happens No ghosts, almost no train, no secret, no interest. Constant and HARD comedy attempts are painful. Everything else is pitiful. The parcel is idiotic: a group of people was stuck in the middle of the open space, because their train was delayed by less than 3 minutes. What kind? And the railway does not leave them a place to stay, in a strong storm? I think no. Oh, they can walk 4 miles through dead black fields. mmm yes Of course. Or they can impose themselves on the hospitality of the railway and stay on the “ghost” of the railway station. The station, which turned out to be nothing more than a MORTAL MORNING, completely without ghosts, interest or conspiracy. <br /> <br /> It’s so terribly boring that it seems impossible. <br /> <br /> This should be added to the list of lost films !! ahhhh !!
