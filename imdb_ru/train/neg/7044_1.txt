How sad to see how beautiful and talented Tina Louise comes down to making this terrible excuse for a film. Tina still looked fit and attractive, but for some reason she seemed really scared. I can understand her fear; fearing that this 3rd-level bastard will somehow be released to the general public. Also, I'm a fan of pretty Adam West. Again, as with Tina, Adam looks good and in great shape for a man of his age. His acting is tolerable here, but the script is so bad that even listening to the dialogue is difficult. <br /> <br /> The film is a plagiarism of Brando’s classic film “The Wild Ones”; A biker brigade outlaw out of control in a small town. The bikers here are like a motley group, and I’m sure I don’t want them to meet my sister. The game is tough and wooden, and the plot is as old as sand. Hellriders are the hell to watch!
