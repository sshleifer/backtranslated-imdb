As a great admirer of Marlene Dietrich, I had to (finally) see this very, very boring picture. This is Miss Dietrich's first color film, and the most beautiful blonde in the world is redhead! A bad start This story is a terrible bore, touching on a topic that is boring in itself: I feel religious guilt. (Who needs this ???) Suffice it to say, perhaps, that of all the films of Dietrich (and I have seen the most, including Pittsburgh), this is the only one where even her performance is hardly worth watching. Color photography is fine (this is a very early Technicolor release), but without a goal. Funny casting: C. Aubrey Smith, Basil Rathbone (enough said?). The only thing that arouses any interest is John Carradine’s outlandish caricature of the play “The Sandbox”, which predicts everything that will happen. Estimated "happy ending" - one of the most depressing in history. Another example of David O. Selznick’s highly inflated reputation (did he ever make a really good movie? Except “Togo”?) And for one last annoyance, the MGM DVD soundtrack is a mess, with volume levels apparently randomized . Very not recommended.
