I began to thaw, so I will make this review as short and pleasant as possible. <br /> <br /> There is this astronaut, and he is climbing a spaceship with two other guys, you know? Except that something happens that exposes him to radiation, and then when they return ... well, never mind what happened to the other guys, but our astronaut began to melt! No, not just burn out, but melt! Like ice cream in July! Well, maybe not so fast, but you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> In any case, it becomes red and sticky, and the fact that it melts, drives him crazy. I believe he also checked the “melting man” handbook, because suddenly he knows that in order not to completely melt, he must eat human flesh, so he starts tearing people apart. other characters, but in a movie where a person melts, melts and melts (and melts), do you really need others? What is important, who will he chew on, and what will remain of them? How long will it take him to just dissolve? WHY this movie was made first? WHERE did they take the money? WHEN you fall asleep watching this? <br /> <br /> I almost melted, but I still have enough time to tell you that this film is terribly boring, although the idea is really cool and kindly gross. Makeup neat, but everything else ... SPLAT
