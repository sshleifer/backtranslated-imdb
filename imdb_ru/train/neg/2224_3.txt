I first saw it when I was about 7 years old. I remembered what I thought was the vague outline of what had happened. Now, 15 years later, it turns out that I remembered everything with great precision, because it seems that the authors never went beyond describing the story. There is no plot in this movie / cartoon. There is no character development, no prehistory, no character arc, nothing. Good guys do things because they are good, and bad guys only do things because they are bad. One unintentionally fun part is when someone you consider important dies and nobody cares. They just shrug and move on. There is almost no dialogue either. If you turn off battle scenes and running scenes, you will lose 70% of the film. <br /> <br /> Watch this because you want to see good animation for no other reason. Or, if you like to look at the meagerly dressed hot cartoon guys (or the meagerly dressed hot cartoon guys).
