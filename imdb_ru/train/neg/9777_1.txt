I was attracted to this film, curious to see how they adapted the atrocious novel of Hubert Shelby. I thought that a literary fragment of such depth, with a rich tapestry of characters, terrible situations and social criticism, cannot turn into a bad film. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This film is a terrible film, not in content, but in form. Director Ulrich Edel performs, in my sincere opinion, horrible directorial work, which has nothing to do with the original book. Not surprisingly, Edel is the television director; This film looks and feels like a bad film, Made for Television. Some of my views on this bomb (** spoilers ahead **): <br /> <br /> - Lack of directing creativity. Scenes are slow, feel slow, look poorly filmed, and barely move from a fixed position. The only freedom they take is in the field of cinematography with a pleasant dark tone. In addition, the film has the same technical creativity as a television soap opera. <br /> <br /> All the actors are doing an amazing job portraying these pathetic characters. The problem is that adaptation does not affect the main element in the development of the plot: MOTIVATION. All these characters move like robots, without a clear motivation for their actions. It seems they are doing things completely unexpectedly, like robots, for no reason. Edel misses any opportunity to enrich the development of the character, not exploring the motivation of the character and avoiding the development of the personality of each character in full. <br /> <br /> This lack of character development is obvious to Thrall. Jennifer Jason Leith is great at playing this trashy prostitute, but her alcohol-induced decision to allow sailors to violate her is not explained. It looks extremely silly, as we see how this character does it unexpectedly. This is a prime example of poor character development. <br /> <br /> There are also many minor characters in the film who do nothing, feel nothing and add nothing to the plot. I would like to know more about Harry's wife, for example, and the interaction between them. This is another missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> Edel approaches the development of a character only with Harry, and his obsession with his gay lover, only to spoil everything in the end without explaining - again - his motives. The bandits also joke because of their lack of elaboration. <br /> <br /> - Soundtrack is one of the worst I've ever experienced. The awesome work of Mark Knopfler. I seriously expected more from the former leader Dire Straits, but his work in this film is seriously absent. Sometimes, like in a battle between trade union workers and the police, music seems completely unrelated to the film. He also feels completely poor and anachronistic; I can swear that the whole soundtrack is made from a Casio toy keyboard. It distracts from the actual action. <br /> <br /> - The adaptation of Desmond Nakanoâ€™s book is so literal that it excludes the essence of the story. It seems that they tried so hard to keep the storyline of action for action in the book, that they forgot to actually develop the characters and once again explain their actions and motives. <br /> <br /> I seriously Can not recommend this film, even to a Shelby fan, because it can spoil the original book. This is a very boring effort to adapt the novel, and it shows very little creative input.
