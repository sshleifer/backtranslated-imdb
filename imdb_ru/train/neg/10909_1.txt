This is a very bad movie. I laughed once or twice, and the storyline sucks! Maybe there is one funny joke, this is stupid and boring. Throughout the short film, I fell asleep and wondered when it would end. <br /> <br /> No one behaves like a person, and everyone behaves stupid and ridiculous. Rob Schneider, acting like an animal, is not something I would pay to see. It looked funny, but the point is, don't waste your precious time on such a ridiculous and stupid movie. <br /> <br /> I was wondering when this would end, even if it was a short movie. At first we thought it would be better; but it gets worse. Stupid, to the very end. I left the theater, and I would remember this film as extremely bad forever. <br /> <br /> The author and co-producer of this film is the television writer Simpsons, but this is not at all like The Simpsons (this movie sucks !!!)
