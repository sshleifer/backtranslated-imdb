Want to watch a scary horror movie? Then stay away from that. There is not enough beer in the world to make this movie enjoyable. <br /> <br /> However, there is enough scotch. Single malt if you can handle it. <br /> <br /> If previous comments were not enough to prevent you from watching this sober movie, let me help you. NASA sends one person and two unpaid extras into space into Saturn orbit. A really large solar flare causes bleeding from the nose in Colonel Steve West. From this point on, things are going down, and the nonsense begins. <br /> <br /> I actually read an adaptation of a book that was published and released only in the UK. Miles is better than a movie, and the book was terrible. At least some of the pretenses are made in anticipation, and some explanation of the events has been extracted from the author (rhyming with "gas"). <br /> <br /> Not to say that the film is completely useless. Rick Baker found out that he really should read the contract before subscribing to the film, and Jonathan Demme found out that he really is better suited for directing. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is an episode of MST3K showing this film, but this, of course, has been edited quite a bit. Without the obligatory throwing of the breast, even the healing power of Scotch tape cannot save you. <br /> <br /> Please just watch “The Lost Ark Raiders” if you want to see how the guy melts. See Space Cowboys if you feel the need to see astronauts. I cannot recommend this film to a sober public with a clear conscience.
