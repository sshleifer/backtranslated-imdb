I usually write reviews only for films that I really hated or loved. And, as you can probably judge by the number of stars above, I did not like it. I assume that you have already read about the plot or may have even seen the film, so I’ll skip the summary. Let's take a look at this, pros and cons: <br /> <br /> Cons: concept: the premise was created to be interesting. Using chaos theory as a topic was interesting. However, it was not done so well. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that the Chaos theory was somewhat distorted. The event that happened in the film looked more like a fictional coincidence than anything else. I assume that the Butterfly effect was presented to the whole “God (s) makes the Tsunami return the statue”. The presentation looks very messy. Some people call it smart, but this seems to be another exciting action movie. <br /> <br /> Storyline: Is it just me, or does it seem that Kamal just threw it together to give him a reason to play ten roles? The plot is extremely contrived; Govind continued to lose the bottle so many times because of unclear incidents (it happens that his friend confused the bottle with the package he sent to India, the crazy old woman just throws the bottle at the idol, half of the actors happen to have unexpectedly met in the same hospital, and the case with the idol somehow mixed with the one that belonged to a famous singer.) CGI: Oh God, CGI. It was even worse than the special effects in Jaws 3, and they were lame. I immediately understood which parts were animated. Even my ten-year-old cousin knows that underwater vehicles don't look like that. <br /> <br /> Tricks. Yes, now I know that the militants in Tamil films are unrealistic, but the stunts in this film were terrible and in fact distracted me from the story. <br /> <br /> Make up: I have to admit, they did a better job than expected. I thought Kamal would play people with similar skin tones, so two fake white guys and a fake Japanese aikido guy took me by surprise. However, it was still pretty bad, I could easily tell which ones were wearing masks. <br /> <br /> Songs: in many cases, the music is distracting and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> Asin: Her character was perhaps the most annoying in the film. She was loud, irritable and irrationally obsessed with this idol. I really wanted her to die. <br /> <br /> Holes for conspiracy and refrigerator logic: let me tell you straight: the lab monkey was smart enough to go through a password-locked door, but not smart enough to tell the difference between a chocolate bar and a bottle of deadly virus in him And then, a former CIA agent who, after the bottle, finds out that he is heading for India. Instead of immediately following him, he first marries a dancer. The famous Punjabi singer with cancer checks in a small town hospital in the third world, when he could easily afford the best available treatment. In addition, he got shot in the throat. You would think that he would be killed, but instead a magic bullet cleared his tumor. You read correctly, BULLET knocked out a tumor. <br /> <br /> Pluses ... Naidu character: Perhaps his comedy was the only pleasant part of the film.
