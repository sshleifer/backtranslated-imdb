I remember this show. I still remember this funny song "The Funniest People of America". Honestly, it should have been called American lame or unfunny or totally disgusting people. Dave was unable to save this show, as well as Bob Saghet or the replacement hosts for AFV, which appeared later. Jackalope segments were hilarious, and yes, Dave could make some good off-screen voices that were better than Bobâ€™s. But this show went to hell because of the inconclusive lousy videos that people submitted. In addition, it developed as a sort of variety show with lame guest stars, including Olson Gemini. Plus the AFV was in full swing before they began to choose the drooling as ugly as sinful children as the winner. Did I mention that the videos were disgusting and lame? But still the theme of the song is swinging!
