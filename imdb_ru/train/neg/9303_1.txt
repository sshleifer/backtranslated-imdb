I write this review after seeing it a few months ago ... the trailer looked promising enough for me to buy this lame excuse for a movie. This is a complete joke .... and literally spitting in the face of real classics of the horrors of the early generation, such as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), with which they even had the opportunity to compare themselves on the cover. The producer who played Brandon has to go turn the hamburgers and serve the fat hamburgers ... damn, he might not be very good at that either! The lighting was bad, bad, bad and very annoying because of the film, sometimes you couldn't even see the faces of the actor. I don't even remember the rest of the actors, which is really sad, bad, that they never do anything to impress you, to make them memorable. This is all the time I will waste in this review. PLEASE stay away from this pile of garbage, even if you get it for 25 cents, do not do this, buy a piece of chewing gum, at least it will entertain you! br /> <br /> If you want good quality low-budget fun, much better than that ... then watch the Jeff Hayes film .... because it takes talent, and the child does it! <br /> I gave this 1 star only for the cover .... this is the only thing worth loving this so-called "movie" <br /> <br /> - Rick Blalock
