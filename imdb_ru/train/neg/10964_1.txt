I was not lucky to see this at the “Pavement” film festival. The pavement as a whole was a disappointment, and this film was the last nail in the coffin. Being a devoted fan of Lewis Carroll’s Alice books, I was very excited about the premiere of this film, which made it even more inconvenient to watch. Usually I am enthusiastic about modern retellings if they are treated well. It is usually interesting to see parallels between the past and the present in a familiar story. Unfortunately, this film was a less modern retelling and rather a perversion of pop culture. The adaptation of the characters in the original seemed juvenile and usually turned out to be terribly annoying. It probably did not help that the actors were not very good. Most of the speeches were ridiculously overpriced, which, I believe, was either due to bad direction or due to an attempt to correct a bad script. I never laughed once during the whole movie. All these jokes were outdated references to less-current events, which with time will surely lose their urgency. Indeed, the only highlight of the film was the initial sequence in which the white rabbit went to meet Alice, but even then the score was a poor imitation of the work of Danny Elfman. In addition, I must say that turning a croquet game into a rave dance was terrible. Without a doubt, this was the lowest point of the film. <br /> <br /> What a joke. I do not see this movie. After his conclusion, I was genuinely angry.
