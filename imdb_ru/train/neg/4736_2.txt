The film deserves 2/10. 1.5 stars for a girl (sorry, I'm biased, I think a beautiful girl is the only highlight of the films), and 0.5 for being shorter than Azumi 1. I watched Azumi 1 and 2 in 1 seat. I was amazed that I could sit through it. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about the pros of the movie. Girl. Uto Aya is cute. That's all it takes to save the entire movie. The fact is that if the main character was a man, I’m sure that most people (including me) wouldn’t touch the movie at all. <br /> <br /> Now let's talk about the minuses. Firstly, it is very difficult, with many repetitive scenes. Scenes Nachi and Azumi keep coming back. This is more like a dramatic way of shooting. Typical Japanese dramas love memories, and this film too. Secondly, the film is too unreal in the historical environment. I do not mind unreal movies. But this film looks like a bad way to show creativity by adding ninjas who act like bears and spider webs, etc. ... it reminds me of Shinobi, although Shinobi is a movie with a fantastic setting. In addition, in order to portray "I don't know" what effect, the director takes people dying from blood splashes (literally) everywhere ... people who do not understand that their head was cut off ... etc. And so on. D. D. ... and so on ... Too many spoils the show. It seems that the influence of anime is strong in this film. This makes the show worse. Third, shouldn't Azumi be a murderer? She looks more like an army of one person, she’s just a woman. I don't think you see the killers attack military camps. The only time I felt that she acted "like a killer" was when she killed Kiymas Kato at the end of Azumi 1. Finally, the plot was thin in both films. This is a linear story without development and surprises anyway.
