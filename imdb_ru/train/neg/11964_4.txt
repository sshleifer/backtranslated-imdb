Billy Crystal co-wrote and starred in this extremely safe and comfortable comedy drama about fathers and sons, adult irresponsibility and aging. Billy plays a cardiac surgeon with a heart attack (ha-ha), which makes him look for his alienated father (Alan King), an additional film that imagines himself to be a big star. The script is the nonsense of Neil Simon with an abundance of one-liners, a flat expressionless indication of Henry Winkler (stuck in the sitcom mode) and family conflict at the ready. Crystal and King try their best, but King is too energetic and often overloaded. Jobeth Williams plays another ungrateful role, but she manages to bring her inborn, unassuming class to the well-known character of her friend. I think this is a comedy, but the tears blink ... embarrassing. ** from ****
