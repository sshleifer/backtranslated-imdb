Like all the films of the Taviani Brothers, this film looks great, but it is rotten to the last detail by false romance, and coincidences lean heavily on each other in some kind of facsimile of "history." In fact, this is really just a sentimentally cheap tear, posing as an intellectually outstanding feature film.
