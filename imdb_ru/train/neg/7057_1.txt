This is one of the most annoying, meaningless films I've ever experienced. Every time it started to seem like it could get better, more and more sepia tones appear, accompanied by paranoid idiocy disguised as social commentary. The main character, Maddox, is a manipulative, potential rebel who lives in a mansion, seemingly without any parents or responsibility. The auxiliary cast is much nicer and more interesting, but, unfortunately, it has never been developed. We also never understand the character of John Stanton, allegedly influencing Maddox, in order to carry out acts of rebellion. At some point, I thought, “Aha! Maddox is just crazy and secretly deals with all these messages from the escaped mentally ill Stanton! Now we get somewhere! ”But, of course, it ends wrong, and the whole film turns out to be meaningless, both from the point of view of Maddox and the viewer. Where is Ferris Büller when we need him?
