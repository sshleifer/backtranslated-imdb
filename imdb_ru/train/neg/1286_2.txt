How does a Scotsman in kilt make love in a pretty purple heather? Very, very carefully. Now I have a clear advantage over many other reviewers that I was born in Scotland. Too many Americans take this simplistic nonsense seriously. This is a joke, people, “four legs are good - two legs are bad,” as was Orwell’s. Jessica Lange has an emphasis on the fact that the production of “The Brigadoon” by the amateur dramatic society “Wells” will be rejected. Liam Neeson - apparently popular among women - wears his kilt with all the prestige of a man whose great-grandmother once got off the train in Edinburgh Waverley. And the enemy is auld? Where would the Scots have been without them to hate and blame for everything? Lord Roth, Cox and Hert should be ashamed of conniving at such racist stereotypes. “Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves” seems to be a masterpiece of historical accuracy in comparison. And at least Alan Rickman was funny.
