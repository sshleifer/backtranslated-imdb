Ted V. Mickels film "The Fragile Crushers 2" is 103 minutes of painful cinematic spill. The plot is a mixture of meaningless business relationships between people who grind corpses into cat food, while cat aliens who are losing the war with alien dogs want some of this cat food. While watching this film, I began to look for some distractions, something to convince myself that I was doing something else besides losing my mind from the inside. <br /> <br /> Some scenes go on too long, as characters always do simple things. I heard that Mr. Mickels does not like to use jumps too often, fearing that they will confuse his audience. I am not sure whether this attitude is "avant-garde" or just "stupid." No matter how hard you try, I couldn’t force myself to take care of any of the characters of the overwhelmingly large squad, well, except perhaps for the old people who are the caretakers of the factory. Most of the actors are a group of not talented lovers who did not even bother to learn the texts of “Amazing Grace” before singing it on camera. Although, perhaps, this is the fault of the poor sound quality, since I actually heard only about 80% of the conversations while watching a DVD. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst movie ever made. I listened to the commentary fragments, and Mr. Mickels looks like an amazingly sweet old man. What the hell was he doing creating such garbage? I would like to hear explanations from old men who were supposed to lie shirtless on a metal conveyor belt, expecting to be sharpened. The films I have long hated seem so much better. I long for intermittently suitable Excalibur music and consistent lighting of Dawn of the Dead. I need to go and do something. I do not see this movie.
