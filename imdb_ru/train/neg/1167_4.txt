I really liked this movie, but in the end it just didnâ€™t work for me. I saw most of the results of Kitamura and found it to be very changeable. Live, like all his films, has an interesting plot, some elegant episodes and a fair amount of creativity. However, these qualities are painfully lacking in Alive. The plot is cool, if not all this original and could make for a cute ace. Unfortunately, the step is painfully slow, and it takes time for a film to get started before it reaches fairly predictable places. The action is almost bearable, with the final bout pretty cool, and the previous one with OK. The earlier of them is also overshadowed by the excessive speed of camera work, which makes it less consistent. There are some neat visuals and some interesting ideas floating around in the dialogue, but the film still drags badly. The characters are not well developed and do not have good actions, and the decor and overall colors are gray and boring. The film is not entirely horrible and has some interests, perhaps a reasonable use of the fast forward button can improve it. With about twenty minutes taken while running, it can be a pretty decent sci-fi thriller. But the feature film is boring. It is recommended only for very patient and determined fans of Kitumury.
