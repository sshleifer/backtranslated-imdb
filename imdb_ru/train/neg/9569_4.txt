Of course, not terrible, but definitely not good. <br /> <br /> “Cry, Beloved Country” (1995) was shot by Darrell Rudt and written for the screen by Ronald Harwood (adapted from the 1946 novel by Alan Paton). Starring James Earl Jones and Richard Harris. <br /> <br /> The film is about South Africa before apartheid and talks about the interweaving of black and white people. The pious but naive preacher Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones) receives a letter from Johannesburg saying that he must come immediately; he later finds that his son killed a man. Rich farmer / landowner James Jarvis (Richard Harris) believes that his son, a black rights activist, was killed by his son Kumalo. In this they unite. <br /> <br /> I can’t compare it with the eponymous film of 1951, because I have not seen it. Or the 1974 musical called “Lost in the Stars”, because I didn’t see it either; both look better than this. But Cry Freedom, on the other hand, I saw; he has a much more urgent air, as if he is trying to say something when the film “Cry, Beloved Country” does not seem to know where he is going. Very "sickly". I refuse to compare the film with the novel (except for the fact that I enjoyed the novel more than the film), because novels and films are two completely different media, and there is no point in trying to transfer one directly to another or compare them in the same way. . <br /> <br /> Honestly, this film exploded. Well, I think it was not so bad, five out of ten, but it was not so good. Both of the main roles, both very capable actors draw some of the most wooden performances I've ever seen, with some of the most awkward dialogues in the history of the movie (but you can blame the writer, Ronald Harwood, who is also strangely excluded from the game the film, also writing an exalted pianist and Be Julia). By the way, the meaning and themes of the novel are almost completely lost in the transition to the film for the third time; there is little, if any, tension at any point in the film, racially or in tension. Music does not help. The painfully irrelevant and boring pastoral orchestral tracks really help in this dull film. One of the advantages is cinematography, in which there are a lot of good or great pictures, but, unfortunately, this does not help the film too much. <br /> <br /> The last bright words of Alan Paton’s novel are displayed in the final moments of the film. It is a pity that they seem so detached from the film just shown. I do not know what Nelson Mandela could see in this film. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
