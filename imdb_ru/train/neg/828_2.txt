We'll see. In the finale of St. Elsewhere, we learned that there was no hospital and that everything was in the head of an autistic child. Newhart ended up telling us that it was all a dream. And Rosanna finished, telling us that it all happened in her head. Very creative " at least as far as it’s real on the screen. This type of series finale was made twice before, and was familiar, frustrating and just not fun to watch. Now is Newhart a dream? At least it’s done creatively that far exceeded expectations anyone who loved the show. The idea wasn’t too exciting but it was so brilliantly made that maybe it was the finale of the best series. Roseanna left me feeling deceived by being such a devoted fan.
