I was watching Peter Jackson’s version of The Lord of the Rings when I was reading The Two Towers halfway, and it seemed to me that it was just great. <br /> <br /> An animated version of The Lord of the Rings was released at this time. on DVD, but I told myself that I would finish reading “The Two Towers” ​​and “The Return of Kings” before watching them (as I thought, it showed the whole trilogy). <br /> <br /> So when I finished the trilogy, I went and brought a DVD, which was a stupid idea, because it was absolutely rubbish. <br /> <br /> I was bored for 20 minutes, which was very strange, because I love the book, and I am shocked that the creator of this film could even think about fitting at least 1.5 books in a two-hour 8-minute film. <br /> <br /> None of the characters experienced any emotions when they were talking, and it seemed that reading my page, even my favorite character, Gandalf, did not seem interesting to me. <br /> <br /> Animation was the only norm in some parts of the film, with the exception of the orcs (they looked terrible) and the faces of Aragorn and Sam. <br /> <br /> I don’t know how this film was released, because there wasn’t even a proper ending, but it might have been good that the creator ran out of money, because the film could not get better. <br /> <br /> I just hope no one judges a book on this film. <br /> <br /> 3/10
