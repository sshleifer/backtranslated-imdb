This is one of those films that you think producers would refuse to release because it's so terrible. Obviously, they thought children were stupid and great for absorbing endless commercials, and they thought they were entertainment because it was funny. What's up with the talking machine with the buttons that Wendy, McDonalds, M & M and Skittles are written on? There was no talking car in the cartoon. (Doctor) The claw must be evil, not beautiful and charming. Why is Rupert Everett "The Claw" anyway? Were the authors of the drug when they wrote these scenes? It seems that they (badly) are launching Robo Cop, turning a person into a criminal android. I tried to get my money back, but there was a policy according to which, if I watch a film lasting more than 30 minutes, you will not receive a refund. Sorry, I watched this pile of shit for more than 30 minutes. After I was informed about the no-return policy, I decided to look at the rest of the disgusting garbage called "Inspector Gadget."
