I saw this movie a few days ago ... what was it? <br /> <br /> I like films with Brian O'Halloran, they are fun and enjoyable. When I saw the name of this title and genre, I thought it was great, it could be really good ... some kind of parody of slashers or other horror films ... but ... then I read the preview and thought that everything it could be just as well ... but it wasn’t ... <br /> <br /> My opinion: if they look like films a bit like documentaries, with a bit of comedy, try Moore’s films or opening an alien, they’re really talking about this one was empty. <br /> <br /> and put a comedy in the headline ... no comment ... a very bad joke
