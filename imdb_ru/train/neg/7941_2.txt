When the 2000s came to an end, the adoptive daughter of King Kong went on and, with tears in her eyes, announced that her show was coming to an end. <br /> <br /> While Miss Winfrey was crying, I laughed and screamed like wild. Indian from the old west. <br /> <br /> What is Oprah doing? she takes famous people and puts them on her show. what famous people? people who suffered (just like her, except that these people lost more than their virginity), they had melted faces (true story), missing limbs (true story, see the end of the paragraph) and marital violence (count too much). and somehow they come to the show and tell their story, as if we had not heard it before many times (Bethany Hamilton, I heard your story about the loss of the shark’s hand from the first day, which was on October 31st, 2003. that you have no offense.) But the biggest thing, probably on Oprah, was an interview with Michael Jackson in 1993, when he was accused of corrupting a child. Unfortunately, Mr. Jackson has since passed away. but one particular show told about Michael's personal life, which few people knew at that time. <br /> <br /> Oprah’s real influence comes from middle-aged women and football moms. It seems they sometimes think that she is a personal Jesus. but all I see in Oprah is some big woman from the ghetto who made it big, and she just shows how rich she is. <br /> <br /> I am glad that her show will end soon. we need better television programs.
