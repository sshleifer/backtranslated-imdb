I was really looking forward to meeting the Planet of the Apes, but it was a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> The settings and masks are excellent, but this is the only good aspect of the movie. All other things are really annoying. Mark Wahlberg does not play, he's just in the movies, he looks stupid. Other actors are not very good either. <br /> <br /> But worst of all is the story. This is absolutely funny! For example: monkeys are lying unconscious on the ground, but people do not attack them, no, they wait until they get up again! This is just one example of a stupid story, but it will take too long to tell them everything.
