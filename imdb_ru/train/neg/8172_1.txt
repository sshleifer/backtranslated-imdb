Cannibalistic killer wilderness on the hunt, and two quarreling couples can be his next source of protein in this basement deal on Friday, the 13th clone of cheap stuff. There is literally nothing interesting in this, murders are surprisingly rare, and when they happen, they are completely amateurish. It also adds ghosts to the mix for no reason. I felt exhausted after watching, as if my brain was liquefying and draining my nose. And this is without a doubt the worst Donald Jones film. If you are thinking of renting it because of the chic re-release of the DVD Code Red, do not worry <br /> <br /> My rating: F
