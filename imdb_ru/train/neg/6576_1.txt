I totally disagree with those comments that say this is a good movie. This is a totally sucked movie. I mean REMOTE - S.U.C.K.E.D. The history of development is strange. Mia Kirchner has turned from an innocent girl into a party lover who is looking for fun occasions for no convincing reason. In addition, all the actresses looked too old to be college students - college students were about 30 years old - you understood everything. I watched only the first ten minutes and began to fast forward in search of sex scenes. all sex scenes are lame, hasty and, most importantly, have no front scenes at all. All the sex scenes are ridiculous, considering how much clothes they have. Do yourself a favor - save it and save yourself a few dollars. Conclusion: history - 0, sex - 0, acting - 0, rating - 0 out of 10.
