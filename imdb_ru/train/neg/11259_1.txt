I gave 1 to this film. I can't understand how Ettore Scola, one of the biggest directors of Italian cinema, made such a film, so stupid and funny! All the stories of people participating in the film are irrelevant, boring and not interesting. Too long, too boring. In this film, I save only Giancarlo Giannini and Vittorio Gasmann. I hope that Scola will radically change the themes and style in his next film.
