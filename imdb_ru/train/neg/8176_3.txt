I watched this movie last night with anticipation, but in fact I was not very impressed. <br /> <br /> With the exception of Combo, I thought the game was bad and the plot was limited. It was like the drama "Made for Television". <br /> <br /> I felt that the film was very far-fetched. From the very beginning, the whole process of confrontation with the context (yes, we understand that this is Britain of the 80s, now you can stop) was tedious and gave a very one-sided idea of ​​what life was like in Britain in the 80s - Margaret Thatcher’s poverty contrasted the war royal power, but between them there is nothing? At that time there were middle classes - just working people with decent wages and mortgages. I suppose the clips of the Falkland Islands were also added randomly to the end, for a “dramatic effect”. <br /> <br /> The sequence of events looked a bit fragmented, as the characters moved one action to another without we saw how their thinking could change so quickly. <br /> <br /> Relationships between “Sean” and “Smell” were not easy. I could not even look during the scene of the nogging. It is very hard for me to believe that she would be attracted by a boy who was not only much younger, but also looked much younger. I know that there were only four years between them, but four years is nothing when you reach the age of twenty, but in adolescence this is a huge difference! In my experience, such a difference in age between adolescents occurs only when the girl is younger, since girls grow up much faster and more on the wave in boys for several years older. Sorry, but I did not buy it - an unnecessary plot point created for a shock value. <br /> <br /> The ending was somewhat sharp and, again, contrived. If the incident with throwing the flag was supposed to be a sign, then in my eyes it was somewhat short. <br /> <br /> It bothers me that British films only concern the upper classes or the poor. Don't get me wrong, I love Trainspotting, and Four Weddings has its charms, but can't we, the British, offer something else? Why are our films always so obsessed with the class system? I was born in 1973, so by age it was not very different from what Sean would have been in 1983. I grew up in a single-parent family in a rather poor municipal estate in a town in England. However, my childhood experience was very different from that described in the film - I don’t even remember that racism was a problem (although I don’t say that it wasn’t). "This is England"? Not in my experience. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that I felt that this film lacked content, and I was completely boring and not impressed everywhere.
