I just recently learned that Madeleine L'Engle's novel was turned into a Disney television movie and ordered a DVD. This book was my favorite when I was a kid, and I read it several times. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that some of the children's actors are not like the characters described in the novel, the Merry family is well played, with cute (if too cute) Meg in the center and Charles Wallace, who is persuasive as a child prodigy, without becoming annoying. <br /> <br /> The first half hour is quite promising, they do well in establishing relationships between the leading characters and the stage. Unfortunately, as soon as non-human characters appear, the adaptation begins to disintegrate, and as soon as the children leave the earth, everything falls apart. Alfre Woodward looks too young and too regal, like the eccentric Mrs. Watsit (instead Miriam Margolis or Joan Pleight), and Kate Nelligan's face is so disguised and expressionless that in recent years she must have visited plastic surgeon Fay Dunaway. For some reason, they make her Mrs., who looks like Glinda from The Wizard of Oz, when she ought to be like the good, evil sorcerer of the West. <br /> <br /> In the end, what brings it the worst is a terrible special effect and artistic direction. I understand that this is a television film, but CGI looked like something that could be done 15 years ago. The incarnation of the centaur Mrs. Wattsits is a disaster, like a costume like Chewbacca for Aunt Beast, which in the novel is a velvety, elegant creature instead of a clumsy thing like Big Foot, shown here. I could go on and on, almost every artistic choice is a catastrophe, presumably because there was not a large enough budget to justify it, and also because the project work lacked imagination and common sense. <br /> <br /> It would really need the feeling of astonishment Spielberg brought to his early films. What a pity that with the current popularity of adapting children's literary fantasy series no one thought about adapting Wrinkles in Time and its extensions to the big screen, giving it the scale it deserves.
