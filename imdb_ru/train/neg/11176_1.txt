I saw this film in an early preview, and I can't help but emphasize how badly I thought that this film was. From the very beginning, the audience groaned from the awful southern accent of Pacino. Poor Al looked very, very haggard, and I cannot decide whether it was intentionally part of his role as a drug addict, or maybe he just didnâ€™t get enough sleep before coming to the set. But much worse than a close-up of Pacino, is the pitiful excuse for conspiracy. At the beginning of the film we are given evidence that the character Pacino is gay, and I suspect that this is exactly what the screenwriter intended. Later, however, we must suspend our distrust and believe that both Thea Leoni and Kim Basinger (both of whom lunate in lame roles) crave this elderly, half-dead, effeminate man with a funny accent. The worst part in general was the main theme of the plot, which was related to corporate espionage, which is never fully explained, and we never care about the slightest. Since it was a preview, I will leave the final decision behind me because of the possibility of re-filming and editing, but you can bet that I will not pay a cent to see it in cinemas.
