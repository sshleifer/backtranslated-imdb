The film is filmed much less. Vanessa Redgrave dies, but before she leaves, she begins to tell her daughters the story of her life and her secret love ... <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that looks and expects it to become A great movie just because there are so many great actors and actresses in it, so it looks like itâ€™s about something other than the action movie itself. Not bad, but with Redgrave, Tony Collett, Glenn Close, Meryl Streep, Claire Danes, Natasha Richardson, Eileen Atkins, Patrick Wilson, Hugh Darcy and others (all give great performances) you expect more than just a weeping story that is a little more novel harlequins. <br /> <br /> Wait for Cable.
