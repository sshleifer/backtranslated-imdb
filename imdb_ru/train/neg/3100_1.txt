Hobgoblins .... Hobgoblins .... where do I start?!? <br /> <br /> This film gives Manos - Hands of Fate and Future War a race for the money, like the worst movie ever made. Laughing at this is fun, and Manos was just painful to watch. Hobgoblins will end up in a time capsule somewhere like the perfect movie to describe the term "80s cheese." Acting skills (and I use this term at ease) are terrible, hobgoblins are one of the worst puppets you have ever seen, and the fight with garden tools must be seen to be believed. The film was the perfect medium for MST3K, and this version is the only way to see this mess. In this film, Mike and the bots have a lot of ammunition to pull out some of the funniest one-line players that they have ever done. If you try to see it without the help of Mike and bots ..... God help you !!
