My dear Lord, what a movie! Let's first talk about “special effects”. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those fanatics of effects, but I really thought that overlaying was a practice of the long past, mostly the 60s. For some time I thought that they could have recorded this film a long time ago, and it took them a long time to cut and release it. But as far as I know, in the 60s they didn’t have cell phones ... <br /> <br /> What I’m looking for in the movies is basically a good story with a really good message. To act again, the effects are secondary, I do not even mind a few small inconsistencies. However, in such films as this bad game, improbability, etc., all this makes a bad movie even worse - this is what happened to me in Celeste's prophecy. <br /> <br /> My wife said that the book is really good, and although I do not like all these spiritual things, I somehow see that this can be conveyed in a believable way - the film could not do it. <br /> <br /> Maybe one single reason for viewing this one, though. If you really love cheese films, then this will be right for you. If IMDb stars were for kindness, not quality, I MUST give this movie a rating of ten stars. <br /> <br /> By the way, three stars for the worst films, such as Critical Mass. (look at the comments on this - funny). Celestine's prophecy is at least somewhat entertaining.
