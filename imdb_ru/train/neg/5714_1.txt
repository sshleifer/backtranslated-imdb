I have seen many good Korean films, including thrillers and films with a darker overtone, but this sucks. The director seems to be a sadist who accidentally found someone to produce garbage. The film does not have any entertainment value and is not even a thriller. I can not believe that someone really made such a film. Despite the fact that acting is fine, the storyline and the feeling that it leaves are terrible. <br /> <br /> I am sure that I will not watch the films of this director. There is no point in making a film, and a complete disappointment in thrillers. All that is is a show of scenes with a psychopath wasting drums with poorly shot scenes and a demonstration of more blood and violence, which makes it exciting. A very disappointing movie, and I highly recommend skipping all movies of this kind.
