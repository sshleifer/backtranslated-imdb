Run ... do not go away from this movie !!!!! This film, aimed at the youngest children, will tire you to tears. If the 90s Gamera trilogy raised the bar, this film simply dropped it. This slow pace and fighting monsters is good, but rarely visible. This film made me flinch in a cat box. Just a very bad offer after the phenomenal series of the 90s. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS, FOR THIS POINT !!!!!!!!!!! Here are 10 top reasons why Gamera fans from the 90s series will hate this movie. <br /> <br /> 10. This film is a drama that tells about a child who is trying to cope with the death of his mother, and is afraid of losing to Hamer in battle after learning that his father had seen adult Hamera. <br /> <br /> 9. You see adult Gamera, perhaps for a minute at the beginning of the film. He gets hit on the ass by several Giao and self-destruct ??? He looks old and lethargic. In addition, he is not like any gamer you have ever seen. His suit looked cheap and rushed. <br /> <br /> 8. The young Gamer, whom you see in the rest of the film, looks like a pokemon. Big-eyed and cute ... he will remind you about the baby Godzilla from Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla 2. Gamera is now too cute. <br /> <br /> 7. This film has a NASCAR race viewing pace during a 3-hour rain delay. I watched this movie with two other Gamera fans, and no one was happy with how slowly this movie went. I saw an SUV full of fat people riding a mountain road moving faster. <br /> <br /> 6. Like Godzilla: Final Wars, this movie had very little time for kaiju. Final Wars had a lot more, in fact, and better fights, albeit short ones. <br /> <br /> 5. Children play the main role. The theme of all the kids and the poor writing killed the original Gamera series in the 1970s, and the story repeats in the 2000s. The most successful films of Gamers have abandoned the feeling of Sesame Street and have gone to a darker place. Why go back to a failed formula? It was supposed to be a new trilogy, and bad ticket sales killed all hope of continuing this story (thank God). <br /> <br /> 4. Gamera lost his cult roar. Now it sounds like an Elephant with sore throat. <br /> <br /> 3. This film could be a new Olympic event ... Imagine a baton that involves sending very young children at risk. You must see the end in order to understand this moment. Where were the parents? Oh yeah ... right there they send their children to the kaiju battle zone. <br /> <br /> 2. The special effects were good, but not the same as in the Gamera movie. Legion and Iris had better effects. The best effect was the demonstration of an apple the size of a baby Gamera. Not too impressive. <br /> <br /> 1. This film is not at all what adult Kayu fans expect. The director was involved in the Power Rangers, and it shows. It looks like a cross between ET, Always: Sunset on Third Street and TMNT. Kudos, if you know all 3 links. <br /> <br /> Rent at best or look once if you buy it to finish the DVD series.
