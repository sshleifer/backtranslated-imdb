It starts with a good note, only to hesitate and disappoint quickly. <br /> <br /> The characters Mack (Akshay Kumar) and Sam (John Abraham) are not properly created until Mac's boss decides to associate him with three flight attendants. The rest of the drama talks about how Mac, Sam and Uncle Mambo (Paresh Raval) deal with situations that sometimes seem forced. <br /> <br /> As for the cast, Paresh Rawal is a very talented actor, I thought he was lost in the role of a sullen cook. Akshay Kumar is tolerant, John Abraham stumbles very badly on furniture, and Rajpal Yadav is the only saving grace in the film. <br /> <br /> The second half of the film is at times amusing, but in all DUD (songs are boring) and serious disappointment if you are hoping for some useful entertainment and comedy.
