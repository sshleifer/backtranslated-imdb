Gadar is an example of one of the worst overpriced films in Bollywood. Directed by Anil Sharma, who prefers to act in films related to history, gives the film for trash. The songs were boring, and this is not the song you want to listen to in your car, full volume. Sunny Deol is known for making stupid films where he beats up 100 bad guys on his own. He even kicks the metal door to the prison (Indian) and kicks the moving car away (Tisri Anh). I can give you 50 more examples of the shameful actions of Sunny Deol. But I'm sure most people already know this. Sunny gives a pitiful idea, repeating the same role again. A guy who claims to be fighting for his country using violence. Amisha Patel is an incredibly sexy body with a gorgeous body that I would really like to But even she couldnâ€™t save the film from a disaster. Instead of wearing sexy clothes, as she usually does, in this film she does not. Perhaps because she played a Muslim, but she does not behave as in the film. In general, this is a bad show, I'm sure it will appeal to some people who like to see a Bollywood actor beat 100 guys. Give me a break.
