In general, beautifully photographed and skillfully acted, but the writing is very boring. There are scenes so incredible that there is no joy in watching. For example, the fact that the young lover has a twin brother is so contrived that I groaned out loud. And the “connection with the bulb of emotions” also seems strange. <br /> <br /> Although I do not know. If you have several glasses of wine and you want to relax with something cute to watch in several sluggish comedy scenes, this is a pretty good movie. No serious effort is required from the viewer. But an Italian film, especially an Italian comedy, is usually much better than this one.
