* SPOILERS INCLUDED * <br /> <br /> With a name like "Bleed", you know that creative juices were not up to par when this puppy was conceived. The film is your usual low-budget film-slasher. Oh, of course, he is trying to be creative with the premise of the "murder club", but we learn that it was just a joke. Well, for those who really care about these things, the main plot is that a new girl in the city starts dating her colleague. He invites her to his circle of friends, and at the party they tell her how they have a “murder club”, and they kill people, blah blah blah. Well, we learn that it was a joke, but not before our heroine killed a lady in the garage. Now the "members" of the Murder Club are being killed one by one. Oh, and the bad guys win, and the film ends in depression. By then, you don't care. <br /> <br /> Looking back, the first 10 minutes of the film does not make sense. The motivation for the killings at the beginning of the film is never explained. I would say that for the director it was a way to promote a movie, but there are deleted scenes on the DVD! I'm not sure why anyone would like to see more than the full-length version of “Bleed”, but obviously, people behind the DVD thought that the audience would demand more. The box says that there are Easter eggs, but damn it, I would like to waste my time looking for extras in this film, and this is beyond my power. <br /> <br /> I was expecting a bad movie, and “Bleed” made on that front. It was not a funny bad movie. In the film, everything looks good, and there is a lot of nudity, but acting is just awful. My least favorite character is the guy who turns out to be the killer ... I think he should be funny and funny, but he just ends up becoming a tool. I think the funniest moment in the film is when our heroine kills a woman in the garage as a result of a funny unconvincing death. The heroine pushes women into a cement pole in the garage, and the woman looks as if she has barely hit her, spits out a sip of blood and "dies." <br /> <br /> For those who believe that making films is a complex, creative process carried out by professionals, see “Bleed”. This will change your mind and you will understand that any movie can be hacked. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, don’t waste time and money.
