This film was terrible. I watched it three times, and not even everything. It is simply impossible to watch, the storyline sucks, it is depressing and completely disgusting. I don't write spoilers for anything, so if you want to know why this is so disgusting, see for yourself. The only good thing about this film was John Savage, his early dialogue and some funny roles in the film. The little kid in this movie is annoying, and the whole situation is bullshit. I saw this movie in cinemas across America, so I assumed it would be a good movie. Jesus Christ, I was wrong !!!! All this is terrible, but the naked figure itself is lame and nasty. Another thing is that Starr Andref, another protagonist, was not in such bad films in the past, in fact she was in some pretty good films. Same with John Savage. This movie sucks!
