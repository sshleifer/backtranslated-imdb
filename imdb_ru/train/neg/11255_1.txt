In short, this film was boring. He lacked life and spark. Big problem with two wires. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow did not have any chemistry. He was boring and she was annoying. <br /> <br /> Visual effects were interesting, but they didnâ€™t enhance the scene. In any case, visual effects tended to separate the audience from what was happening on the screen. None of the sequences of actions seemed real, and therefore the film could not create any real drama or sense of danger. <br /> <br /> The film had potential, but it required a better script, a better game and a better director. I kept thinking during the movie, you know, this movie would work if Harrison Ford was the heavenly captain, Karen Allen was Polly, and Steven Spielberg was the director. <br /> <br /> Ignore the criticism of this film. Critics, I think, praise the film because they * want * to like it, and want it to succeed, even if it failed on many different levels.
