You collected 5 writers, each of whom wrote his story with a different genre, and then you try to make one film out of it. This action, this adventure, this is fantastic, this is Western, this is a mess. Sorry, but this film absolutely stinks. 4.5 gives him a terribly high rating. However, it is these kind of films that make me think that I can write films, and I can hardly write.
