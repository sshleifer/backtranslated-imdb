The original “Disappearing Point” was a great movie. Subtle motifs, characters that seemed real and spontaneous. The remake was terrible. The sermon is clearly obvious; he missed the point of why the original was a classic. Black Charger was cool, but even that could not save this click. Why hold on to the white Challenger? I did not think it was the best choice in 1970. Some parts of the film were unintentionally funny. For example, when Vigo stood on a cliff overlooking a canyon after his “Dream Search”. His Indian friend was standing next to him. Vigo wore only his white underwear. Sorry - it looked stupid - he looked at the picture in his book, The Fruits of Looms. Another scene was at the end - after an explosive collision with bulldozers - the announcer said that the impact was accelerated to 180 miles per hour. He then mentions that the police said that his remains were not found because he evaporated, but some people believe that he was rescued and was hidden by friends in the crowd. Then it shows that he is rolling out of the car at a speed of 180 miles per hour! First of all, you could not open the car door at 180 miles per hour. Secondly, the car will not continue moving in a straight line for 100 yards. with no one to manage it. This will quickly roll over about 30 times. Thirdly, if you hit the sidewalk at 180 miles an hour, you will fall into various soft pieces. No matter, we see him at the end, standing with his daughter. In general, a film that offends someone's intellect.
