A very common horror story about a luxury building in Brooklyn that hides the gates to hell. This is reminiscent of The Tenant of Polanski (released a year before Sentinel), but too far from a film of a Polish director in any possible aspect. The "tenant" was so disturbing, while the "Guardian" was not at all like that. <br /> <br /> In this film, it is most surprising that the great names of American cinema (Burgus, Gardner, Wallach), veteran actors playing for food (probably) were shot in it. <br /> <br /> Verdict: hardly interesting. <br /> <br /> * My rating: 4/10
