A rather disappointing prequel to the first two films, there is neither expectation nor interest of the second one in it. Concentrating on the guys who "control" the cube, it basically eliminates any sense of tension inside the cube, as we just do not care about the characters inside. Most of the film is just boring, and it becomes truly terrible with the appearance of the older glass-eyed and crazy green-eyed marine. After that, however, it simply descends into excessive unintentional gaiety. The end fits, though, indirectly associating it with the first. The script is terrible, at best, acts mediocre, and the direction is not impressive. Much less follow-up.
