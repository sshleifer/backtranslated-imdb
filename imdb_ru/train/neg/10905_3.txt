The guy is a loser. He can not find girls, needs to grow, they are chosen by stronger, more successful guys, etc. We looked, saw, went further. I have to say that Rob must pass by Adam Sandler part of his life. And get the hell out of Adam Sandler. There are two funny parts in the whole movie. I could not even finish the last 5 minutes. I was bored. “Animal” is a good movie. I usually like Adam Sandler films that have the same plot. But it was too hard to impress. Jokes are very old. So believe me. This is not a movie that most people could get into. But some have done so, so I'll be fine. <br /> <br /> 3/10
