BLIMEY! I did not know that someone would make this film! it's horrible! I recorded 5 things that can explain why you don’t want to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> No. 1: “This is the biggest rave ever”, where is this rave? I saw only a few people dancing around. <br /> <br /> 2. when they are on a rave, they can ONLY see blood everywhere, without people, two destroyed tents and one scene ... and what are they doing!? they are drinking! <br /> <br /> 3. Worst actors I've ever seen! the captain and his team .. terrible! <br /> <br /> 4. when one of the people shoots from a regular rifle, he shoots almost 30 times without reloading! <br /> <br /> 5. I did not know that everyone in the world can fight like a professional! must be a new thing. <br /> <br /> I wonder what the producer thought! "It will be a big hit, it will be a classic" ... of course, you stupid, in any case, do not watch this film, its waistline of time. My eyes are still bleeding!
