This ghostly Kiesi Kurosawa film is pretty wild, and there was at least one leap in it that took me by surprise. But overall, the film is incredibly stupid, with a detective trying to track down a suspected serial killer, only to find out that he may have committed one of the crimes. Then he discovers that he is being pursued by a gorgeous Asian female ghost, and he has no idea why (like the viewer). As other murders are committed, he becomes even more confused because the killers are easy to find, and this ghost still haunts him for some reason. Not only is the plot completely stupid, the lady-ghost is the funniest of all, especially when she suddenly flies through the city like Wonder Woman. And the finale doesn't make much sense; in fact, the whole movie has little meaning, and I can't recommend it at all. If it were not so serious, I would have thought that it was a black comedy. Outside of the Bright Future, this is the worst film directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa, whom I have ever seen.
