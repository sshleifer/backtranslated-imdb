No, I'm not joking. If they ever propose a film idea, they should be kicked out of the studio. I'm serious. Their films are absolutely identical in all, and they consist only of trips abroad, with a problem that they easily solve, hoping to become popular, and with new guys. I'm thinking about it. If you have ever seen a movie in which they were filmed with another storyline, contact me and name it. These "films" are bad excuses to be on television and go to other countries. There is a reason that movies never go to the cinema. I am sure that when they were very young and did a little bit of O.K. films, some studio manager bought all of their rights in 15 years, or so, now that they, 17 years, could make films in other countries, when they want, using studio money. Let me advise you, stay away from Mary-Kate and Ashley! THIS IS FOR YOUR GOOD!
