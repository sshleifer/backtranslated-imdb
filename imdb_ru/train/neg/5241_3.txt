Tell the truth, I'm a little overwhelmed by seeing all these positive reviews from many people, which is also the main reason why I actually decided to watch this movie. And after I saw him, I was really disappointed, and this comes from a guy who loves this movie genre. <br /> <br /> I’m completely surprised by this film - it’s like a child’s film with nudity for no reason, and all this is due to the fact that small children swear and swear. I'm not completely righteous, but it really went too far in my account. <br /> <br /> Overview: the story of two guys was sent to the program of the older brother for their reckless behavior. There, they met with one child with obsession tits, and the other - a medieval freak. <br /> <br /> The name itself has nothing to do with history. They are not role models and / or doing anything, but they serve their time for what they have done. The story is very predictable (although expected), and humor is lame. And haven't we already seen the same characters (played by McLovin) in many other films (for example, Sasquatch Gang?). I think I laughed three times and almost fell asleep. <br /> <br /> Well, at the casting, everything is in order, because he is the one who creates the script. And the game is so-so, as expected, when you watch this type of movie. And the direction is what to expect? This is the guy who brought us Wet Hot American Summer, and this film sucks too. But somehow he always managed to attract some kind of star to attract his awful movie. <br /> <br /> In any case, I felt not just a deceiver, but a waste of time. Only the naked scenes seem to be the best in the film. I can not understand why I should recommend this to anyone. <br /> <br /> Pros: Elizabeth Bank? Two topless scenes. <br /> <br /> Cons: not funny, horrible story, nudity and children do not mix together. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3.5 / 10 (class: F)
