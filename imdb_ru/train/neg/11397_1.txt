It was really awful! He had a terrible storyline, he acted poorly and was like an amateur remake of the evil dead, but not nearly as good. <br /> <br /> I needed all my perseverance to get through this, it was a good job, you didnâ€™t need to go to the toilet, I doubt that I would come back! This makes Hammer House of Horror look like a Hollywood epic with a big screen. <br /> <br /> The only value of this film is the endless supply of beautiful women. Not bad among them! <br /> <br /> If you want to have fun with friends after a night on beer, then this is for you ... otherwise avoid it like the plague!
