I bought this movie, an exciting super free bloodbath. I have not received any of them. This film fails at almost every level, in no way frightening or ridiculous, it is just a horrible film, and never gives the viewers anything worth seeing. What is so bad about this is that it is not at all as rude, cruel, and cruel as promised, very little violence. Virtually no spilled blood and no excitement. Acting, leadership and dialogue is absolutely unbearable. Honestly, this is really funny. I could hardly sit through this total garbage once; I certainly never want to watch it again. Do not waste your time on wasting celluloid like this; it really is perhaps the worst movie ever made. If I could give him a minus star, I would.
