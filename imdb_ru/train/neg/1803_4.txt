Here is one of those educational short films designed to get strangers to know about the facts of life. This time, the target audience is pre-adolescent girls, a fact of life is menstruation. This animated film, created by Walt Disney Pictures, seems to be sponsored by Kotex. <br /> <br /> It begins with an explanation of how hormones make you grow and develop. With the help of the animation and the female narrator, he shows us how the body works, especially the ovaries, the uterus and the vagina, and why it all leads to menstruation. It is almost surprising, becoming here a comic note how to avoid the topic of sex. Even the word is never mentioned, although the "fertilized" will pass once. I really don't know why I saw it, but since this is one of those rare short films that can give the impression of an innocent time, you can try.
