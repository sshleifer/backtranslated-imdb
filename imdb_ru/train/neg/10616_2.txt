Dire. Just awful. The script is invented, the actor painful, and the story just drags on. This is, without a doubt, the celebration of Sally Potter and some more. It would not be so bad, but she is the director, screenwriter and star of the film, and this is just self-praise. I found that I was not indifferent to the developing romance between the two main characters, and the finale did not come right away. It has two redemptive features. First, many of the pictures are really very cute, especially in Paris, and look pretty good in black and white. Secondly, whether or not you are a fan of tango, the music is generally excellent (except when Sally starts singing). Watch this movie at your own peril or risk, or if you need an unintentional laugh. I'm sure someone likes it. According to statistics, it should.
