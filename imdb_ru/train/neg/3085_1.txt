Description: Roots, completely stupid and useless. It's so cheap and unconvincing that it makes you wonder why these abnormally stupid people spent about 2 months or so to spend the budget (I suppose it is ...), probably not more than 700 dollars to make this film. The watch was just hysterical with or without the Mystery Science Theater. I give you the best advice in the world: <br /> <br /> Rid yourself, save your time, life and money, DO NOT - repeat, DO NOT even think about whether you should watch this movie. This film is so banal that it makes your face turn purple from outraged boredom. If you have a single digit IQ, then be my guest and watch this absolutely disgusting movie. You might really admire it. (As I said earlier, if you have a single-digit IQ) <br /> <br /> With about 12 of your own actors, a few puppets you bought at a garage sale, and, of course, cameras and music, I guarantee make a slightly more interesting home video than this piece of absolute crap.
