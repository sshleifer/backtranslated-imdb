In keeping with Disneyâ€™s well-known practice of stealing ... I mean ... foreclosures and looting of famous properties, this version of the venerable live action cartoon has become one of the worst reworkings in a year of failure to re-do. I grew up on the original animated series. Any episode of the original animated series will bring you more laughter than this entire film. There is no real cool computer book penny. There is also no gag with auto-destructive orders that always end up detonating on the Chef. New is a smooth talking gadget-gig (in the original cartoon there was a cooler vehicle that could turn into a van or car) and an element of a typical, unrealistic Hollywood novel. Do not fill the chests to pay for Disney executives and even for their _ex_executive - do not watch this movie. <br /> <br />
