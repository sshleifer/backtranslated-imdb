From the very beginning, you know how this movie will end. It's so clichéd that your typical NRA member won't like this movie. I give it 2 out of 10, just because of the game of William Benton. I can not believe that people voted for 6+ for this film. This is so biased to “a certain point of view” (once a thief ...). People are not born bad. They are also not born good. They are born from scratch. It is society, parents and education that make them as they are. And if they turn the wrong way, somewhere on the line, then, of course, not the American criminal system will return them to the right path! Anyway, avoid this movie like the plague. I bet you have more important things to do than to waste them on this nonsense. <br /> <br />
