Well, I caught this movie halfway, but .oh.dear.god.it.sounds.like.they are.all.reading.from.scripts. <br /> <br /> Especially that guy who is now in the Teachers and the Book Group, although at least he proved that he can act if he wants! (the part where someone has a heart attack, stands out as a bastion of bad filmmaking, both in terms of acting, scripts, and general credibility. The film has ever, at least the original, and had actors whose performance did not resemble such as serious, but hopeless GCSE students who are trying to get a passing score, not so much as a Human Traffic, as a car accident!
