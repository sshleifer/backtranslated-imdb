Slaughter High is essentially your 80s symbolic slasher movie. The joke is out of control, leaving the monstrous guy terribly burned. After a few years, the hideous guy comes back and starts killing people who hurt him. Now the story may seem intriguing and very interesting, but what makes this horrible film so different from the rest of the 80s movie is that there are some flaws in it without humor and a continuation error. <br /> <br /> The game is terrible, but not really as bad as you would expect. Although it does not help that every character in the film is so dirty and unattractive. The presenter, Carol Manning (Caroline Munro), is perhaps the greatest tormentor of all, and it is she who, I believe, should share compassion and root for us. Not to mention that the geek guy is almost too disgusting, and I think that even the stereotypical geeks themselves will be rudely crazed and just plain outraged by how disgusting he is, so that when he gets confused, someone really cares ? <br /> <br /> There is a lot of unintentional laughter. Munro's lack of acting talent is quite obvious, which puts her on the same level as the rest of the terrible actors. Nevertheless, the greatest entertainment is easy to get when the film is poorly trying to present Munro, who at the time is already over thirty, as a teenager among teenagers. And then, when it comes to later life, and Munro plays at his real age, the rest of the actors do not pass as adults. All this fits well with the theme of the song, which is a cheerful thrash pose of heavy metal, accompanied by a maniacal laugh and a cry of "I'll get you." With this in mind, Slaughter High is not really a very good slasher, but it has poor entertainment value. Perhaps this is important for fans of hardcore slasher, but do not expect from this dilemma, expectations, or any trust. Horrible!!!
