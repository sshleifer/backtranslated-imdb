I have to congratulate the genius who approved it. Edward Furlong, you are not as good as you think, mate, you canâ€™t grab every piece of cheap amateur shit whose only intention is to get some money. <br /> <br /> Shooting is bad, and I mean BAD. Anyone who has a camera will get the same result or better. <br /> <br /> Acting, let's just say: do not go to the supermarket in search of actors. Good ones usually come with a degree or at least have some damn experience! Director ... Mr. John Kee, please find your purpose in life as a director, you just suck. You have bad direction, the corners are all mixed up (not in a good way), the lines look like they are being read from toilet paper, and damn music ... it always appears when it shouldn't and goes out for no apparent reason. And, by the way, do not look for a writer either. Making films is not the same as working in a cafe, it requires skill and skill, and I really doubt that you will ever have it. <br /> <br /> Instead of making a terrible film about the shootings, you should have made this movie. return to oblivion and wait until something good comes .. Or just go and find a job in a cafe. You will have less stress, and you will save movie lovers some money and a bad night. <br /> <br /> Vote: 1/10 (my first)
