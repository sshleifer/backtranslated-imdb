Dakota (1988) was another early car in the lead role of Lou Diamond Phillips. This film is similar to the later released Harley film. There are a few differences, but both are the same. I do not know who came first. I think it will remain one of the mysteries of life. But they are both concerned "children" who are trying to turn life around. Instead of bikes, horses are involved. It's basically the same movie, and both are damn foolish. If you are a serious doctor of law fan, then I recommend you to see them both. You get extreme robbery and posturing from L.D.P. if you play, then go. <br /> <br /> Not recommended, except for L.D.P. fans !!!
