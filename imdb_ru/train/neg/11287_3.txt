This is a movie that needed to live. In the year of its release, the legendary film critic Barry Norman considered him the worst film of the year, and I did not hear anything bad about him, especially the plot, which was criticized for being too complicated. <br /> <br /> Frankly, the plot resembles red herring and the film suffers even more when the word “plot” is used, because, as I understand it, there is no plot as such. There is something related to the Russian gangsters, a character named Pete Thompson, who is trying to get pregnant with his wife Sarah, and an Irish guy named Sean. How they all fit into what is called a “plot”, I'm not sure. It is difficult to explain the plots of Guy Ritchie films, but if you watch any of his films, I’m sure that we can all agree that they all have one, no matter how complex they may seem at the first viewing. Similarly, the James Bond film, although the scenes are stretched with battle scenes. You will have serious problems, as in RANCID ALUMINUM there is a central plot of any type that can be convincingly explained. <br /> <br /> If you look at the cast, you’ll hear enough warnings about which movie you’re going to present. Sadie Frost has appeared in some of the worst British films made in the last 15 years, and she doesn’t do anything to become inconsistent. Stephen Berkoff calls himself a bad figure (and he plays a character named Kant, who sums up the wit of this film), while one of the minor characters is played by a TV presenter, presumably because no serious actress will be seen in this film. > <br /> The only thing I can say about this film is that it is completely forgotten. I saw it a few days ago, and right after watching it, I was going to write a very long critical review warning people about what they allowed themselves to watch, but now I mostly forgot why. But this does not change the fact that I remember that I really did not like this piece of shit
