He had memories from “The Dances with the Wolves” for big prairies, Indians, military battles and from “Barry Lyndon” for the British and the atmosphere of candles ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the script is terrible: there is not enough continuity (excerpts “in 5 months”, “in 3 years”), and the romance is so ridiculous that it is hard to believe: America is a big country, but the characters all the time run into each other; First of all, wait until the end, and you will understand how to kill the story (imagine the same thing in the Titanic). <br /> <br /> Sometimes a brilliant director saves a bad script.
