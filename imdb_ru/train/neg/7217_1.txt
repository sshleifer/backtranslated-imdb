I just watched this DVD at home. We love westerns, so my husband took it off. He began to apologize to me halfway through. Saddles, costumes, accents - everything was off. What made me so angry was that the guy didn’t shoot a “collector” with a bow and arrows when he took the soul of a fat man. His only excuse was “he had only 2 arrows left”. We looked through it all, and as someone else said ... too many bad things to single out one reason why it sucks. I mean the fact that the boy accidentally snatched an evil stone from the collector the same month and day he was found, what's the point? And why was there a grave yard, where everyone died on April 25, and the people whose souls were collected by the collector still walked around? If you want a movie to laugh after a few beers, this could be your movie. However, if you want a real western, you will hate this movie.
