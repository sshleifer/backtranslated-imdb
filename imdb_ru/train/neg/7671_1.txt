The film begins with scrollable text, which takes almost five minutes. This gives a basic summary of what is happening. This could be easily done using acting skills, but instead you get the effect of scrolling the text. Shortly after characters are shooting at you, of which you will learn a little, keep in mind that this is EVERYTHING that you will learn about them. The plot begins to take off, and then falls through the entire movie. Not only is the plot changing, but you can even ask yourself if you are watching the same movie. I have never played video games, but I know people who have. As I understand it, whether you played the game or not, this film is not getting any better. Save your money if you do not like to sleep in cinemas.
