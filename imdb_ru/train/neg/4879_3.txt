Is there anything worse than a comedy film without humor? The answer is yes; one that does not cause any interest in the whole picture. The premise is not so bad - a naive frontman for an illegal business - but this is a cauldron with a bad script and scenario, and it simply does not work. <br /> <br /> Was it a good B in 1942? It is hard to imagine. The only positive aspect of the film is the cast, which contains several famous people of the 30s and 40s, such as Warren Heimer, Vince Barnett and Robert Armstrong (I always dismiss Richard Cromwell as the weak who killed Gary Cooper in "The Life of Bengal Lancer ", So I did not consider it). <br /> <br /> I cannot recommend this and rated it at 3 - if you have a choice, get a root canal,
