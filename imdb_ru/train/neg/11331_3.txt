With all due disrespect for this “epic” of George Stevens Sr. about mistakes and incorrect reading, I can only be surprised that the “legend” of James Dean could have survived this peak, I contend that the farmer’s bow studio their "gigantism". Rock and Liz were not so much better. Let's just say that the Dallas televised was a true “heir”, even if modern (current) “teksany”, such as Lei and Do, not to mention our intended “president” of these explicit States of Amurrica, do the same vile global dimensions. I never read the original Edna Ferber, but I think that he is a head taller than what was on the screen. And all these well-paid ones, I would have thought that, despite the “support” of famous actors and celebrities, “Giant”, at least for me, is a dwarf of meager merit, not to mention promotional campaigns.
