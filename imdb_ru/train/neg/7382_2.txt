Well, let me say that I have always been a fan of Stephen Seagal, and his films are usually great, but this does not fit the rest. This is in my opinion very stupid, I did not like all of this. The biggest reason I don’t like it is that it is very imperfect and doesn’t make much sense to me. The acting is very bad, even Steven Seagal does not make a good acting, the rest of the actors I see, because they just make a video. It does not follow the direct storyline, everything happens at the same time, therefore, there is not much point in it. There are practically no actions in it, and in order to make an action movie good, it usually needs action. The special effects are very bad and you can say that it is a fake. So overall, this should be the worst movie of all you need, if you want to watch a movie about Stephen Seagal, don't shoot this movie, just pretend it doesn't exist. So just avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: ** of ********** <br /> <br /> * of *****
