Could this be the same director as “Don't Look Now” or “Bad Time”? Poorly acted <br /> <br />, clumsily edited. You only have to compare different scenes of the accident in this with those in “Do not look now” to see how much the Horn has lost its touch. <br /> <br /> Even generally reliable Theresa Russell (looks a bit stocky these days, I'm afraid to report) cannot save it. The plot is pure pseudo-religious hodum, the action is wooden, and Roag’s attempts at his trademark time shift are pitiful. <br /> <br /> Avoid this like the plague.
