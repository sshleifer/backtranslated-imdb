Tony Scott has never been a very good director, but every film he made after The Red Stream seems to bring him one step closer to being the undisputed worst working today (Michael Bay may fall into the same category, but at least his big, stupid, delusional epics entertain at some initially perverted level). And, like other bloated Hollywood biographical films (for example, “De-Lovely” and “Confessions of Dangerous Mind”), telling about the lives of pretentious, overvalued or frankly shallow ciphers endowed with the aura of “mystic” society, which thrives on Juicy backstage details “Domino” is a film that starts with a small potential and breaks this infinitely small amount to a sixty-minute mark. With a length of 128 minutes already stretched, the film seems twice as long, and the time spent with the characters seems disgustingly superficial and forgotten (unlike the excellent "Rules of Attraction"), Scott's attempts to wrap up the listen with irony using the self-satisfied Domino, the off-screen voice of the self-aware rich girl only draws attention to the complacency of the film - it becomes an act that only masochists can consider pleasant. Story? A spoiled little domino from the top of Domino Harvey's bark (Keira Knightley, in an ersatz teaser as petty as her gorgeous appearance), is tired of the shallow lifestyle of the rich and famous in Los Angeles, as well as the dizzy head hunters Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez, to learn more exciting profession; along the way there are double crosses, gunfights, media attention (courtesy of mocking Christopher Walken, who calls in his trademark scoundrel) and ridiculous hints of romance. Scott cuts the film into segments that rarely last more than a few seconds, increasing the resolution to make the film soaked with neons a nightmare that is frankly unpleasant to watch - if Scott were given the opportunity to shuffle the picture, hide it, or distort it in some way, it will ; but this whole tasteless stylistic overload stuns what is scarce in the plot, characterization and tension of the film (not to mention its “uh”, “entertaining” value). Most characters are either despicable or stereotypical, often both (watch the unbearable, few-minute episode where the African American presents a new list of racial classifications on Jerry Springer), and I found that I would like them to get the end of the "tails "our main character's coins to the end. “Domino” is a complete rubbish - whatever interest Scott may have hoped to awaken in his audience, he is lost in a sea of ​​neon claims causing a migraine in a few minutes.
