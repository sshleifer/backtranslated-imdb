Simply put, I do not like westerns. And without having spent one from the beginning to the end, I decided to look at “My dear Clementine” and see through it, no matter how much it hurt. At first it was painful, as expected. I found the acting game ridiculous, the scenery (your usual dessert, horses and cowboys) boring, and the music and its time fluctuated to the point of pain. However, after mentally cheering to chat, after the first 20 minutes it became much easier for me to endure. Focusing on cinema and on how John Ford managed to make even the most boring situations (boring, in my opinion, that is) look quite stunning from time to time, made him much more interesting. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I cannot say that I liked the film to the end. However, this was done well enough for me to sit until the very end, and this in itself is impressive.
