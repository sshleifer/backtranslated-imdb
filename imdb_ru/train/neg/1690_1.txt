This film was terrible. I could hardly fall asleep through it. I would never have watched this movie again if I had been paid. The so-called horror scenes in it were incredibly predictable and replayed. There was nothing in this film that would make it original or cost $ 7.50, which I paid to watch it. Do not watch it, do not rent it, do not read about it online, because any of these things will be a waste of your time. Sarah Michelle Geller showed a dull performance, and she should be ashamed of the fact that she spoiled her good name in this film. Shame on you, Sarah, for being associated with this horrible, terrible movie. A terrible movie, you do not need to watch it.
