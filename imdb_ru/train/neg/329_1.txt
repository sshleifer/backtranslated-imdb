First: I bought it in the video store. Second: I watched it. Third: it was boring. Fourth: it was not funny. Fifth: most of the antics were lame. And last but not least: it is not only a bad film, but also a complete fiasco. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Adam Sandler, despite this disappointing and forgotten film. I'm sorry because this was his first movie. Even if you're a big fan of Adam Sandler, don't worry about watching this movie. Instead, just take a video, get on the boat and throw it overboard.
