Could not sleep last night. So, I got up, turned on the phone, and this film was included. <br /> <br /> Cinematographers bit off more than they could chew. As ambitious in terms of volume as the Forrest Gump. But the Gump reads like a fairy tale, where an extraordinarily lucky man leads us through the whole epoch. TGMB just relies on tired cliches to tell a story. Almost like a Broadway musical where actors have to unwind it. The goal of each character was to fill the silly archetype of the 60s. <br /> <br /> Take, as we met with Finnegan: hug his black maid and get a picture in the frame of the MLK. Crimini, let's talk about hard hands. Why not just give him a T-shirt that says "I am the heart of black people"? <br /> <br /> Sunlight: “Isn't free love good, man? Oh no, I had no menstruation. ” <br /> <br /> Mary Beth: “I want to go to Berkeley, not to UCLA Square”. Excuse me? In the 60s in Los Angeles there was nothing square. Instead of taking the time to demonstrate what made Berkeley unique, we simply hear this brat whining about not having gone there. <br /> <br /> I can't even remember the name of the black guy. He was simply a prop, used to show how racially tolerant other children are. <br /> <br /> The fact is that historical plays should not be so stupid. Take "Stunned and Confused." Look at how we met football hero Randall Floyd. For the first time we do not see him on the football field In fact, we never see him play football. We met him in class, inviting his poker companions to a party. <br /> <br /> In “Stunned” feminism, this is not an accidental side effect from the fact that some girl is confused. It is much more organic, more serious than that. This is specified in the ladies' room for a coup about the island of Gilligan. Serious ideas can grow in the most ordinary conditions. But in real life it is. <br /> <br /> Some warm comments indicate that the themes of this film are still relevant. I agree! That is why I feel so disappointed with this piece of baby boomers pornostalgia.
