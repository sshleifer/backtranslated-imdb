Personally, I think this show looks pretty cheap. Some of the actors are terrible. They do it and seem fake. I can always tell how it will end in the first 10 minutes or less, because they make it so transparent. This is also not very well written. I love to watch it, laugh at it. You know the saying, "This is so bad, what is good?" Well, this statement refers to this show. I also like to look, to see if I am right, when I think, how it will all end. Until now, I was right every time. It's like a little game that I play. It's nice when you're bored and you want to laugh at something.
