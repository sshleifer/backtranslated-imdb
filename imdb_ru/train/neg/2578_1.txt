Summing up this film: without a real plot, this film consists of 80 minutes of crazy characters who either drink or joke. The music is just awful, the humor is not funny and all female heroes are depraved idiots or just fans. It seems to me that the film was actually written by a 14-year-old boy who thinks that drinking is cool, women are created to give pleasure to men, and all who are against this view are geeks. In addition, the film has nothing to do with the original American films about cakes, except for a few names and Mr. Lowenstein, who plays a secondary role in this film. The only good thing about this movie is beautiful girls. Do not watch this film and do not be deceived by rating 5.4, because it is clearly overvalued and does not deserve anything higher 2.
