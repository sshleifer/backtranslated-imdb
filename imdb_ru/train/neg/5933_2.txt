I was a fan of his first album. This film is a bad service for him. The performances, with the exception of Rufus Wainwright and Teddy Thompson alone, are simply terrible. <br /> <br /> Especially annoying are those that Marta Wainwright, Nick Cave, Anthony and Jarvis Cocker had. Even the one from the McGarrigle sisters was destroyed by Martha Wainwright's so-called harmony. <br /> <br /> I never saw my wife get up and leave the room in the film, and I felt quickly redirecting the performances to get to several interview segments that were also difficult to watch due to poor camera performance . <br /> <br /> Many of those who could interpret Mr. Cohenâ€™s songs recall Jennifer Warns, KD. Lang, Billy Joel, Aaron Neville and Willie Nelson, but the people selected for this performance were simply terrible. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, there will be another attempt to capture Leonard Cohen in the film, which will illustrate his insight, talent and intelligence. <br /> <br /> very sad
