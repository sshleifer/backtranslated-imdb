I think it was PG-13 overpriced nonsense! At the very least, BRITTANY SNOW's performance was good, and some others, such as IDRIS ELBA, were also good, but some other teenagers at graduation, like leading friends, were not so convincing. The killer was so stupid and looked so stupid. Death was stupid, boring, and completely unoriginal. The film was very boring and overpriced. It was not disturbing, I almost fell asleep. This is another bad PG-13 remake, this is really a terrible IMO movie. The ending was so stupid, and the climax was very fast and boring. The film is also rather slow. In general, the only good thing about this shitty fest is maybe BRITTANY SNOW, I think she gave a good performance and IDRIS ELBA too, but other than that it was a completely awful movie and a terrible remake. Well, that's just my opinion. I gave him 2/10.
