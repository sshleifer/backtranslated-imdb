Despite some suggestive oddities in the script and the overall value of the film’s curiosity, Wolf Rage appears as a dull, uninteresting excursion to lycanthropy, preserved only by the stately presence of Pearl Crystal's villainy. The remaining players, including Hammi Nashi, are completely written off (although admittedly, cruel dubbing does not help anyone). Although the script contains enough variations on the werewolf / Frankenstein / Dr. Moreau themes to highlight a dozen films, the plot is so unevenly developed, the characteristics are so weak, and the dialogue is so funny (at least in the English version) that any hidden interest to sourcing processes soon suppressed. <br /> <br /> Zabalzy’s direction seems jerky, even amateurish. His production is clumsy and ineffective. It does not help too bright lighting Villasor. Even promising decorations are so unattractively photographed that several attempts by the director to scare the public are signaled in advance. <br /> <br /> Other credits fall into a similar model of incompetence, although a musical score is worthy.
