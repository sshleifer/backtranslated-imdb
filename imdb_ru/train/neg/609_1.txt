It was an absolutely horrible movie. Don't lure Christopher Walken or Michael Ironside. Both are great actors, but this must have been their worst role in the story. Even their great acting game could not buy back the ridiculous storyline of this film. This film is a propaganda work of the USA in the early nineties. The most pitiful scenes were those when the Colombian rebels advanced their arguments in favor of revolutions. Maria Conchita Alonso seemed fake, and her pseudo-lovers with Walken were nothing more than a pathetic emotional jam in the film, devoid of any real meaning. I am disappointed that there are films that destroy the good name of Christopher Walken, like an actor. I could barely sit through it.
