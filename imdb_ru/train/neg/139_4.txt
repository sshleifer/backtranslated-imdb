This movie was rented by a friend. Her choice is usually good. At first I read the cover and expected a good movie. Although it is a <br /> <br /> horror movie. Which I do not prefer. But no horror came to mind while watching a movie. It was a boring, not very exciting film. The appearance of Denise Richards <br /> <br /> again became a joy to the eyes. But that's all. We (the four of us) <br /> <br /> We are a little disappointed. But do not hesitate to watch this movie and <br /> <br /> judge for yourself.
