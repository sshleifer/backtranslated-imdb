What happened during the making of this film, so that it turned into a complete mess? Just a year after “The Club for Breakfast”, a brilliant film with many of the same actors as in “The Fire of Saint Elmo” (which, by the way, looked and acted in the latter more, as if they were still the underdog high school from the former but without a grasp or discipline in portraying their roles. <br /> <br /> Whether it was the director or the screenplay. Since it was the same person (Joel Schumacher), it should be both. But Schumacher gave us "Phantom of the Opera", "Telephone Box", "Time to Kill" and two films "Batman", "Batman and Robin "And" Batman Forever ", which range from good to great direction. Something went wrong on" StEF "because there is no genius in it, there is no comedy that costs something, and it is very far from really valuable in life. <br /> <br /> Example: Wendy’s character (a rich little girl who makes a good heart) and help the less fortunate Mare Winningham plays shows Billy (a naughty slut who cheats on his wife and his friends, drinks too much and he has no sense of order in his life, which is right l Rob Lowe), that she is still a virgin. Billy really sees the challenge and the possible conquest, but Wendy is not ready. Wendy, in fact, is not so ready, it's hard to believe that she is in this group of friends. Later in the story, when Billy, whose wife left him, took her child and married another, somehow tied up some threads of his life together. Billy goes to New York, leaving and giving up parental responsibility for his little daughter, he convinces Wendy that her virginity will be for her the perfect "leaving gift." And Wendy, who works as a social worker, helping broken families, seems to be not at all obsessed with this despot. Give me a break. The only thing she can give only once, does she give a loser who leaves her family and friends? Schumacher sees this scene as a wonderful and touching moment. <br /> <br /> There are many more examples where there is a complete discrepancy between what is real and the value that is thrown overboard, and actions look like a virtue. <br /> I suppose that some may say that “it was in the 80s”, but I remember that it was in the “80s” that men became responsible for the children they gave birth to then married or out of wedlock. /> <br /> I think this film is so bad because it is not synchronized with what is truly valuable and correct. <br /> <br /> With regard to technology (and not history), it was terrible, because Well. It is unrelated and looks like a 3-hour film that was edited before 1 hour and 40 minutes. Transitions and jumps in time just do not make sense. Take what's on the floor of the editing room, paste it back, and the film will probably be shown much better ... but it's still a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Schumacher may have become a better and stronger director since 1986 (he should), or maybe he was head over when it came to writing the script for St Elmo's Fire, or maybe This group of actors took the film set and went their own way - this is what I really think happened.
