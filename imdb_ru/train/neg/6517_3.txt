I went to watch this movie, and although there were a few moments in it that made me laugh, he had some very serious flaws. First of all, he represents the humorous feats of a real divorce trying to find love in Los Angeles. What it turns into is depressive, narcissistic, and unfunny hype in the history of the director’s personal life and professional life. The jokes wear out quickly, and you suddenly find that you don’t care how that person’s dating goes. The funny thing is that the director at the same time presents himself as an extremely annoying and badly spoiled character, and then he expects us to be concerned.
