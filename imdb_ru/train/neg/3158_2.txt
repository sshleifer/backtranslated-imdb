It really was the worst movie I've ever seen. Michael Vartan is hot, but who is this woman? And she looks absolutely horrible throughout the entire film, her hair is so bad! They speak like monotonous voices, and there is no chemistry. The DVD cover doesn't even come close to what the movie really is. Indeed very boring. I had to go through some of them because it was so painful to watch. I really want to know, how can I think this is good? hahaha, they literally just love to say and say yes, and there is no passion at all. I could not say that they were in love. Sorry, but that was the saddest excuse for a movie I've ever seen.
