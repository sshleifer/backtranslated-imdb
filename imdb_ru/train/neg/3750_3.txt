I was finally able to take a look at this experimental Lynch soon after such a long wait ... and, unfortunately, it was not worth it! Even for a devoted fan of Lynch, I found it very tedious .... Nothing happens, there are long, long, long painful pauses, where nothing happens, long monotonous speeches, where nothing happens. said, and it all ends with the fact that the viewer does not know or does not care about what the hell it was, what happened before and what happened afterwards. <br /> <br /> There was a hint of Mulholland Drive - the blonde and the brunette were very similar to Diana and Rita, and the moment of “Lost Highway” with links to some momentous event that happened, but which is not clear. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, all this is very uninteresting and very boring, nothing happens, it is very easy to forget, and I think that I will delete it from my computer and forget that I have ever watched it. Sorry, David!
