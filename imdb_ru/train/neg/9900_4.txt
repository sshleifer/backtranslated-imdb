I believe that any novel, as depressing as Moby Dick, would not have found much support from viewers of the Depression era, who had enough of their own troubles. But any similarity with the classic novel by Herman Melville is pure coincidence. <br /> <br /> In fact, half of the film is a prequel to the main story as we know it, not much has been saved for the film. First, we meet with Ahab Creeley (he has a surname and brother) as one happy and happy soul with two legs and intentions to marry Joan Bennet, the daughter of Father Mapple. This brother, Derek, played by Lloyd Hughes, also wants to marry Bennett. <br /> <br /> John Barrymore - Ahab in superb performance. Barrymore had not quite mastered sound cinema, and he turned out to be with all the silent history of the era, as well as his stage voice, which would shake the crowds of any cinema in which this film played. <br /> <br /> We see how Ahab loses his leg to the great whale Moby Dick and I must say that the scene of the amputation was pretty awful. Of course, all this was before the code. However, I am sure that the audience in 1930 started. <br /> <br /> After this, the story of Ahab's whale hunting, in his opinion, made him unsightly in the eyes of Joan Bennett. This is not exactly Melville's motivation, in fact there are no female characters in Moby Dick, as he wrote. <br /> <br /> One of the things Melville did was to endow the crew of the ship of Ahab Pecod with personalities. In addition to the Queequeg, the harpooner cannibal has names, but not personalities. Starbucks and Stubbs can also be Smith and Jones. <br /> <br /> I would look at this version of Moby Dick solely for the sake of curiosity and nothing more.
