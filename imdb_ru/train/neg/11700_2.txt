I really wanted to see this movie, but after watching it, I was very disappointed. Best of all was when Stephen King was in it. Robert John Burke cannot act to save his life, and no one else can. A few speeches even made me laugh out loud! The film was not the same as I imagined it, after reading an amazing book, I imagined that it was darker and much worse. If I were Stephen, I would be very angry! <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t know why they changed the ending, I thought the ending of the book was very good. If you had just found out that the cake killed your daughter, you would not feed him, would you ?! <br /> <br /> A book would be much better!
