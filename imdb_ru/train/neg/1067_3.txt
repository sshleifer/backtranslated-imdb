Only a handful of segments attract here. The segment with car service from Nigeria is heartbreaking. One of them, with Fanny Ardent and Bob Hoskins, makes his point, spinning around the bend, until the last shot blocks things. <br /> <br /> The problem with this film is that only a few clips evoke Paris. The rest are so scattered on the subject, tone, expression and production that you can also see "The Best Commercials of the Year, 2006". This is really ubiquitous. It does not develop during the time of work, and there is nothing directors reign in it. No design connects pieces ... boredom begins. I'm an hour, twenty minutes, and Elijah Wood is, in some stupidity, a commercial, overproduced vampire joke. It has as much in common with Paris as older ladies in Antarctica. Fantasy appears, I think, first in the Coen Brothers segment (uh, thanks to J & E for having spoiled another movie), and then appears too many times. The point of staying in Paris is that you don't need fake shit to make your days extraordinary. Why divide it into a neighborhood if Quartier de la Madeleine equates to vampires for some unlucky director? Has the genre ever been more widely represented than the vampire film? Every three years we get the same lame clich√©s with vampires. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, the transition from segment to segment is rather unsophisticated. Transitions are lost. It does not seem deliberate, it feels sloppy.
