"Die Hard" meets Cliffhanger when the ski resort is besieged by terrorists, and Jack (Crackjack) can only stop it by one policeman. <br /> <br /> The B-action film, which is borrowed from other films, is quite good with a pretty good action, a funny plot (as always in these films) and three beautiful stars. Thomas Ian Griffith as a cop, Nastassja Kinski and Christopher Plummer as terrorists. If you don't like stupid action movies, this is not for you.
