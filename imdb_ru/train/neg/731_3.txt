Mike Hawthorne (Gordon Kerry) witnesses the brutal murder of his mother and the suicide of his father Morty (John Fedele). Twenty years later, Mike gathers a group of his friends in his family's house in the woods for a Halloween party. Playing a game in which guests confess and confront their worst fears ... Mike tries to invoke the spirit of his late father. It soon became clear that the spirit of Morti lives in a wooden Indian in the cabin. The statue comes to life, and the bloodbath begins. <br /> <br /> Most of the commercials are not very convincing, and the film uses a cheap theme for a teenager. A stale story regretfully acted. Famous actors include Kelly Benson, Philip Rhys, Emmanuel Voigier, Byron Chef Luna, and veteran actress Betsy Palmer.
