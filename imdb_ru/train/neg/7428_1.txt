As usual, on IMDb, a majority vote instead of a “weighted average” is far more indicative of the film’s entertainment value. In this case, the majority gives him "one." How right they are! To begin my review, I first admit that I don’t understand at all why this film is called Alien Attacker. It includes space and even “alien” (I guess), but in the long run there is neither rhyme nor reason (at all) for anything, at least there is no real basis for the plot or resolution, which I could understand where whatever /> <br /> There are quite a few episodes that are so terrible (both along the lines and in time, and in the way they are pronounced) that they far outweigh the strange sensations that you experience when watching similar really bad films. I have no idea about this part at the very beginning, where the electronic Bugs Bunny seems to be ranting about something. <br /> <br /> The “plot” covers only the area of ​​space known as the G-Spot, excuse me, make this G-sector ... and a virtual reality program infected by some alien (?) virus. I think this is an alien because the rest of Ariel’s image looks like a photographic negative. <br /> <br /> In most films, we see people shooting from space weapons, falling from lofts and seemingly endless meaningless close shots of “Where is Ariel?”, “Can't find Ariel” (meaningless because most of the other pictures are ON interaction with Ariel, at least anything) on ​​the computer monitor. Commander Skyler (Billy Dee) sits and watches every fantasy about the convict's BP programs, hoping to find this alien virus and unite with it ... ??? Or maybe I missed something ... <br /> <br /> Billy Dee Williams went through several courses on How to Act in Despair before shooting this film. We know this because he spends a lot of time moving his fingers over his face and looking mournful. <br /> <br /> The docking scene with the bow of one ship, going to the rear of the other, was half-amusing. at least, it provided for laughter in addition to the early scenes, where we see a few shots of the ship, when it just rotates in a circle, very similar to the unsuccessful experiment of Lego. <br /> <br /> Everything seems to die in this film, so why? Even VR women are dying, as if it should mean something (especially since everyone else is dying) ... outrageous. <br /> <br /> Due to the money I save on products, I will not rant about wanting to get my money back, which I paid for the DVD of this. The dollar that I saved on this vanilla waffle bag was paid during this reviewer's time. <br /> <br /> I’ll just add that the story itself, at least as a novel, and with a much more detailed addition, could probably be quite interesting with the correct author. <br /> <br /> 1/10
