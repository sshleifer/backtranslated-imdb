I can not say exactly what I think about this film, it is against the rules, I watched a lot of films, and it must be the worst so far, Extremely low budget, I assume that all the money went to the scenes of slaughter, because I could better deal with a black and white 8mm camera and a team of monkeys. It was so bad that I signed up to leave a comment, because I had to tell someone that there was not enough movie rental space. But these are my 2 cents, I suggest borrowing it from some poor juice that rented it, and see for yourself. Because I am sure that I will not spend money on it myself again. Now I leave you with this comment. I hope that you did not do it at the place of lease when they did not return your money to you .. =)
