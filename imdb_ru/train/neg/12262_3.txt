Fans of feature films about creatures have recently had to endure a lot of horrible movies. Blood Surf shamelessly joins the list of stupid, odd words of horror reading about ridiculously large animals that want to turn the food chain upside down. Crocodiles have been particularly successful, as we have already had to make our way through the terrible Crocodile (director disappointing Tobe Hooper) and Lake Placid. Blood Surf is no worse than in other films and more ?? he likes to exaggerate greatly. The saltwater crocodile is supposedly 90 years old, it is over 30 feet long (!) And kills for pleasure! During the film, he is entertained by the fact that he devours a bunch of completely stupid surfers and dudes who have come to look for new thrills while surfing in a crowded shark area. The only beautiful aspect of this film is its tropical location. Even though this is a completely inappropriate setting for such a film, the lagoons and nature look amazing. Any other aspect is simply disastrous. There's a bit of blood there, but it all looks fake and funny. Dialogues are totally painful to listen! You will not believe in some lines that these actors have to say! I know that surfers should be a mentally underdeveloped group, but I hope that for their own sake they are not so stupid! At the beginning of the film, one of the characters calls "Jaws" a "mechanical toy", but the crocodile here looks at least 10 times less real than the great white shark of Spielberg. The visual effects in Blood Surf are amateur, and the slaughter is not impressive. I will not talk too much about acting, as it is secondary in such films. Girls look sexy in wet shirts, and their boobs happily bounce, running away from the beast. You guessed it: Blood Surf is a very bad movie. So bad, it's fun again. But "funny" for a completely different reason than suggested by James Hickox.
