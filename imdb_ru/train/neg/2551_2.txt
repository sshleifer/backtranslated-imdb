Misled by the terrible lie on the cover of “fun like an American pie”, my girlfriend and I were sitting in front of the TV waiting for a comedy ... and this is definitely not one thing. You probably will not laugh once, if you do not treat the same, like a donkey, ever small minds. This is not even an erotic film, which at least would be something, considering that it is about sex ... <br /> <br /> So what is it? A strange story concerns a guy who wants to lose his virginity (zero originality, I remember “Lose him” for one) and his gang of friends. The rest of the characters (that is, girls) just come and go without a valid reason. C'mon, there are even gnomes (so simple: "gnomes are fun, ho-ho" ...). The acting is very similar to TV (like the video throughout the entire film) and definitely amateur in the case of most girls ... <br /> <br /> A terrible movie. Amateur, poorly thought out and, in general, NOT FUN. Children and teens will love to watch this with friends because of curses and sexual jokes. In addition, do not even think about renting this movie.
