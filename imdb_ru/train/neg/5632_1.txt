I watched a DVD (called BLACK WIDOW in the USA) and then I felt that it was a really awful movie. But they must have come off quite a bit from the original film, or I missed a lot. There was very little vulgarity and nudity in the sex scenes (even the breasts), but I read several other comments on IMDb.com that mention vulgarity and something about the tampon. I have not seen anything like it, just a bad, boring film with unattractive characters and a banal, sofomorsky plot. Giada Colagrande is either paralyzed from the mouth up, or botoxed to the gills, and no expression touches her face. And her name makes me think about how to smash a drink at Taco Bell: “I will have a Cola Grande!” Actually, it was pretty funny, it was so bad, I played like in my own Mystery Science Theater 3000, noting things like the fact that Defoe's skin is too big for his face. It really is like a silly putty!
