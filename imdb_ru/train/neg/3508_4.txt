Despite the overwhelming cult that followed this sad "documentary," I must admit that I heartily hated the film that hit our party with a much more sad part of exploitation than with useful information. However, after seeing the magnificent stage musical drawn from it, one can appreciate that the film could be in safe hands. <br /> <br /> Someone suspects that many of us, who were actively affected by the film, could have had some obscene delights that his more cruel fans liked, destroyed by the uncomfortable suspicion, that too many of us or those we know - only one or two steps from the deplorable situation of the two insane women depicted in the picture, who live and contribute to the poverty they seem incapable of controlling or escaping. <br /> <br /> Because of this film, the viewer desperately wonders how anyone could have gone down to this level of degradation and, unlike a musical, does not offer any warning tips or explanations, only a horror show, not bought by humor or insight. <br /> <br /> This heart-breaking film plane makes reaching the stage version (we hope that weâ€™ll end up being filmed for the cable) even more remarkable. Act II is true in almost all the details of the film in question, but in a strange way, putting the sad position of prisoners to music, causes human tragedy to art. More importantly, this act is preceded by a wonderful act I, in which we meet women before they fall into mutual insanity, and we are hinted at how their lone purgatory appeared. In short, all that is missing is FILM. <br /> <br /> To the credit of the directors (or their successors), the excellent release of Criterion DVD includes out-ticks and bonus materials, which partially redeem the main film - behind the film. photos of scenes, interviews and comments - filling in some of the gaps that the original editing consciously chose to omit in their quest for genuine horror and depression. They cannot make an amateur film in itself satisfactory, but they can at least make it a little more understandable. <br /> <br /> In the end, only a wonderful stage play, inspired and taken from the book by writer Doug Wright, composer Scott Frenkel and lyricist Michael Corey, raises the rating of the original GRAY GARDENS above one (generous) star.
