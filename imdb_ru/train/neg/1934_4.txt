It follows the usual formula for recruiting a new recruit - this time the first African American (Cuba Gooding) after President Truman desegregates the Armed Forces - as part of the US Navy’s deep-sea training program, led by racist fan (Robert DeNiro). If the program was not bad enough, it should be located in Bayonne, New Jersey. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with speeches. Robert De Niro activates his southern accent and screams gibberish effectively. Cuba Gooding, raised by a stern father as a poor black farmer in the south, is an expected example of directness. The girls — it's hard to call them women — are Sharles Theron and Lonette McKee. They have secondary roles, and they basically argue that their people must exercise common sense. Other worthy performers, Powers Booth and Hal Holbrook, have even more careless roles. <br /> <br /> That's it. Almost everything else could be collected using a computer. The ship is called a boat. Robert De Niro salutes indoors. After the brutal attack on the hospital staff, he was transferred from his clothes, not arrested. Someone shouts “I'm leaving here” in the early 1950s. (Maybe it was the usual expression at the time. If so, “my bad.”) People refer to each other by their rank - “lieutenant”, “assistant boatswain”, “commander”, as in the army, whereas in In the Navy, they are simple "Mister" (if an officer) or the address of their last name (if enlisted). I did not bother to check whether the title "Senior Master" existed in 1950. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding has a very difficult question. It seems that everyone in the navy hates blacks, except for one guy from Wisconsin. He stutters and is despised by others in his class. This is similar to the scene in the Animal House, where the applicant for the Tony brotherhood is asked to wait in a room with a Sikh, black and blind child. <br /> <br /> Gooding is a enlisted person, junior second class officer. He manages to marry a beautiful woman who has just graduated from medical school. In one of her arguments, she pleads with him. She just wants to become a doctor, and he should join her, leave the fleet and lead a quiet life. “And just let life pass you by?” He retorts. Yes. Yes, just be a doctor's spouse and let life pass by. You can wave it from a golf course in Boca Raton. <br /> <br /> Such clicks were fairly common in World War II. "Bombardier", "Airial Gunner", such things. Cheap as they often were, they had some educational features. You have learned something about becoming a scorer or shooter. Here, technical details are skipped, perhaps because the writer did not know anything about them (except for Boyle’s law, which we studied in school chemistry). <br /> <br /> I could not keep track of what happened during some of the emergencies, without which such a film would not exist. If I correctly understood the mechanical problems, it is because I correctly guessed. Direction also does not help. The film is replete with close-ups, so much that they lose any dramatic impact they could have. And emergency situations are confusing because they are poorly focused. <br /> <br /> Why continue? Want to see the best example of such a movie? Almost everyone will do - except, perhaps, “J. I. Jane ”, in which the hero being bullied is heroin. Try out the training camp scenes in the film Young Lions. There is a Jew victim. Or try “From here to eternity”, in which the light buttons of sympathy are not pressed, and the victim is an adult who refuses to bend and actively inflames the conflict, like “Cool Hand of Luke”. Simple excuses are not offered, because light excuses are too simple. <br /> <br /> Carefully formulated and not very well made.
