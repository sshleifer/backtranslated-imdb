Original pottery. Rudolph: Pretty good. The original frosty cartoon: you need a little work, but it may be worse. But Frost and Rudolph together on the fourth of July? C'mon! Give me a break! It was one movie that should not have been shot. That was bad. In fact, this does not apply to any holiday, except July 4th. This made it especially bad, since Frosty and Rudolph are usually associated with the Christmas season. And any film can be destroyed by too much singing. Frequent songs made this film seem much longer than it actually was. In the film, they tried to mix two familiar characters from Chirstmastime with a traditional American holiday (which seems to almost “limit” America), too many meaningless songs and a lousy storyline. Result? Bad film that can not be watched at any time of the year. I would advise you to abandon this film, even if you like Frosty and Rudolph.
