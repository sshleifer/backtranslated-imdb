Well, I could not even enjoy this film because of its cult values. This is a thriller from the B-movie, directed by Commando, which, however, is too stupid and stupid to be considered a good B-movie with enough entertainment value. <br /> <br /> This is a film of the 90s, but first of all the film should resemble an action movie of the 80s, when this type of B-film was all time high. These films have always been excessive and never paid much attention to their history or actions. It was all about explosions, big muscular heroes and bullets flying around. This film has all of these components, but I really didn’t like to watch this movie just as I liked to watch movies of a similar type. It’s hard to say why, in fact, because the plot, the acting and the like are just as bad as in the case of any other genre film of the same era. <br /> <br /> Perhaps because the film is often far too stupid. All these types of films have their own silly moments, but this film is only filled with it. Fighting, Dolph Lundgren runs shirtless, characters, story. All this is not very good, because it is often too bad for words. At times, the story doesn't even try to make sense, and what is even the main storyline of the entire film? His story is really everywhere and seems to be written only to create a film with fighting, shootings and the like. And these sequences are not even really good to look at. The moments are too short and disappointing, so that they can be observed in reality, from the person who brought us the "Commando". <br /> <br /> This is, first of all, Dolph Lundgren, in which he plays the main heroic star, kicks the butt with apparent relative ease, knows how to handle weapons and other weapons, and, of course, also gets a girl who played by Tia Carrere. All this also brings us to one of the worst editing sequences in the history of action movies, and also definitely one of the worst sex sequences I've ever seen in any movie. Both are too weak for words and just very poorly folded. <br /> <br /> None of the characters will work. The good guys are cops, but they never behave like one. They simply kill without being accountable to anyone, and they are not very interested in making arrests or reporting their discoveries to anyone. Even when they find out that a large Japanese criminal syndicate is trying to seize LA streets, and the brewery works as a cover for a drug factory and drug smuggling on a large scale. And think a little more, what is Brandon Lee's overall goal in the film? The film could easily be done without him, and with a girl. <br /> <br /> Too stupid, sucks and simplistic, but not fun enough. <br /> <br /> 4/10
