"Paula, I may be a bitch, but I will never be a bitch!" <br /> <br /> A funny line in another rather tedious movie featuring cute honey in Stacy Walker, but that's about it. This girl is a real teaser who lures her boyfriends, colleagues and even her lesbian roommate Paulo to her bedroom, but then turns into an abnormal job that screams "rape" and calls the police! <br /> <br /> The schizophrenic identity of this certified c ** t is interesting, perhaps for a while, but this story ultimately turns into a real recurring affair with a single note. At the very least, the end is worth the wait, for those who will still take care by this time.
