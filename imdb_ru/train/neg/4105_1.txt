Another bad, the lowest they can go to, is one. Otherwise, it will be an easy zero. Indeed one of the worst films I've ever seen. In fact, Pekenpa's name was not in a place that I would never have guessed that he did. In fact, one of those people in San Francisco I know was on the set, and from almost full dawn, he says that Sam just trampled. It shows in peaks. A little laugh at the beginning of the movie is the ONLY thing in all this mess that deserves a second look. Even Gig Young is not watchable. This is a real test of masochism. If I had been forced to see the theater, I would cry out. And now I really feel guilty, watching all this because of a very comfortable couch that was too good to leave. What a mess, it seemed less written than invented when they walked together. This is not only a bomb, but also a bomb written backwards. Clap !!!!!
