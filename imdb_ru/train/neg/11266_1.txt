Well, what can I say ... <br /> <br /> When I saw the movie, I still have to wonder what the hell it really was ?? V. Doji the camera is moving in the yard at one moment ... I had to look away from the screen, I felt physically sick ... Around and in different directions .... You understood ... <br /> <br /> VERY VERY strange accents in many moments .... "Those who need to know, know" <br /> <br /> If you donâ€™t get it for free, or you get paid to watch, or your partner about making you draw a house or something .. then forget about it ...
