I work as a concierge at a hotel in Washington and, believe me, the character played by Michael J. Fox was nothing remotely accurate, we just don’t go with our pockets, overflowing theater tickets and bills of $ 100! # 2 If I ever let someone use the room for some time “afternoon enjoyment,” I will be fired on the spot! The organization to which I belong (Les Clefs d'Or) has very specific standards of ethics and behavior, which we take seriously. # 3 Similarly, it is not true at the end of the film that Doug simply removes his golden emblem with a key and passes it on to another employee - we earn these keys, and this is a sign of honor and knowledge that you can wear them. There is a whole process of applying and checking to join our organization. <br /> <br /> This film does nothing to dispel the bad perception of the concierge as nothing but a mercenary collecting money. In short, it does a disservice to our organization. I welcome any comments.
