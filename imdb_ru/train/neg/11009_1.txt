I rated this movie HORRIBLE (1). After watching the trailer, I thought that this movie could be pretty cool. "Guaranteed to offend ... everyone!" trailer said. Well ... it offended me, because this film really sucks. This is hardly a comedy, since I laughed for about two seconds throughout the entire movie. And what about all the gays in this movie? I'm not gay, and I have no problems with those who are, but what's the point of adding so many gay scenes to the so-called comedy film, when these scenes are absolutely not funny? I think the director is negative gay or something. <br /> <br /> My advice: if you want to spend good money, hire a good comedy that you have seen a million times, you will be better than to watch this lousy comedy of Mother of All. This is really complete rubbish.
