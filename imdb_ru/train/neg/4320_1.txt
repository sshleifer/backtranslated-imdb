First of all, let me say that this is not a film for people who want to see something energetic and joyful for the holidays. This film is cold, cruel and simply depressing. Mary Steenburgen plays a dodgy mom who leaves for Christmas because her husband lost his job, they lose their home, they can't buy Christmas presents for children, etc. You have an idea, nice things for the holidays. This is how Harry Dean Stanton appears in the role of Gideon, a Christmas angel, who in his dark hat and long coat looks more like a pedophile who hangs out with the children all day, watching them. There is no better way to instill the Christmas spirit in Mary Steenburgen than to kill her family, and then offer to return them if she believes in Christmas again. Santa Claus is a blackmailer, and his Christmas workshop looks more like a refuge for Nazi refugees on the run. In the film, everything is so thick that you do not care about a happy ending when it comes, because the rest of the film is so bitter and incredible. I am sure that this film wanted to be something like Kapra, but there was no joy or mood in it about what a holiday film should be.
