A cowboy who sympathizes with the plight of a neighboring Indian tribe is mistakenly accused of raping and murdering the leader's daughter, which leads to violent hatred and violence. <br /> <br /> It’s nice to look at the damn insanity of a madman’s sweat, although it’s absolutely impossible to defend at any artistic level. The terrible costumes and the fact that all the Indians, obviously, are white, make it look more like a lively cartoon than a serious production that its press materials fake. <br /> <br /> In short, nude nude (the real reason for watching this) is good. Everything else is not. Definitely there are better examples of both genres. <br /> <br /> More interesting is that The Ramrodder was filmed on the notorious Spahn Movie Ranch. It involves not one, but two members of the Manson family, Catherine Scheir and Bobby Beausoleil, who probably already was in the bank for the murder at the time when he got on the soda-filled screens of the Pussycat Theater!
