Incredibly stupid, redundant and humiliating closure of the series "A Nightmare on Elm Street"! Part 6 is so incompetent that it seems that director Rachel Talalay deliberately wanted to turn Wes Cravenâ€™s original premise into one big bad and tasteless joke. This is not just the worst record in the Elm Street saga; it is also one of the most awkward horror films ever made, and it directly offends fans of the genre! The story is stupid, the drawings of the characters are ridiculous, is the structure all muddy and most of all ?? special and visual effects resemble those of Tom and Jerry. The sequences in which Freddy Krueger kills his victims are endless and very uninteresting. Should we be petrified when Freddie's nonsense turned Brekin Meyer into a video game character and scared him around the walls of a house? The story brings us back to Springwood, and it seems that Freddie suddenly had a middle-aged daughter. You think he would have mentioned it in one of his previous adventures, but no? There is only one surviving teenager in Springwood, and Kruger uses him to get in touch with his long-lost daughter. Another reason why this latest release is so terrible is a completely illogical structure. John Dow-boy is presented as the main character, but then he dies suddenly, and the plot continues to rotate for two adults! How about this: Freddy Krueger, who spent five whole films, killing only teenagers, is eventually beaten by two adults in 3D glasses! It seems like it destroys the whole entity, doesn't it? As I understand it, Nightmare on Elm Street has always been a terribly overpriced series, but so far even the weakest records have had at least some redemptive elements. Freddy's Dead, however, is simply unbearable, and no one should waste his / her precious time watching it.
