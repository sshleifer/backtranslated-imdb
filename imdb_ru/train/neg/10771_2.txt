For several years I have not been watching children's films, so I missed "And here are the tigers," when they appeared. (I never even saw Bad News Bears, although in the 70s I worked for the guys who sponsored this film, Warriors, The Man Who Will Be King, and Rocky Horror, among others). ) Now I like to check out old or small films and find people who have done an excellent career, despite the fact that in the beginning they were shot in a not very successful film. Just a few minutes in this film, I could not spend the time any longer and jumped to the end to see if there was a young actor in this film who did bigger and better things - at least watching his / her appearance arouse some interest because conspiracy and acting did not do the job. And so, I noticed the name Wes Craven in the credits as an electric brigadier. He has already starred in two or three of his early shockers, but has not yet created Freddy Krueger and has not starred in the movies “Scream”. Maybe he should have done a favor and helped in this photo. Even more surprising was Fred J. Lincoln in the credits of actors like "Aesop", the stupid character in the film. F.J. Lincoln, from the 70s to just a few years ago, appeared and produced films for adults. He was associated with an adult parody of "Ozporny", and it is this title that is funnier than all the attempts of the "Tigers" to humor. Let the fact that an adult actor was shot in a children's film be evidence that the people who made this film were sleeping behind the wheel.
