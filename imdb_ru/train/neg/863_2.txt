From the euro horror film, especially the films made by the cult enlightener Jess Franco, I realized that the plot could not be expected to make a lot of sense. However, Franco went overboard with this film; and, despite the surrealistic atmosphere and reputation of the film as one of the best directors, Succubus, unfortunately, is really a terrible film. I have to admit that I saw the American version, which lasts about 76 minutes; but unless it was logic that was shortened, I am sure that the longer European version is just as boring. The plot relates to a marauding woman; to practice S & M and talk nonsense, and all this is really boring. There is no blood here, and sex is boring, and most of the time there is a boring dialogue, despite the fact that it is a short film; It was difficult for me to go all the way to the end. I have to say that the locations look good, and Franco did a good job using his surreal atmosphere; but the positive elements end there. Jess Franco is certainly a talented director who has shot some classic thrash films, but it looks like he did it for money, and in general I recommend skipping it and watching some of the directorâ€™s more interesting works.
