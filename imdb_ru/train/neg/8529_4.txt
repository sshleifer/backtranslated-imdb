What kind of tit in MGM thought it would be a good idea to put the polite Clark Gable in the role of the Salvation Army employee ?? Ironically, another beautiful future star, Cary Grant, also played the Salvation Army guy just two years later in a heavily overvalued SHE DONE HIM WRONG. Looking back, it’s pretty easy to see the stupidity of these roles, but I'm still surprised that WHO thought the Salvation Army guys were “hot” and could look at these fast-moving people and view them as realistic representations of the roles they played. Once upon a time I worked in the sister organization of the Salvation Army (Volunteers of America), and NEVER saw any guys working there (unfortunately, this also applies to me). Perhaps I should get a job in the Salvation Army! <br /> <br /> So, for a very curious one, this film is worth seeing, but for everyone else - a bad letter, a casual dialogue and an annoying moralizer make a very slow film.
