If you really need to watch this movie, because your girlfriend has a romantic mood, let it be a boy. But be prepared to take your hp with you if it comes with a radio. <br /> <br /> Having watched such a good film as “Arisan” (2003), it’s terrible to see them come up with again in Indonesia. It seems that the only idea is to make money, but no one seems to be seriously working on the image of Indonesia in the world of entertainment. The fact that this is a “global” world does not seem to occur to those who make films in Indonesia. And since the Indonesian public swallows everything that they are presented with as "Made in Indonesia" with a taste of the west, they get away with it. <br /> <br /> Good, the story is good to begin with. And it could develop into a good movie. But did the director think that the musical needed, first of all, live music or at least good reproduction and, secondly, good choreography? In this movie, the reproduction is so bad that it makes you cry straight to the movies. Every word you hear is accompanied by seconds AFTER the actor or the person who sings the play, and this is very annoying while watching a movie. <br /> <br /> The choreography is as if they were planning to make a film about the morning gymnastics, but in the end it thought it would be nice to turn it into a musical ... They just forgot to change the choreography. You see, they are unlikely to dance, they jump here and there, raise their legs in the air, and that’s all. <br /> <br /> Well, at least there is a happy ending .... But if you can convince your girlfriend that a good candlelit dinner is much more romantic, do it!
