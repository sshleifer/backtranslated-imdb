Such a long-awaited film ... But he disappointed me and my friends who went to see the film on the first day ... From the trailers it looked like an action movie, but it turned out that it was an "Out & Out" comedy (bad comedy). But one thing that deserves high praise is the play of these professional actors, they did an excellent job with their role in the film. Good acting, but I don’t think it can save the film .. India was shot beautifully. Kerala, Rajasthan, (Ladakh?) All were full of color, good. However, because of how the inner beauty of these places was filmed, I wanted to know exactly where these places were and when I could go there ;-) <br /> <br /> Plots were shot very badly, no one could do the head and the tail of the tricks, they used Akki very well (akshay kumar), but they could have done it much better .. <br /> <br /> Animation is the worst thing I've seen in recent movies (I think in films 90 In the early 1990s, animated scenes were better (the initial scene, when the car falls, the word “fly better” is the road to the lake). <br /> <br /> And the name of the film was mentioned almost every e 20-30 years. minutes, just to make sure that the audience does not forget the name of the film, I think ..
