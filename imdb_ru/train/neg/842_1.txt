This is not Michael Madsenâ€™s fault, he was hardly in it. This movie was just awful. If you want to laugh and be bored, watch this movie. Words cannot describe how idiotic it is. Forgive Michael. The cinema was dark. All other actors are unknown. When viewed, it feels like soft porn, but without nudity or heated scenes. This film had sexy shades, as it is about the underground killer S & M. The game was bad, except for the role of Michael Madsen. He looked like he wanted to laugh. I hope he paid well for this lousy movie. This is something that I would not be proud of. It's not even film B for cable, it's more like F, and should never be shown, never.
