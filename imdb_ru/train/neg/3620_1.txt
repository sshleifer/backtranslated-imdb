I tried to watch this filthy movie when I was five years old; Since then, I have never been the same. This “film”, despite its colorful appearance, is filled with images caused by drugs that smell like the usual nonsense of your ordinary citizen seeking asylum, not for people, ESPECIALLY not for children. <br /> <br /> He starts innocently enough with a poor boy who breaks the drum of his classmate, (waiting for him), sticking his head in; yes, putting his head through it. But do not be afraid, my friends! He is quickly comforted by his chirping flute, which is rather strange, I will allow you, but still acceptable. <br /> <br /> Then: the film turns into a combination of the “Wizard of Oz” and “Where the Wild Things”, but loses all the “warm and fuzzy” aspects of either of these two books. <br /> <br /> So this seven-foot yellow relative of Barney is friends with this poor boy and plunges him even deeper into despair. <br /> And, to add a pleasant mass of terrible themes, a predatory boat was added to the mixture of chaos, which used to be a friend of the grandfather’s motley brigade and doped “dragons”. br /> <br /> The most comforting image in the midst of this chaos is the villain, aptly named “Witchiepoo” (?). Of course, she has her own problems: that with an obvious plastic mask compressing her facial expression, the need to deal with a broom, the gas level of which, it seemed, was always the lowest at the most inappropriate moments. As a result of this, one of her favorite activities was the immersion into the reservoir that separated the land of Pufnstuf from her degenerate, decaying abode (I don’t know where I would prefer to live). <Br /> <br /> In general, this film is terrible ... <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a film that has the same effect on your audience as an exorcist, then this film is for you. Enjoy.
