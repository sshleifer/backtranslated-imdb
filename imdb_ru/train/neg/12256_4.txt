Oh God, I must have seen this when I was only 11 or 12 years old (do not ask how). Perhaps I was young, but I was not stupid. Anyone could see that this is a bad movie, nasty, rude, not scary and very stupid. I saw more impressive effects in Disneyland, I saw the best performances in the school play, and I saw more convincing crocodiles in the zoo, where they do nothing but sit in the water, ignoring the kids tapping on the glass. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in northern Australia. A handful of ambitious young people trying new water sports, surfing in shark-filled waters. It soon becomes apparent that something more dangerous is in the water. After they learn that, they get the help of a middle-aged fisherman who wants to kill an animal in order to avenge his family’s food. <br /> <br /> I think I’ve seen every crocodile film taken in the last fifteen years, the best of which is Lake Placid, and the worst one is its sequel. I think Blood Surf should be the second worst crocodile film, since Primeval and Crocodile closely follow it. <br /> <br /> The Australian salt-water crocodile is one of the most dangerous creatures, resulting in more than a hundred injuries or deaths every year. Films like Blood Surf destroy not only the fierce image of such a creature, but also the good one and a half hour of the spectator's life. If you really do not want to see it, avoid Blood Surf.
