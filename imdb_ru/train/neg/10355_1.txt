I have loved this book since my 5th grade teacher read it in our class many years ago. And I read it to each of my grades 3 and 5 in the last 18 years of study. Perhaps in the past the film was made, but I could not find it. Well, my students and I were so excited when they heard that Disney had brought out the beautiful book by Madeleine L'Engle. <br /> <br /> When I watched the movie, I had the highest hopes. As the film went on, I became more and more depressed. They messed it up badly! I have never been so let down by a favorite adaptation of a book to a film. I understand that films can not strictly adhere to the book, but they do not need to change something for this! Most, if not all, departures from the book were completely unnecessary! <br /> <br /> At first I held my opinion and just listened to my students discussing the film. Well, it wasn't just me. Almost everyone felt the same way - he deceived the great story that Madeline L'Engle so skillfully created! <br /> <br /> Why did they think Aunt Beast looked like Chewbacca from the Star Wars movie? Why wasn't Calvin's hair red? Why did Mrs. Who did not have the appropriate "witchlike" dress that was such a clever game on her behalf? In general, we were all wondering - why did you have to change almost every detail? <br /> <br /> I have always dreamed of what a wonderful film this book will make. I'm still waiting for this movie. This was a “wrinkle in time” only in the broadest sense. I'm going to write to Peter Jackson and try to convince him to take on the task!
