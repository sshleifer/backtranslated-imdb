... and this particular film. I believe that if there really is a negative afterlife, the damned souls are tied to a rather uncomfortable couch and are forced to watch this movie in a continuous cycle for all eternity. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe it's not so bad, but this is probably the worst movie I have ever seen next to “Manos, with the hands of fate” ... and I have seen a lot of bad movies you believe me. <br /> <br /> This is just a disgusting film “B”, poor film making in all its glory (or worst of all). What I really didn’t like about this film was the retarded duet they added for the comedy. relief. Now, a little comedic relief is good, but most of the film is focused on the adventures of these two morons, and not on the “heroes” of this film, who actually have less time than it does! <br /> <br /> To be fair, Crown International really wiped out the movie by adding bad music and doing bad editing work. But honestly, it was probably a bad film to begin with, so Crowne really couldn't do so much to harm him. <br /> <br /> This really should be on the top 100 list. I would not want this on my worst enemy. <br /> <br /> Actually, this is my battle movie. It was bad, but I still liked it, despite my one-star rating.
