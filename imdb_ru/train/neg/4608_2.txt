I bought this DVD because it has Kari and Mpaa ratings; "Rated R for violent violence and sexuality, nudity and language." <br /> <br /> How correct IMO should be stated; "Nominal R for violent violence, sexuality, nudity and language." <br /> <br /> The word “sexuality” should follow the “comma” and not “and” because of the huge differences in the meaning it has. I think that many people who have watched this film will agree with me that parts of sexuality and nudity ALMOST do not exist. My first impression when I looked at the mpaa rating was that I would watch something like a “bright” movie. That is why I felt deceived. In the story, it was so-so, in the end, who really cares about the story, if there was a great Kari in it. I know not. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is just my opinion. <br /> <br /> Joseph
