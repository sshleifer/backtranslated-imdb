I am a great brand for Neil Young's music, and with that and the glowing praise of the film, received in many alt-indie press circles, I was struck by the first Greendale show that I can find. My excitement was short-lived, since this tough storyline and weak lyrical impulse left most moviegoers either asleep or disappointed. <br /> <br /> Neil says the movie began as a soundtrack, and the characters came to life so much that they just made the soundtrack. Not the best way to create a story. Not a single character actually has an arc, and when “significant” events do occur, the viewer doesn’t care, because the levels of irritation in the film’s technique are so high by now. The entire film is a song, and for this purpose the characters speak lyrics in a row when they are sung ... the technique works for the first stanza, which it does, and after that annoying. It does not seem real or fake, it just seems undesirable. <br /> <br /> Awful game when characters find one mood and play everything. Bad lighting at times. The only respect I can give to the film concerns several scenes shot as news releases, but the technique is used in the cinema today so much that this film has done little to promote it. A good soundtrack, but nothing that I quickly buy. Bad movie
