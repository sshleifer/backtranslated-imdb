Chinese Ghost Story III is a completely superfluous continuation of two great fantasy films. The film offers special effects that can be expected from spells, but it fails on all other fronts. The actors all play extremely stupid cartoons. You must be still in diapers to find their farce humor even remotely funny. The plot is predictable, and development is sometimes unstable and often slow. By the end of the film begins to resemble old Godzilla films, including frayed, unusual special effects and (well, one more) ghost with the head of Godzilla. Maybe I would have smiled if I was expecting a camp. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to see what garbage fantasy fans have to put up with - in this case, because someone thought they could squeeze out a little more money from a good formula. They cannot do it again: the cash cow is now dead as a dodo.
