... It would be the worst movie I've ever seen. Hmmm, okay, maybe then connected to the Bogeyman. Awful, really awful. <br /> <br /> I had low expectations and they did not materialize! I honestly can't think of one good thing. so here are the worst moments ... <br /> <br /> 1. OPERATING 2. SITE 3. CGI (Xbox 360 has better graphics .... seriously) 4. SITE 5. DIALOGUE and finally ... 6. PLOT <br /> <br /> There are so many unanswered questions about whether they made a 2:32-hour film, and then realized that they didn’t put Lex Luthor and Superman on the stage together and had to agree to 3 x minute bit, or did they really think that no one would notice that the main character and the villain spend less time together on the screen than the son of Superman and the minion he kills? !! <br /> <br /> Was half the budget spent to convince Kevin Spacey to do this? <br /> <br /> When Superman goes to the hospital, why don't the doctors ask: “What the hell do you want us to do? He's a damn alien! We don't know Jack about his anatomy! ”? <br /> <br /> What happened in 5 years, during which Superman was away, which led to the development of technology for 28 years? <br /> <br /> Where do people who have written good reviews watch the same movie? <br /> <br /> and finally, why? Just why? <br /> <br /> By the way, for those of you who are interested in why Superman can raise an entire continent of kryponite, I think I understood this ... <br /> <br /> ... since Superman appeared, he is not affected by kryptonite until he sees something green in the rocks, this is clearly all in his head. therefore, only on the continent he suppresses his fear of the brilliant green rock ... <br /> <br /> either this or the authors are idiot idiots who did not think that it was a rather obvious mistake.
