Stephen J. Cannell apparently decided several years ago that he would broaden his horizons and indulge in horror. The result of "Dead Above Ground" is a terrible piece of garbage. Now, if I noticed his name in connection with this particular film, I would put it back, but no, I did not have points, and so I missed it, damn, I really need to take them with me during the video hike shopping The first question is: who the hell is the target audience for this? It's almost like a “scary” children's movie, but again, there is topless and some blood, and some bad words explode here and there. The main characters are so cute that you want someone, anyone, to go after them with farm tools of some kind. It seems that the guy opens the bed and breakfast, which has a volatile past, there lived a witch-killer who collected children's teeth. Probably the real estate agent did not mention. Of course, now, in our day, there is a ghost of little girls to warn a lively little girl who lives there now that something bad is about to happen. This is true, and there are also two Bubbasa who squatted on this property when the new owner took over, so they also want revenge. All this has a feeling of some kind of rubbish made for a cable that is intended for children on Halloween, except, of course, for things that are not suitable for small children, so this is not only mediocre, but also confusing. Thanks a lot to Anchor Bay for the fact that they released it too, considering their usual track record with good releases, this is a new minimum. The UK gets a set for phantoms, we get the Tooth Fairy. It hardly seems fair. 1 out of 10, absolute rubbish.
