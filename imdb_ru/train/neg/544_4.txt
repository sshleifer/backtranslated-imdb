PROFI: Akshay Kumar's performance (is it just me or this guy always able to beat AB in his films together?). Some touching scenes in the 2nd half. <br /> <br /> Cons: all the 1st hour (jokes were soft, to say the least). Every scene with Rajpala Yadava. Big folly in making AB decisions. Let me say it directly, he believes that cruel insulting the soul of his son in all possible ways (which will probably ruin their relationship without the possibility of recovery) is the best way for him to get Akshay to finally take some responsibility, and then actually tell him the truth ?? WTF? He thinks Akshay is too soft to bear the fact that his old father will die soon due to cancer, but thinks that insulting him will make him stronger? Am I the only one who does not see logic here? The biggest drawback of the film. <br /> <br /> - Akshay becomes a trick. LMAO !! We are told that he graduated 1st in college every year and has an MBA. But when it comes time to feed himself and his pregnant wife, he becomes a stuntman. LOL !! How to actually claim a regular job in ur area? Or, hell, somewhere else where your life is not in danger? This is an incredibly dumb letter. <br /> <br /> - The end. I hate such melodramatic stuff. We have everything in our throats to regret AB's character, which I could not. All this reminded me too much of Crc in KNH (which I hate). This shit "please, sorry for the guy with the disease" has passed. I liked nausea more than sympathy for the old man. Could not watch the last 20 minutes or so because of this and, therefore, had to quickly fwd. all business <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Bacchus is too stupid to be called a good movie. His obvious director Vipul Shah set his sights on emotionally fragile chikas and old men who don't care about history that really makes sense. Give them some decent pictures of songs, fancy outfits, lots of scenes with glycerin and a bit of stellar power, and they will be happy to fool around in this way.
