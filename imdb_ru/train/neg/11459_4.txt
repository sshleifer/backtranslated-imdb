Whalers pick the wrong whale. <br /> <br /> Yahoo’s whale exploiter group seizes a female and strings it on its tail. The whale's companion sees it all, including the moment when the female's unborn baby slips out and falls to the deck. "Captain Nolan" (Richard Harris) could say that the big man is really insane by the way he looked at him, as if saying: "Get out of the city before the tide." <br /> <br /> This story of revenge has the presence of Harris and the beauty of Bo, but no more. It was Bo’s first “released” film, although her first acting job was four years ago in And Once, Love, released in 1981 as Fantasia (directed by John Derek). Today, the date of this review (November 20) is Bo Derek's birthday. I hope Bo has a good time whale ..... get it? ..... whale? ..... hee hee.
