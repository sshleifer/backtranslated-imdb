this movie was a terrible excuse for ... a movie. first, casting might be better; Caitlin, the protagonist, did not look like her television mom. <br /> <br /> Also the plot was pathetic. it was extremely cliche and predictable. the final was very disappointing and cheesy. (but that's all I say about this). <br /> <br /> Although the nail in the bag was the scene when Caitlin (Jordan Hinson) was supposed to cry, but the girl could not cry on command! there were no tears in her face, just a few incredible sobs. she is not a dynamic actress at all. she laughed as falsely as Hillary Duff on Lizzy Maguire (sp?). then the film went from not very good to bad. it really looked like she was playing <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: this film was really bad! it was a kind of mixture of every cliche of the children's film of the 1990s, from which everyone was tired - only worse! <br /> <br /> I gave him the letter 'F' because it was so damn hard to survive (b / w / i, I was a nanny when I saw it). <br /> <br /> However, you might like it if you are 9 or less. ;)
