Racing drivers say that 100 miles per hour seems fast, until you have driven 150, and 150 miles per hour seems fast, until you have driven 250. <br /> <br /> OK. <br /> <br /> Andalusian dog looks amazingly strange, until you see Eraserhead, and Eraserhead seems amazingly strange, until you see Begotten. <br /> <br /> And Begotten seems amazingly strange, until you see the work of K. Frederick Hobbs. Fans of the race, there is NOTHING in the world cinema, as in the works of C. Frederick Hobbs. <br /> <br /> The ghost of Alabama, as in any of his films, is close to a consistent plot, and only hippies participate in it. rock concerts, voodoo, ghosts, vampires, robots, jugglers, corrupt transnational corporations, elephants and Mystery Gas. And the incredible Woodmobile, of course, traveling through the Sunset District to San Francisco. <br /> <br /> What is striking is that someone gave him a LOT of money to make the Ghost of Alabama. There are sets, lighting, hundreds of additions, costumes, many, many effects. Somehow this makes the Alabama ghost SO WRONG. You are watching some terrible cheese ball, such as Night of Horror or Plutonium Baby, and at least some part of the oddity causes an apology on the grounds that they clearly shot the film from the stock on their Discover cards. But the ghost of Alabama was made with a real budget, and that is EVIL. I mean, I have a script about a tribe of cannibals living in Thunder Bay, Ontario, about building a secret temple in the wood of Twizzlers, and nobody knocks MY door swinging a checkbook - how did this guy get money for FOUR The most brilliant films ever made?
