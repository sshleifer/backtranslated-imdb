I was looking forward to Catherine Bigelow's film with great impatience after the endless commercials and 6 Oscars that he received. Unfortunately, this is really not a very good movie. The description of the situation certainly seemed accurate and plausible in all respects, but beyond that the story simply seemed incomplete, and the direction of the film seemed uncertain and random. The actors made a lot of effort, but for myself I still did not understand how the film was trying to be. It's not as atmospheric and exciting as Full Metal Jacket, not as epic as the Band of Brothers, not as actionable as ... well, nothing. I, of course, cannot understand why he was nominated for so much, and why people "unwind" these epic proportions. Keep in mind, given the scale of the films in the last couple of years, I believe that there is nothing to choose from.
