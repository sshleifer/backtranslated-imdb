This movie is terrible. I did not laugh so hard at a movie that was unintentionally funny for a long time. Leno should stand up to get up and late in the evening TV. The cars in the movie were great, but the movie itself is the dumbest movie I've ever seen. It's a pity, the game is terrible, and the plot could write a 4-year-old child. don't get me wrong, jay leno is hilarious, but not in this movie!
