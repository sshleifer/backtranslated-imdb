This film is so bad that you almost feel it is dirty. In fact, after it is over, there is a feeling of relief, relief, which you can now put back into the rewinder and immediately send it back to the video rental store before it pollutes the rest of your video collection. When we rented it, I jokingly suggested that it was like a movie in which William Hurt would “ring” in his performance. I meant that he would not try very hard. But, about a miracle, in a huge number of scenes in this film Bill Hurt is actually ON TELEPHONE! Our realization of this irony was the only pleasure we received from this intricate mess. Cinematography and editing are dark and puzzled, the story is chaotic, and the soundtrack is barely audible. There is a very slight resemblance to “Falling Down,” but this film had a bold, disturbing storyline, great writing and acting, and a fascinating soundtrack. A “polluted person” is just some kind of ruined old European tourist trap, and watching her is like driving along some unfamiliar country road in an unknown country where you don’t speak the language in a torrential rain immediately after dark while holding the windshield. fogging Do you get a picture? Do not understand this.
