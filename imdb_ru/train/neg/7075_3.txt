This, at least, is the third remake of this film, so if you experience a feeling of deja vu while watching it, don’t be surprised. All they did was change the story setting and tell it differently, but the differences were not significant. And it does not get better, because the plot from the very beginning has flaws. It never works. Like its predecessors, acting is mediocre. <br /> <br /> The plot has a unique ending that will surprise anyone who has never seen this movie before, but the ending doesn’t fit the story. If this film ended ten minutes ago, it would work and would be very pleasant, and I would consider it more worthwhile. But the spoiler and in the end the crime pays off, because the offender is not caught. I never liked this message from the movie.
