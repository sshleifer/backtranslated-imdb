Every Christmas Eve, I force my children to endure the next show, "This is a wonderful life." I also thoroughly enjoyed Bad Santa. So sue me. I admit it. I like cheese films. I also like superb, smart, but, like in many other things, diversity is good. What would be the Christmas season without Santa's annual film ka-cing-ka-cing in all its guises, from Edmund Gwenn to Billy Bob Thornton? Fred Klaus will not make anyone forget Bedford Falls, but I do not believe that a Christmas film must grow to a cult in order to succeed. "Fred" is the perfect festive film, with enough humor for adults and enough charm for children. My wife and I laughed a lot, even if most of the humor was obvious, and Vince was just Vince. Paul Giamatti was a first-class Santa who helped a lot. Not the best movie and is unlikely to become a must-see for anyone's annual Christmas traditions. But my wife and daughter enjoyed the fact that it was a festive shmaltsy with a small amount of spices. There is nothing wrong.
