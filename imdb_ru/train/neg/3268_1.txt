It’s ridiculous to make a film about a child who is devoured by wild fangs and that a mother is mistakenly accused of murder, but in spite of all this it will be possible. Meryl Streep gives an idea of ​​her life, melodramatic, overworked, but with this comic genius, which makes you laugh, even when your mother fights with horror. <br /> <br /> If comedies about babies that dogs eat, your cup of tea may not seem inconvenient to you, and yes, this is a strange choice of topic for farce, but in fact very few films have to do with it, because it focuses on giving Stripe a demonstration of her Australian accent and facial distortion. <br /> <br /> Quitting in pursuit of a biased attitude towards the media and sensation and disregard for truth or ethics gives the film the opportunity to dare to say that these things are bad.
