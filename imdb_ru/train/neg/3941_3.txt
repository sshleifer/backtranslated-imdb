This is what happens when you live in China, and the local video store is depleted in English-language titles - you are blessed with this work, which, yes, seems to be Romanian cinema. However, I think he has real comedic potential. <br /> <br /> Technically the spoilers are: <br /> <br /> Although I don’t think it would really ruin anyone’s pleasure to see why there’s a beach shooting scene on the set in the casino , even in the memories. This mystery and many other riddles still cannot be used by desperate comedians, perhaps when they are stuck in Bucharest. <br /> <br /> Let me also wonder out loud why absolutely beautiful people allow themselves to scoff at such a film. This is sad.
