I had to turn it off after about 15 amazing moments. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that this could improve, <br /> <br /> What I saw was poorly executed, directed and written. <Br /> <br /> This film should never have been released directly to DVD. <br /> <br /> The main character, who is the best bride of AD, has a huge ice sculpture that kills her. She was such a disgusting person that I didnâ€™t even feel sorry for her. She appears there as in heaven and is still disgusting, I soon left. <br /> <br /> Eva Longoria portrayed her, and I hope that I will never see her again, she cannot even act. She is simple. Annoying. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd, the actor who usually cannot do anything wrong, also participated in this deception. <br /> <br /> Jason Biggs (no longer a teenager) is also present, <br /> <br /> I like comedies, BUT not stupid about stupid people. <br /> <br /> Rating: * (out of 4) 30 points (out of 100) IMDb 2 (out of 10)
