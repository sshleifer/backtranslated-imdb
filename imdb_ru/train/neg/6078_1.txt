I rarely comment on films, but I read other comments, and I cannot believe that there are people who applaud this celluloid debris. I know that there are certain people who have their own plans, but let's take them on board; acted badly, shot badly, and the story felt like the director was thinking up how he went ahead. I'm not going to focus on the sexual aspect of the film with the participation of young children, because the filmmakers obviously knew what they wanted and what their audience wanted. All I can say is a horrible movie, the content is bad and offensive, an amateur production, and I am glad that they could not make a movie like this legally today
