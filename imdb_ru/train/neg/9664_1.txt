This film, based on the book, is really terrible and causes great disappointment. We have been waiting for this move for more than a month. Many reviewers hoped for this. Also in newspapers and on television, this made a lot of sense. When April 29 comes, many will regret to notice that the film is really awful. What for? First of all, the story was so monotonous. There were many vague scenes, sometimes it is difficult to understand what is happening. The actresses from Julia Avsar were not coordinated with their roles, especially Vildan Atasever. She plays better in comedy films. In this film, a kind of drama, she could not get rid of her previous role. And finally, the film is too short, just 66 minutes.
