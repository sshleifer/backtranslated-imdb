This movie is incredibly funny. I love horror movies, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm a big fan of blood, but most of the deaths in this film are not shown. This only shows us already dead bodies, and the only death scenes they actually show in this film are terrible. The graphics look so obviously fake. The actors are terrible too. There are no real emotions from any of them. Not only did I spend my time watching this film, but I had to expose myself to actual shots of beating animals at the beginning of the film. If I could rate it a -10, I would. Damn this movie. This is crap. <br /> <br /> Don't look.
