Maybe it's a dubbing, or maybe it's endless scenes when people cry, moan or otherwise continue, but I discovered that “Europe-51” is one of the most congested (and therefore annoying) films that i have ever seen. The film starts promisingly if familiar, as Ingrid Bergman's mom is too busy to spend time with her spoiled little boy son (Sandro Franchina). While mom and dad (soft Alexander Knox) ​​entertain their guests at a dinner party, the boy tries to commit suicide, setting in motion a series of events that change lives, and Bergman spends time pouring compassion on the poor and needy. Inspired by the editor of the communist newspaper, Andrea (Ettore Giannini), she soon spends more time with the oppressed than with her husband, who soon locks her in an insane refuge for her problems. Bergman plays the sacred role to the end, repeating her role of 1948 as Jeanne d'Arc, and Rossellini doing a fantastic job of lighting and filming for the best effect. Unfortunately, the script pushes its point of reference with subtle cunning, since Andrea and her mother, in turn, declare Marxist and Christian platitudes. For the final scene, soaked with tears, I had more than my fullness of these tiresome characters. The real step for Rossellini was when he departed from neorealism and even more embraced the mythic and mystical themes of the 1950s, The Flowers of Saint Francis.
