During the first Voya we get to know the world in which werewolves exist and are somewhat organized. The plot in this film had some meaning; The TV reporter is investigating this and trying to uncover the truth. In the end, she has to kill many of them, including her boyfriend, who becomes one of them. Then she shows the world that they exist, transforming in the air. The special effects were just ridiculous in the first film, and in this they do not improve. Whether it is transformation, bad puppets or stupid computer graphics, showing superpowers. <br /> <br /> Storyline is not so bad; for some reason they must kill the werewolf chief. It will not destroy all werewolves, and in fact it will not stop the threat from werewolves, because ... they just want to kill it. I think there was some muddy reason for this, but she really gets lost in the film. <br /> <br /> After the film “ends”, we have a 10-minute montage of the film that we just watched, and every other scene is one where the female werewolf pulls off the top, exposing her big chest, while some Devo-esquire band plays with a werewolf crowd. <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes this movie even watchable is Christopher Lee.
