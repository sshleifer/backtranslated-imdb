I was expecting a bad movie and got a bad movie. But I could not even imagine in my worst fantasy how bad this film is. I do not even want to try to explain what a Blood Surf is. This is not about surfing, but about a big crocodile. They complain about a fake shark in the Jaws, but Spielberg was wise and did not show the shark to the end. Here the crocodile is shown many times, and this is the worst crocodile I have ever seen, and they are not trying to hide it. If you want to see a nice fake crocodile, see Lake Placid. <br /> <br /> The director had the opportunity to make a decent film about surfing / shark, but he had to make a bad movie about b-monsters. He had the opportunity to make an original movie about surfing, but he wanted to make a movie about monsters. So, you understand how bad this film is, are there any good roles in it? Not really, thereâ€™s some nudity and sex scene filmed straight from a playboy movie. The game is not so bad, and Kate Fisher looks good. It is a pity that she does not take off her top. Leading actors are also quite good. They had some potential. The place was beautiful and the movie started off well with good surfing scenes. The incompetent writer and director is to blame. The dialogue is one of the worst I've ever seen, and the script is really poorly written, and the director had no talent, and no fancy. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this. Even if you want to see the beautiful Kate Fisher. It's not worth it. Watch the Sirens look at nude Kate, and Lake Placid if you want a good crocodile action. <br /> <br /> 3/10 because I am in a good mood, and Maureen Larrasabal looks nice naked, and Kate looks good (but this is a bad actress), and Dex Miller, Joel West and Matt Borlengy did a good job with part of the crap they had to work with.
