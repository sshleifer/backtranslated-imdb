I was very excited when I saw the advertisement of this film, because I recently read a book and I really liked it. The film, however, did not meet my expectations. Having read the book, I recently prepared me for a great disappointment, which often happens when stories are translated into movies. The characters did not seem to fit well into the book. The direction was weak. It was hard for me to get into characters. There was no real connection with the viewer about what was going on. The dialogue did not adequately explain what was happening. It seemed that he just hit and rushed away. Overall, I was very disappointed with the film. I suppose if you did not read the book, it could be ok by itself. At the very least, this may encourage you to read a book that you are likely to enjoy more. <br /> <br />
