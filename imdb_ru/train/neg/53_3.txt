I am learning Catalan and was very happy to find El Mar, a film with a predominantly Catalan dialogue, in my video store. <br /> <br /> Hmmm ... not very happy to see him. <br /> Yes, as other reviewers said, it is well-made and beautifully photographed. Although the initial sequence of children is shockingly cruel, it works well and is convincing. (For the most part, it is ... Can Mallorcanas undress a corpse in preparation for a funeral right in the center of the town square, in sight of a 10-year-old deceased boy?) also established during the Spanish Civil War. <br /> <br /> Fast forward and three children who survived the first incident, came age. Francis is a nun working in a tuberculosis sanatorium, and both the boys, Manuel and Ramallo, are both patients. I know, but hey, coincidences happen. <br /> <br /> The problem, as in many Spanish films (apologies to Almodovarâ€™s fans), is that with one exception (Francis) the characters are just damn * weird *, their motivation, personality and dialogue are often simply incoherent . <br /> <br /> Moreover, it turns into some terrible wretched excesses. Be prepared for a lot of pain and a lot of blood. The reviewer, who called it the "potboiler," is quite on the go. If this were done 40 years ago, the poster would say: SEE FORBIDDEN LOVE !! RAPE !! KILLING !! !! ORGANIZED FANATISM !! ANIMAL STILL !! Betrayal !! <br /> <br /> An introductory sequence is not enough to make the personality and relationships of the characters believable. To work, it had to have several memories to flesh out the characters. In fact, this seems to be a strange and depressing cross between "Brother Sun, Sister Moon" and "Pulp Fiction." If this sounds like something you should see, by all means, enjoy. I think I am going with something that does not make me feel that I need to take a shower in order to wash away the face of the earth and darkness. <br /> <br /> As for Catalan, this is a Majorcan dialect, quite different from Barcelona. dialect, although I was surprised by the commentary, which said that even Barcelonans obviously needed Catalan subtitles to figure it out.
