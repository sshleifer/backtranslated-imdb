Well, the story does not make sense, the characters lack dimension, the best dialogue is the commercials about the poor quality of the film, the cinematography is gloomy, and only editing saves a bit of confusion, but Sam Peckinpa made the film. For those who appreciate Pekingpa and his great work, this film is disappointing. Even a great cast cannot redeem the time spent by the viewer on this minimal effort. <br /> <br /> The correct response to the film is the contempt that director San Pekingaph, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Burt Young, Bo Hopkins, Arthur Hill and even Gig Young bring to their work. Watch wonderful films about Beijing. Skip this mess.
