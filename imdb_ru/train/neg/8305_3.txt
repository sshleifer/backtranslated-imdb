Like most people I love "Christmas Story". I have never even heard of this film, and perhaps not in vain - it's terrible. The same language, the same story-teller, the same director, but the original's warm blurredness was not enough. Charles Grodin was a bad choice to replace Darrin McGevin, but I can't imagine anyone could replace him. The story seems forced and it lacks the sweetness of the original. Interaction with neighbors, Bumpuses, is ridiculous. In Christmas Story, Ralphy's obsession with BB weapons seems cute, but his obsession in this film is boring. Scud Farkus, the original bully next door, is replaced in this film by another child with braces and a strange hat, but with a small amount of the ominous appeal of Scud Farkus. It would be quite difficult to compare the original, even if this film was shot with the original team.
