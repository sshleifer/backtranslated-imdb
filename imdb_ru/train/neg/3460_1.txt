Oh, man, this movie ever bites! If you have ever been afraid to see a rehash of a slasher genre made as cheap as possible and cautious at the same time (PC friendly means no nudity, a classic element of slash films). Each clich√© is remade without a hint of self-awareness and action. Oh, action redefines the word horror. I should have known better, since a direct Dutch translation of the name helped me.
