In a nutshell: this is a romantic comedy with a cookie dresser that REALLY WISHES and TRIES to be something big. It wants to be Harold and Maud, Annie Hall, Graduate. He wants to be deep and human. He has interesting camera shots, lighting, music, montage, and all this creates the feeling of an important film. The dialogue is smart - at times. There are a few moments of "laughing out loud." <br /> <br /> But what ultimately prevents him from being something more than just a patterned night cable in flight, a time killer: <br /> <1. David Schwimmer - how many times can a puppy Joe look sad into space with an open jaw before it starts to annoy? Maybe some kind of spittle would help. <br /> <br /> 2. Gwennet Paltrow - she is really flat here, not just in the chest. It is assumed that her role will be this lively, sweet, caring girl who just continues to get into the wrong situations, with the result that she is very confused, and therefore a loser-loser, such as Schwimmer, has a chance with her. But Gwennet plays her very boring. Combine this with a puppy's saliva (see above), and you will have little chemistry to take care of. <br /> <br /> (I continued to portray someone else in this role - for example, Kate Hudson). <Br /> <br /> 3. Scenario and plot - things that happen simply do not ring true; In the end, all the problems are wrapped in such a neat and neat bow at the top that it seems that they blew the whistle, and the scriptwriters simply said: “Oh, it's time to finish, there is a train to catch!” So ​​they pulled out the Hollywood formula, checked all the boxes and let's go home.
