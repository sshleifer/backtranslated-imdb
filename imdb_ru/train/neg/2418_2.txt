The first mistake you make when you name a movie is to use the “living dead,” without actually having the budget for a real zombie fx. Of course, it was a low-budget zombie film - a very low budget. I thought it was a film school project. Amateur actors and amateur effects. <br /> <br /> It was really nice, considering the above, and represented an interesting twist in the zombie genre. If you are going to get an “R” for violence, you can also give us some good pictures of the attacking babies. Women were so little used in this film that it could almost be classified as “gay interest”. <br /> <br /> And I stay out of Auckland. There was a lot of shooting, and the police were not visible!
