... but it makes you wonder if we have any at all! This film is as terrible as any horror of today's horror. A man walks around half-naked ladies, trying to decide which of them to kill, so that he can give his girlfriend a new body. One scene involves a person reeling around and spraying the entire set for a full three minutes, covering everything that should be much more than ten gallons of “blood.” The film also attempts to create a feeling that what a man is doing with his girlfriend is wrong and contrary to nature, but the film is so poorly made that viewers cannot inflame any sense of shock or outrage. Placidly gloomy and unsightly sinister, this film cannot even get its own name directly - the opening credits say “The brain that will not die”, but the final credits indicate it as “The head that will not die”.
