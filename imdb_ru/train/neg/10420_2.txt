Well, I know that many people are likely to resent this review, because Watership Down is a “classic” and standard part of most people's childhood, but seeing this film for the first time at the tender age of 18, I have to admit: I really hated it. <br /> <br /> We watched this movie because my sister read the book and really enjoyed it, and many people who whimpered from the very word “Watership Down” - their memories of the film being children and tearing emotions at the seams - I recommend. To be honest, I would not worry. I have given this advantage of doubt; As a rule, I do not like to stop watching a movie halfway. It was an exception. It was really, really, painful, sickeningly boring. This film was perhaps the slowest thing I have ever watched (imagine a light snail in space), and in fact “did not do” for me. Art was fine; the backgrounds were well made, if not to say a little soft, but the rabbits themselves were not very cute, and the animation was rather nervous and poorly thought out. <br /> <br /> I will not go into the details of the plot line; This is mainly a story about a group of rabbits that leave their eagle due to the penetration of people into the area. As a rule, a moralistic story about the dangers of human interaction with the environment in which anthropomorphic rabbits are used to convey this message. For me, I kind of wanted to be gassed, not because I'm a terrible sadist, but because the characters were boring, annoying, boring and generally rather rude (oh, I'm so terribly English). I found myself constantly looking at my watch when I watched a movie, and it took about 20 minutes before something really happened, and even that was a terrible obstacle. <br /> <br /> If I were praised anyway, I would have to admit that the concept of showing children the dangers of building in the countryside and, we hope, exposing the arrogance of people, etc., etc., is quite well-intentioned. Maybe all this is generally sanctimonious and preaching, but the message that it is trying to convey is good by nature. The music was also good. <br /> <br /> So in conclusion, this film is pretty bad. I could not see through it all, or I would probably be forced to eat my own legs in sheer boredom. Of course, this is not a “torque”, this is bad, but it is still not very high in my eyes, so I gave it 2/10. <br /> <br /> Hope this helps.
