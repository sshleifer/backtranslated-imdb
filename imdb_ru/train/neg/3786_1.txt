This is not a completely correct review, since I have not seen much of the film. I stopped watching this. The film is very cruel, with nasty drug dealers and street punks, but I have not stopped watching. <br /> <br /> That's the problem: I looked enough to get acquainted with several characters, each of which was not interesting. Everyone was a tedious, despicable psychopath, without any attractive personalities, and I have nothing to wait. I was not at all curious what they would do next or what might happen to them. <br /> <br /> If there was at least one person of interest, and I do not mean a good or good person, I mean an interesting person, I could stay with him. See “The State of Grace” to see what I mean. In this film, Gary Oldman's character is completely crazy, but he is * very * interesting. Al Pacino may have worked well at Scarface, but his character simply did not attract me.
