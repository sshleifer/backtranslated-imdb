How could I best express my feelings for this film: disgusting? headache? lack of consistent writing? simple nonsense? Try all of the above for this parody. And this is only for referral. <br /> <br /> History? Well, I think there is a story. Two dumb blondes are looking for a job after they crash a plane on a golf course. They are mistaken for a “peaceful renounced murderer” (sarcasm), and two “thugs” “hire” them. One thinks that “pick him up” means a date, and the other a younger actor she dreams of. And, of course, the stock of turtles for farting turtles, which they build with the winnings in the casino. <br /> <br /> It seems like everything can be funny? Guess again. They try to make it funny, but it’s not. Shooting episodes are not well done. I have seen the best shots in Hong Kong films. The visual effects are average for the movie of the late 80s. But the problem is that this is a 2007 film. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time on this. Danny Glover's film "Out" since the early 80s is still not the worst film of all time, but again, this film is in its class. "F"
