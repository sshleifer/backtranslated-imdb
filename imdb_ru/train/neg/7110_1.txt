Well, we must pay tribute to the director for how brave he is. Gutsy will be the correct term. Not only did he use a total of five people (no add-ons on ALL), but he also decided to use subpar special effects with a confusing and boring plot, he also, and Iâ€™m NOT joking, put a warning at the beginning of the film that you could die from the fight !!! However, they promise FREEEEEE COOOOFFFFFFFIIIIINNNNN. Having a terrible, lame gardener is always a good move. Yaaa-unique-aaawwwwnnn .... <br /> <br /> If you are watching Mystery Science Theater 3000, you may have seen it. They love to show horrible movies, just so you know. <br /> <br /> Good gift for someone you hate.
