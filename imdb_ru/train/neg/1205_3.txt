What is it? Canadian film about zombies, which I had never heard of before. The Undertaker is working on the body of a recently deceased young man. This allows you to expand the memories that show how the guy got there. Basically, he and his friends went to the cemetery on Friday the 13th and resurrected the dead thanks to their silly singing. Cut back to the morgue, where our dead body comes alive and kills the undertaker and his owner (with his eyes stuck out). WTF Final? The picture shows the owner of the funeral home in a straitjacket and shouts: “I'm not crazy!” Surprisingly, they returned his eyeballs. <br /> <br /> Having run 58 minutes, this is definitely one oddity in a zombie movie theater. It feels much longer, but I plunged into some kind of trance, where I could not stop watching. The film also has one of those gag "if you see this image, turn away from the screen." This is an image of an old man who falls ill in the theater (prophetic?), And when he appears (only twice), the blood begins to flow. Scenes are pretty damn awful for a period of time. There is a big blunder when a zombie chops a girl’s right hand off with a shovel, but when he pulls a fake hand into the frame to chew it’s left hand.
