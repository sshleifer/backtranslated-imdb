This movie was terrible! I rented it, not knowing what to expect. I watched the first 5 minutes and the film and knew that it was a bomb. The game was bad and there was no plot. Monster sooooo fake. This growl and his mouth does not move. Also, why do they need a doctor who plays the xylophone to kill the monster. Just bad, don't even waste your time. (1 out of 10)
