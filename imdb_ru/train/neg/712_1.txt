When I started watching this movie, I saw a guy from Buffy, Xander, and thought how good it is that he still makes a living acting in a movie. Now a strange film that I can stand, considering that this is a good portion of strange things, such as, for example, the films of David Lynch, “Twin Peaks”, “The Lost Trail”, etc. And you need to be in the mood for one. This one, however, made me mockingly remember crazy sites about conspiracy theories that have absolutely no meaning. I mean, come on the Nazi people who are conspiring with America to make the unholy trinity of evil forces? I was surprised that they did not mention the hollow land in this movie with Hitler's flying saucers and lizardmen. Maybe, if in this film there were 60 grams of the heroine, it would make some sense, but seriously I do not condone drugs, as I do not condone this film. It should be burned, crushed and forgotten so that the good old Xander could get another acting job. It was not his action, although it was good, but the script simply had no meaning. Sorry.
