An illegal so-called asylum seeker arrives in Stuttgart and thinks that the Germans are “racists.” <br /> <br /> This is another forgotten nugget in the long list of anti-German propaganda films after World War II, aimed at making the Germans feel “bad” because they did not accept each and every degenerate in their country, he can pursue German blondes and sell drugs to German teenagers. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for good German films in general, see “Der Tunnel”, “Der Untergang”, “Europa Europa” and “Lola Rant.” <br /> <br /> But not this . <br /> <br /> Also “Das Experiment” with the same male actor from “Lola Rennt”.
