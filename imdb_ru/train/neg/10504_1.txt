I could not watch more than 14 minutes. This is a great combination of really bad acting and really bad direction. Used images are disgusting, they all the time overcame an angle of 180 degrees. My head hurts and I try to watch this load of “you know what.” The dirt on the window of the "mysterious car" makes you see the light from the lighting on the windows ... annoying. What else ... it's all so badly framed that you just want to scream at that lady who is going there. I only shot short films, but I'm sure it would be better than the director of a feature film ... the story is incredible, just the scene of a long French kiss in the beginning tells you that it will be pretty awful at all costs, it will save you 5 bucks or so for hire, and in this 1 hour 30 hours of your life you will never return ...
