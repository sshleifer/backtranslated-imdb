While I watch this film, it is interesting to see how it marginalizes black men. The film spends time showing how helpless the black man is most noticeable in him (except for the heroic moment). For most of the film, other black men (and black black women) in the film are in the background, barely noticeable. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Williamsâ€™s character was strong and responsive. The viewer can easily identify and sympathize with her. There are also some fairly visible and three-dimensional auxiliary characters with fair skin and some white characters with some warmth and dignity. But 99% of the black men in this film are nothing more than invisible men. Silent shadows in the background, without consequences. Such a terrible flaw, but nothing unusual in the mainstream media.
