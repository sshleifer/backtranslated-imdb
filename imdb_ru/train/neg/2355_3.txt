I almost always opposed the inclusion of songs in the movie. I believed that the quality of the film would automatically improve if only these extremely annoying songs were excluded. However, everything quickly changed after watching this terrible black (without songs) and this film (many songs). While Black was extremely weak, they tell a fascinating story with strong play and good leadership. The songs were almost random and almost mixed with the film. Of course, no woman got sprayed with water for no apparent reason due to mysterious sources of water, spinning wildly through the streets at night. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised by the bold and imperturbable approach used by the director. , Nothing was disguised, and almost every scene was completely believable. <br /> <br /> I would recommend these films to people who speak Hindi, at least with a little understanding of life in Mumbai. The first, because the English subtitles were below par and contained many mistakes, which sometimes completely changed the meaning of the actual statement. The latter is because you definitely appreciate the accuracy of the description as soon as you yourself have lived it. <br /> <br /> I would definitely rate it as a work worthy of international recognition. Scenes with gossip drivers were a nice touch and at the same time served as a source of genuine humor and another point of view on all the confusion. The film falls short only in a few places, where the characters sometimes say the most inexplicable things that distract from the general direction of the film. <br /> <br /> I also thought that some of the more sad scenes were not done very well. It was a touch, funny to watch, not to cause feelings of sadness, and the whole scene looked a little silly. However, these are minor issues, because the film is, in general, a truly rare treat to watch. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a cynical, pessimistic view and at the same time refreshing! Actors, not “heroes” are the key. The opportunity to see believable people in an unusual setting - everyday life. A backstage perspective on the scale of debauchery and a rare ray of hope for Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
