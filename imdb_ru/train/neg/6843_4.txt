Quite an interesting exploitation of the movie in black and white, written by David Friedman. Lead actress Stacy Walker is well-played and strangely attractive. She looks like an abnormal Renee Zellweger with a bad hairdo. This chick shot only two of these films, and then returned to Texas. The music is terrible. One of her guys plays Sam Melville (from THE ROOKIES TV show) under a different name. <br /> <br /> The best line in the Tony film: â€œDo you dress me, doll? nestlings put me up. "Good b / w cinematography from Laszlo Kovach (EASY RIDER & TARGETS and many others). Good spots (cool pool, also used in DEFILERS) .
