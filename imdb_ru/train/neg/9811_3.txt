What can I say??? This film was so stupid and stupid that I thought it was a comedy with dragon psychos. They have to rename it to “The Battle of Pregnant Cats!” What a stupid waste of time if you want to see (DIE DIE !!! "I WANT YOUR CHILD ROYAL) Jennifer Tilly, being crazy, then just shoot one of the movie" Chucky " oh you, "The Bride" Chucky. "It's much more fun to watch two ugly plastic dolls (one of them, Jennifer Tilly, turned into an ugly female version of Chucky) doing creaky plastic rubber sex, and then watching Daryl Hannah be pregnant, dull and stupid; Husbang in a food processor reminded me of mine Th mom trying to do homework! Well, it's just BAD !!!
