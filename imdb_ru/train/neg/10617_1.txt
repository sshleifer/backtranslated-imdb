Probably emboldened by the fans of her much better Orlando, Potter here delivers the car for herself in the worst possible way: she writes, directs, plays leading roles and actually co-authored music, including the Mawkin love song. The film is very similar to a teenagerâ€™s high school or college project, who is convinced that her own intimate love and melodramatic obsessions are as adorable for us as for her. But the character of Potter is not as sympathetic as the object of her romantic obsession, unpleasant, and the whole film is an embarrassing demonstration of narcissism, disguised as a tango celebration. Perhaps if she hadn't given up herself, it might work. She simply cannot act, whether she plays herself or not. Artsy, overly ambitious, boring and stupid.
