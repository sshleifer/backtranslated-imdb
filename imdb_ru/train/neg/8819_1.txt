it is without a doubt the worst, most idiotic, terrible thing I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> This plot of the film says that some guy goes crazy and dresses like Santa Claus and kills people, BECAUSE he saw his mother give his father oral sex while he was dressed like Santa Claus. WHY DID IT EXIST? is it just me or is it the scariest reason for someone to go crazy like ever? and this is not the only thing. I'm serious when I say that nothing happens in this damned movie. Nothing, until 1 hour and 15 minutes passes. <br /> <br /> There is a whole fucking scene where he sticks a bloody Santa beard to him. This is a long minute. WHOM HELL WANTS TO SEE THAT? However, I must say that the ending of this film made me laugh at this. so if you see this movie on TV or something like that, then after 1 hour and 20 minutes you just watch, without a doubt, the worst end of the whole cinematic story. and I take it seriously. <br /> <br /> it’s not even that good, it’s bad, it’s tiring, it’s idiotic, it made me want to break the VCR. it's just not worth your time, and I'm sure all the other reviews mentioned it, but the actress who played the mother in Home Improvement was in this movie for a split second. DO YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW IS THIS FILM? I would LOOK TO IMPROVE HOME ON SIX SIX SIX SIX HOURS WHEN EVEN LOOKING FOR THESE FILMS AGAIN AGAIN.
