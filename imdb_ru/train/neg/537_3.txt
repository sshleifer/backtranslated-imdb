I went to see "Evening" because of the actors. For this reason, I went to see “The Room of Norman” - this film, in which Diane Keaton, Leonardo de Caprio and, besides, Meryl Streep, were shot - and I liked his every minute. The same goes for the “Notebook,” although it was a frivolous chicken. And I felt that anything that Vanessa Redgrave, Meryl Streep, Patrick Wilson and Glenn Clowes would give would be at least as good. Instead, I found that sometimes even the greatest actors cannot overcome the trivial, simplistic and - in one case - truly offensive material. <br /> <br /> Now I have no problems with the way the movie is arranged. I actually enjoy movies that turn back and forth in time to tell a story ... while one era covers another and poems. But while Vanessa's character, who is on her deathbed and recalling a past event, she felt that “was a mistake”, was exciting, at times, the part that actually shows what this “last mistake” did was does not clarify anything. In fact, it seems meaningless in the most stupid fashion “a girl meets a boy, a girl gets a boy, a girl loses a boy”, and in the most incredible, cliche, in the wrong way. <br /> <br /> And from being spoilers, so keep this in mind if you continue reading. <br /> <br /> First of all, Claire Danes was brutally mistakenly accepted. Not only does she not even begin to resemble Vanessa Redgrave as a young woman, she has nothing to do with chops when it comes to acting. Don't get me wrong, she can be good in the right role - just not in this. And Patrick Wilson was mistakenly accepted, although he has acting chops to almost cope with this. He would have been better suited to the role played by Hugh Dancy - the rich confusion of WASP - and not the object of sexual attraction to everyone without exception; he is too wasp for this. Hugh Dancy? One note - "I am a tortured drunkard and wait until you understand why." And the “why” (I am a hidden case in the world of sexual repression, so I have to drink the surplus and make a fool of myself in front of everyone I know) was so insulting to me and the way he died (as you knew, he would do it, because this is the only thing that can happen to a fagot in the fifties), so ridiculous, wrong and wrong, I almost threw my candy at the screen. <br /> <br /> With regard to the modern part between Tony Collett and her sister, her fear of commitment, her jealousy of her sister’s “perfect life”, her sister wonders if she’s made the right choice, her pregnancy and hers too the ideal guy (which could actually be more interesting and meaningful if Patrick Wilson played it, and Ebon Moss-Bakhrakh could be more interesting Harris, given his dreamy eyes) - in any case, it was all mixed up in 70 and the 80s. And in much greater depth. Should we REALLY present it again and again, as if it were fresh and significant? <br /> <br /> And to top it all, Meryl Streep doesn't even appear until the last ten minutes of the film, all in the makeup of an old lady who hides many of her facial expressions. She is still good, but only because she is Meryl, and Meryl can find a way to remove even the most stupid dialogue under the heaviest makeup. <br /> <br /> Simply put, this movie has all the clichés in a movie with a “really meaningful message,” and he adds a few that really had nothing to do, again. Two hours of duration and permeated with music "Lifetime Movie-of-the-Week", which is guaranteed to deplete you - this is a complete failure in both the "significant" and "cinematic" aspects. I give him "3" only because of Meryl and Vanessa. <br /> <br /> Now, if all you need from your films is two times, then please postpone my comments about “The Evening” and set aside time. a life. But if you want a truly meaningful experience to be served by great actors and directors who know what to do with a simple story about life and death and all the nonsense she brings, rent the Norman Room and find out what a truly great actor play.
