I must confess that I saw several howlers in my time, but this one is there with the worst of them. The plot is alarming to follow. Sex and violence are confusing and distracting from a really poorly composed film. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine that the actors look back at the final product and want it to gather dust on the shelf in order to be disturbed for one or two generations. Unfortunately, in my case I have a DVD. He will sit on the shelf and look at me from time to time.
