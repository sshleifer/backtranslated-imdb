Spoilers will be in it. The film could be better if they had a different script, director and computer graphics provider. Not much right? In the film, a man launches his own theme park ... uh ... zoo on a desert island where people can see dinosaurs ... uh ... saber-toothed sounds, and it is called Yurr ... oh ... Primal Park. I don’t mind robberies, because there are no original ideas for this kind of film, but this one just slaps you, and it’s even a “shaded head thing from design”. Saber-toothed, which are not saber-toothed, according to Mr. Primal Park (just ancient killer cats), are rather strange, but what’s a major achievement is what I call the "Sylga". Because after getting rid of one big cat, the hero relaxes a little because only one remains. Enter the strange feeding guy who says: “No, we made three, the third one is a monster that moves with its front legs. Great, great. A group of college students is also on the island for a scavenger hunt, they are testing to get into their click, fraternity or sort (I always thought that I needed a short nickname). Of those who live, only one completed his task, so I enjoyed it. Oh yes, the obligatory click "The Evil Capitalist Must Die" acts not with one, but with two of them! The death of Mr. Primal Park is the most ridiculous thing you will see in one of these films, when the tooth of the Sabretooth statue loosely hangs out (courtesy of Sylga), shrinks to several sizes and pierces a person through the throat. If I had just gone so easily. I like Sabretooth better than this spin-off.
