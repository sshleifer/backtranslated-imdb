When I noticed that Noah Wyle and Ricky Schroeder were in the same film, I scored! I admit, I could not wait to see the movie. And I must say that the first fifteen minutes or so were nostalgic in some way. Then everything went down the hill. I did not expect this to be a dump of politically correct civil rights. They took all the possible controversial topics and threw them into one stupid story. I was shocked that Noah was involved in something like that, especially in his role. No one with a fully functional brain will really take all this crap about the Vietnam War. If someone really wants to know what communism was like, sit down and read a book about it. And not the one that praises it or against it, just cold and harsh facts. <br /> <br /> I only watched a few scenes here and there just because I wanted to see Rickyâ€™s body, but that was all that interested me, Everything else in this film annoyed me.
