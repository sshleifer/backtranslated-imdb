Alone In The Dark is one of the BAD movie associated with Dews Bigalow as the worst movie of the year. I wish it was ALL that I had to say, but, of course, IMDb provides word counting and all that. <br /> <br /> I think about what a bad movie is worse than a bad one. Low budget trees, such as Red Zone Cuba, Monster A Go Go and Manos. Or a huge budget shame, like Gigli, Superbabies or this chatter. You see movies like Monster A Go Go and Manos, because the director has no idea. Such films happen because the director is a stupid, idiot who collects money, who simply does not care about his audience. <br /> <br /> This is more shocking when you consider that Uwe Boll (the mastermind behind this shocking nonsense he has some real garbage in his belt) created something that happens only once in the blue moon. Really horribly bad horror movie. Everything is a mess. CGI trashy, bad storyline, crazy random camera sections and terrible soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Alone In The Dark is a terrible movie that absolutely nobody should watch. Woo hoo! The review is over. Give me a kidney, remove 2006, and may I NEVER talk about it again. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie.
