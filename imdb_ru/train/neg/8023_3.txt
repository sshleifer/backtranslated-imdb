After watching this movie on DVD, I watched the trailer. The voice acting describes the film as surreal. Well, this is surreal, and there is surreal. <br /> <br /> In fact, there was only one part of the film that seemed surreal to me, but, frankly, it was more confusing than surrealistic. Other unusual images, especially the scene in the dining room, where everyone is on the floor, were so meaningless that they had no meaning. I have no objection to images that mean nothing, but these scenes just seemed out of place. <br /> <br /> I got the impression that the director was trying to convey Logan’s inner monologue. I don't know what else could explain what was going on. Unfortunately, nothing of what I saw gave me any idea of ​​what Logan was thinking, what his perspective or even his emotional state was. All I could say was that he was not particularly pleased with his appearance, and that he was in love with an older boy. <br /> <br /> I thought that the ending signals what the relationship between the boys has become, but nothing else happened. Intentional juxtaposition of ambiguous scenes with those that were simpler seemed more like a cop than an artistic decision. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, although the film was tiresome for me and without content, it was a definite change of pace. I really liked Madagascar Skin, and I had the feeling that this film was striving for such a narration and, perhaps, even for style. It didn't even come close. For me there is no doubt: this film deserves A for the effort, but D for the performance.
