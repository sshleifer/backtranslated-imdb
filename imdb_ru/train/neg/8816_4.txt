I saw my mother ... well, she did not quite kiss Santa Claus; he held his hand on her thigh and thought of evil thoughts. <br /> <br /> This was enough to emotionally hurt a young boy who wanted to believe. He grew up a bitter man, frustrated with the quality of his toys and the lack of Christmas spirit. <br /> <br /> In anticipation of this film, I was very disappointed that less than a few people died, and there was no nudity at all. What a bummer. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie, but it was too slow and really didn’t have a good script. I didn’t expect great acting, but I’m sure I wanted some action. There simply was not one.
