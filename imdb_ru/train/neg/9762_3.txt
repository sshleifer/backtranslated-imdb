Alan Ald plays the real Sports Illustrated writer George Plimpton, who was once invited to join the Detroit Lions football team as an honorary member. Rather, a pale, implacable drama, softened with curiosity by fantasy. Director Alex March with an interesting accent took up this material, removing it in a quasi-documentary way (with macho comments), but at the same time giving the tale a whimsical, capricious character; nonetheless, by revealing the cinematic brilliance in this production, he turns the main story into a mess. Alda’s smug, charismatic performance is another flaw, although the cast is filled with real pro-athletes (and sparkling Lauren Hutton as Alda’s girlfriend - how is that for fantasy?). * 1/2 of ****
