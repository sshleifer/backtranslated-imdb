One of the worst films ever. Not funny, bad cinema style TV, bad acting. It is sad to see so many famous old actors barely able to walk, let alone act. Leading woman Nancy Young cannot act. A terrible direction. Weak with bad tv movies. Random weak jokes have no success. Even the basic premise of the film does not make sense. Somehow they should prevent the wedding, but there is no logic in their actions. A slow step made my wife stop looking, but I experienced it. It is assumed that old people behave as if they are young and excited, but this seems pathetic, not funny. How did they even get the money to do this?
