Well, I also heard, read all the lifeless reviews and comments about how this film could deserve the Best Oscar film, so I went to see it today. What a big disappointment! 1) If you read other reviews, you will learn from US soldiers who have served in Iraq how unlikely the events of this film are. They reflected my own thoughts; during the screening of the film, I - a complete civilian person - continued to think to myself: “Tell me WHAT? There is no such thing that could happen so ... "2) In fact, very little is happening from the point of view of the plot. A new guy throws up bombs to replace the one who was killed (death, which is not quite clearly explained). A new guy gets adrenaline from his job. His attitude puts others at risk. THAT'S ALL! 3) This film is not as alarming as it is claimed. If you want suspense, try one of the Bourne movies. If you want to watch a war movie that is emotionally strong, try renting “Go Tell The Spartans” telling about the Vietnam War and the stars of Bert Lancaster (who personally told me at a random supermarket meeting that he was immensely proud of and one, which he regarded as one of his best works, and which he still upset, was largely ignored as a result of an over-promoted Apocalypse now), or the old black and white classic of World War II "The Bismarck Sink" which, especially for the English film, is incredibly heartbreaking. DO NOT SPEND TIME ON Hurt Locker.
