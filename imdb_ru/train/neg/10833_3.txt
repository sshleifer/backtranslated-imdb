I wanted to love Magnolia. The plot reminded me of the Grand Canyon (which I liked). 4 different lives / stories that come together at the end, but Magnolia made a wrong turn in the middle of the movie, and I was lost. I turned it off almost immediately, but I felt that I had to keep there until the end; I knew little that it would be another torturous hour and a half. Thank God, I rented instead of seeing it in the theater. I almost cried out in disappointment after 2 hours. The biggest blow in the pants - the final scene of the frog. My DVD player still hasn't forgiven me, and I don't blame anything. It was a unique film, but a bad, boring and meaningless film.
