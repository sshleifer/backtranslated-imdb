Repetitive music, annoying narrative, terrible cinematic effects. Half of the plot seemed to be centered around the meaning of shock, and the other half seemed to focus on pacifying the crowd that would put pressure on people to start the fight. <br /> <br /> One of the best scenes was in the “Deleted scenes” section, where she is in the principle office with her mom. I do not understand why they cut it off. The film seemed to be desperately trying to figure out what he could, and Domino, speaking of women's clubs, would be the highlight of the film. <br /> <br /> Funny cinematography is reminiscent of MTV, and is completely unnecessary or useful for movies. Accelerating the film just to jump over a lot of things and rotate the camera around something that repeatedly ages when first used. As if the directors want to use all these extra shots that they did not want to throw away. <br /> <br /> Another movie with Jerry Springer? This was supposed to tell me not to watch it from the previews. <br /> <br /> A popular film for a crowd of viewers.
