Yes, definitely better than my view of Death Tunnel. In fact, some of the deaths were quite original, and the blood was decent. It was like the “Wrong turn meets hills with eyes.” <br /> <br /> BUT: 1.) When are the “children” (high school or college?) discussing horror films in the kitchen, everything Shea says is an almost exact quote from Scream (1996). It's about girls with big tits, etc. 2. /) <br /> <br /> 2. Was Steve NOT the bootleg of Randy from Scream? 3.) Besides the fact that this happened in October, how was the film related to Samhain? Pretty unnecessary if you ask me. I find it funny when I see the horror films of the 80s, which talk about loose ends, pointing the finger at a druid or pentagram. <br /> <br /> 4.) Wow, they made a link to Sam Raymi !!! 5.) Why is Gary and his sister in the film? They characters have nothing to do with anything. And he is so psychic that he could not even see his OWN death? 6.) When Gary was killed in the bathroom (at this point, deaths were just blood clots), how could she hear the screams when she was downstairs, but not hear them when she stood outside the door? 7.) Sister Gary commented on Haggis - it is, above all, a Scottish dish, not Irish. <br /> <br /> 8.) So, the lesson is that you are like Sheh and do not have fun and do not smile the whole movie, will you live alone? 9.) The mutants were pretty cool, but they looked like Chili con carne walking dishes. <br /> <br /> 10.) When they brought Gary's sister, they forgot that Steve was tied there, and they wonder where he went? 11.) Was there not more than one killer? Shea won, but he never met them again. <br /> <br /> 12.) What happened to the memories of these people? Half of them, She, did not know whether they were alive or not, so what about this? 13.) Why didn't they kill Gary and his sister before? 14.) Why has no one ever called the police? And, obviously, everyone KNEW that these people lived in the forest, why they never organized some sort of raid? 15.) As far as I know, they were not zombies OR Vampires - so how could she “turn in” at the end? I'm with everyone else on the giant "eh?" in the end. <br /> <br /> The path is better than the tunnel of death, but still quite sloppy. I still do not understand why they even posted it in Ireland, given that Samhain had nothing to do with the plot.
