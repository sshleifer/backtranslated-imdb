Hamm, an Italian film shot by David Hasselhoff and Linda Blair. Honestly, I did not expect much, and in fact, I took even less than I expected. This does not mean that this film is the worst that I saw, because I watched worse things than this one, but the plot was in most cases confusing and uninteresting, and some good blood scenes were the only thing that saved it. In addition, you will love some special effects, they are really gentle and bad. Now I want to watch “Troll 3” of the same director, of course, it will not be worse.
