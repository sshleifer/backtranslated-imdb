I was one of the few extras in this big bomb. I just happened to be in the right place, working on safety on the racing scenes in A.I.R. as it was known then. Thank you, my scene in the first few minutes of the film, and I do not need to look at all this. It was a big party, not a movie set, but hey, the pay was good. Attention to detail was not a strong point for this, but who was going to know it. It was funny to see cars on the track very slow speed, and then in the film it accelerated to what was close to normal speed. Many scenes were modified as they were shot, I believe, to reduce costs and time.
