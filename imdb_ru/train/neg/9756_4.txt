Despite the (English) name, it seems to have nothing to do with the devils and much more to do with the overbearing ruler, who is looking for the Philosopher's Stone and wants gold to be made of lead (and virgin's blood). Jacinto Molina plays Gilles de Lancre, and he seems to have little trouble punishing people when he thinks they threaten his position, or when he needs virgins for their blood. He is mainly caused by his love of a lady and an alchemist, whom he hired, and his greed and madness seem to be his problem than an obsession with demons (unfortunately). There are parts that are at least somewhat exciting, such as contests and adult men trying to knock each other down with big sticks, and the film at least looks good, but otherwise little can be recommended. A little on the path of blood and nothing to fear at all, and the most unusual for the film Molina / Ours, and not some unintended humor. Therefore, 4 out of 10.
