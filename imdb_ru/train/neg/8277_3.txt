This may be incredible, but this film has collected in Russia 878 138 dollars! This is shown in almost all cinemas and still works! Well, I have no idea why distributors are looking at this particular “film”, which is almost never shown all over the world. This is some kind of mystery! Haha Perhaps it was based on the fact that another film "Pledge This" with Paris Hilton, which was also released only on DVD almost everywhere, had major shows in Russia and collected more than 1 million dollars. In addition, in both films there was a lot of advertising, for example, banners, commercials, etc. were placed throughout the city. Speaking of the film, I would say that it is boring and absolutely boring. It could be better, really. Even if he has Jessica Simpson.
