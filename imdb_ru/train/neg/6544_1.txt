I paid one dollar for this DVD, and at first I felt deprived, but then I started thinking about it, and I should be grateful. I found the holy grail, the real touchstone of a bad movie. If you think that the initial dramatic footage of an empty stadium successfully came together with the awkward address monologue of the camera Evel, wait until the initial credits roll on the driver's ass. The script seems to be stuck together from newspaper cuttings and textbooks on ESL. But ..... I just can't believe how bad George Hamilton is. It seems he is absolutely not connected with anything that says, the only inner monologue that I can discover is, “God, I bet they think I'm sweet. Really cute! ” This is an epiphany! Now I know how bad it is.
