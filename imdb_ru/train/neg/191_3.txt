... do not live in Montana and especially not live there at the end of the 19th century. <br /> <br /> “The river flowing through it” is certainly a well-made film from a cinematic point of view. Beautiful scenery, Redford behaves well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story is bad (if there is one at all). <br /> <br /> I was sorry for the narrator / author, who is as dry, dim-witted as his father, the preacher. Being expelled, not controlling his own life, he remains to watch his brother, who is also in a cage surrounded by a small town, losing his life. The author does not even understand the motivation of his brother, but at least he understands that he lacks the slightest amount of darkness / fun. All that is is fly fishing, where he, like the old man, follows his father’s style. <br /> <br /> The end is not surprising, it can be seen from the very beginning. <br /> Definitely NOT MANDATORY (3/10) <br /> <br />
