First, a little background; I am Englishman and lived all my life in London. I have been to many games at The Den and most other London clubs. I am familiar with the type of person who falls into hooliganism, and I know how they act and how they speak. I must say that this is a bad, bad film. I can tell you that Green Street is one of the most unreal films I've ever seen. I spent most of the movie cringing in embarrassment. I felt I had to write a mini review, because I felt that I needed to point out a few things. <br /> <br /> a) People just don’t talk in real life in London; filmmakers have gone too far for all slang and made it stupid. Unfortunately, hooligan types exist, but the ones that you see on Green Street are more like parodies. b) The actor who plays Pete Dunham (Charlie Hannama), unfortunately, sounded about the same as “Englishman” or “cockney” like Osama bin Laden. He is from the north in Newcastle, and I'm just amazed that any of the other actors could act right next to him - how we should take him seriously. Why they simply did not invite someone from East London to play this role, I cannot do it. I could take care of myself, hehe. c) Mr. Frodo. I mean, how can I take seriously Elijah Wood, who kicks ass to people who are twice his size and who are really nasty hooligans. He would be dead. Just like that. Honestly (as a British) it was difficult to watch this movie. I am sure that this film will be bombed here in the UK. It may be a little better in the states, because Americans simply don’t know (or don’t care) how inaccurate it is. <br /> <br /> Please, my American and foreign friends, do not believe a word of this nonsense. Yes, these firms exist, but they are all extremely clandestine and hidden, and on a much smaller scale. The film gets only 2 from me because they actually shot some of that in London. Usually they try to remove these things in Cardiff (Wales) or something like that and expect that we will not notice everything.
