I have to say that I was very curious to see this film, and it was considered a notorious disaster when it was released 20th Century Fox in 1970. He also appeared on several critics' lists of bad films, and this only heightened interest, since I just had to see what made this film so bad. After watching, I think I have the answers. Although I will say that it makes for a curious viewing, the action, the guide, and the script are so laughable that the intended satire is completely absent. Raquel Welch seems to be trying to carry the film, but after the introductory sequence of the sex reassignment operation, the film goes so far that she cannot cope with this task alone. John Houston in the role of Uncle Buck. A loner certainly will not help, as he licks and looks at the screen, he sometimes looks as if he himself wonders what he is doing there. Rex Reed jumps like Miron, Myra's alter ego, and even has his famous masturbation scene. Bravo for debut performances! Farrah Fawcett plays a dumb blonde; She, of course, seemed convincing in this role. But, of course, maybe the most famous role went to Mae West. The sight of a 75-year-old plastic-faced woman making sexual innuendos seemed more appropriate for a horror movie. I do not want to put it in place personally; but in this movie no one looks good. The direction seems so uncertain and non-existent that the film is not only bad, but also boring. Add some old shots from a movie about old stars, and the movie will become even more disconnected. To everyone who liked it, and I was glad that, at least, I saw it, but Myra Breckenridge seems like a catastrophe, which has always been considered to be from the very beginning.
