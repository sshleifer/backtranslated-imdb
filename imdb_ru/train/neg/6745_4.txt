This is a low-budget movie in the style of "Scream." “Maddy” is a new employee in a clearly unnamed office where she meets and begins a relationship with her colleague Chris. During a hot party, Chris and his friends convince Maddie that they belong to the Murder Club, where everyone kills someone for kicks. When Maddie loses him and kills someone for real, the hype begins. <br /> <br /> The film looks good, and for this genre and budget level there is everything you need (nudity, blood, maybe a few cameos from slightly larger stars) than the cast), but after the captions run out, you ask yourself why you spent 80 minutes of your life watching it.
