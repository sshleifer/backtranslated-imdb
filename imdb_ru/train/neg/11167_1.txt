Jack Black usually makes me laugh, just breathing, but in this movie ... <br /> <br /> In addition to direction, writing, lack of plot, constant robbery (which are constantly supported by direct camera shots) and .050 jokes, it was still a waste of time. The idea sounds promising, but the potential that was there is lost due to the complete absence of comedy and the worst direction I have seen in this part of the film. <br /> <br /> I kept hearing that this film is portrayed by Mexicans very negatively. Although this is no doubt true, I really do not think this film is intended for racism. I think this is more the result of a “creative” team, desperately trying to find something funny in this mess. You can almost hear them screaming from behind the camera: “Hey, look, this is an ugly Mexican! Laugh, people! Please for the love of all living things, LAUGHTER! ”<br /> <br /> But racist accusations aside. When you get down to it, it's anyone who has spent a lot of money and time to watch this pile of leftover roasted beans, which should be offended, IMO.
