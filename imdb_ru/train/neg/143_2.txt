In an attempt to reclaim the genre of a teenage slasher who was carried away by parodies such as Scary Movie and Shriek, if you know what I did last Friday of the 13th, Valentine fails. Why do people like Halloween? Because it was original, new and beyond all that has ever been done. Why do they love scream? Because at least it made sense. Valentine is just a stupid slasher who hardly has any blood. The plot is so similar to Halloween and Urban Legend that it is not funny. And the moment the killer appears on the screen, you know who it is, itâ€™s just sssssssssssooooooooooooo predictable. Genre of teenage slasher DEAD Overcome! <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10
