I watched this film on the grounds that Amber Benson flirts, and Nick Stahl is really cool - I thought that any film with the participation of two actors, which I love and respect, cannot be bad. And in this sense, I was right - given that they were given a painstaking dialogue, they both cope quite well. You see, it’s not good enough to stop the film from sucking, but it’s good enough for me to do this in more than 75 minutes of the movie (and this is the main sign of a horrible movie: when in 40 minutes you are already praying for it to end). <br /> <br /> It’s hard to figure out where to start with the problems in Taboo. The dialogue, as already mentioned, is terrible; wooden and completely unnatural. January Jones is incredibly bad, and since she is a character we spend most of the time following the house, this is an unforgivable flaw. The plot manages to be so confusing that it makes no sense, being at the same time so clichéed to be completely predictable (literally, none of the main “turns” in this film will surprise anyone except the baby). Leaving some interesting shots, the director tries too hard with very little success, awkward tracking shots and nervous camera work distract from that little element of the story. <br /> <br /> Three stars of this film were awarded for the fact that it contains Amber Benson, and the latter was thrown on the grounds that one of the jokes made me laugh a little. I would not recommend this film to anyone under any circumstances. Avoid at all costs.
