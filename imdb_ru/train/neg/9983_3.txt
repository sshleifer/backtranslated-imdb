This film is a massive yawn, proving that Americans have no farce. Even when it was already written for them! The original film "Hodet Over Vannet" is a witty comedy of mistakes, which I would rate 8/10. This is not only a linguistic translation, but some absurd chains of events are completely skipped, depriving the film of its original sly farcical nature and turning it into a cheap farce like "oh, here are my pants"
