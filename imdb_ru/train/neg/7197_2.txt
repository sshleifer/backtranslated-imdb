OK. I think the TV show is pretty cute and there is always some lesson in it. So when my children decided that they wanted to see this film, I decided to go together. I wish I stayed home and watched a TV show instead. <br /> <br /> The fact that the humor is stupid and unoriginal is the least of the problems of this film. The plot is almost non-existent, the characters seem to exist in a vacuum, and, worst of all, the Gadget does not carry any lesson. It seems that Disney took all the things that make the Gadget inspector work on television and threw them all. Honestly, my youngest child (8 years old) liked the film, but the older one (10 years old) left, thinking it was stupid (he was too old for a humorous humor, but too young for any adult humor). br /> <br /> As a rule, I like Disney movies, but this one misses a mile. This is normal for a very narrow age group (say, from 7 to 9), but this should skip all the rest.
