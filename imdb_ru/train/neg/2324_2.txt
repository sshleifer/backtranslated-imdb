I agree with the comments of other users that the two main roles were well played, being the guy who played the role of Gary Gillmore and Giovanni. Too bad the story was so boring. Not knowing about the story, I did not know anything about Gary Gillmore before the film, so I did not know what to expect. I thought it would be something like “The Walking Dead” or “Room,” but how wrong I was. The whole movie just spoke, talked about and talked about their mom and dad. The only cool scenes were the memories in which dad lost his temper. It was the only interest I got from this bite.
