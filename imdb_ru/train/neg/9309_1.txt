Hello everyone ... <br /> <br /> Thereâ€™s really nothing to say about this film. The main plot is that the guy (Brandon) takes a few friends on a trip to his cabin in the woods on weekends over the weekend from work. After I met the girl on the way there, everything became bad for everyone. <br /> <br /> One storyline (I think it was written by an actor playing the role of Brandon, although I may be mistaken here) is hardly unconvincing, and is accordingly played out. The Clown Killer himself is a rather sad excuse for a psychotic killer. Instead of being dark, mysterious, but, above all, an intelligent predator, we are instead offered a rather awkward, singing rhyme for children's singing, which seems to be experiencing a slight midlife crisis. The only thing that served as the basis for writing this comment was the sex scenes and everything that was in the film (the quality of the film led me to get some pleasure from such things). <br /> <br /> In short, this film falls below all possible established standards. Admittedly, I shared a few drinks with a close friend when I watched this, so we managed to put together some relative entertainment value from this film, and therefore it is fair to mention that S.I.C.K fell just out of two ratings. However, in reality (and with retrospectives) a one-star rating is more than a legitimate indicator for this film. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of ten.
