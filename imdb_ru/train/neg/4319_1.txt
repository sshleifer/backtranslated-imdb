Sorry, but I will ruin you both the storyline and the ending in the hope of avoiding the fiasco of the holiday, similar to the one that I now face. The father dies, and the mother asks Santa in a letter to return him to his family for Christmas ... and Santa does. Dad is cute, happy, healthy and totally unaware that he is dead. Everything ends in syrupy sweet. <br /> <br /> But as a parent who recently saw my five year old kid lose his best canine friend, it was a horror movie. Now my son is convinced that all he has to do to get his friend back is to ask Santa! Do not underestimate the will power of the young heart - no conviction will convince him that it was only a film and that his dog will NOT be back at Christmas. It was painful to look at his joy when I learned that on Christmas Eve he would have to relive his loss. <br /> <br /> Shame on everyone who recently lost a loved one. It is quite difficult to cope with the loss once for a child, but there are some wishes that we should not even present as an opportunity.
