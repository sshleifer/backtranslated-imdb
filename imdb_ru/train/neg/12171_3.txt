Being a slasher fan, I'm usually going to watch every slash film that goes through my retinas, which sometimes does more harm than good to my brain, I say. That evening when I was surfing the canal, Camp Sleepaway II met me by chance. Of course, I wanted to check it out, since I heard about the Sleepaway Camp franchise, but I have never seen one of them (unfortunately, I know). I note that, since I did not see the original, my criticism probably should not be taken too seriously, because perhaps what I consider wrong is completely intentional because of my own franchise design. <br /> <br /> I assume that the Sleepaway Camp franchise is in itself a joke. Hell, even the name itself sounds like a deliberate joke. Sleep in the camp? It's fun. I can appreciate the movie for simply wanting to collect something for pure camp horror, but that's all I can do. The acting in this film made the actors of the original Friday of the 13th look like the fish performing Macbeth. Campi requires a bad game, but come on. Pamela Springsteen, as an evil killer who had no connection with reality, coped with my work better than she killed the entire cast. As for the comedy, I laughed several times, but between them there was little and far. <br /> <br /> In the end, SAC II is pretty boring, and I really wanted to sleep in the camp. Deaths are so obviously staged and false that you can hardly appreciate them. If you need a comedy with a good movie, I recommend Club Dread. If your channel is viewing you, check and see what else is included.
