The question is, when someone sees such a bad film, it doesn't necessarily sound like this: “How did you get such a bad film?” Or even: “Why did I even see it terribly?” But “What did I learn from this experience?” That's what I learned: <br /> <br /> - Just because the “rules” of horror films were cataloged and ridiculed countless times in the past ten years, does not mean that someone will not go further and make a film that uses EVERYTHING of them, without the slightest humor or irony. <br /> <br /> - If your movie should be described as ** weak ** based on a video game, you have problems with the script. <br /> <br /> - a black character cannot always die first, but an Asian character always knows kung fu. <br /> <br /> - Although you can be proud of having figured out how to make the Matrix "affect the budget", this does not necessarily mean that you have to use it again and again to nausea. <br /> <br /> - Being a brother of Ron Howard does not guarantee the choice of roles. <br /> <br /> - When the scene is not edited together, just use the frames from the video game, no one will notice. <br /> <br /> - If your cousin's rap metal band suggests writing a theme for your movie for free, politely reject. <br /> <br /> - Zombie films are not about people who kill zombies. They are about zombies killing people, preferably in the most terrible way. This is what makes them scary. <br /> <br /> White people who can pay $ 1600 to get a rave deserve death. <br /> <br /> - If you find an old book, it will tell you everything you need to know. Anything else you will find in your two lines after someone asks: “What was it?” Or “Where are we?” <br /> <br /> - Naked breasts are not a panacea from horror films. <br /> <br /> - Shooting a helicopter and a licensed deal with Sega magically transform your film "student film" to "major studio release." Try it! <br /> <br /> - Just because you can name all three films of the Living Dead, it does not make you George Romero. Or even Paul US Anderson. <br /> <br /> I have seen the worst films, but only because I saw Mortal Kombat: Destruction.
