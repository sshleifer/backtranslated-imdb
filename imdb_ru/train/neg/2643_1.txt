This, for lack of a better term, is a lousy movie. Where to start ...... <br /> <br /> Cinemaphotography - This is probably the worst I've seen this year. It looked as if the camera was transmitted from the operator to the operator. Maybe they had only one camera. It gives you the feeling that you are a volleyball player. <br /> <br /> There are many episodic episodes added without any continuity. When they did the split screen, it was absurd. Everything was flat, it looked ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Color tones were far away. These people must learn to balance the camera. This "film" is poorly made and poorly made. <br /> <br /> Story - you must be joking. If I were an SS agent, I would sue the producers. looked like the Marx brothers with radio and weapons. Sutherland was in 24 mode - I see it for free. Eva Longoria would have been better with a bit less and more showing. As a thriller, she was not special. <br /> <br /> I did not see the real conspiracy, except that Douglas frightened the president’s wife. He never said why the mercenaries tried to kill the press. I simply do not see the President of the United States running for his life in the service tunnels of the building, like a rat in a maze. p-l-e-a-s-e. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is dead. This film is proof. I like the big screen. Since I was a child. There are many more such "films", and I will leave. What's the matter, Hollywood, who shot so many films, forgot how to make a real movie? If I owned a theater, I would start showing old films. The one in which there are real actors, good storylines and good cinematic shooting. <br /> <br /> This “movie” is a dog. Do not waste your time or money. I rate this movie as zero! Douglas is not suitable for this role. I can look at his age, but he just lacks that.
