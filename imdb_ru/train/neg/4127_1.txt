Such a bad film should be shot from all stores around the world. So full of boring, boring, unimaginable characters and with a lead character with such an annoying attitude and a dry voice, constantly giving a thoughtless voice for every action and feeling, this film is the record of the most complex film I've ever watched. Since I paid the money to own them, I felt the obligation to bring it to the end, and how sorry I am about it. My head ached everywhere because of horribly dull characters and their meaningless, less intriguing lives. A group of children who know nothing about everything are all frigid and, worst of all, they have a terrible dialogue, just thinking about how the main character tries to meet the girl. Bored, so much that my friend shook with hatred, and I flushed with embarrassment that I threw 6 pounds. The DVD was on eBay the next day, and I did not make much money back. Avoid the plague.
