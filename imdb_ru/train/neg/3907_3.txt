I am glad that I shot this film for one reason: because of its flaws, I wanted to read Allende’s book and get the full story. <br /> <br /> Pros: the film is beautiful, the period is depicted well and consistently (as far as I know), and Meryl and Glenn do a good job. <br /> <br /> Cons: this is the worst acting job I've ever seen in Jeremy Irons - I kept wondering if there was something wrong with his mouth. (And I hate horribly in English the way he says “Transito”.) Winona Ryder doesn’t make anything believable except to look young and idealistic. With most of the other speeches, everything is in order, but in the arcs of the characters and the development of relationships there is so little sticking together that I was disappointed and disgusted long before the end. <br /> <br /> I am very curious whether this film is typical for the work of Bill Augustus. I may have to lose a couple more bucks to get Smill in the sense of snow.
