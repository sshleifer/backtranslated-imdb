I thought the movie was good in parts. The start was exciting. The first 30 minutes of the film were good. The corners of the camera in the first 30 minutes were strange, and I did not like it, because they did not completely cover the actors. <br /> <br /> I think that the last 25 minutes of the film were not so good, from which we expect a lot in the case of such films. <br /> <br /> Dialogues did not make sense, and I do not think they were very clever. <br /> <br /> I felt that they were trying to copy films like a phone booth, in terms of dialogue, but failed miserably. It seemed that many scenes between the actors were placed for this and had no meaning for the story. <br /> <br /> The whole movie only shows the law and Kane. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t think it was a waste of time, this is normal movie, but not gr8
