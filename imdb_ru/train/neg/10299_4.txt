I have to admit that I did this, thinking that something was about to happen, except for the dead body in the first scenes ... and its deliverance from it. I was wrong. It was Bettyâ€™s cinematic peak, beating along the beach in the first part of Mordant Morven. I really don't care what young guys from Scotland are doing these days, who your screw is, what drugs they take. Visually, a walk along the Cabo de Gata in Andalusia was for me a pleasant and, of course, the highest point for me. Nadir was the store for her dead boyfriend. When the film came to an end, I had two thoughts ... 1. Is that all there is? 2. Now I understand why her boyfriend committed suicide. Rename it. "Naked boredom, or what I did during a trip to Spain." I'm such a sucker for sticking these things up
