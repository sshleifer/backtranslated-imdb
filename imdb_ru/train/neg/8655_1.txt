What a horrible movie. It sucks. It was terrible. I don't know what to say about this movie, but DinoCrap, which I stole from some reviewer with a nail in the ass AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sigh .. I hate not Roger Korman, this is a terrible movie. Well, really? But what can you expect from a movie with computer graphics Homoeric. What's different, the CGI sucked out loud; I really hate this movie. This is, without a doubt, Roger Corman's worst B-movie and probably the funniest B-movie too. This is --- DINOCRAP! Sorry, I must have offended some nerds in these moments. It's just a terrible movie ... 0/1000
