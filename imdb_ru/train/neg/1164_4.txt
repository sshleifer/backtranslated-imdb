I don’t know where to start, so I'll start with a fragment from the back of the cover of this film. "Alive combines the tension of Cuba Vincenzo Natalie with Kitamura's own version." I have not seen Versus, so I can't comment on this, but I think Cube was a great movie that I recommend to everyone. However, in this case, someone obviously confused the "tension" with the "boredom". <br /> <br /> I’ll just ruin the whole plot, because besides being one of the holy Swiss cheeses, he’s also moldy cheese, and the film isn’t worth wasting time even if you don’t know the plot beforehand, so this irrelevant. If I misunderstood the plot, don't hit me - perhaps because I had to try my best to keep my eyelids open. <br /> <br /> The US military in Nevada once lost a UFO in the Numbi desert. This obviously makes sense because they are both deserts, so they are practically in one place. Different continents or not. The monkey broke into a UFO and acquired an alien who was handed over to a Japanese explorer who had to eat the monkey in order to survive in the desert. No difference. The alien is now transmitted to anyone who is “bloodthirsty” enough to kill the current owner. The Japanese military want to use it for military purposes, so they decide to transfer it from the current owner (the daughter of the researcher) to another dude. But instead of simply choosing someone from the military, who is full of bloodthirsty and already on the side of the military, they decide that it probably would be nice to choose some kind of criminal from the death row. Oh, and the reason they choose this particular criminal from the death row is that he was the first person in history who did not die from non-lethal electric shock, which is the standard method of execution, because everyone dies from the placebo effect, when they are shocked, I don’t know if they will do it so that they can laugh in the staff room about how everyone dies, even if it is not fatal, or if they just want to reduce their electricity bill. <br /> <br /> Then the film turns into what the Matrix would be if it were really crap, and excessive fights bore us to tears for an hour. And wait, now they remember that they already had a dude infected by aliens, so the whole movie up to this point was actually a waste of time, as well as human lives. Then everyone dies. The end. <br /> <br /> The only moment in the film where I didn’t want to go to sleep or eat a sandwich instead was when the guy was pressed to the wall with a pipe over his chest and he was sticking out there and another dude was passing by. The dude hanging on the wall says: "It hurts me, shoot me." And a lively dude is looking at him, and this does not mean that he is an angry dude or something like that, so he really looks sad and does not want the guy on the wall to suffer. Therefore he shoots him. <br /> <br /> (Rhetorical pause.) <br /> <br /> In the stomach. "Gee, thank you so much."
