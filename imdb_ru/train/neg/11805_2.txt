See the original with the same name of 1944! This is made for a television movie, just awful! Although he uses (as far as I can tell) almost the same dialogue, he simply does not work! Is it an acting game, bad direction? So it's made for television, but why watch a bad copy when you can get an excellent original? Moreover, you will be spoiled by the plot and will not enjoy the original as much as if you were watching it first! <br /> <br /> There are several things that are different from the original (this time it is shorter), but for the worse! The actors playing the roles here simply do not meet all the requirements! You just do not believe them, and who can beat Edward G. Robinson's performance from the original? If you want, watch it only after you see the original, and even then you will be very brave if you look at it to the end! It's almost sacrilege!
