A student filmmaker hires a B-class actress (delightfully wondrous MOLLY RINGVALD!) To complete a horror movie her mother (terribly boring Kylie Minogue!) Tried to make 12 years ago. At the very least, this is a curious choice of plot, since any Australian horror fan knows that, unfortunately, the genre lacks female directors. There is a curse in the film because Molly had to kill some psychokiller on the original film set. But she came back because she needed exposure. Unfortunately, the curse is still there, and people are starting to die on the set. Cut is an Australian attempt by a modern "slasher", but unfortunately it does not bring anything new or exciting. In fact, it breaks half of Wes Craven's filmography of the 1990s. A lot of cinema roles in a la Creek (except for the fact that it is Australian - Jane Campion ... look how funny it is) and a lot of "is it real or is it the movie La New Nightmare." Editing is bad, the music is annoying, the effects are funny, almost everything is bad about it. Fortunately, the film may have a sense of humor: one day, a well-dressed girl from the film crew says to the owner of the house in which they shoot: “Do not worry, we will treat your house as if it were ours,“ to which it responds ” , it means nothing to me, you look like you live in a landfill! "Ha! And Molly's funny one-liners were enough not to regret renting it. "Do you have a diet cola here?" (when she goes to the professor's car) and "Does anyone know where I can buy tofu?" (the first thing she mumbles on the set) and "Where the hell is my agent?" (Oh wait, this is what I thought of her.)
