The “religious” of Bill Maher is not an attack on organized religion. This is an attack on Christianity and Islam. In addition to ridiculing a group of rabbis who invent distorted machines to circumvent the rules of the Sabbath, he really does not attack Judaism and looks furious when the rabbi actually challenges the existence of the State of Israel. If Bill Maher followed his hypothesis to its logical conclusion, he would understand that the very creation of Israel in the Palestinian territories is based on the so-called “sacred books” of organized religion. This indicates its complete and complete lack of objectivity or concentration on the creation of this film. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult for me to believe that this person is an atheist or even this whole intelligent person. Anyone can approach a religious person, laugh at him and call them stupid for their beliefs, but what can you offer them in return? Nowhere does he actually tell them why he thinks they are stupid. What makes him a "rational" person in the room? In a sense, this reflects what he really is not, and in the end he looks as stupid as these people. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good film / documentary about the real evils of religion and How religion can damage human civilization, see Richard Dawkins's Root of All Evil. This brilliantly researched documentary, clearly indicating what he hopes to achieve and how. <br /> <br /> Religulous Bill Maher is not funny, does not present interesting questions and does not give any insight into such a controversial subject. It seems that this is ranting and delirium of an old man, dissatisfied with his Catholic upbringing. I almost feel sorry for him.
