“Unheded” is one strange little film, a forgotten slasher from the golden age of the genre. It is difficult to really write a satisfactory review of this film simply because the film is so unique. The plot is rather exaggerated - three young women on the way to a rock concert have a car accident and find themselves in a difficult situation in the mansion of an eccentric old woman and her daughter-virgin. Very quickly, the ladies understand that something is wrong when they hear strange breathing and noises in the attic. In addition, mothers and daughters have a very, very strange relationship, as they strongly quarrel in front of their master at dinner. The old mother even goes so far as to call her daughter a whore and whore and accuses her of sneaking up at night to sleep with them. Halfway through the movie, when one girl finally decides that she would rather go looking for help, the murder begins. <br /> <br /> As for acting, this film is at the bottom of the barrel. None of the three girls can act, especially the “leading” girl. It’s almost incredible to hear them pronounce their lines in the same wooden tone throughout the film. Mother and daughter are better, but not by much. The film is also quite boring piece by piece and really, really, delays. The killings are terrible, but we haven't seen anything like this before. However, as mentioned here, the film really gets points with its brilliantly exhilarating and bloody ending. It comes entirely from left field and has the same shock value as the end of the classic camp "Sleep Camp". Unfortunately, the rest of the film is a bore and suffers from terrible acting and a boring, boring walk. An isolated, eerie-looking mansion and dark, dark lighting give the film grainy realism, but it quickly collapses when one of the characters tries to act. It may be worth it if you can hold out until the end, but I say that you had better just rewind for the last 10 minutes. 4 out of 10
