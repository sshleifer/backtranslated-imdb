Basically, take the concept of every Asian horror ghost movie and break it into one and you will get this movie. The story is this: a group of college students receive voice messages from their phones that predict their death. There are ghosts that if you saw some Asian ghost film are no longer scary. This film was rather distressing because it is very cliche. This is the same bull, another movie. <br /> <br /> The game was pretty good. Unfortunately, the actors are in a very difficult situation, so we have not seen anything like this in the past. Two major acts have done a solid job. <br /> <br /> As regards blood, little is happening here. We get a cool sequence that includes a hand that twists its head (I don’t know how else to explain it), but it was cut, so you don’t see anything but the final result. From time to time you see some blood, including decapitated hands and zombies (I would add that it looked very cool), but this film is not too bloody. <br /> <br /> Panic in the film are few and scattered. and it's really not that scary. From time to time you will receive several terrible images, but this is not enough for me to be considered scary. This is no different from Ringu, Ju-On or Dark Water, and none of them scared me. There is a flaw in this (and in most Asian horror films), which is that if it doesn’t cause panic, it’s not so good. <br /> <br /> As far as directing is concerned, Takashi Miike still did a good job. He seemed a little tamed in this film compared to his past films, but he still portrays most of his flawed style that he became famous for. Many of the images were similar in many ways to Miike (including a scene with a bunch of cans of dead fruit), and the last 15–20 minutes seemed much more to Miike than the rest of the film. However, the film has flaws because of its lack of originality. <br /> <br /> I would only recommend this to people who are very fond of Asian horror films (even if you, I would recommend them much better) or to big fans of Miike. A warning to those who want to get into Miika is NOT his best job. <br /> <br /> I give him 4 because it is just mediocre. Perhaps if it were released 4 or 5 years ago, it could be worth a higher rating. <br /> <br /> In addition, I would like to talk about Asian horror films very quickly. How did it happen if this is an Asian horror movie that is automatically considered good here (in the USA)? Many of these films in Japan are equivalent to the fact that Scream, Urban Legends and “I Know What You Did Last Summer” were here in the 90s. If you saw one, you saw them all. And many of these films rely too heavily on panic and imagery, so if they don’t deliver the panic they intended to do, they’re just not that good and nothing will change that. More Asian horror films should be more like “Listening” and “The Tale of Two Sisters,” two films that, if they don't scare you or don't scare you, at least they have great stories, acting, directing, cinematography and much more to support them, Two films that are not just great horror films, but great films in general. More Asian horror films should be similar to these, rather than cliches: “The ghost just needed to be found, so he began to kill people through their phone / video tape / home / electrical appliances / water pipes / Google search engine / vibrator / grocery” / so on .
