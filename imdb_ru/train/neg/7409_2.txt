There are some elements that save this film from a complete disaster, but are overshadowed by bad actions, plot holes, deus ex machina throws, silly dialogues, weak script and predictable cliches ... <br /> <br /> We have a horror movie with plot, which most of the time does not lead. A group of unlikely heroes, including the black guy who gets him first (yes, this cliche seems to be still very much alive even in Finland) seems to be having trouble trying to get out of the mysteriously empty hospital. There are piercing ghosts (very imaginative), zombies (at some point I thought they didn’t use zombies, but they came), and a Finnish glam rock band with demonic makeup that bothers them. There are also some scribbled time shifts, but this adds nothing to the storyline. The autistic girl and the tramp seem to have a deeper understanding of the situation, but they never tell it to the viewer or their bewildered friends. Their lines consist only of deep thoughts about the life lesson, such as: “What happens, happens ...” or “Light cannot live in darkness ...” or ominous “I need a red pencil ... red pencil”. Thus, all of these characters (including a worried father and a sweet doctor in distress) end up running through dark floors, away from demons or by mistake. Sometimes there is a ghost or a group of zombies, and if it seems that the demon keyboardist cannot notice a group of six people approaching him swinging a flashlight and talking, he simply pretends. And, obviously, this demon can break through the walls without much hassle, but opening the elevator door is beyond its scope. <br /> <br /> In the end, we even get the turn of the sequence “it was all a dream.” Or maybe it was not. Oh, man, I would like this movie to be, and a look that makes time move faster, so it all plays in just 10 minutes or so ...
