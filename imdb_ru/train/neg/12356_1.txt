Watching this movie was a waste of time. I wanted to leave in the middle of the movie, but I resisted. I don't know what Ridley Scott intended, but I learned that in the army, women become as stupid as men. They learn to spit, insult and fight in battle, and this is also a waste of time (in my opinion). And anyway, what the hell is this last scene in Libya? Are they still fighting Gaddafi, or is it easy for everyone to believe that Islamic people are always dangerous?
