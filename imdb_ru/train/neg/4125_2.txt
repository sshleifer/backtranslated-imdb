Holy crap! What a terrible, terrible Spanish thriller! I had it for about four years and finally started it another night. I watched an hour or so before going to bed. I was quite intrigued by all of this. I finished it last night and could not believe where I stopped it last night. I literally stopped him a second before the movie went down completely. <br /> <br /> As I said, I was very intrigued and interested in where the mystery was going, but I stopped it right when Simon received the package in the bar. I picked up the phone when he opened the package to find the laser gun, and then played a “menacing” game with a laser tag. Phew! Then the big discovery is that all of this is a terrorist plot with the role-playing game of nerds. Phew! You can say that the Spanish industry was definitely behind the director Mateo Hill (co-author of two big previous hits of Amenabar). Excellent rating and great photo. But this script smells stupid. The way someone has spent the last 40 minutes with an imperturbable face is beyond my power.
