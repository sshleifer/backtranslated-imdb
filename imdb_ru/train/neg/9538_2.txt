When I saw the commercial for this, I was all about to see it. Now, forgive me, but I saw it so long ago that I do not remember how it all went. Suffice it to say that the film that I saw had no resemblance to the “film” for which they sold me. <br /> <br /> I was bored, annoyed and incredibly disappointed with this film. And if it wasn't bad enough, they should have sunk it even further with this horrible reggae music. Not exactly tuned music for a horror movie, eh? I think if you have never seen an advertisement (or, I suppose, a trailer), you might think that this is some kind of hot stuff. For my money, advertising was much better.
