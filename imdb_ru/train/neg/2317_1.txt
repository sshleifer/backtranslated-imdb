The leadership clearly stated that the idea and the plot of this film are completely original ... however, as for those who read the comedian "slam dunk", we can clearly see that the characters are very similar and even some jokes ... <br /> br /> Another note - Jay Chou himself, NOT KNOWING Kung Fu, he just will not impress anyone if he tries to act as he can, many people today can see the differences ... Fortunately, the film does not contain a big part of the fighting for Kung Fu and a lot of things supported by stunning and visual effects ... <br /> <br /> I think the acting masters in Jay it is still hard to watch, especially when almost everyone else in the film much better. The only reason I think Jay is the main actor is simply his popularity. <br /> <br /> Despite how much I want to stop someone from watching this, so this “original” film will get something that shouldn’t. It has become one of the best budget films in China this year.
