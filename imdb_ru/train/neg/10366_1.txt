It was more than 80 minutes to half unexpected boredom. First, I was wondering how you can produce something like that. Then, having reached the 70th minute, I convinced myself that it was only a few minutes, and I lasted until the very end, which makes me proud, because I consider this film to be a great test of patience and tolerance for shit. Was it worth watching? Well, as I wrote above, if you want to test yourself, try it and if you are strong enough, you can hold out until the end ... The film lacks consistency, and the characters seem to have no common sense in everything. All the events in the film, you can be sure that you have seen it somewhere before, and they seem to be placed in this film just to fill out the film.
