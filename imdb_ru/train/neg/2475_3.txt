I was disappointed. the film was a bit predictable and did not fit the deception pasted all over the box. Having said that, the characters were well developed, the Vindego myth was used in a unique premise, and the house was rather creepy, but I just didnâ€™t have enough. I kept waiting for this big ahhhhh or boo! But that never happened. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film was plagued by poor filming of bad special effects. Thus, showing most of the bad stuff and not using the viewer's atmosphere and imagination to create horror and suspense. Try movies like Session 9 or Cube if you are looking for a low-budget but well-thought horror movie.
