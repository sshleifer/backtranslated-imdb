This woman, who works as an intern for a photographer, goes home and takes a bath, where she discovers this hole in the ceiling. Therefore, she learns that her neighbor above her is a photographer. This movie could have a great plot, but then the plot loses all hope. The problem with this film is that every ten seconds someone sniffs heroin. If they shoot scenes where someone sniffs heroin, then this will be a pretty good movie. Every time I thought a scene was going on somewhere, someone inhaled a white powder. It was very painful to have so much addiction in one movie. This attracted the attention of the main plot and a great story about the photographer. Lesbians didn't bother me. I was looking for a film about art. I found a movie about drug use.
