It was probably only my DVD - but I would not advise anyone to try to watch this image on a DVD. <br /> <br /> I had to increase the volume on the TV to the maximum possible level, in order to hear about 80 percent of the conversations. Some conversations were still invisible. If you are from Scotland, you may have a chance, albeit a small one. <br /> <br /> Folk voices drowned out almost all of the surrounding sounds, including package unfolding, footsteps, even puffing with a cigarette. <br /> <br /> By increasing the volume to a level at which voices can be heard, I can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will call the police when the scene changes to a noisy environment such as a disco, and that you will injure yourself by diving behind the remote to turn it off. <br /> <br /> There is art, and there is art, even in the field of sound mixing. But this effort during the war would meet international criteria that could be classified as an atrocity. <br /> <br /> About half an hour later I gave up, not seeing anything else that could be seen in the picture.
