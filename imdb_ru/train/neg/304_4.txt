In this film, Ruth is depicted as a woman drinking, gambling, overeating a sports figure with a small baseball. Baby Ruthâ€™s early life was quite interesting, and it was omitted for all purposes and goals in this film. In addition, Lou Gehrig was barely covered, and it was a well-known relationship, good or bad or indifferent, they should have been covered better than they were. His life was more than bad. He was an American hero, an icon by which many great baseball players became models of their lives. I feel that I am right in the memory of a great baseball player whom this film completely ignored. Shame on the creators of this film for benefiting from its mistakes, and not because of its greatness.
