There are so many comments on this film, but I found them to be misleading. This is an extremely used scenario when a normal person becomes an accomplice in a crime against a person of the opposite sex for no apparent reason. The guy meets the girl. A girl holds a boy at gunpoint for something funny. The boy is intrigued. <br /> <br /> You know the exercise: the antagonist turns out to be a wild, free spirit, not a sociopath ... Throw a few words of wisdom from Alice Drummond and you have a recipe for love. Sheedy's "is she crazy or does she just need a hug?" The role of The Breakfast Club just smells like a lead character. And all that remains is truly a horrible movie turkey.
