When Ben (Red Foxx) discovers that his wife Beatrice (Pearl Bailey) has run off with his own brother, he rushes to his son Norman (Michael Warren) to unravel his story about grief - only to find that Norman has a secret lover : Effeminate Garson (Dennis Dugan). Needless to say, Ben does not take it well, and numerous complications follow - including Ben’s attempt to force Norman to be homosexual, correcting him as a prostitute (Tammy Dobson). Unfortunately, this movie description sounds much more exciting than the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Originally written for theater by Ron Clarke and Sam Bobrick, NORMAN ... ARE YOU IT? there was an absolute catastrophe on the new york scene. To pay tribute to the play, I actually saw that it was staged in the 1970s as a theatrical production of the community - and although no one would blame her for being something other than a petty farce, the actors played so wide and in such a reckless manner that it turned out to be quite funny. It is a pity that the actors of this film did not do the same. <br /> <br /> This is a horrendously executed film. Red Foxx, one of the funniest 20th century comics, about as funny as yesterday’s wash, Michael Warren (who later appeared on the HILL STREET BLUES television series with a much better effect) competes with Foxx to find out who can give the worst performance, and Pearl Bailey is not far behind; In truth, only Dennis Duggan, Tammy Dobson and Wayland Flowers cameo sparks - and, unfortunately, this is only compared to the rest of the actors. <br /> <br /> Not only the film is poorly executed, it looks bad. According to historical films, this was the first attempt to remove a large screen in a videotape, which was then transferred to celluloid for the purposes of the project - and believe me, it shows. The film is like a bad comedy series from the 1970s, right down to the painted horizon visible through the windows of Norman and Garson’s apartment. <br /> <br /> Some movies are so bad that they become funny, but NORMAN ... THAT'S WHAT ARE YOU? not one of them. I can summarize my reaction to this film in two words: skip it. Do not buy it, do not rent it, do not touch it with a ten-foot pole. Just step back and run like hell. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, GFT, Amazon Browser
