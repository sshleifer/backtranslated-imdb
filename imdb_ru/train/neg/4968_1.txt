I was expecting a Grendel movie, a book written by John Gardner in the late 1970s. It was based on the epic of Beowulf, but is told from the point of view of the monster. <br /> <br /> Whatever you think about Gardner’s book, a film based on the epic of Beowulf should not be called “Grendel” when it says nothing more about a monster, except for a few pitiful scenes in which the monster KG displayed as nothing more than a modified Predator. <br /> <br /> In addition, the authors should also be punished for spoiling the original story and contributing to the continued growing ignorance of the mass television audience in the United States. <br /> <br /> Typical Hollywood to get it so wrong. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing and a complete waste of time.
