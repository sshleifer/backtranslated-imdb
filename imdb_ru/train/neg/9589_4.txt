This film is terrible, if you pay attention to it. This is the perfect movie, if you just watch how colorful pictures are dancing on the screen - each of them has no visible connection with the other. I rented this film because I'm a David Bowie fan, and I really appreciate musicals. In the end, Bowie starred in the film for a total of ten minutes, and the songs and dance episodes were rare and left much to be desired. The moral of this story was really stunning. I could not tell if it was about racial issues in London in the 1950s or not for a sale. In the first half of the film, I laughed at how stupid it was, but I liked the courtesy of the no-sell message. When they began to kill blacks, I thought that my record was spoiled. Maybe I rented half of two different films? No, there was a song and dance "Keep Britain White". Sorry, but you can’t write a musical about World War II. At least, not a musical that could be described as “marching,” as I wrote several times in this review. In general, I would say that this film could be much better if it decided and played the best actors. (And put David Bowie in it, damn it longer!) My rating is: C-
