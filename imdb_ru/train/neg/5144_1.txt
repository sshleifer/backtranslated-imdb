The orange tone for everything was just disgusting. Oh yes, the main character lives in the ghetto, which is all painted orange with people in orange tones. In the meantime, to mentally escape from this crushing poverty of the body, she plays a video game with complete immersion (which sucks that no rules are clear, and no logic follows the game process). She obviously makes money on the game, but it turned out that she is not an employee of the gaming company? Many silent pauses later the story stretches slowly. It uses a brilliant orange computer interface with a working interface that is so visually annoying, and I can only suspect about the future release of Microsoft. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, I, the viewer, ask mainly why she spends her precious time on some kind of retarded game when she barely has enough vital needs? Oh yeah, playing games is fun, but what's the point when you are almost starving? While she spends her life playing some lousy, even more orange, lame full-immersion video game, her dog runs away (probably looking for a host who gives her at least a minute of attention and regularly feeds her) or is stolen from a woman ( she ignores her lousy orange reality). <br /> <br /> In the meantime, she enjoys some kind of game in which her gaming team lost an entire uninteresting film. Yon Therefore, she wants to be the best of the best, go and bring them an ashtray (tired of all of us). God, this main character sucks as a person, and has no redemptive qualities other than her physical beauty (which she could somehow exchange to avoid her crushing poverty). <br /> <br /> So she reaches the “Real“ level ”and he, at least, does not suck, and she horribly goes to kill her former teammate, who is in a comatose state, mentally living on a“ real ”level. Finally, this boring, boring film with orange tones is no longer a tedious job to watch, but it can say something like “the main character has fallen into imaginary computer poverty, and now it’s actually in the real world” and will live in the real world now? Well, she kills the guy and he disappears in digital effect. That's it Yes! Thanks to the stupid director. idiotic idiotic film about vagrants with philosophical perversion. <br /> The director could say: "THIS WORLD exists, and if you live in it and contribute to its improvement, it will not be some kind of rough orange earth poverty. " A clever way to turn this crap film into a painfully slow lesson about basic civic pride (for 1% of viewers who did not find something really interesting to watch at the moment, or are film masochists). <br /> <br /> No, director. The director had to spoil everything by adding some clumsy digital effect and destroying all the chances of ransom for this terribly lousy film, which was a waste of money, a waste of time and a waste of the audience's trust. <br /> <After that, everything ends. Then piss off. I hope the director suffocates from this. I put this HACK on my "avoid at all cost" list for any other films to which his name is attached.
