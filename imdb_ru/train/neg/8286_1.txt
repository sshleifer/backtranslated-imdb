- = contains a spoiler of both the original and the film version = - <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of the musical Notre-Dame de Paris, I also read a book this summer and watched a movie today, in the beginning I was full of hopes of watching good film, especially when I saw 6.3 IMDb point. The first scenes were good, but I did wait, the stage in the theater was straight from the book, but it was normal, but when Esmeralda kisses the gringoire, I felt that something was wrong ... they didn’t even kiss in the book, even in the musical ... <br /> <br /> and there was a huge gap, why Esmeralda is judged by a sorcerer, in the book she teaches her goat how to react to the number of hours or write the word "feb" .. wait, there was no phoebe? in this film, he is nothing more than soldierly junk, the creators forced Quasimodo to show love, and they even canceled Frollo's love ... but Notre Dame was Frollo. his thoughts, his struggle between the love of God and the love of a man in the film, we cannot find anything like that, all that we have is some kind of villain who is really bad and kills people whose encounters with his thoughts ... and not to mention Phoebe, not to mention Frollo’s love, not mentioning Jehan (Frollo’s brother), not mentioning Esmeralda’s mother (maybe everything is alright, the storyline was very split), they didn’t even mention the real story ... ( one PS: Frollo was not an opus of dei or someone else a member of the cult, he is actually interested in alchemy, he is trying I make gold ... it is stuck in science and religion) <br /> <br /> Finally, do not watch this film, this is a kind of directorial edition of this masterpiece, and if you watched it before you read the book, be merciful God bless you, you must read the book immediately ... <br /> <br /> This film is worse than the hunchback of Notre Dame II, an animated film, spend time watching the musical Notre Dame de Paris .. enough is said ..
