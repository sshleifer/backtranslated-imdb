Jean Seberg did not have a drop in acting talent. Like all of her films, Bonjour tristesse does not suffer from her appearance (although she is perhaps the first of those modern women whom Tom Wolfe happily describes as "boys with breasts": publicists, of course, use the word "gamine") , but painfully suffers from Seberg's dull, monotonous, murderous voice. In all her films, when she needed to play anger, Seberg played it with coarse audible, distracting, gasping breath between her monotonously buzzing literature. Oy. <br /> <br / > Adapting Preminger to a humorous, fantastic blow Francoise Sagan's soap opera story is remarkable only for its magnificent cinematography - but at the same time it is difficult to frighten it on the photogenic French Riviera, and perhaps not innovative for its accuracy, the use of black and white for modern scenes, of which the monotonous story of Seberg brings us to the bright past of the color past. <br /> <br /> Juliet Greco has a short moment when the singer at a nightclub has a black and white spotlight, giving a smoky voice in a dietary style, dark existentialist lyrics. oh songs. This moment, in retrospect, is more than an insignificant troll. Except, of course, if you are French - especially if you are a "68th" Frenchman, eager for the glorious days of the barricades around the Sorbonne - and your children rebel in order to preserve the life-long sinecure that have clouded and exhausted France. Economics: then you still believe in Sartre and Foucault and all such mystical, irrelevant theorists. <br /> <br /> David Niven plays the most difficult role, he has with enough pleasure to play an aging hedonist who has not yet realized that life is not like that. T is all about Sagan's teenage notions of the hip, cool, cool, "mon copain!" Dad. Deborah Kerr demonstrates her usual professional presence by convincingly playing a woman who unfairly suffers from Seberg's angry teenage snotty jealousy (fulfilling Sagan's petty fantasy about the classic theme "there can be only one queen bee in a hive"); In fact, Kerr owned the only remarkable and memorable moment of this film on the screen. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is unnatural - I agree with an earlier reviewer, who said that it sounds like “poorly translated” from French; Combine unnatural scenarios with the incomparably dull, intolerable monotone of Seberg, and you can save this Valium for the next night. On top of that, the ineptly synchronized post-production of voice acting is almost obvious and, therefore, much more tedious: this is especially true with regard to rewriting for Milen Demonzho, because it spoils her otherwise very pleasant blunt performance of the blonde. <br /> Hunky Jeffrey Horn gets the short end of the stick here - a very good-looking young man who also suffered from a less handsome, non-cinematic voice, which, paired with Dr Seberg, leads to unconvincing puppy love scenes. (Horn was, let's say, just adequate at Bridge over the River Kwai, perhaps because his end was delayed by those great film professionals like William Holden and Jack Hawkins, instead of being supported unfortunately by the incompetent Seberg) . <Br /> <br /> In general, Bonjour tristesse is nice to watch, but this is a shallow, immature soap: fine porridge with foam.
