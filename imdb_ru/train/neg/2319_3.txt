A lot of stupid plot holes in the film. First we see him watching his master practicing kung fu, and dying in the midst of his practice. I'm not against. And then at the end of the film we see how he uses kung fu, which he learned just by watching his master when he was a kid. Is it even possible? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> This show is exclusively for fans of Jay Chou, and the film lacks depth in terms of character development, cinematography styles, and plotting. <br /> <br /> Has anyone noticed that the captain of the basketball team (forgot your name) and idolater Li Xiao look so much alike that you think this is one and the same person? Long hair, the look of a sunny boy, tall and strong. These two looked as if they had come from a mass production factory designed to produce products that make teenage girls scream wildly from an orgasm. Itâ€™s not that these two actors have anything of value to contribute to the cinema as a whole for the film industry. <br /> <br /> The jokes were inconclusive and not funny at all. <br /> <br /> The scene concerning four masters Jay Chow, returning to help him out on the basketball court, degenerated into a meaningless conspiracy when they began to beat their opponents in the style of Royal Rumble. Worst of all, when 4 masters won the fight, the crowd began to cheer, and the match continued. Was it really WTF? moment. <br /> <br /> At the end of the show, when they win the match, all thanks to Jay Zhou's excellent kung fu skills. How he acquired these kung-fu skills remains a mystery, because the show somehow shows that he is acquiring skills just by watching his master. <br /> <br /> And then his long-lost father leaves the woodworking job to recognize Jay. Chow, like his long-lost son, seemed just too fast a director to finish the film. <br /> <br /> In short, this is Jay Chou's film (instead of the usual "chick"). Watch it only if Jay Chou is your fan. If you are one of those whose tastes in films are very similar to those that are on the list of the top 250 IMDb films of all time, then this film is not for you.
