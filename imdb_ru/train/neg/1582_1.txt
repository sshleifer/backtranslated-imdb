Argh! this film hurts my head and not in a good way. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just my growing hatred for the action movie genre, but even when I was a kid, when I swallowed jokes like Seals, I still viewed this film with dislike. now i totally despise him. <br /> <br /> Take one pretty good fast-paced story. keep the name and throw away everything else. instead, use some of the future gladiators' misunderstood storyline, which is so full of plot that all things are in danger of destruction (why is there a rebel base in the center of the arena, what about cameras? Why are there clear pictures of what actually happened in bakers? an unguarded room?) <br /> <br /> the whole film screams of the eighties, from a terrible terrible score to silly shiny costumes. ugh. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. I know that some liked it, but some liked it when they drenched me, and I do not understand them either.
