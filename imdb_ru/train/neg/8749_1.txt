A terrible movie, as everyone said. What made me laugh was the appearance of Scott McNealy's cameo, presenting an award to one of the killed programmers in front of a wall of SUN logos. McNeely is the CEO of SUN Microsystem, a company that practically defines itself by its hatred of Microsoft. They played an important role in filing antitrust complaints against Microsoft. So, were they stupid enough to think that this bad film added fuel to the fire? <br /> <br /> I don’t see a public record of SUN’s participation, but it’s clear that the creators of this film know Scott McNealy. Interesting mystery
