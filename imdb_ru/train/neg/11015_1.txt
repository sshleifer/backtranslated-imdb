I foolishly read the DVD cover of this movie at Best Buy about a year ago and said to myself: “It seems ridiculous, plus he has Michael Clark Duncan, how can I lose!” I paid $ 15.99 plus tax for it. I took it to a friend’s house, and we were both stunned by how badly it was written and acted. Wooden performances are abundant. All the promised "funny" and "outstanding" performances never appeared. After 90 minutes, I shyly lowered my head, knowing that I could never return the 90 minutes or $ 15.99. I literally almost cried too, because if it were something that could be considered a “comedy,” I no longer wanted to believe in a movie. My friend and I constantly informed our friend about the horror of this film to the extent that he needed to watch it, just to see how bad it was. In the holiday season of this year, I watched him with him, because he did not want to watch it alone. This was my next terrible mistake, because when I watched, I just got angry. I started screaming for a movie, and I'm not one of those talking to a movie. Everyone I know, even caught a glimpse of this film, agreed that it was the worst thing they had ever seen. My sense of humor is sick and distorted and often offends my friends, but even this film could not save it. The fact that this film is not on the top 100 list on IMDb is amazing. The fact that his rating (at the time of this writing) is 3.6 is a crime against humanity.
