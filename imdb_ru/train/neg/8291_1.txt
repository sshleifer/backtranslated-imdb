The idiot dentist finds out that his wife was unfaithful. So there are no new storylines here. However, the authors managed to create a stupid, disgusting film. If you like to watch the vomiting of children or to see how the dentist imagines that he pulls out all the teeth of his wife in bloody horror, watch a movie (or remove it). If not, go to something else (MY FAIR, anyone?)
