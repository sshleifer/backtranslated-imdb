For the fan series, I have to admit that the Hidden Frontier is not so bad at all. But reviewing this series cannot be based on whether it is a fan series or not. The initiative itself is commendable. Creativity too. I believe that these are people with regular work and very enthusiastic about Star Trek. But by doing all this work. Pulling all these resources. Taking all this time, and still all those flaws. <br /> <br /> First of all the action, and the lines are terrible. For most. Dialogues belong to the military show of the 70s, not Star Trek. The captain (Mr. Skvinti) looks as if he is going to burst out laughing at any time. And most characters just read their lines. Directors must be aware of the fact that the word “retake” is not just a word in a dictionary. But I also assume that the series is made in the style of “Two Frakes Takes”, which has shot many TNG episodes and films. In addition, I could not help but think that most of the actors are typical tracks. Without going into this assumption. <br /> <br /> What concerns me most about the quality of the project. When they first decided to spend so much time and resources on this series - why did they not make it available in decent quality? Using a fast low-resolution time format is a waste of talent. Even "higher" episodes are considered to be of poor quality compared to the standard quality series released in. Using a high resolution Xvid codec and file size would greatly improve perception. If the problem was in a group with problems, the creation of a torrent tracker would solve it. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, the team will decide to refresh the series and possibly release it on DVD, giving it the quality of the project it deserves.
