Spike Lee should be one of the top rated directors I've ever seen. He is a dear critic, because he allegedly makes films with a “message”, or he is so bohemian in his approach that he forces critics who are filled with water from the formulas of Hollywood films to eat his stuff just because they are different. <br /> <br /> Summer Of Sam doesn't even do it well. The style of cinematography and editing - Oliver Stone, as the story. The plot is very similar to "Do it right." Image of "Guidos" or Italian Americans PC set (of which I am one of them) directly from Eddie Murphy's Raw. Only Eddie Murphy's impression that a macho Italian begins a fight with a taller African American is MUCH more believable than the cartoony, wide Italian cartoons shown here (John Leguizamo's character is a possible exception). Has anyone seen this movie been able to figure out how it will end? As soon as Richie appeared in the film, I could already see the fist on his face and foot in the stomach, I had already seen him being charged with murder. This character has the most integrity in the entire film, so of course Lee is going to show what happens to people who stand out in the crowd (what a bearded click!) <br /> <br /> Anyone please, please give Spike Lee lifelong pass on all the basketball games he wants. So, maybe he will be too pleased to take a film camera for a long time, and we will not have to undergo his self-confident fuss, and besides, I will not have to see critics (some of whom I respect) the emperor ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
