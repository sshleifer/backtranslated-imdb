Pretty average fantastic movie. The plot was more or less obvious from the start. Despite the fact that the acting was quite good, the script seemed very cocky, using ideas taken from numerous films. <br /> <br /> Main story: scientists working on a research platform in deep space save a fighter from a collision with a red dwarf that they were in orbit. On board, they find a stasis pod that fails at that very moment. After 2 or 3 minutes, when the person in the capsule wakes up, you realize that he is a complete lunatic. Something that completely eludes the crew of 3 people on a research ship ... <br /> <br /> After that, it becomes a breakdown of any other film in which a psychotic insane person terrorizes innocent victims. Overall, I think Speed ​​2 was the best research. from the subject, which I also do not consider a good film. <br /> <br /> Not a very good movie, output the aliens and watch them again. <br /> <br />
