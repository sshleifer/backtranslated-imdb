Who was George S. Scott? George S. Scott was a famous actor. Virtually any film in which he starred is better for this. Now Olge had absolutely NOTHING in common with this film ... but once he said something that describes the said T film. <br /> <br /> I don’t remember his exact words, but he basically said that a great work can save bad deeds, but a great work cannot save bad deeds. This little observation has never been more truthful than in “All the New Adventures of Laurel and Hardy: For Love or Mom.” <br /> <br /> Making two leashes was absolutely perfect. Bronson Pinchot (Laurel) and Gailard Sartain (Hardy) not only look at the details, but also do an excellent job with the task, imitating the real deal (manners and all that). This film should be a permanent testimony of their talents. However, this film does not make sense when it comes (you guessed it) LETTER. <br /> <br /> In addition to the initial dialogue between Pinchot and Sartain (who was very “in character”) and a brief dagger related to a taxi, this film is a difficult routine. <br /> <br /> PROBLEM # 1: too much time and effort was spent on the plot. <br /> <br /> I don’t want to know why Mom wants to kidnap a pretty British girl. What I want is to see Stan and Ollie (or at least their assistants). Too much screen time was devoted to explaining the plot or to the not very funny secondary characters who said that the plot revolved around. <br /> <br /> However, even if this film were jokes, it would still leave us with ... <br /> <br /> ... PROBLEM No. 2: Most of the jokes are what I would call a "diluted" farce. <br /> <br /> What do I mean by “diluting with water”? <br /> <br /> In a farce, a character gets an exaggerated wound for a comedic effect (for example, Looney Tunes, 3 Stooges ... or what about Laurel and Hardy?). <br /> <br /> In the “dilapidated” farce (as I define it), the character receives minor injuries or inconveniences, and the filmmakers play it out for a comedic effect. <br /> <br /> The following illustration might help: <br /> <br /> In Looney Tunes, Duffy Duck was shot by Elmer Fudd. His bill falls, and he puts it back. This is a classic farce. <br /> <br /> In this “pearl” Ollie accidentally bumps into some people. They turn around, tell him to be careful and continue their cheerful journey. This is not a farce. This is not even funny. It's just ... boring ... and this film is full of such jokes. As if they were the bread and butter of this film. Writers and directors just take these boring moments and act as if they should be funny. Of course, the example that I just gave is the most extreme case, but I can only weaken it a little. <br /> <br /> In short: the film simply does not work, because the script is not able to benefit from Pinshot. and Sartain’s ability to impersonate Stan and Ollie. Instead, the script benefits from the exposure of the plot and the slop jokes. Watching this movie is basically watching two great imitators who were not given any real material to work with. <br /> <br /> Not a good movie, but incredible help for sleep. <br /> <br /> I say give it one mistake and stick to the real deal (just as long as you stay away from Atoll K and Be Big).
