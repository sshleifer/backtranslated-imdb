I noticed that the previous reviewer (who seems to be still in school) gave this film a very good review, and I can only assume that it was because the reviewer did not see the much-better 1989 BBC adaptation of this classic novel. The main problem I encountered in this (1999) version was the casting of Anthony Way in the role of Tom Long. Anthony Way was a talented high-frequency boy who became famous after appearing in the television mini-series "Chorus." I can only assume that he was cast for the role of Tom Long due to his excellent acting skills in Choir. Unfortunately, the little boy who appeared in Choir, at the time of the filming of Tom's Midnight Garden, turned into a tall youthful youth, and therefore Anthony cannot be persuaded as a schoolboy Tom. It is too far away to believe that Tom (as Anthony) will make friends with the much younger Hattie. In the 1989 BBC version, Tom and Hattie are much closer in age, and the development of their friendship is much more believable. For the 1999 film, even the special effects do not convince and are not a noticeable improvement in the television effects of 1989. Actors and actors of this version are inferior to earlier adaptation, and in general the film was a lack of a glossy version of the real classics. As a final note, I would like to point out that the BBC VHS 1989 version costs over £ 20.00, while a new DVD of this version can be bought for less than £ 5.00. Should I say more?
