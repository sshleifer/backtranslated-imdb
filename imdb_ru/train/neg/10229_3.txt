I base it on my observations of one episode that I saw last night (09/27/06). I do not think I will look again. The action was completely wooden, the plot was completely predictable, the ending was completely unrealistic - I mean, who would believe in a $ 30 million judgment for the death of a recovering addict with incurable cancer? The lead actor (Victor Garber) seemed so uncomfortable, almost embarrassed in his role - perhaps he realized how bad it was written !! I fully understand that the drama proposed this season is rather poor, but they can certainly find the best authors. Maybe they are sending a letter to India or China !! I bet we won't see it next season!
