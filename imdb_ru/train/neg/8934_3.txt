I bought this DVD without any prior reference other than the names of John Houston, Raquel Welch, Mae West and Farrah Fawcett on the cover. I found the Brazilian name very strange, but I decided to watch, expecting to see a funny comedy, for example, “Switch”. However, a meaningless story is terrible and difficult to describe. Miron Breckinridge (Rex Reed) is undergoing a sex change operation in Copenhagen, and he returns to Hollywood, telling her that she must be Mira Breckinridge (Raquel Welch) and demanding half of her uncle Buck Loner's property (John Houston). During the day, Myra and her alter ego Miron corrupt a young couple in the academy of her uncle with the help of strange sex. At some point, the dirty script is so confused that I believe that this whole story was only a journey of Myron's mind, caused by an accident. Unfortunately, the beauties Raquel Welch and Farrah Fawcett are not enough to keep this film. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Homem & Mulher Até Certo Ponto" ("Man and woman until a certain moment")
