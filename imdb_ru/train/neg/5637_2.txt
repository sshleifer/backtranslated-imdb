I understand that I want to make a film that is sharp and different. I understand the reviewer's previous comments that this is a misunderstood film. My point is that as soon as this movie ended, my first comment was: “This is what happens when a rich princess wants to become a movie star and has no talent” ..... she uses dad's money to make a movie which she wrote, directs and pays for ..... obviously, to get closer to the film, to understand that there was no character development and no directions, such as the beginning, middle and end ..... some of the voyeurist was good and acute, but what was the point? I saw women go to the house, find some photos, screw the caretaker, go outside on a very cold night (implausible) to check the noise and run around their caretaker lover ... the film ends ..... someone brings my ignorant arss ?? I really want to know what the matter is ... what was the vision of the directors ..... why is there no development of a dead lover? Why is there no information about the caretaker? What is the point of night vision? What is the point of lipstick on the car? Why a dead caretaker? Why do we need to talk about the escaped mental patient / peeping volume? What's with the urn? Oh, and the lamp is what should mean, whose house is it? Territorial? What for? Why does the caretaker feel that this is his home? this aspect was never pursued ...... as far as William Defoe is concerned ... I made this film because he was in it and is known for its sharp characters ..... write me back and tell me what I need explore ... ..I'm just a mom in middle America who loves movies .... Chris ....
