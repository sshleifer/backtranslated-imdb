Hanna-Barbera sucks the life out of another famous property. The violence is softened, the plots are formal, the animation is bad, the music is disgusting and repetitive, and, to be honest, the show is simply not funny. <br /> <br /> At that time, HB put all of his series on the same cliches, regardless of whether it fits the cartoon world or not. Thus, Popeye and Bluto appear in the repeating segment as cavemen (“Hey! Popeye is popular, and Flinstones are popular. Put them together and you can't miss!”). In addition, Olive Oil and Guna have a regular segment in which they appear as army recruits in the apparent robbery of "Private Benjamin". Seriously! What for? <br /> <br /> Announcements of public service are added to the annoyance factor in each episode (standard practice for cartoons, but still annoying). Popeye lectures his nephews on the safe passage of the street, recycling waste, and are you ready for this? - danger of smoking! (I swear I don’t think it out.) <br /> <br /> The only charm left from the original cartoons is that Jack Mercer, Papaya’s voice from the first days, continues his role here. <Br /> <br /> Worth checking once to get a new estimate of old Fleischer shorts. Otherwise, avoid at all costs.
