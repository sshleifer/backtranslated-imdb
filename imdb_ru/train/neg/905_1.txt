An unmarried woman named Stella (Bette Midler) became pregnant by a rich man (Stephen Collins). He offers to marry her out of a sense of duty, but she refuses it and decides to raise the child on her own. Everything goes well until a child named Jenny (Trini Alvarado) becomes a teenager, and gradually (and predictably) everything gets worse. <br /> <br /> I saw both the silent version and the sound version of the Stella Dallas. None of them had a strong influence on me (and I cry easily), but they were well made if dated. Attempting to do it in 1990 was just a stupid idea. I think Midler had enough power after the unspeakable success of “Beaches” to do this. This (as expected) was bombed. The story is funny and dated by today's standards. Despite the fact that Midler and Alvarado give good performances, this film is really addictive, and I was bored to the end. Stephen Collins and Marsha Mason (both good actors) do not help in the roles. Flimsy and boring. Really - who thought it would work? See the 1937 Stanwyck Version instead. I give it 1.
