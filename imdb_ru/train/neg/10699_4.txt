Yes, I sat out all this, God knows why. <br /> <br /> It was a long day, I had nothing to do, it was very cold outside, well, these are all unconvincing excuses, but they are the only ones I have. <br /> <br /> I gave The Darkling 4 stars out of a possible 10 - I have seen the worst films, but this one is definitely right there in the old bin with a bad film - a bad script, a bad game, poor lighting and silly special effects . <br /> <br /> The storyline, which never makes any sense, revolves around this simple little family, daddy, mommy and little girl - which I assume is believed that the viewer “identifies himself”, all three were tiresome and annoying . You just want the dark side to get each of them. <br /> <br /> Dad is a cook whose hobby is cars. Dad meets a rich man named Rubin, who collects cars and who has a creature that he acquired in the "mysterious" East. Ruby keeps him in a bird cage and calls him "Dark." <br /> <br /> During the film, Darkling is explained as 3 or 4 different things: the shadow without a person, the inner darkness that exists in all of us, and the devil. So choose which of these explanations suits you - because, believe me, it doesn’t matter. <br /> <br /> Darkling’s main problem seems to be that he longs for a companion — a companion gets him — and then eventually becomes dissatisfied with the person. This, of course, leads to tremendous wealth, followed by a catastrophe, for a person who is associated with The Darkling. <br /> <br /> And for everyone else, it just leads to a very long, tedious movie. <br /> <br />
