Stranger Jack (Matthew Lillard) arrives at the shop of the fraudster Max (Vincent D'Onofrio) and tells his ambitious companion and poison specialist Jamie (Valeria Golino) that he is Jack's brother. Jamie does not buy his story, dominates Jack and ties him to a chair. When Max arrives, Jack offers $ 100,000 each to defend him in the Spanish Judges antiques negotiations with a rich and dangerous collector. Max invites his stupid friend Piska (Mark Boone Junior), who comes with his backward girlfriend, who believes that she is from Mars, to make a backup team. However, Jack crosses the collector twice, and then intrigues Jack, Jamie and Pais. <br /> <br /> Low-cost “Spanish Judges” is a film with a reasonable script, with a terrible conclusion that a good cast plays. Valeria Golino is amazingly beautiful, but together with good actor Vincent D'Onofrio they cannot save a stupid story. In addition, scenes that should be funny, unfortunately, do not work, and in fact they are stupid and not funny. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Tudo Por Dinheiro” (“All for the money”)
