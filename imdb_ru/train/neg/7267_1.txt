This film is just too long, too repetitive, with a male nude and sexy (as they say, gay with my own collection of films for adults), too useless and unnecessary. Most of the first third of the film may have been reduced to ten minutes and was equally effective without the patience (and endurance) of the audience. <br /> <br /> I saw this film early on a Saturday afternoon with a film festival audience; a type of crowd that tends to be more adventurous, interested in more experimental or atypical films, such as one without much dialogue, shorts, foreign films. The crowd, which almost sold out at about 275 seats in the cinema, began to drip in the first half of the film, and while the overwhelming majority remained for "payback" (which was never achieved), I have never, in about 14 years, visited any number of film festivals, experimental , funny and others, saw how so many people left the movie. <br /> <br /> This film could easily be cut in more than half and made as efficiently as before. He could also go in different directions, still with a shorter opening time, and would be much more efficient. <br /> <br /> Since it currently exists, itâ€™s not something that you can readily recommend, or the one I would like to have. desire to look again.
