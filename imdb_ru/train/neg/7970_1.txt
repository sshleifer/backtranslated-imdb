Do you want to spend almost 2 hours of your life watching, it depends on how much you like your horror movies. If you like them so much, damn it, they are hysterical, beware. Jigsaw is undoubtedly the worst film I've ever seen in my life (and I have seen Long Time Dead), and I say this as a fan of the low-budget horror / bloody film genre and have seen quite a few good films. compare it with. I will not even go into the details of what makes this film bad, and the only thing that is good about it is that it is so terrible that it is one of the funniest things I've seen in recent years. If you can find it to rent cheap, it is definitely worth seeing if you were involved in it - shame on you. : o) IMDb need to enter a rating of 0/10 specifically for this film, it deserves it.
