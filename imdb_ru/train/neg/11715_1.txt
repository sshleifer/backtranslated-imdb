haha You should just smile and smile if you have really gone through this entire movie. I think it speaks of itself. The film itself was created, I think, as a kind of psychological test or as a drug to take you to a place where you have never been. When Wittgenstein wrote his famous first philosophical article, a treatise (sp?), He said it was meaningless and useless, but if you read it when you finish, it will take you to a new level, like a ladder, and then you can throw away the work and See things with clarity and true understanding. I think this movie is the same. <br /> <br /> Like the film, it is without a doubt the worst film I have seen in such a unique way in a long time. First of all, they are snipers. I loved to watch this guy kick ass in different movies. and I experienced some weak ones. however, although you know that a movie can be a shit, you never suspect that it can be as bad as it really is. what is the most interesting. I mean, these are snipers. You know, it might be good, but everything will be fine, right? smile. <br /> <br /> So at every level it’s pure boredom, pure non-originality. The reference to the professional is dead and obvious, but done so badly that it seems ridiculous. There is not a single interesting character in this movie, at least. and to make it all more surreal, they have a soundtrack that sounds like parts to various Bourne type films, but not quite right. in fact, although it seems that it is close to the background music of action films, it just happens that it is done in such a way that it has hurt you fantastically. <br /> <br /> then all the scenes are in full black, to be honest, since the characters are so flat, you don’t care what happens, but no matter when it happens and someone is killed, you just say to yourself Should I have seen this? something else? What about scenes with dazzling, unpleasant blinking at a speed of stroboscopic lights, for a period of time that is too long to bear. of course let's add it. how about this though. when you tense up and your eyes can no longer handle it, do something else in the dark murders where you really don't see what happened. and on top of that, let's face it, you don't care. From the very beginning you were bored. <br /> <br /> I fussed a couple of times, but almost the whole movie I caught. and it becomes something that you can observe, without something that affects your mind at any level, therefore, it becomes something that you can effectively distribute and start thinking about your life, where it moves, where she was, who we are people. <br /> <br /> and this ... this is the real magic of this film.
