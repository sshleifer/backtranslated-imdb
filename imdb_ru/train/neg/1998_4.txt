My roommate got the no-no, Nanette movie soundtrack like a dub on tape, and she started listening to it without a break. After I was finally brainwashed, I found that the songs are irresistible, especially famous, I want to be happy, but I can't be happy ... But, roughly speaking, from the soundtrack, I had no idea what the movie was about . Therefore, the other day I saw a copy of it in a video store and filmed what was supposed to be a long-lost version of the film. I thought it would be amazing, because the soundtrack is so cute. Unfortunately, most of the songs I loved were not seen anywhere in the video I saw. Now I have never seen the 1930 version of the musical, but this version was sadly disappointing because there was very little singing and there was almost no dancing, except that the sound was really bad and you could not understand what people were saying. a lot of time In fact, the only high points of this film were the outrageous fashions of the 1940s. Nanette wears this crazy hat with two feathers that stick out like rabbit ears, and Kansas Kitty has this weird feather sleeve she holds on her forearm and then turns into this clean scarf. One dance sequence is also a bit strange, because Nanette makes this strange ballet film with a picture of a pin-up girl superimposed on top of her. In fact, another bright spot of the film was the artist Gillesp, who dreams of becoming a great artist, but now he is doomed to draw charming girls for money. I love how Gillesp√© saves his old school, and he misses Nanette when his masterpiece, which was supposed to make his career, was sold to Nanette for a meager amount of $ 5250. Doesn't she understand that this piece was his immortality? Stupid bunny / girl with bunny ears feathers on your hat. When will you learn? Why doesn't he just light a cigarette before the advertisers take the Work?
