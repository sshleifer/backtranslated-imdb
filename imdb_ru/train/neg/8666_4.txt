This TV thriller is all talk, a little action. He is working hard to create his convoluted plot, but the writing is so complicated that the exposure is still muddy at best. By the end, I knew no more about these characters than at the beginning. He has a quasi-script "Ten Little Indians," but he halfway cuts him off in favor of lighting Sally Field and uncovering the killer. The field replays here with grace that I rarely saw from her. Early introductions are good, but the letter quickly deviates from the course and ultimately goes beyond. Lots of hysteria, constant thunder and lightning strikes (which adds nothing). Curious failure from producers Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg. With all this talent, could they give us something more than a script full of red herrings and Sally Field hiding in the closet?
