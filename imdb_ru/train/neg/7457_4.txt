Chris Kattan is a gorgeous sketch actor on Saturday Night Live ... but he probably should leave the film industry alone if he doesn't get some creative control. He plays an annoyingly vigorous character who basically looks a little backward and fast. Want to know only the funny parts? The material that they showed in the preview. Yes, his perception of me is ridiculous. There is nothing else. ESPECIALLY, when you can say that he is trying very hard to be a physical comedian, to which he does not need to try, because he is alone. And yet, his "destruction of the veterinarian's office" seems awfully bad. This movie made me flinch. Avoid this at all costs and keep watching SNL.
