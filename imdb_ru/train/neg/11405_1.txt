I had to watch it at school. And to summarize the results ... <br /> <br /> Talentless actors, inept script and inept director. <br /> <br /> This film is a waste of time. Don't even watch a movie. Do not worry. You will be so disappointed. My teacher said it should be good. How wrong she was. She even slept a little. The actors of the film were just bad. The best actor there was an old man, and that says little. He has a terrible story with horrible characters. So unreal, and I can honestly say that it makes no sense. The script was unemotional and confusing. There were moments in the film when I frowned and said: “What?”. There were also too many loose connections and conspiracy holes. It was just awful.
