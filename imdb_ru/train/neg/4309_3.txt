The high school director (Keenan Wynn) with a losing basketball team involuntarily hires a coach who is not only a gorgeous blond woman (Cathy Lee Crosby), but also a catalyst for their new ways of winning. Are you really surprised? Along the way, there is a growing romance between coach and star player Jack (Michael Bean). Police are never notified. <br /> <br /> Packaged with other Crown International Pictures, like a Greenhouse film, this film is actually useless. This can be easily edited in the television film of the week. Katy Lee Crosby looks great as Randy Rawlings coach, especially in her scanty outfits, but I was expecting more than just a sensation from a movie rated R. - Former NBA player, Sidney Weeks, is the real reason for the new success of the team, not Katie Leeâ€™s coaching job. Too much teasing and not dirty enough makes it a big disappointment.
