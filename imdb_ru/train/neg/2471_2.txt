I remember when I was little, when I was in camp, and we were going to camp under the stars. There was always someone who would have a good story telling about the forests that surrounded us, and they always scared me. Well, when I found Wendigo in the library, I checked it out in the hope of becoming one of those films that had a supernatural creature stalking people in the forest, very much like the stories told in the camp. Well, to my horror, I was so far from the truth. Wendigo is really bad. The story begins with the fact that a family of three goes to their winter hut, which looks like your usual country house and is not at all like a hut in the forest, and they encounter a deer. Well, it seems the local villagers really hunted for this particular deer and are very upset about our urban people. The film spends too much time keeping an eye on the daily affairs of families, instead of understanding the essence of the film. Only in the last 15 minutes we actually had some kind of action with the participation of "Wendigo". I suggest that you stay very far away from this film. It will keep you waiting an hour and a half ago.
