Ah, Bait. How do i hate you Let me count the ways. 1. You are trying to be funny, but trite and unpleasant; every joke is predictable and expected, and when it comes, it does not cause laughter. Instead, I want to quit. 2. You are trying to be dramatic, but incredible; the woman overdid it to a terrible degree, and the "bad guy" looked like Bill Gates, and about as scary as ... well, Bill Gates. (Just try to imagine that Bill Gates is trying to intimidate someone with a gun. Doesn't work, does he? Lawyer, maybe, but not a gun. Not suitable.) As for Jamie Foxx, well, just watch how he tries to deliver dramatic and sincere dialogue is ridiculous and makes me want to quit. 3. You are trying to be filled with action, but instead are boring and draw too many times. And when the action heats up, the camera tripod must have been lost, because the scenes sway more than in The Blair Witch project, and I feel sick, and I want to quit again. 4. You are trying to be a good film, but you have failed, you have failed, you have failed! I would prefer to go barefoot in the Sahara with a package full of jerky, without water, without sunscreen and only with Meryl Streep for the company. This hell would be more beautiful than one minute spent to see how everyone in “The Lure” replays the stupidly written story of Bill Gates for the bad guy, and let's not even talk about a massive bomb that will explode in a car that Jamie Fox's character has just driven off a cliff, but somehow he manages to escape ... just kill me now or do the right thing and promise me that I will never have to watch such a bad movie, never.
