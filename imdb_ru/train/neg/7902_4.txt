Cute and playful, but sucks and cheap. Munchies is another Gremlins clone that appeared in the 80s. I'm not a big fan of fakes. <br /> <br /> At first these were excellent “gremlins”. <br /> <br /> Then there were very average "little animals." <br /> <br /> Let's not forget the lousy “ghouls”. <br /> <br /> But all the pits should be at the "Hobgoblinov." <br /> <br /> Is there something else ?? <br /> <br /> Now for me, the Munchies should have been somewhere between Ghoulies and Hobgoblins. In fact, I probably found it more interesting than Ghoulies, but I preferred a darker tone. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, he plays a stupid nature (which is better for him), but because of that nature, Hammy (Alix Elias and Charlie Phillips) can become pretty domineering that you prefer just to see how idlers run . That's where the fun happens. Mostly frivolous fluff, although, since the story is mainly focused on larks (who are hungry, agitated and destructive) in a whole bunch of supposed comic meetings (some moments work) in a small deserted town, since a couple of people are in pursuit. This is silly, but strangely attractive due to the fast rhythm. The creatures themselves look rather soft and poorly detailed, as they are the main dolls they are joking about. Where their identities come from is what they can really say ... and with attitude. <br /> <br /> Charlie Stratton and the furious Nadine van der Velde (who was in Critters) were honest leaders. Harvey Korman was acceptable in two roles. Robert Picardo also jumps out. <br /> <br /> Amusingly modest entertainment for undemanding.
