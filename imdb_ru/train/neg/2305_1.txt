This film made me feel as if I missed some important scenes from the beginning. There were continuity errors and graphics that stopped just as suddenly as they started. I was very disappointed because I love Whoopi Goldberg and Danny Glover, in addition to the fact that Danny Glovers always trusted and respected taste in the choice of roles, for example, Grand Canyon. I just couldn't finish this movie after what seemed like an eternity, but it probably took just over an hour; we had to turn it off. There was no comedy, there was nothing in the characters that could make you empathize or sympathize with them, there were no emotions associated with this film, and the clips of their past were poorly edited, confused and unnecessary. What could be a great idea for a movie, even if itâ€™s a drama, not a comedy (although I think that a comedy would be better in this situation, because I like to watch white people go crazy and start acting like idiots it makes me laugh) was a waste of my $ 1 in the video store.
