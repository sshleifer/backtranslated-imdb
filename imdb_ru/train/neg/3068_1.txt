Similar films are originals, like Album Oriented Rock stations - what music was like - repetitive, boring and drained by all the original energy by a committee of corporate drones. I am glad that Aragorn was not a typical psychopath of this P.O. Go back and see the 1971 version, count things that will NEVER be included in the modern version, and thank any deity you worship that someone somewhere in the distant past had a chance to write and make an original concept film that was not was based on someone's ideas, and were not passed through the corporate council before he saw the light.
