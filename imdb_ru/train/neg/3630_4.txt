We must assume that those who praised this film (“the greatest opera ever made,” have I not read it somewhere?), Either they don’t care about the opera, they don’t care about Wagner, or they don’t care about anything except their desire to look cultural. Either as a representation of Wagner's swan song, or as a film, it strikes me as a relentless disaster when the lead reading of the score coincided with a sly, grim realization of the text. <br /> <br /> It is doubtful that people with ideas about what an “opera” is (or, for that matter, a play, especially a Shakespeare play) should be allowed somewhere near the theater or film studio ; Siberberberg, very fashionable, but without the slightest justification from Wagner’s text, decided that Parsifal was “about” bisexual integration, so the title character in the final stages turns into a kind of hipster babe, although one who continues to sing high tenor is not enough - either of the actors in the film are singers, and we get a double dose of Armin Jordan, the conductor, who is seen as the face (but not heard as a voice) of Amfortas, and also looks monstrous in double exposure as a kind of Batonzilla or Conductor, who ate Monsalvat during time music performance Good Friday, in which, among other things, the transcendent beauty of nature represented by scattering worn and flabby crocuses stuck in obscene lawn tool that puts me in a deadlock. In the theater, we sometimes have to discard such flaws with our thoughts, but I cannot understand why Syberberg could not connect, for Parsifal and Gurnemants, the same magnificent mountain pasture that was provided for Julie Andrews in “The Sound of Music”. . <br /> <br /> The sound is difficult to endure; high voices and trumpets, in particular, have an auditory brilliance that adds another fatigue to our impatience with not inspiring conductive and paralytic unfolding of the ritual. Someone in another review mentioned Bayreuth's 1951 recording, and Knappertsbusch, although its pace is often very slow, was what Jordan lacked at all, the feeling of pulse, the tidal feeling of music — and, half a century later, the orchestral sound in that The set, in modern editions, still surpasses this film.
