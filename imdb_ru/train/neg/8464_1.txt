I am very tolerant of really bad science fiction and horrible films - I’ve been watching them since 4 or 5 years old, so I’ve seen some really bad things, but I can handle it. I even watched a lot of movies on the SciFi Channel, so I know that I don’t expect much - usually a promising film, which has no end. I think hope is eternal, or, as they say, the triumph of hope over experience. Unfortunately, this is a dog from the very beginning, and I knew it, but, like a moth to the fire, I kept thinking that something interesting would happen. This is not true. All the actors give a decent job - given the script, I do not know how they all held direct faces. It is somehow related to the collapse-hungry parasite worms, which slowly invade the human race, one body at a time. There is an evil plastic surgeon who collaborates with enemies, giving them the appearance of people ... do not worry, he gets what comes to him. The slugs themselves don't know where they came from, they think they could ride a meteor that landed on the earth, but ... somehow they know about the members of the royal slug among them - the princess slugs managed to breed with a man who knows that she is the Queen of Hearts and loves her for herself ... oh, should I continue? Please, I beg you, do not spend 2 hours of your life watching this ... everything will be better ... think about the worst, least pleasant way to spend two hours ... it would be better than that.
