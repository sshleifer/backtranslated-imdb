America needs the best person to win the “Game,” so who do they hire? The gymnast (oh brother!), Played by Kurt Thomas, who has the necessary skills to win in a game in which ninja participate, the village of madmen and Richard Norton, to whom Kurt Thomas says "keep your gear in pants." (His exact words) I missed it in cinemas, and this is a good reason, because I would probably have been kicked out because of the laughter that I broke off on a regular basis. The first thing that came to my mind was how lame these ninjas are if a gymnast can kick their ass. Kurt Thomas looks like 5 feet 4, and he is unlikely to hit one as “The best person for the job.” As for Kurt Thomas’s acting talent, it's good if you can't say something good ... In all seriousness, although you have to ask yourself how much cocaine was used to create such a stupid idea. Only the decision to accept Tara Reid as a scientist is paramount. Although for 18 years it has been called the stupidest movie I've ever seen. Not to say that I did not find it unsightly, I laughed so hard that I almost choked. Twice. Only in the 80s it was possible to create a film with such a bad idea. Although, note, this is the only film in which the hero was so stupid, he can not even pull the blade sword out of the ground. This is the leanest fighter ever created, as well as one of the most fun. <br /> <br /> * of 4- (Bad)
