If I could rate this movie by 0, I would! I see that some people on IMDb say that this is the funniest film of the year, and so on. Sorry? Did you ppl sniff LSD or ........? There is absolutely nothing funny about this movie. N O T H I N G! I really want my 27 minutes ago to be spent watching this piece of shit. <br /> <br /> I read that someone sitting on the plane and watching this movie stopped watching after 30 minutes, I fully understand that in fact I would watch a kite on the plane 2 times instead of Watch this movie once! <br /> <br /> DO NOT watch this movie, do something useful from your life, do the dishes, walk the dog, damn it ... everything is better than spending time in front of the TV and watching a hot rod.
