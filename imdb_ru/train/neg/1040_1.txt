I can not believe that this film has managed to get such a high rating of 6! This barely noticeable and incredibly boring film is definitely one of the worst films I have seen in a long and long time. <br /> <br /> In a budgetless way, he reminded me of episodes I and II of Star Wars for the pure impression that you are watching the train’s complete creative collapse. <br /> <br /> This film should be avoided at all costs. This is one of those "festival films" that only pseudo-intellectuals like because they make people so bad make people think that it makes them "different" and therefore good. <br /> <br /> Bad filmmaking is “not different.” “It's just a bad movie.
