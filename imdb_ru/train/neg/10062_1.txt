Nintendo !!! YOU #% $ @ ERS !!! How could you do this to me? I can't believe it ... this film is actually worse than the first one. I went to see it in the theater with my brother, because my mom made me go with them ... oh god ... where should I start? The plot MORNING. Voice acting is slop. The animation failed. The end is REALLY DRYED. If you liked this movie, you suck too. And for Futuramafan1987, which said that it was the greatest film in history, you are a tool, simple and simple. This is not a movie for anyone, but worried ten-year-olds from the Game Boys who think Pikachu is God. I'm still crying, thinking about this horrible movie carina ... and then there was the adventure of Pikachu ... don't even turn me on to this horrible movie mess. In truth, this is one of the most boring experiences in my life. Do not go watch it at any cost. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: exit, find every copy of this film you can, and record it. Burn them all, and then continue to shoot a GOOD film, for example “Aliens” ... or “Bowling for Columbine” ... or even “Back to the Future”
