A rich Harvard dude falls in love with poor Radcliffe chick, to the horror of his strict father (Ray Milland). <br /> <br /> Dirty, sweet and, most importantly, juicy story about the battle of "classes" when a rich child, Ryan O'Neill, brings the librarian home to ridicule his snobbish parents. Ali McGraw is a social dick with a dirty mouth, while John Marley plays her pious Catholic father, but no one in the film is more annoying than O'Neal himself with his whimpering, posing as Harvard's yappi champion. > Over 8 (!) Years followed by the “Oliver Story”.
