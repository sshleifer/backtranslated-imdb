I thought that Harvey Keitel, young, was just from the Sex Pistols John Lydon, and then as a bonus, Ennio Morricone's music. I expected that an old, sharp Italian police thriller was shot in America. Istide, I have a story with a hodgepodge that never made sense, and a film that made me say: WTF !!! Too many unanswered questions and not enough action. The result: a potential cult classic was flushed down the toilet. Keitel and Lydon work well together, so maybe Quentin Tarantino will be able to reunite these guys with the best scenario. Yes, and Morricone score: good, but not memorable. <br /> <br /> In general, not a waste of time, but not “must see” if you are not a fan of Keitel.
