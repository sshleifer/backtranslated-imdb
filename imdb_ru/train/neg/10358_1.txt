I read the entire book Wrinkles in Time, and then watched the movie. The film contained all the elements of the book, but since the book was 190 pages and the film took 2 hours, it was really full of too many effects and a bad game. <br /> <br /> A wrinkle of time a girl named Meg, Charles Wallace and Calvin must team up to find Megâ€™s father and leave Kamazot Island. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the film is really ugly. The game is terrible, the direction is ridiculous, and the situation is not needed. I was really crushed when I saw the same man, Madeleine Angle, who wrote the book and made the film, made a great book and a terrible movie. Acting is worse than any live video. Yes, I have to admit that there were cool effects. But seriously, they were all done terribly, not serially. If you are reading a book, you will be overwhelmed by the film. I would like to give it 0, but, unfortunately, I can give only 1. Half could be useful.
