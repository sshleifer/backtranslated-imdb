With such a name above my understanding that this film just did not like me. Of course, there are a few decently slovenly moments and a little bit of blood, but the way the movie was shot and the general storyline just struck me as an idiotic and lazy attempt at the abundant “shock” tactics ... on the side of the road. He and his inflammatory brother are in prison until his brother breaks out and agrees to meet his girlfriend in the forest. As a result, he drives her into the house where they are screwed, and later he shows her a collection of kidnapped guys in the basement. Hard-drug prisoners consist of her old boyfriend who raped her, her "thief" neighbor, and her sexually abrasive boss. He explains to her that he is going to kill them all. She ends up killing HIS, and then focuses her attention on the men (or pigs) she torments and kills herself ... Most of the violence and humiliation is associated with eating shit and the destruction of the genitals - all this is far from anxious and essentially soft. The best scene is masturbation with a broomstick, followed by agonizing rape ... Of course, “I spit on your dead body, IP! Ss to your grave ”was conceived as an informal continuation of“ I spit on your grave ”based mainly on the name and the link given by the main character, assuming that Camilla Keaton was her mother. I personally think this is a wildly blasphemous statement! This film is a boring, amateur mess that tends to be hit, but failed miserably ...
