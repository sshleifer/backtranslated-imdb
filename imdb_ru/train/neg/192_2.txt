The only good part of this movie is the beautiful scenery. This film was long and boring. The minister should have left the pulpit when his son Paul deviated from the teachings he had proclaimed. How many times have his boys vainly take the name of the Lord in this film from the Presbyterian past? This does not fit. I wanted Paul to be swept away by the river without a boat at the very beginning, to save us from the stupid, smirk, selfish story about Paul (Brad Pitt). Thus, Norm becomes a teacher, and Paul becomes an obsessive player that Norm wants to save, but does not want, so what. It is very uninteresting. We see prejudiced whites, whom Paul supports because of his native American. It was the only part that had some interest and could possibly turn into a real “wild west”. We only see a sleepy city, in which the minister’s sons have nothing to do except 1. Norma pursues a lame girlfriend and understands her family. 2. Paul writes silly stories in a newspaper store, scratching his head and taking many sips and tying up a lot of flies. I would prefer to watch a fishing show, that this film again - that will never happen.
