Personally, I would advise people to stay away from this movie. This is generally a bore, which is worth watching, and the fighting is poorly staged. Slow and not very convincing. If you buy the “Legends of Hong Kong” DVD film about this film, the only thing you should listen to is the audio commentary from Bey Logan. <br /> <br /> But in any case, since the ninja film ever existed. watch. I can not think about one thing and, frankly, do not want to. <br /> <br /> In general, when it comes to movies, I have one golden rule: avoid any movies that contain the word "ninja".
