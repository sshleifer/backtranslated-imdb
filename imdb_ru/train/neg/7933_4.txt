I'm a big fan of Randolph Scott, but this film is stupid. All of this has a canned, fake, sonic feel for it with a truly horrible rear screen projection. He has a good plot idea that the screenwriter successfully drowned in a negligible scenario, which makes it impossible for the audience to plunge into action and really care about any of the characters. The direction is pedestrian and only emphasizes how bad the script is, and does not help to improve it. I have seen many quite pleasant sound productions before, but this is not one of them. All he does is make you appreciate the Scott and Bettiher sand films. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is tanned, trimmed and shines with a million dollar smile. He is always pleased ... even in his worst films. Besides Scott, the other main reason I wanted to watch this film was because I really liked Miss Wimore in Errol Flynn’s Rocky Muntean film. In Man Over Gun, she’s just as beautiful, and you can say that she’s a good actress, but she had to say some rather stupid lines, and the blockage the director gave her was really terrible. I only saw Phil Carey in Operation Pacific, and he plays the exact same character here ... arrogant ass pain that you want to turn into an unconscious state. I think it proves that he is a good actor ... he made me hate him. In my opinion, there are several unsuccessful attempts to remove comics, which only distract from the film. Although there are many elements to knock, I have to say that I really enjoyed the two Spanish songs played in the musical numbers ... but this is not why we are going to watch the films of Randolph Scott, right? <br /> <br /> There are definitely worse movies about Scott, and this one is definitely not unbearable, but it also cannot be considered as something ordinary.
