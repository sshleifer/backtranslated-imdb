The idea of ​​a thumb is not such a winner the second time. ThumbTanic was not as good as Thumb Wars for several reasons. First of all, I think Mr. Oedekerku had a lot less work in the Titanic. Unlike Star Wars, the film “Titanic” (yet?) Did not become a cultural myth, and there are far fewer references to it that will resonate with the audience. <br /> <br /> In ThumbTanic, holes are filled with one-time jokes that aren't really connected with anything. For example, the insinuation of the hero that the heroine is not clean during a scene from a springboard is not funny. Rather, you just think to yourself: “I missed something in the original movie?”. There were too many such useless jokes (cf. Spider-like). <br /> <br /> On the contrary, the fake designer of a smart ship made sense and was funny. Also very funny was the appearance of a guy in the film who wanted to go "faster", like a maniac running around, demanding that everything be "faster", including the sinking ship and himself, who first died. Such jokes mean something in the context of “Titanic” and give meaningful humor to Tumbtanik. <br /> <br /> Media thumb, faces and voices are still funny. Props and computer graphics kits and animations are commendable. In general, although ThumbTanic proves that quirkiness alone does not work, this film still makes you wonder and laugh until the end.
