Two days after I saw this, I am still in agony because I saw it. This is so bad, you have to wonder how someone could write this prank, much less let it be free for the general public. Calm acting, lead man, who looks like he's a moaner, and Alison Eastwood is embarrassed. The action testifies to the low-budget making of the film, which means that it is terribly bad. Plot? Well, if you were 6 years old, you could write this movie. Simplified, idealistic and just suck.
