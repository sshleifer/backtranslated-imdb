The meteor hit the Crater Lake (hence our name), awakening a plesiosaur, which sets about a snack among the population of hits (in California, this world capital of huks.) “Crater Lake Monster”, which somehow managed to escape from MST3K. Featuring an exciting game, a decent animal, and more, this is a terrible part of a 1970s low-budget movie about low-budget exploitation / monsters. <br /> <br /> Although the film is guilty of many crimes, the biggest is Arnie and Mitch, two hideous goons that serve as our comic relief. They stumble, struggle to stock up on "banjo music," look at women and behave like humanity's pathetic apologies. Characters are so bad that they should be considered a crime against humanity.
