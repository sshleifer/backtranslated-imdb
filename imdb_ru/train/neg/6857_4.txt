This "comic comedy" seems very forced. Indeed, the actors try their best to deal with the essentially unfunny scenario. And, as a result, it is not going anywhere. The idea that a woman finds out that she was pregnant after a divorce is not that funny. And then, when Cooper sneaks in with the baby, because he doesn't want to be put up for adoption, it seems terribly unfunny, and it's very hard to turn it into a comedy. It really is a shame, as the actors were more capable than the script, and I got bored with all this mess. Considering that Cooper made so many GOOD comedies, I recommend you watch them.
