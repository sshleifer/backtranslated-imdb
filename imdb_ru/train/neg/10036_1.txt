Sometimes I don’t understand what directors think when they make a film ... I had an injury after seeing Welcome (2007) and I thought that they wouldn’t do it again. But after a lot of amazing promo videos, Tashan finally ended up with a heart attack. <br /> <br /> Such amazing 3 songs in the promo - Dil Haar, Chalia and Tashan Mine ..... and what do you get in the movie? Zero history, a predictable plot, a lot of Akshay Kumar's tricks and nothing interesting, except watching Karina after her significant weight loss ... !!! <br /> <br /> Another big catastrophe with music ... in the music album. They spent the time to give the pitiful little dialogues of these 4 jokers, and they didn’t think to give a background song of scenes when Akshay Kumar performs tricks ...! This song is so good, quite comparable with Tashan Mein, and it is not in the music album !!! :-( If you plan to watch this film, I would say, watch it to listen to that background song, which sounds like this: “Bachchan Bachchan Pandey ...” <br /> <br /> In general, he was very disappointed with By the way Bhyajji tried to speak English badly! <br /> <br /> Get out, man, I have to vomit!
