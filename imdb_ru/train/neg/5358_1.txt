Obviously, all the good reviews published for this film are still owned by insiders who were either associated with the film, or know someone who knows someone and, thus, saw several cuts. Well, I do not know anyone involved, and I saw the final version, and this is pure garbage. The only thing he has is ambitions and many cameos from horror legends (none on the screen will be terribly long). Itâ€™s as if the filmmakers shot this movie during the weekend during the horror convention and invited actors like Tony Todd, Tom Savini, David Hess and Michael Berryman to shoot scenes during coffee breaks. This is an ultra-cheap film "The X-Files", filmed on video, with a terrible play of actors who have no actors, with more mullets than is acceptable in the 21st century. There is little or no action; This is all an overly explanatory dialogue that the pointless plot is trying to explain. Computer FX is a joke, but not enough, and not enough action to make this movie enjoyable for MST3K. After about 8 consecutive scenes without talking, you will find yourself reaching for the fast-forward button ... and not letting go. Absolutely useless.
