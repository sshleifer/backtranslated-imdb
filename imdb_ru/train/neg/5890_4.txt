This romantic comedy is not so bad. Some funny things happen here and there, and there are some pretty memorable characters in it. <br /> <br /> However, acting is amateurish (with the exception of the banker). While some scenes are very funny, others are just confusing. In particular, I found the “romantic” part of the story poor. <br /> <br /> In general, I think it's worth seeing if you like football and romantic comedies. This is actually a good film, and the final is really good. Just do not expect anything unusual. It is fair if you have an hour and a quarter to kill.
