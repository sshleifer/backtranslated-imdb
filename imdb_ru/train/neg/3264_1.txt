This caustic, homophobic thing was dated in 1976. Now it seems especially vile, filled with stereotypes of gays and characters, over whom it is necessary to laugh, but not over which. Redd Fox makes his standard game, Michael Warren, at least, is trying to lead humanity to a one-dimensional character, and Pearl is Pearl, what were you thinking ...? Pearl Bailey deserves much better.
