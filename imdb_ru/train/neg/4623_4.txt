If you haven’t seen a gong show, then you don’t like this film at all, not to know that the show makes this film great. <br /> <br /> I give him 5 out of 10 because some things make him funny, which helps to compensate for his obvious problems. <br /> <br /> 1) This is a funny snapshot of the era in which it was made, in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 2) You get a lot of funny roles of the people you saw in the series. 3) It is interesting to see Chuck (the presenter) when he is not playing on the television character. 4) You will see a lot of strange people doing all sorts of oddities, as you see in the TV show. <br /> <br /> I will not list all the bad things, because there are many of them, but here are some of the most outstanding ones. <br /> <br /> 1) In the film “Hong Kong Show” there are many relevant clips that get tired throughout the film. 2) The movie storyline outside the clip segments is very weak and basically consists of only one subject point. 3) Chuck is actually half decent as an actor, but most of the rest of the actors do typical manners on the 1970s plane. <br /> <br /> This is a good film to watch when you do not have an hour and a half you want to watch everything at once. Watch 20 minutes at a time, and it's not that bad. But even then it is not so good. ;)
