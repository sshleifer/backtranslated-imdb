Any film with such a ridiculous title like “The Bagman” should automatically attract the attention of any bad movie buff, but the plot is very different from what you would expect after watching the DVD cover. Bagman is by no means a good movie. This refers to the category of films that seem to have been (and probably were) shot on a home video camera. The game is terrible. I have not heard or seen such a wooden game since the time of Troll 2. There are many scenes with nude and sex, but they obviously jump too fast. Characters morons and completely forgotten. The ending (which I will not spoil) can be easily foreseen after viewing the very first scene. Because of the foolish nature of the film, nothing but terrible production values ​​is truly scary (terrible attempts at realistic bleeding, a driving scene where the car is clearly still, etc.). Recommended only for fans of bad cinema.
