I was curious to watch this movie. Many people seem to be excited. I also have my own beliefs. I believe in Jesus Christ, but I am open to any views or opinions. It doesn't matter to me whether Jesus existed as written in the Bible. Was Mary a virgin or not, or all other similar pagan coincidences. For me, the idea of ​​salvation is important, the idea of ​​love as the only way to find peace in this world. <br /> <br /> What made me angry is that someone accepts the proposal, presents it as a fact, but it was written without showing the context. For example, in this film they showed the following great sentence: “Those are my enemies who did not want me to be king over them — bring them here and kill them before me” Jesus (Luke 19:27). What did they not do? I tell you, this is the context. Jesus told the story of an evil king. There is no place in the Bible where Jesus supports killing. He is love! After misquoting the Bible, they present us with hateful people (pseudo-Christians). Most viewers do not check the information presented, so they begin to think that Jesus = hate = does not suit me or anyone else. This is pure manipulation of people. Please use your brain. Do not take everything as a fact that you are told in this film. We are destroying our own foundation, our civilization, if we thus begin to destroy Jesus and the message that he brought to us. You saw off the branch on which you are sitting.
