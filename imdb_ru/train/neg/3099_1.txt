This film is not just bad, not just banal, it is disgusting. Something about Daphne, about a terrible call girl, about all this damned (and I literally use this word) film radiates a grotesque that will insult the hostess of a brothel. This film makes my skin crawl, makes me regret the presence of reproductive organs and makes me feel unclean. <br /> <br /> In this movie, what worries me most is that they used such a good concept. A creature that creates fantasies with catastrophic results, rather than the cliché “Worst Nightmare” and “Experienced Bone Will”, is a truly exciting movie idea. <br /> <br /> The thought: the reason why hobgoblins have to be killed before the day is because they are attracted by bright lights. During the day, bright lights do not appear well, so they can go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Consider hobgoblins: four hobgoblins leave the film studio, and yet at least nine of them kill toys throughout the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Question for discussion. If you had a cold, demanding, inhospitable friend, would you engage in combat with garden tools with a military jerk? Explain.
