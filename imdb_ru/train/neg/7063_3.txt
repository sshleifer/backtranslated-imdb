The guy made a lot of titles for several films, and I think he once said; I have to choose a cheap script, try to put as many headlines as possible (because, after all, I am a caption designer) and try to convince people that this is actually a film. One of the worst I've ever seen is for sure. If you could not wait to see beautiful headlines, look at what posters do not waste your time on viewing. <br /> <br /> What an irony, isn't it, did you see this poster? the only part of his project that SHOULD do title work is almost none!
