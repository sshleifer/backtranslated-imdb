Alexander Ajiâ€™s remake, Hills Have Eyes, was one of the bright spots of 2006. He was not only a remake of the classic horror movie, but damn good. So, almost a year later, we continue to work on the continuation of this remake. Although the original screenwriter Wes Craven is back as a producer and co-writer, this film simply cannot rise to the level set by the original and the remake. A group of military interns stops in the desert to check out some scientists and run into the mutant family from the first film (at least those that stayed plus some new ones). There is a lot of blood here. What annoys me in this film is the complete lack of characteristics. The viewer does not care what happens to any of these people, because we did not get into them. Even the mutants had some characteristic last time, but this time nothing. Mountain for blood is meaningless. There must be a reason for this to happen, for it to be interesting. Nothing that happens here is interesting. And what is it lately with the scenes of rape in movies? Here we get another one without a real reason. I hope this is one of the hills that will no longer be visited.
