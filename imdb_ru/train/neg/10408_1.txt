If Fassbinder made the worst movie, I definitely don’t want to see it! Anyone who complains that his films are too talkative and claustrophobic should be forced to watch this in order to learn to appreciate the more restrained style that he chose in excellent films, such as Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant. This film is littered with so many artificial, quasi-symbolic images that it looks like a parody of an "art film". The scene at the slaughterhouse and the scene where Elvira’s friend prostitute watches the channel for ten minutes, these are just two of the brightest examples of what makes this film a real test of the viewer's endurance. But what really makes me angry about this is a few scenes in which only Elvira and her ex-wife and / or her daughter appear. These are the only moments that reflect real human emotions and prove that at the core of this terrible film was a great movie struggling to break free. What a waste.
