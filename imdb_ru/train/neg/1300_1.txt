This film should never have been made. Honestly, I have to admit that before I saw this, I had some serious doubts. The director is not a great actress, although she starred in many films in Holland, and the young woman who starred is a television personality with a constant smile on her face and a little criticism of self-criticism. The actor who played another major role that I recently saw in Bride Flight, and although this film is better, he did not convince me than. To begin with the story, I did not read the novel on which it is based, but the script that underlies the film is something that could be done given that children are having a birthday party on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but not someone of the same age as a director who likes to watch a good movie. Something really disturbing is the rewritten dialogues, most of the time they were pronounced out loud. My best wishes to the operator, at least he was trying to do something from this. It is a pity that the film was edited lousy, if not, then some scenes were certainly more authentic.
