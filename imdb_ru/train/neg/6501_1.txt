This film is again one of those films that someone is thinking about or trying to make others think that they understood it. Anyone trying to figure it out is MORON! I would advise to take TWO not one, but TWO hits of very strong acid, and at least you will get a visual thrill from this !! Although, in the end, you can commit suicide for having wasted your acid !!!! Since this comment requires 10 lines of information, let me write something for those of you who are trying to protect the film. Unintelligble. Garbage. Schitzoid. A waste of talent. The film is ice-cold, with a paper at its destination with voiced clouds, in a sunny dive in pudding ... Sounds like a lion in a red light with visible hair. Now explain it to me !!!!
