In my film (unfortunately), in my opinion, stands out the introduction in which John Berlin (Andy Garcia) enters the city. You see his Mercedes driving through a winding road through a forest like the one that is full of mahogany trees. It is quite beautiful. <br /> <br /> As for Andy Garcia, playing a character with the name of Berlin, well ... Andy is too Hispanic / Latino to be overcome. Maybe the Caucasian father married his Spanish mother in this story? Who knows. But I can tell you that when you send him to the city of farmers and drug addicts, he stands out like a sore thumb, especially with his accent that flashes when he gets angry. Yes, I know, big deal, right? He is still a good actor. <br /> <br /> The name refers to a serial killer who calls his victims Jennifer. All the victims are blind, and he dismembers them. The killer paused, but suddenly appears when a blind witness appears (do not ask), Helena Robertson (Uma Thurman). To my surprise, Thurman plays a great blind man. When I saw Lance Henriksen play the sergeant. Freddie Ross I got worried. Henriksen played in rather strange films, especially recently. I still can not forget it in the movie about bloodshed, Pumpkinhead. <br /> <br /> Berlin makes a movie in a small town from LA like a detective. He begins an investigation into Jennifer's murders after finding body parts at a local landfill. His brilliance in finding one of the victims was blind, it seemed far-fetched. So did the irony of killing * SPOILER * Freddie with similar records and names. I am very confused in the logic of how the eight Jennifers appeared. And the killer motive just like a madman didn't hit hard. Looking back, this film is probably more truthful in life, showing an unsuspecting person capable of murder, simply because over time he became a bit nuts or maybe was born abnormal. <br /> <br /> John Malkovich does a tremendous job in questioning Garcia! Although no cop would be allowed by law to put pressure on someone so much, and yank him without a fair knockout. As for the ending, it is a bit surprising, but quite controversial, just like Sgt. Ross is murder. The killer prefers to go after his traveling victim, preferring to frolic, I think. <br /> <br /> And he has so many opportunities to kill her, that is ridiculous. I will not spoil the very end, because, despite the precariousness, this is a good surprise. However, after that you will probably say, as I said: “Boy, she was lucky!” 4/10
