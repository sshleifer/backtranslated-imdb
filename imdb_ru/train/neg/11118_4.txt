It was a popular movie, probably because of humor, a fast-paced story, an outsider character who shuts his mouth, etc. It's funny that you probably could not have made a movie with that name if you replaced someone -but "white", like everything else, will be regarded by the PC police as racist. <br /> <br /> However, Woody Harrleson, as a white guy who turns out to be just as good, if not better, than any of the black basketball players, is as interesting as his main colleague Wesley Snipes. <br /> <br /> Snipes had a lot of funny lines, providing most of the humor. The bad part of the film - which does not bother many people - is the extreme profanity here and the meanness of all the characters. This includes the Woody girl, played by Rosie Perez. There are no really clean, good people in this movie. For this reason, I cannot honestly recommend a movie to at least not friends or those who are offended by a lot of profanity.
