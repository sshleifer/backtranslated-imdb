Matt Cordell returned from the dead for the third round, although Iâ€™m not sure that anyone was worried about it, except for frantic MANICA COP fans. Cordell, who died in the last film, was resurrected through Voodoo, and is now on the trail of several villains involved in the execution of a fellow officer. I missed part of this low-budget fast startup of the 90s, but it was nice to see Cordell counting the amount of body in different, terrible ways. The problem is that the whole movie is pretty static, and Cordell is simply not Jason or Freddy. Interest is rapidly declining, even with the great master of bi-films, Robert Forster, who works as a doctor and eventually puzzles. Stick to the first movie in the series, which is both funny, scary and exciting.
