“The Deathrow Game Show” of 1987 Mark Pirro is a black comedy that is in many ways extremely funny, but, nevertheless, sometimes very funny. This film, of course, could be much better, the acting is terrible, and some very funny scenes sometimes make it difficult to watch, but the concept is funny, and there are some funny moments in it. <br /> <br /> In In the near future (1991) game shows have changed. Chuck Todin (John Mac Cafferty) is playing a game called Live or Die, in which convicted prisoners sentenced to death have a chance to play for their lives and for money. Candidates who fail will be executed on the air using many different methods, such as guillotines, electric chairs and other, more bizarre penalty devices, followed by applause from studio audiences. The show, of course, is more than controversial, and Chuck made many enemies ... <br /> <br /> “DEATHROW Gameshow” is incredibly cheesy and crappy in many aspects, and the action is terrible, but it's no doubt fun in many parts, especially if you're a fan of dark humor. You have not missed anything if you have not seen it, but it is definitely funny and a waste of time. 4/10
