The plot for Descent, if it can actually be called a plot, has two notable events. One at the beginning - one at the end. Together, these events make up perhaps 5% of the total film time. Everything (and I mean _everything_) between them is basically the director’s desperate attempt to fill in the minutes. I like disturbing movies, I like dark movies, and sand scenes don't bother me - but if you expect me to sit for 60 minutes of foggy / dark (literally) scenes without a storyline, you will have one more thing. Rosario Dawson, one of my favorite actresses, is completely in vain here. And no, she doesn't undress, even in the NC-17 version that I saw. <br /> <br /> If you have a couple of hours to throw away and you want to watch “Descent”, take a nap instead - you will probably have more interesting dreams.
