I love insect killer movies, watching them is a lot of fun, I had to watch this movie, since it was one of my favorite horror books by Shawn Hutson. <br /> <br /> I met him and would like to listen to him, how this film was terrible, how he said it was, after he said that I was still dying to see how bad it was . <br /> <br /> The plot: people die mysteriously and horribly, and no one has a clue what the reason is. <br /> <br /> Only MIC Brady, the health worker, has a possible solution, but the authorities mock his slug-killer theory. <br /> <br /> It is only when the body begins to count to rise, and the expert on slugs from England begins to wander around, does it seem that Mike had the right idea after all. <br /> <br /> This film as the most superfluous film of all that you have ever seen! The slugs in this movie are fast (then normal), and it looks like they are sending scenes! <br /> <br /> This film is not at all like a book, the book was ten times more terrible, ten times more terrible and there was much more history in it! <br /> <br /> I didnâ€™t like this movie at all! Since I am a big fan of slugs, this book and the second book is called "Reproduction"! Both books are great <br /> <br /> Read the book, then watch the movie, you might like it more than me. Give it 2 out of 10
