What a wasted cast. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most disappointing films I've seen. <br /> <br /> Usually Roger Ebert does not let me down, but I feel deceived by seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> The only excitement is Elizabeth Banks in her bra. This is a pitiful statement about this film. It was very promising, but it looked like a transvestite was dry. <br /> <br /> This is a self-absorbing trip. <br /> <br /> I canâ€™t express my bitterness deep enough about watching this movie, and I hope I can warn you about the same disappointment.
