Exiled from heaven, a gang of lustful naked female angels (with large plastic fangs) settled in a terrible forest, where they feed on any unhappy souls who must wander. Soon, a group of friends in a car trip becomes a victim of bloodthirsty kids ?? An independent low-budget horror made in the UK, Forest of the Damned takes an interesting premise and throws it into the pan with some of the worst actions, effects, and trends I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Directed by Johannes Roberts shows some random talent behind the camera ?? the scenes in the ruined house are quite tense, and there are some cleverly crafted "shock" moments - but for the most part the film is technically amateurish. Add truly horrible horror films by Tom Savini and Sean Hutson, and youâ€™ll have one very bad movie in your hand. <br /> <br /> From this movie, you can extract some fun, as well as a variety of different female nudity for guys to enjoy, but most will find it a chore to sit.
