“It doesn't look like this big mechanical toy,” says the character, commenting on Jaws. Well, Blood Surf would like the beast to be as convincing as a shark from the Jaws series. In other words, the digital special effects of this film are terrible. Acting and guiding is also not much better; they seem more suitable for advertising deodorant or chewing gum than for a horror movie. The attitude of the people who worked on this film demonstrates contempt not only for the genre, but also for the audience. To say that you "liked" this film only prompts the directors to offer us more of this shit, further destroying the horror horror genre. (* 1/2)
