This is the worst robbery of Home Alone films I've ever seen! Look at parts 1 and 2, but don't let anyone say that this is BETTER than the first two! I mean, in fact, you are not making a film, then doing a sequel with the same characters and actors, and then doing another sequel with DIFFERENT characters and actors! I mean, it would be nice if it wasn't the movie "Home Alone", but they REALLY made it the movie "Home Alone." Culkin is too old now, so you must stop making sequels! Oh my god, this movie makes me sick! Buy part 1 and 2.
