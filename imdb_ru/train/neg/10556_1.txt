This is a good example of how NOT to make a movie. <br /> <br /> There is very little meaningful dialogue, there is no context for the events and constant cuts between seemingly unconnected scenes. The result is a confused, ignorant viewer; the plot is absolutely impossible, and the ideas presented are meaningless without listening to the director's comments. <br /> <br /> This film is directly related to the atrocities of a person and tries to show how wrong he is, with an emphasis on child abuse. This includes some stock cadres of real, terrible acts of violence, including wartime executions. Although this works in the context of the film, I feel that the ideas underlying the film could be presented without resorting to such extreme content. This film is absolutely NOT intended for the weak tired or easily offended, and it should not be shown to minors under any circumstances. <br /> <br /> The climax is anticlimatic compared with the content of the rest of the film. If you do not listen to a comment when it happens, you will probably miss it. <br /> <br /> The director's comment was one-time: “sit on the guy and let him speak, without cuts.” comment. While this isn’t necessarily bad, the director ends up wandering around a lot and often spends minutes on complaining about his college, filming conditions, co-producers, a bad movie and a dozen other things. Constant negativity detracts from what is otherwise an important tool for understanding the film. <br /> <br /> The film was shot many years ago on 16 mm film and Super8 film for four years with an extremely low budget. Because of this, the quality of video and audio leaves much to be desired. That doesn't make it a bad movie, but it makes a bad movie worse.
