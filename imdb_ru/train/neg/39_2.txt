The actress who made the film in Africa was abducted and taken to the jungle, where she was held for ransom. The producer hires someone to go and get her back. All complicate cannibals in the jungle, who worship a really ugly "god" who loves to eat naked women. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible, dirty movie. There are many naked people and violence, not to mention violence against naked people. This is a film about exploitation, designed to appeal to the deepest dark parts of our being, and if the film were not so boring, this film would be a classic. Let's face it, despite the blood, nasty sex and abuse, and the ugly monster in this film is a prankster. Pace shattered, and he expels you. There are several plot lines that seem to occur separately from each other, although in the end this is all one story. Worst of all, almost no one says anything. Most of the minimal dialogue concerns protests of cruelty or one character: “I will do what I want.” It is such a quiet and boring film that if it were not for the frequent cries of the victims, I would recommend it as an assistant in a dream. <br /> <br /> This movie should be avoided if you don’t need sleep, or if you don’t need to watch every movie about European cannibal. <br /> <br /> (By the way. VideoAsia just released it as part of its Horror Tales series. Their print is strangely packed into a mailbox, which looks like the result of their print from a Japanese source (there is a fog) that was cut to remove subtitles. Their seal also has no initial names)
