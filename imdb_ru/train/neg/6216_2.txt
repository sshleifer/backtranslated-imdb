9, the film I was looking forward to for many months .... was a bit of a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> I was deeply surprised by the lack of history 9 and the strange development of character. All the amazing sequences of actions in the world do not compensate for a single cute character. <br /> <br /> Strange, almost abandoned in occult sequences, were not only irrelevant, but also infuriating. The story of robots and scientists ... why does it suddenly turn into a horror monster necronomicon with mystical symbols and green magic ghost lines instead of giving answers to what could be incredibly scary devices of history ?? <br /> <br /> How, what, when, why .... questions that promise to ask only if you care about it, and it becomes less and less likely that you will do this as you leave theater. <br /> <br /> Such a film is disappointing due to the lack of depth ... I would have watched this movie drawn in pencil if the story were good. But the filmmakers relied on CGI magic and the name of Tim Burton to draw into the crowd. What ... this is what attracted me, but could not deserve my respect. <br /> <br /> 9 could be awesome ... with a few more rewriting and a little more respect from its own creators.
