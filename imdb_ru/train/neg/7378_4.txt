Stephen, mate, do you remember when you said the following: <br /> <br /> “Try to find the path of least resistance and use it without harming others. Live honestly and morally, not only with people, but with all beings. ” <br /> <br /> You didn’t do this, you fatally injured your fans and their morals with these “movies”. I would not even worry if I did not know that you are much better than this, I, I saw a video where you teach, you are much better than this, why, why, brother, why ... <br /> /> The production of rollers was on a spool I promise, bro, I am not afraid of you, I will tell you the truth on your face so that we can fix it. <br /> <br /> Well, I like that some others fall asleep by 90%, but honestly, I was tired and had lunch just an hour before distributing Sensai, what are you doing. 12 million? really? Do you have any ideas about what we could do with $ 12,000,000? It could be in cinemas and a blockbuster, if you wanted us to donate money from huge profits to a homeless shelter or something like that. These post-production people take you, man, the choreography did not exist, we can do better, man, the blinking eye was from people in the black film, I half expected a blacksmith or Tommy Lee Jones to appear to tell you that they were gills not forever. <br /> <br /> Seagal, you are an aikido master, why are you doing this for yourself, for us? when you came on stage, you had such a fresh direct style, and it was obvious that you were a teacher, because your movements were so clear and precise, when you watched your first three films, I felt that you were teaching me something , now I'm I feel that you are just being cheated or something like that. I feel that I need to save you, buddy, this time you are the one who was killed, and I will go and take revenge for you, helping you to make the best movie. Bro, I know who you really are, I know the truth about Niko's movie. let's talk. <br /> <br /> contact me, man, I have some fresh ideas. I'm a niggle, I swear, you will not be disappointed with my attention to detail, and we will do this for the fans, your fans. we deserve better, we hold, but the strand is about to break. I swear, I will not let your film go out the door with a single mistake. I'm still trying to find out if this was the worst dubbing in the entire history, or you have laryngitis, but I promise you that I can make a better impression of your voice than lame ****, who did not even try. I really hope that you hit him on the nuts as payment. I can come up with a story and plot that can be used to avenge the death of your student / daughter / wife / dog / home plant niche, and I promise you that we will return you, I promise, I also want to go to the direction that makes people think, if you let me in, I promise that we will make a film that people will leave and have to discuss it, a serious thought, defiant, perceptual, changing experience. <br /> <br /> Steven Sigal This is my official written permission for IMDb to give you my contact information in order to resurrect one of the best martial arts heroes I have ever seen since he is not Italian, he is Irish and Jewish, so what you call it a bad acting, i call it a great acting because for 20 years you thought Segal was an Italian.
