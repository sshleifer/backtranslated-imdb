This movie sucks ass. Something about a heat wave in some European country, full of garbage. Nothing happens in this movie. maybe 30 seconds of sex, but that's all. There is a very annoying girl who catches, rides with people and really pisses me off. This film is completely reckless, and you should not watch it yourself. I regret it, it is very boring. I would rate this as zero, but I can't. No sane body should see this. I am sure you will regret it completely, I did. How could they come up with something so bad. Even the Secret Men were better. SECRETS OF MEN. It sucks. This film was not worth doing. a complete waste of time. The characters in this are very difficult to understand, and I'm good very, very very boring.
