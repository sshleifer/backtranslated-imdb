This comedy is really not funny. This is a novel that influences stereotypes so much that it has no effect. This is a caper film, so derivative - yes, even then - it does not make sense. <br /> <br /> The cast is adequate. Moreover, it is difficult to say. However, it is nice that the players are unfamiliar. In MGM, it would play the lead role of Robert Montgomery. The wife of a businessman who had no time for anything other than work could be any number of actresses. <br /> <br /> We can be grateful that this little-known film is inhabited by performers, mostly unknown today. And production values ​​are not terrible. However, this does not make a real impression. <br /> <br /> This is a common fake. And who wants this?
