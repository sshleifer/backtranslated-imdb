I am a fan of films that fill in the gaps in the objective world of world cinema. So after watching the Water Lily trailer, I expected that I would like this movie, because I thought I came across something unique: a movie that honestly depicts teenage lesbian love — a kind of female version of Beautiful Thing. <br /> <br /> The main characters are 15 years old French women. Marie is slender, restrained and pretty stingy; Floriana is sociable, athletic and beautiful; and Ann is loyal, plump and behaviorally immature. The erotic relationship between Marie and Floriana always boils in this film, if not on the surface, then just below. <br /> <br /> “Water Lilies”, however, is not about the origin of lesbian love for two teenagers; We are talking about sexual dysfunction, suffering, longing, adolescents working for different purposes and - at least in two cases - sad mechanical sex. It also proves that writers and directors spoil their own creations when they become too manipulative. <br /> <br /> In the additional functions of The Lord of the Flies, director Peter Brooke says: “French cynicism begins with sexual arousal, which means that the French consider children to be angels, and adolescents and adults to be pervasive cynicism. Part of the fall of this film - the creator of the film Celine Skiamma swallowed a huge dose of this cynicism. <br /> <br /> “Where is the joy?” I asked myself while watching this movie. Yes, first love can be painful and disappointing, but it can also be joyful and solemnly erotic in a new, life-affirming way. These positive moments are missing in this film; no balance. <br /> <br /> Organically, this film wants to be a bright celebration of first love. But Sciamma is too impressed with her own cynicism and wit and destroys the film. First, what is the point of showing only a plump naked girl? I know that in European cinema there is an established tradition of naked teen nudity, as evidenced by films such as Slingshot; Scammers; Devil, Probably; Little thief; The noise of the heart; Friends; Bo-Per "and" Europe, Europa "; but this case is a minor author's invasion -" You see, audience, I can make a film in which I only show an unattractive naked man. "Or no nudity or evenly distributed nudity in an honest way. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in the club where Floriana and Marie are dancing. Next is not just Floriana, cynically manipulating Marie; this is the film director Sciamma, cynically manipulating her audience. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the greatest betrayal of authenticity and organic integrity is places when Floriana warns Maria that she is going to request something that is “abnormal.” Marie quite understandably asks: “Who is interested in being normal?” Then Sciamma plays incorrectly with her audience and the noise of the film, because Floriana’s request is fake , a derivative and substitute question, rather than a genuine, heartfelt question of the film, deserve the character Marie and the audience, who have invested their time. <br /> <br /> Here are two more things that falsely creep over the viewer's nerves: 1) so far the french - of all people - take wah Well, in a bathing suit and a turtle in a boot? 2) What kind of teenager - of any nationality - would bite off the apple core, which was thrown into the garbage, in order to get a taste of the beloved mouth? <br /> <br /> The three main actresses are promising and, if they find the best means for their talents, they can be great actors. Louise Blaischer (Anna) - the best actress in terms of technology and can make a successful career as a second plan. Adel Henel (Floriana) can become a leading lady, or a bomb, or both. Pauline Aquart (Marie) has intensity and magnetism that are infallible. In the future, she could play everything: from an emotionally crippled librarian to a mysteriously sensual seductress and reluctant politician, who is rapidly growing in fame. <br /> <br /> In general, “Water Lilies” were very disappointing. If you are an honest director, please make a genuine film about two young women in love! No, not necessarily for the sake of this middle-aged guy, but young lesbians can have something of a quality that they can look at and identify. And yes, to fill the gap in world cinematography.
