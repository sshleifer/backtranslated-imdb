I made my personal mission to pursue those who are responsible for this film. I even asked the rental company to give me back my money, because I claimed that they made a false advertisement. <br /> <br /> It is not enough that the film itself is money, but the cover is what sold me. I made better makeup effects for my Halloween children than what the film actually portrays, compared to the cover. Can you say raccoon eyes? <br /> <br /> I'm not going to spend more of my time going into details, but come on, the main character of the film is a Los Angeles policeman who was born and raised in Alabama - but with a German accent!?! This is beyond insults.
