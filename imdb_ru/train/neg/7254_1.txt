Who ever wrote two or three glowing reviews, either participated in the creation of this film, or used the term “free”, or bankrupt it, and if this was the last case, I would like to return my seven dollars! The actors, again the term “freely used”, are terrible, in fact almost none of them did anything that would be a relief. The scenery and everything associated with these screams, we had 7 dollars to work and one day to do it. Was it taken in the backyard? Everything about this project says low budget. The actors were at best in list D. Don't waste your time, unless, of course, you want to take it back and try to return the rent. The main bad guy looks like the punk from the 70s show, who eventually married his grandmother Dummy Moore. My local blockbuster video store lists this as the film most returned with the sad comment attached. Even at the box office for 99 cents, this film is gathering dust. Someone really should be borrowed. This is a super server and I give him 10 poops.
