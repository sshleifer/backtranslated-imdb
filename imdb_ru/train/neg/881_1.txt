Thanks to the well-known home video distributor, who presented the so-called German independent series, Four For Venice is not only horrible, but terrible. So terrible that I threw it into the used goods store for extra money. <br /> <br /> Nick and Charlotte are a married couple who reached an agreement on sex only on Tuesday because of their busy profession schedule. Eve and Louis are a couple, living from hand to hand, where Eve works as a waitress and Louis works as an artist. Nick indirectly makes Eve lose her job as a waitress. Louis and Charlotte had an affair behind Eve and Nick. Louis deceived Eve by deceiving her that he would fly to London to do something related to his work, but in fact he was flying to Venice with Charlotte for the holiday of adultery. Eva kidnapped Nick and took her two children to Venice for confrontation. The trip to Venice ends with Nick and Eve falling in love with each other. <br /> <br /> The presentation of the journey from Germany to Venice between Nick and Eve was marked by the failure of the comedy. This not only looks senseless, but also hard. In the film, Nick tries to seek help in several ways, but it ends without result. Either the strangers around him behave like morons, or they are just stupid. <br /> <br /> Comedy also had a tendency to add unnecessary scenes to lengthen the story. Although some of the problems that can be solved with common sense, no one in the film uses common sense to solve the problem. They prefer to go through one big round to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> It fails so badly that even the beautiful landscapes in Venice cannot lift the filmâ€™s reputation.
