PLAN B has the appearance of a quickly-made, unedited, sloppy script for a film that attempts to enter the stage for the actors involved — an exit that should have been canceled from the very beginning. This is just another mafia "comedy", in which there is nothing new and which reduces the standards for participants. <br /> <br /> Joe Maloney (Paul Sorvino) is a crime boss who cares more about clothes and looks than about his business. control. His personal assistant, Mario (Anthony DeSando) is dumber than dirt, and his ignorance must be ridiculous. Maloney beat one of his debtors (who, as it turned out, is married to Fran's book - Diane Keaton), and Maloney takes Fran as an assistant to pay off her late husband's debt, becoming Maloney's "assassin". Fran is afraid of her own shadow and cannot carry out Maloney’s orders, deciding instead to transport her “freeloaders” to Florida to hide in her brother's house, James, until she understands what to do next. This alternative to killing three candidates is called Plan B, and Plan A is to kill them! The ending is quite predictable, as is each line assigned to the characters in the script. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton made many good films and is one of our most talented actresses and comedians, but here she screams and rushes and twitches, making her way through the ridiculous part that quickly becomes annoying to watch. Paul Sorvino, well, in general, Paul Sorvino type from other gangster films. The maintenance team is also allowed to play on the balcony in the widest farce, as you can imagine. What should be a comedy ends in folly and brute force. Directed by Greg Yaytanes should return to the television sitcoms: if this flimsy story had been turned into a half-hour concert, she might have a chance. Grady harp
