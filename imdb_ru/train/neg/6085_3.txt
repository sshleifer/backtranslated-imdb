In this paranoia-driven downfall, our reporter hero fights against difficult authorities, double-faced employees, UFO whipers, and silent aliens. (Despite the fact that he is able to control the mind and remove objects from afar, it takes three of them to control the control panel from about two dozen buttons.) The script copies from event to event, leaving many puzzles. Why are aliens blinded the dog? Why do they fry soldiers with radiation when they are only patrolling an empty landing pad? And what kind of space guys, standing their moon cheese, first kidnap ugly photographer, and not his model? Inquisitive mind wants to know! Writer-director Mario Garizzo, apparently, explored his subject, looking at a stack of UFO tabloids when he used the dual function of Sunn Classics. (Scanning on the closing screen can boast that it is based on real events ... just like Plan 9!). Some may feel burned by the sudden finale, but this should still draw attention to the conspiracies.
