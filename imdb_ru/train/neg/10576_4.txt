I was very excited when the premiere of this series took place in 2005. The package was very simple and attractive: each episode was a one-hour mini-movie shot by the famous horror director. Then, when I finally looked at them, it was a bit of a disappointment. There were some good episodes in this first season, but overall it was a mixed bag. I explained this learning curve and thought that season 2 would be much better. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was shocked. At least in the first season there were some good stories here and there. Season 2 (with the exception of "Black Cat" with excellent Jeffrey Combs) for me was a complete and complete loss. The “Sounds Like Sounds” episode may well be the worst thing I've watched on TV in the past 10 years, and most other episodes are not much better. I really hope that season 3 will turn it over next year, but I do not hold my breath.
