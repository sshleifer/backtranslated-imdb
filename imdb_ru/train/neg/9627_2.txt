Okay, I love Ben Stiller very much, although I am very fond of Jennifer Aniston. I do not think this girl can act in the least. In each film or comedy film in which I saw it, it is very difficult to pass by its fake play. Looks like she just stands there reading the script. This film had only one good thing, and that is what Ben Stiller was in it. This plot is both used and abused, it is ridiculous. How many films does this type of plot have? Can we say "Forces of Nature"? Not only is the plot so old, but the result is so predictable, itâ€™s boring. I knew everything that should have happened before it happened. It was boring, but watching Stiller is always nice!
