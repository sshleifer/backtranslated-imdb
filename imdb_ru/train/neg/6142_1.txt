Gymkata is without a doubt one of the worst films ever made. But not a bad kind of bad movies. It's so terrible, it's fun to watch and laugh. Kurt Thomas clearly has no lucrative career in acting. He has to go back to the gym. But who can forget such memorable scenes as a tall bar with chalk, a stone horse, or a five-minute chase scene through a crazy village in slow motion. I do not think it should have been so bad, but who can say. This is not art, but if you want something light and fluffy that makes a good conversation, rent Himakta. Makes an evening of fun.
