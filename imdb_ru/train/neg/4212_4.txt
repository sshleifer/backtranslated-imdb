The beginning of this film is excellent, with a stunning sound and pleasant humor, but as soon as the film turns into animation, it quickly loses its appeal. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons why this happened, at least for me, was that the colors in most of the animations are too muted and too little contrast. That doesn't look good, at least on VHS. From time to time it flashes and looks great, but not often. In addition, characters come and go too quickly. For example, I would like to see more of Moby Dick. However, when the film begins to pull, it rises again with the entrance of the dragon, and then the film ends strong. <br /> <br /> In general, simply not memorable or not able to compete with the great animated films of the last decades.
