Keenan Ivory Wayans is probably one of the worst directors, I swear, he has no real knowledge on how to make films. He made one brilliant film, and it is a scary film. The scary movie 2 was fine too, but everything else Keenan did was a real disaster. avoid such names as do not be a threat to the southern center, drinking the juice in the hood ..... I know what title !!! Obviously, this film also, just everything that has the name Kinans in the credits. <br /> <br /> It was a half hour of stupid nonsense that never made me laugh. just trust me on this, maybe women may like this movie a little because of some things that happen, but in general this movie will never please those who have good taste for movies ........ 1 / 10 .......
