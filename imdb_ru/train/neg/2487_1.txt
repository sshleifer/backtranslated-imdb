Take Rambo, mix with Miami Vice, cut the budget by about 80%, and you have something a few ten-year-old boys could come up with if they have a large backyard and too much access to Penthouse. . Policeman and ex-commando McBain (Bussey, and with a name like McBain, you know that he is just as rude as them) is recruited to search for an American supertank that was stolen and hidden in Mexico. Captured with a tank were tough sergeant. Major O'Rourke (Jones) and McBain's former love Devon (Flugel), the commanding officer, and now meat for depraved terrorists / spies / drug dealers who have no sense of propriety, blah, blah, blah. For an action movie with horny sex there is a lack of action and little sex. The main joke is that McBain always shoots and survives, keeping the bullets as souvenirs. Apparently, the authors did not see the “Magnificent Seven” (“The man for us is the one who gave him that face”), and did not think to give Macbain even the appearance of intelligence. Even for a state employee, production values ​​are small, with distant shots during a dialogue and very little movement. The main prop, the tank, is foolish enough to produce Ed Wood. Flugel, who may have been blonde Julia Roberts (she played a much larger role in Crime History than Julia!) Must go from simple to scared to strike, and come back again, immediately noticing it. Jones, who was in an amazing array of movies, pretty much goes right here. Both he and Bucy probably just wanted some money and a couple of laughs. Look for the talented future actor Danny Trejo (“The Heat”, “Once Upon a Time in Mexico”) in a stereotypical, formidable role. Too boring even for guilty pleasure, “Bulletproof” is still noisy enough to play when you leave the house, but you want people to think that someone is at home.
