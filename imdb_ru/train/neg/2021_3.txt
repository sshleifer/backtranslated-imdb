Ronald Coleman won an Oscar for best male role for his stunning performance as a popular theater actor who completely loses himself in his roles, especially as Shakespeare Othello. The critically acclaimed George Cukor film has a marvelous lineage written by the remarkable team of Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. Unfortunately, the witty banter here turns out to be shy, and the backstage business is overripe. Miklos Ro≈æa also won an Oscar at his own expense, and Shelly Winters has some great moments in a tough waitress (when theatrical Coleman holds her breath, she asks him: "What are you? Some kind of nut?"). Otherwise, this scenario is terribly obvious, surprisingly complex and not very funny. * 1/2 of ****
