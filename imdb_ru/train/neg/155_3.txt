This is not so much a film as a large budget of children's television. As far as I can tell, a villain is a giant swarm of chocolate espresso. This theory seems to be supported by the fact that subtitles call it "insomnia." When it was first mentioned that insomnia had destroyed civilization, I thought, “Wow! A film about nihilistic martial arts! ”But there is no such luck. Although you should consider this an experimental movie when the villain is strangled by the old man’s long white eyebrows. Zu Warriors has exactly the same meaning, regardless of whether the subtitles are enabled or not. This is not a good sign. I found that the special effects are somewhere between Ray Harryhausen and Xena: Warrior. Primitive.
