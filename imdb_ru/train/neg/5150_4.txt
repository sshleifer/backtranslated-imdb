I got a DVD from the library in the hope of getting a good idea of ​​how things are in the background in a major opera production. I have to say, I was very disappointed. The subject had such great potential. Kits in the production of Wagnerian must, of necessity, be thought out and impressive, and the history of their creation and use could be an excellent educational experience. Instead, what we get is a jumble of clips of people moving around large decoration objects, vaguely helps along with a comment that could not hold my attention. I listened, first of all, background music clips from operas. I was impressed with the tremendous effort required to stage such a performance - which really met quite well, and the next time I am in the opera, I’m sure I’ll remember this part if this video - but I’ve been somewhat deceived by lack of detailed comments and explanations.
