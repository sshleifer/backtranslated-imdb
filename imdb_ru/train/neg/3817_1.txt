Seriously. This is one of the silliest family shows of all time. <br /> <br /> The plot. A family without a mother and three "dads" brings up three little girls in San Francisco, California. <br /> <br /> Characters - Danny’s neat freak, loving Joey, Jesse’s obsessive hair, Michelle's spoiled brat, stupid DJ, and almost normal Stephanie. The creators of this show really want you to hate the characters, right? <br /> <br /> So I don't think anyone should watch this show. I only laughed for only a few moments during the whole show, and I think that instead of a lethal injection, all criminals should be forced to watch this show, torture is much more serious than anything else. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10 or: D
