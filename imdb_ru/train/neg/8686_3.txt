I mark this as a “spoiler” only because of some of my comments on the content of the show, and not to the content itself. <br /> <br /> When I read comments, it becomes obvious that these Republicans somehow tolerate the show. But neglect it, while the Democrats seem to enjoy their so-called truthfulness. Even one reader (it seems so) actually indicates that he believes that these events occurred or could have happened when Bush was in elementary school. <br /> <br /> Regarding the content that I see, trying to be neutral in that the group that made this series should really be Bush haters. In the episode I last saw, s02e03, he showed that the program had to be compiled long before McCain became the leader in the nomination; because all the other former leaders also figure. <br /> <br /> Another thing that caught my attention was the use of the add-in in cabinets. I thought that the series, for sure, was made in Europe, and not in the USA, because I don’t know of a single house in the USA, where there would be no built-in wardrobes, and, most likely, in the houses of artists. <br /> <When I watch the show, yes, I really get involved in it, I'm amazed to see that there must be a tremendous desire of the authors to do everything possible to discredit our president. Of course, there are problems that most Americans agree on, but that’s not a reason to be so hated at public shows around the world. Perhaps now this show and network have set the trend, so if Obama or Hillary came in, would they continue to produce and spread the same “humor” about them? <br /> <br /> Another comment on the comments from the commentator If in the 2000 elections there were some changes, then, according to this author, he was so sure that there would be a completely different acceptable president. Wow, wishful thinking on his part. As for the events of 911, I believe that this was triggered back when Clinton was president, and I don’t understand how, if Gore was president, everything would be different.
