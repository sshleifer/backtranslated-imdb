*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Juggernaut is a British "thriller" released in the United States by First National. Karloff is Dr. Sartorius, who must leave his research because his funds have dried up. Karloff is forced to retreat to France and begin medical practice. He is offered by an indulgent woman who wants to get rid of her much older husband. She knows that Karloff needs money. <br /> <br /> Karloff agrees to this offer and soon becomes her husband’s personal doctor. All this time, my wife jokes about the city with a local bad playboy. Karloff finally introduces an old geyser to the core, and it begins. However, his son (from another marriage) arrives a few days before the murder and learns that the will has been changed. When he spills the beans to his wife, she becomes infuriated and even bites her son’s hand. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, nurse Karloff lost the place of the hypo that Karloff used to kill the old man. When Karloff finds out that he has no money, he asks his wife to poison his son. The nurse suspects Karloff and finds the missing hypo. The analysis reveals poison, but not quite in time, as Karloff kidnaps the nurse. <br /> <br /> In short, the nurse runs away, gets the police and rescues a son who is to be injected. Karloff Instead, Karloff introduces himself and dies. <br /> <br /> This film has a few positive points. Karloff is obsessed and plays the kind of mad doctor he did in Devil Teams and The Man Who Lived Again. However, it is strange to see how he walks with difficulty and slightly stooped. We will never know why he is going this way. I suspect the director thought this made him more sinister. <br /> <br /> An actress who plays a two-time wife replays something terrible. She has a French accent. Despite the fact that she overdoed her badly, you still manage to hate her (or maybe you hate her for her actions ...). <br /> <br /> Slightly below average for Karloff's car. If you buy a copy of Sinister Cinema VHS, the sound is a bit jerky.
