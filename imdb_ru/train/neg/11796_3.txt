Nothing more on tv? Are you really bored? Well, then see Phat Beach. However, do not rent it and definitely DO NOT buy it. That would be a big mistake. <br /> <br /> I watched it on TV and in some moments I laughed. I did not laugh for a long time and did not laugh much. However, there were subtle jokes and comments that I laughed at. If you're looking for a very funny movie "hood", watch Friday. If you're looking for a powerful emotional film (something that this film is trying to ... sort of), look for something like wedding dreams or Jason's Lyrics. If for some reason you are watching good black “booty” go see Dominic Simone’s porn movie, because nudity in this movie almost does not exist. However, if you have nothing to do, and this is by telegram, continue and look. You will be slightly surprised. <br /> <br /> *** 3 of 10 ***
