I love horror movies. I can even appreciate most cheeses (look at this, 9 out of 10 horror films are currently cheese), but it was just ridiculous. A terrible game, a terrible letter, completely empty and incredible characters (there are no Meisner actors here!) And the complete absence of a sufficient number of bodies. I would like to save 79 minutes of my life, which I wasted. At least, the Crook brothers are accurately named. The only good thing in the whole movie is to watch Alicia Silverstone want to be hit in the face. The way it EVER got to Sundance is completely confusing to me. Most of the plot was absolutely unreal, even by the standards of the cutting film. I mean, come on! Who would rush to get a cheap earring 10 seconds after the creepy pursuer left their doorstep? Lame.
