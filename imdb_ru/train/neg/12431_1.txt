I would like to say that curiosity got the upper hand. If I only saw the trailer, I could tell you the whole plot of the film; I could save myself the most senseless one hour and forty minutes in my life and about twenty dollars. This film was a disaster waiting to happen, and this confuses Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The film shows a vivid ignorance of reality. For example, a race car with a remote control of this child travels throughout the area and even enters this house. It is even covered with clothes. Is it not reasonable to believe that the remote control can no longer transmit a signal in such circumstances? Hollywood clearly did not believe it. Common logic and any concept of electronics dictate the opposite; I doubt that the race car could even get to the street, not to mention the house across the street. Another unrealistic trait is the lack of intelligence that criminals possess. Why are these criminals rocket makers in all these films until they meet an eight year old child? Should a child be the smartest person in a film, not a professional terrorist? Please, in the Matrix more reality. Also, the leader puts his real gun and “accidentally” raises a plastic gun; Apparently, he could not distinguish. Even with a glove you can do it. The fact that they look the same means nothing; then there are other feelings than sight. The traps are also unreal; if one of them really worked, the criminals would be dead. But Hollywood intends to "laugh" at the "funny" results of the traps. I did not laugh; I sighed and rolled my eyes. <br /> <br /> But I recommend this film to anyone who thinks he has seen a really bad movie; the film that they saw will be similar to citizen Kane compared to this. Otherwise, skip this one for your pride. Home Alone 3 also raises the question. We all know the stars of Alex Linz in the film, but he also wrote it?
