I saw this film last night (about 102 minutes) and I don’t know what kept me in its place. I think I just expected that the film with the Gear will eventually have some value, but nothing of value appeared on the screen. This story is a stupid excuse to throw a shot behind the scenes of slavery and torture. There is no character in the film who would do something similar to real life. The cutting “style” relies on jumps, mini-flashbacks and overprints to give weight to this senseless gang of sadists, who have been running for years, and the SURPRISE leader is the “victim” of the executed murderer. I do not understand how Gere, a Buddhist, was involved in this cruel sexist trash.
