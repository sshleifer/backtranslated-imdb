Minor and extravagant (haha!) The horror of the 80s, as if there were thirteen of a dozen, but still it may seem funny if you look it in the right state of mind. The special effects are tasteless, acting is terrible, and the script seems to miss a couple of important points! The “brain” occurs in a typical quiet American town where every teenager works at the same diner and where a tough guy in high school flushes cherry bombs down the toilet. It is here that a television guru named Dr. Blake and his delightful pet begin the search for mind control on a national scale. Under the brand of “independent thinkers,” the giant cheesy brain sends waves through television sets and makes innocent viewers kill! How cool is that? Now it's up to the rebel teenager to save the world! The funny thing about the story is that he never explains where Dr. Blake and his monstrous brain actually came from. There are obvious references to extraterrestrial life, but that is all. Fur, who needs a background in such a film, right? Unfortunately, there is not much bloodshed, and the “evil” brain looks like a huge puppet sock. The only more or less interesting element for horror lovers is to look at the actors and film crew who shot this film. Director Ed Hunt and writer Barry Pearson are the very same people who made Bloody Birthday (my guilty pleasure) and Plague. Both of these films are much better, and they wisely decided to retire. The most familiar person in the cast is undoubtedly the great David Gale, whom horror fans will worship forever for his role in Re-Animator. A girl named Kristina Kossak provides a nudity factor, and she is obviously an excellent talent? Her repertoire includes exactly 3 films, THIS is her “masterpiece”. In her debut, she was credited as a “runaway model,” and in the movie “3 Men and a Child,” her character is referred to as “one of Jack's girls.” I really wonder how she relates to her acting career?
