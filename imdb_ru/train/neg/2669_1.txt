I rarely go online to comment on a movie. But I can not understand how it was done. Who made it? How could they have thought they were able to make a feature film? Did they spend a weekend at a film school, get a good big check from dad and kidnapped David Badiel’s family one by one until he agreed to that? Or was he by chance a longtime relative / friend doing it out of pure, inappropriate kindness? I don't care, I don't want to know. Even he looks completely confused, muttering his lines and hiding his face from the camera. At the same time, the DOP must have been the Neighbors' guarantor, it seemed that there was absolutely no sound design, the script, direction and editing were terrible, and, frankly, the apathy that crushes me right now means that I don’t I may be concerned about spending more of my life thinking about this film.
