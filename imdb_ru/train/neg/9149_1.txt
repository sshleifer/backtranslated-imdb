There is absolutely nothing in this film that even a tiny bit of talent would show. No one in him has ever tried to act before, even the extras in the cafe look as if they were stuck in place. Nothing looks rehearsed. The quality of the film is terrible. Most of the “action” takes place in narrow corridors or apartments with an operator programmed as an afterthought, shaking a cheap camera back and forth between the “actors” while they deliver their lines. No tripod and microphone, the sound quality is terrible. Even the Manos is better than this, at least they had the proper equipment. What happens there is simply lost in the production disorder. <br /> <br /> Stick to home videos, preferably made by some 5-year-old child, trying the video function on a new phone with daddy's camera. You have a long search to find a film more inept than this.
