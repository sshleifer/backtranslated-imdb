This film had all the elements to be a clever, sparkling comedy, but for some reason it took the blunt path. Perhaps he didn’t really know who his audience was: but it’s hardly a male film given the cast and plot, but he’s too rude and stupid to appeal to women completely. <br /> <br /> If you saw Legally Blonde and her sequel, then it looks like a stunningly horrible sequel. Great actors like Luke Wilson should expect better material. Jessica Simpson, too, could handle a lot more. Rachel Lee Cook and Penelope Ann Miller are languishing in supporting roles that are more stupid than funny. <br /> <br /> Many things in this film were drawn by numbers, various assembly cliches, last minute “misunderstanding”, even a children's holiday chaos. It just talks about lazy scripting. <br /> <br /> This movie may be enjoyable if you don’t take it seriously, but it’s so blatant that it can do better than you are likely to become upset and more and more disappointed when scenes pass by.
