The film, written and filmed by Neil Young "Greendale", is a little more than an 87-minute music video, filmed on about a dozen pieces of songwriter. Instead of dialogue, the film relies solely on Yang's texts, which are largely permeated with social and political commentary to tell the “story” while the actors play the scenes. <br /> <br /> Given the hammy performances and shoddy grit in the picture, the effect is equivalent to Young blowing up some of his home movies and releasing them for public consumption. Although the film is said to have a “story”, we actually have no idea what is going on, mainly because of the unfinished view of the film, the lack of dialogue and amateur incompetence of acting. All that we get for eighty-seven minutes is a bunch of aging hippies silently jumping in a rambling narrative, while Yang's songs play endlessly on the soundtrack. It all turns into a tedious task of indulging yourself. "Greendale" gives a bad reputation for low-budget filmmaking from Hollywood.
