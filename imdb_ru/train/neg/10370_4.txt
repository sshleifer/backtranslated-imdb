I am truly sorry for every second of time I lost while watching this movie. Unfortunately, it is always difficult for me to turn off the film as soon as I started watching it. Especially when it’s such a classic or what people call a classic. I think this is one of those films that every movie lover had to watch at least once, so I watched it. Don't get me wrong, I love Humphrey Bogart and his wife Lauren Bacall both as a couple and as actors, but in my opinion, this film was a big deception. Not a very good story, no spy movie, no romantic love story. Well, not even a convincing mix of both these genres. The only thing that caused the tension was that it was unclear whether the "Gods" and Bacall would end up together or partially between each other. I think “to have and not to have” is very overvalued, and Bogart was in many of the best films in the 1940s.
