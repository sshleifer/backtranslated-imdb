I very much looked forward to this movie. This is a good family movie; However, if the editing team of Michael Landon Jr. did the job better, the film would be much better. Too many scenes out of context. I hope there is another film from the series, they are all very good. But, if one more thing is done, I beg them to take care of the editing. This story was everywhere and did not seem to have a center. Unfortunately, the other films in the series were great. I like the story of Willy and Missy; They are both excellent role models. Plus, the viewers' romantic side always enjoys a good love story.
