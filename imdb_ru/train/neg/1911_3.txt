The formula of the film is about a guy who wants a girlfriend, a guy who will lie to be near a girlfriend, a guy who will find a best friend to help in an outrageous way (comedus reliefus, no?), To help fool a girl, etc. D. It was done to death and, with the rare exception of a few excursions with a rating of z, it was done better. <br /> <br /> Leaving aside the plot, the potential is attractive, and there are a couple of good moments. Jonathon Schaech did better, and his game here was close to calling. Not a complete loss, but nothing new in this cool affair.
