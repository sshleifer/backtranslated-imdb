It is difficult to understand what happened in the heads of Per Christensen and Morten Lindberg when they wrote “Gainigers from space” - the film is announced as a comedy, but there are no real jokes except for coarse character names (captain B. Dick, Sergeant shaved balls). The rest of the film is (apparently) an unintentionally funny story with ridiculously unsynchronized behind-the-scenes shots (the “actors” mostly read their lines without a hint of feelings), “futuristic” computer displays, full of spelling errors, and the plot, almost meaningless. <br /> <br /> Although 65% of viewers gave this film an ideal 10 out of 10, this is the exact opposite of a good movie. It may be AMAZING to watch with some friends, but this film deserves only about 2 out of 10 ... a little higher than the lower possible rating just because of the fact that the authors somehow managed to get some black guys to star in this film.
