Ben, who works outside the city, is convinced that his sister was brutally murdered and wants to bring her killer to justice, but Stephen is approaching him, who believes that his sister has become a victim of the werewolf cult. So, Ben, his sister's best friend, and Stephen go to Transylvania to put an end to this evil. <br /> <br /> This is an incredibly awful class B material, and I wondered how it was released at all. This makes the original “Howl” look like a masterpiece. What Christopher Lee was thinking about, as it must have been his worst performance I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> There was something wrong with this really cheap movie, starting with Annie’s really boorish and wooden performances. McInroy, Reb Brown, Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning (not to forget Lee), crappy fashion (these are Sunnites), cheap and inconclusive special effects, poor use of lighting, humor ... if there were any, 80s crappy music (part the film simply focuses on the game of an unknown group), the orgies of a werewolf make a spectacle, and this is a tedious story with a flat and annoying dialogue. I thought that if it was so bad, it would be terribly funny, but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The good news was that the location and the settings of the film looked great, but that’s all ... in fact, I’ll add a short sweep of Sybil Danning. <br /> <br /> During Finally, the band plays their shitty song during a weird editing of scenes from the film, and I ask the question, why? <br /> <br /> This is a terrible mess, but at least it's not boring. <br /> <br /> 1/5
