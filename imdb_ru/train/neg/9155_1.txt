This movie was the worst movie I've ever watched. It was like a “homework” for a movie lesson. He completely misses the mark when it comes to the “message” he is trying to convey. The characters are too exaggerated, they play poorly, and as for the plot ... well, this is completely ridiculous. The cover shot made me think that it could be a decent movie, a co-actor is beautiful, and that’s all. The moral of this movie: NEVER COURT A FILM ON THIS COVER! Save your time, money and energy and make your own home movie and you will be in a much better position than me. It was painful to watch, and, frankly, I am surprised that someone will spend money to earn and distribute it!
