I was delighted with the fact that I was watching this film, expecting it to be a continuation of the cult classic series “Private Lessons”, which depicts the dream of any male teenager. <br /> <br /> “Private Lessons II” have nothing to mention in the title I mention. This is just a simple click of Cinemax that will not change your life. There is only one hot sex scene on the roof, but that is all. I watched it a long time ago, but believe me, this is the usual boring soft kernel click. <br /> <br /> Women are hot, but not enough to rent or buy a movie. My advice is to watch this only if it is broadcast by cable.
