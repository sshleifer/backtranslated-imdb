This film is not worth the film on which it was photographed. The dialogue is flat, filled with cliché, overly used lines, and issued by amateur actors who seem to be reading the script for the first time. Unsustainable, wobbly movie style - cheap imitation of visual effects in the “Ring” style Characters do not even behave like a normal person. For example, a character who is looking for her twin sister in her house, sneaks through the front door, crawls around the house, all frightened and sobbing, and she has never even phoned her sister's name to find out if she is at home. What kind? You might think that she just buried her sister instead of looking for her. Too many memories of her childhood. Too many unnecessary memories are a typical sign of an amateur director. In fact, it is ridiculous to watch the numerous shots of a woman who drives her car down the street, along the driveway, around this corner, here, there, oh, side view, now front view. Already enough. You might think that you are watching a TV commercial for Solaris! Scary film. 0 out of 100. I am very sorry for those who spent the money to create this film or to watch it.
