The murderer, the cannibal rapist, was killed by a madman at the scene of his last murder. A cult was going to his grave with plans to resurrect him, writing to the grave. This, of course, works, and he wakes up, tearing off the guy's penis, and returns to his old ways of killing with a completely new kind of zombies. Two policemen, one of whom is a little crazy about the scum of the city and has problems with drugs, have returned to business. Two of the original members of the cult are also trying to stop the killer by raising another dead thing. Thinking what they submitted, they leave, but a plastic pupa emerges from the grave, which was used in the original resurrection. It sounds a bit strange, but this is not nonsense. <br /> <br /> The game is terrible, and one of the policemen is the same guy who plays Dr. Vincent van Gore on Goreâ€™s TV shows, and he's just as terrible as the annoying cop in this movie. Another policeman almost tries to bring out his terrible features. Now I'm all for a low-budget movie, but this movie is just awful. If it was not very easy on the eyes, ladies and their nudity, I probably would have fallen asleep. There is some blood here, but this is nothing more than an animal gut, which is put on the victim's stomach. On the other hand, zombie makeup looks great, and his foot-long penis, which he uses to rape his victims, is sometimes funny. There is also a semi-decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll. The chipmunk voice doll is the dumbest thing I've ever seen in a movie. This is just a plastic toy on a fishing line. <br /> <br /> The end is very bad. You expect the killer to have a lot more fights than he does. God knows how they earned enough money to make a sequel. <br /> <br /> 4/10
