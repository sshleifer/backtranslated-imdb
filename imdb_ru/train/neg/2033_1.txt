If I could give it less than 1, I would. Do not worry about renting; If someone gives you a DVD, burn it. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible movie. A complete waste of even a digital "movie." I had better seen 12 year old boys on Youtube. Lommel claims that he wrote this; if so, he is a classic case of someone who is illiterate in two languages. The plot does not exist, the dialogue basically shouts, camera work is some kind of an attempt at skillful sense with senseless cutting of completely unrelated jumps either on the scenes of industrial transport or in some strange evil separation of a young woman. <br /> I usually can follow a not quite obvious plot or see the goal in a “creative” film - I like David Lynch. <br /> <br /> This film either far surpasses my limited understanding abilities that I missed it or it is absolutely pointless. I think this is “let's see if we can take a headline that will be released soon, and make a strange split on it, and see if we can get some of the money.” <br /> <br /> I can't understand why Lionsgate was even worried about it. Absolutely useless, it is so bad that I will not shoot someone else by the same director.
