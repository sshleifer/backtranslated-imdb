The cast, although nothing special, everyone is doing well, the story seems like a good idea, the script is tolerable, and the end has a pretty good twist; so what's wrong with him? <br /> <br /> For a start, the special effects are really bad (if it was done in the 60s), it might look normal, but in 2003 there was simply no excuse for such bad visual effects. It makes me laugh that the cover of the DVD very proudly declares "from the creator of special effects Jeepers Creepers". <br /> <br /> Secondly, the direction is weak, this film simply does not reflect the essence of the story, the doctor feeding the souls of prisoners of the hospital to the devil (or creatures like a demon) must be tense or frightening; it's just not like that. <br /> <br /> On the whole, this is a pretty bad film, and although it is tolerable, and sometimes a little funny, itâ€™s probably still better to be left alone. <br /> <br /> A pretty sad 4/10
