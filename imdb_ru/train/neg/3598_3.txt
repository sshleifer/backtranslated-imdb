Do you know when you look at your collection of old videos, and understand that there are some that you have only seen once or twice, and you cannot remember whether they are worth the time it takes to watch them? Alibi was / was one of those films; I found this not so long ago and decided that I could give it a chance. I'm not quite sure if I am satisfied with my decision ... on the one hand, the film is really very bad, on the other, now I have another free tape ... yes, you understand. The plot is predictable and in no way original. Walking is bad. The acting is bad, but this is not surprising, since the two main characters are the former stars of the series ... they are used to replaying. Characters are poorly written clichés. The film even manages to spoil the easiest way to impress me (through the film): court scenes. Even those who do not cause a single emotion for or against any cardboard character. The film simply has no real redemptive qualities ... even the dialogue is bad. The fact is that there are so many cliches in it that it is ridiculous. And this is the only thing that raises it above the rating of 1/10: (albeit unintentionally) the comic relief of many cliches and stereotypes. I did not pay much attention to the film, but almost every time I looked at the screen, there was something to laugh about. One final note: I thought about using the “Tori Spelling String Cannot Act” line as a one-line resume, but I think everyone knows this, so I chose the current one because it is more informative. In general, a very bad movie, but not the worst, if you have nothing more to do and if it is on TV. Good for a few laughs if you can sit through this. 3/10
