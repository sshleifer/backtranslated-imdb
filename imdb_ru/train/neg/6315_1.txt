This sleek, sexy movie is a must see. Only after a few views can truly understand the uniqueness of this film. Personally, I enjoy the narrator for his intelligent, non-subject, narrative style. The introduction immediately captures you and keeps you on the edge of your place throughout the entire movie. It gives an excellent insight into the world of students and allows viewers to truly “connect” with the inner horror that this film demonstrates. The script itself perfectly holds the film together. Not only children, but also older people will gain a deeper understanding of the subjects being taught and a modern understanding of sexual experience. In anticipation of his time and innovative in cinematography, he certainly defines the word "masterpiece".
