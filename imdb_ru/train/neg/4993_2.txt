Went to watch this movie, expecting "nothing special", still very disappointed. The opening scene promised a small action with a touch of comedy. It keeps you waiting for the first half, because until that moment you expect that now it's time to start the action. Well, nothing like this happens. The film delays, and the ending simply knocks you down to the point where you get annoyed. I wonder what the director was thinking. There was no point. The film was lacking in all aspects, there was no real storyline, and it seemed very empty, even if Rambo was in it, I donâ€™t think that it could have helped the rating at all. There is simply no logic in the film. The perfect way to spend your time and money. By far the most annoying movie I've ever seen, and I'm sure there will be others who will have the same point of view after sustaining it. Definitely not for people who have a little sense of cinema left in them.
