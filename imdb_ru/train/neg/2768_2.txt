This film was terrible. <br /> <br /> They had no characters at all, and the plot was terribly played out. It was a certain sleeper. You might expect the action films in such a film to become his strengths, but D-Wars will surprise you even with the disappointment in this department. <br /> <br /> Also, the action was just a step above the low budget porn movie. And I mean it seriously. <br /> <br /> I was really happy to see the end credits on this because it was so bad !!! Please, whatever you do, do not waste your time and money on such a crappy movie like D-Wars.
