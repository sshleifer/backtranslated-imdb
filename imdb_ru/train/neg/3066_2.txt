This is a terrible remake of the marginal, but very beloved film of the early 70s. I saw the original at least 6 times. The 1997 version is a 20-minute film, “downtrodden” in 2 hours or whatever. Shoddy storyline, which, by the way, is completely different from the original. The main involvement of the government was contrived. There is no flow from one scene to another. In the original, you can go buy a beer or get into the bathroom and at the same time keep up. <br /> <br /> Removing the oil pan on the car took only a few hours. It takes many times longer than in real life. The guys from the car notice this. In addition, the fool or fools who decided to destroy the 1968 Charger and insult the 1970 Challenger must be killed with a blunt bullet. The fact that they are not “people out of the car” is painfully obvious and their death will not be upset. <br /> <br /> The actors had no emotions, everything was trimmed and dried. One step above monotony. Barmitas are more exciting and energetic. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, a radio DJ declared that the Challenger had bulldozed in 180 or 185 (??). This is a complete trash. Can you say aerodynamics, or lack thereof ?? Hahaha !! This movie is a joke. Do not waste your time watching this.
