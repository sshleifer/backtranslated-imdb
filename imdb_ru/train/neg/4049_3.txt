I didn’t like this car by Murray when it was first released in the 80s, so I tried to watch it again to see if I had a disgust with this film before my cinematic tastes in the 80s or were they “Stripes” is just a bad movie. Well, the verdict is rendered, and The Stripes is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Now The Stripes may have been an innovative comedy in the early 80s, and people who have gone through basic training may like it. or who are fans of Bill Murray, but this is still a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Why is it bad? Mainly because The Bands should be a comedy, but this is not so funny. There are some laughter, but they are a bit far from each other. Most of the film is absorbed in a dramatic plot, which is incredibly confused and not very interesting. This disadvantage of comedy is especially noticeable if you are accustomed to more modern comedies, such as The Lead, who want to laugh in every part of the film. <br /> <br /> “The Bands” are even more affected by Bill Murray and Harold Ramis lacking acting skills. Bill Murray is a great comedian, but he was not a very convincing dramatic actor at this stage in his career, and Harold Ramis plays Harold Ramis. These two are just not good enough as actors to carry the dramatic arch of the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, most of the comedy that is in “The Bands” revolves around the self-centered, intelligent Alex Bill Murray. a male character, so if you don’t find this character funny (like I didn’t), you won’t find much of that little comedy that is in The Stripes is also funny. <br /> <br /> “The Stripes” is a film of the era, he didn’t grow old very well and shouldn’t be watched. If you want to see the comedy "buddy" of the early 80s, I would recommend "Stir Crazy". As in the case of “The Stripes”, the humor in “Stir-Mad” is not as fast as in modern comedies, but, unlike “The Stripes,” it has grown much older and can still be seen as a result.
