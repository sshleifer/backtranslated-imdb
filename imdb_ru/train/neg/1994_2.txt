This film, originally released on Christmas 1940, has long been considered lost. A very bad copy came up and turned into a CD that is now on sale. Do not buy it! The film is unspeakably awful. Casting is bad, the script is terrible, the direction is terrible. <br /> <br /> Roland Young sings and dances. And that was the highlight. <br /> <br /> This movie may have been intentionally lost.
