Well, it's hard to add a comment after reading what's already here, but I feel I have to say something. I was not really looking for “spray,” as someone put it, or even “blood and guts / blood.” I have some respect for the relatives of the victims, although I really felt that the creator of the film did not. - They were nameless, faceless and meaningless. Just a vessel for Damer's sexual antics. <br /> <br /> I watched this film with painful curiosity, which makes me think: “What makes a guy a serial killer?” and also surprise by the details of Dahmer’s story, which I know very little about. People here seem to think that the film should not have covered the events of the Dahmer story. I.E. his story, what happened when he was caught, the consequences, etc., but this is important! You see, I assume that if you are American, you will know all this. We do not all live in America. To tell this story about such a person as he was obviously, DEMANDS what is told / shown at least SOME of the history and real events. This does not mean blood and courage, there are ways to show horrible things in the film with the help of subtexts or clever shooting, without resorting to blood. Without even touching on what he did (I learned more about how he reads user comments on this site!), The film seemed empty to me. A moment in time with a very small amount of substance. I would like to know if there is a film about a REAL Damer, because with its lack of direction, a VERY slow pace that NEVER changes, A strange image of homosexuality and a VERY unsuccessful absence of ANY attempt to end this, this film is Bad I would not recommend anyone to spend time to watch it. Defined 1 out of 10 (for actors!)
