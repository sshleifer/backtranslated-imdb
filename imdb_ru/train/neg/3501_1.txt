I understand the jokes well, they are just not good. The show is terrible. I understand this, and this is another terrible thing about it. The only cool character that was ever in the series was one tramp in this episode, but then I see another episode that includes this episode, and the show is terrible. This is not funny, not funny! I don’t want people to say “Only smart people get it,” because if they are so smart, why do they judge people they don’t even know, and say that they are not smart enough or intelligent enough to figure it out? It's like saying “the sky is red”, but never look out. But in any case, this is absolutely the worst show I've ever seen in my life, jokes are terrible, I mean, you can understand them, they are just awful, her argument is very unconvincing, her farting jokes and other body jokes fluids are really blunt and usually consist of really bad actions. I'm not sure that these “smart” people see this show, but judging others when they don’t even know anything about us is not exactly a smart comment.
