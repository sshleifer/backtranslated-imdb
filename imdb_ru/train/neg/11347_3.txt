Cult of the Cobra is now available on DVD in its original form, which fully reflects all the advantages of the film. Unfortunately, this does not mean much. <br /> <br /> He has a competent composition of second-rate people who justify themselves, as one would expect in these circumstances. It is effectively aimed, completely at sound scenes and stationary sets in the background of the studio. It looks good, but too hard, and on a scant 80 minutes it is still heavily supplemented. <br /> <br /> For example, an attack using a double cobra on the first of the GIs was certainly too much of one attack. <br /> <br /> The fact that Julia chose to marry Pete over Tom did not cost anything Tom immediately falls in love with Lisa, and she never has any reason to be jealous of Julia (and besides) . <br /> <br /> Julia’s “Women's Intuition” is presented as if it would lead to an important storyline development, but it is not. Similarly, Pete's investigation of the Cobra cults and the suspicion that briefly falls on Tom does not pursue any other purpose than to fill the screen time. <br /> <br /> These are just symptoms of the underlying problem. The film is structured as a mystery, but it is not. As soon as the curse is pronounced, we know exactly where the story is moving, so the characters remain painstakingly revealing what we already know. <br /> <br /> The ending is particularly lame. Julia is threatened purely by chance. Liza has no reason to want to kill her - she just finds herself in the wrong place at the wrong time. When Tom arrives at the very last moment to save her, it is not even clear whether she was threatened at all. Then he just gets rid of the cobra as any of the previous victims could have done. <br /> <br /> This is such an irrelevant little episode from the story that I found myself surprised at how it was filed on the ground. The studio is headed. Then it occurred to me. Someone said, “These Val Lewton films were very successful at RKO, so why don't we do this?” <br /> <br /> “The Cult of the Cobra” is clearly modeled on “Cats People”: mysterious, restless, A changeable woman falls in love with a hero, apparently frigid, kills people, causes suspicion of a friend of the hero and dies at the end. But “by pattern” does not mean “as good as” - by a wide margin. He copies, but does not understand what he is copying. <br /> <br /> Obviously, he is trying to use the discreet, thought-provoking style of Lewton, but this approach does not go down to history. Lisa is not Irene. It must be strange and mysterious, but there is nothing mysterious in it. We will see her after the first attack in Asia, so we immediately recognize her when she appears in New York. There is never any doubt about her goal. There is also no ambiguity as to whether it actually turns into a snake. <br /> <br /> Again, during her nightly yaw, we get not one, but two attempts at “buses”. None of them come off, because the director does not understand what the “bus” makes working, and, in any case, they happen to a stalker, and not to a persecuted person. <br /> <br /> These faint echoes of feline people give the Cobra Cult any small difference it may have, but they only draw attention to the gaping chasm between the original and the imitation. <br /> <br /> Plagiarism may be the most sincere form of flattery, but I doubt that Lewton or Tournai was especially flattered when this cool little passerby came out.
