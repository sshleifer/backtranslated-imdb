This child is pretty bad, but in no case does he make him a person who outwit adults and can prevent experienced thieves at every turn. No, he is not so much a fool as a child with serious emotional problems. A good couple who wants to adopt is rather tired of adopting him, and although the husband is a little more willing to give this child a chance that his mother does not have. Through the strange character Michael Richards and the always annoying Gilbert Gottfried, and you made a pretty bad movie with a few laughs here and there. I actually prefer the continuation of this film, as I like the fact that Amy Yasbek returned to herself as another, more likable character, because in this film there are one or many characters that are completely unattractive. Even a child is at first rather annoying in this, and they, too, calm him down a little in continuation. The plot is quite simple, though, since potential parents are going to adopt this child, which, in their opinion, is great when the party is hosting a shelter, when they leave, they soon realize that they have a small helium. Add to this this small helium that comes in contact with some convict. Not sure about this character, at first I thought it must be his real father or something like that. All is not well, but I will choose this ahead of Kalkin on any day of the week.
