This is one of those films that are shown on cable around two in the afternoon to entertain bored housewives while they are stroking. Actor's game of the second grade. Poor Matthew Modin seems to be moaning the whole movie. And God forbid Gina Gershon. Her accent is too strong. This is not like a real Englishwoman. It sounds forced and false, very similar to her game. She must stick to what she does best, a lesbian show dancer who plays in a rock and roll band and has a drug problem. Other characters are no better. They are two-dimensional. empty, stupid and stupid. How we should take care of these people. At some point, Christie Scott Cashman got lost in Central Park. Indeed? It is not so difficult to navigate in Central Park. Just follow any path. I not only did not care about ANY characters, but I also hated them. The only reason I even stayed with this train wreck was Fisher Stevens. Even his brilliant humor could not save this dying Fish. Each scene is a typical romantic comedy, and we have nothing left to surprise. The script was terrible, as was the acting. If you catch this fish, throw it back!
