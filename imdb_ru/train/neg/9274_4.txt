This sequel is a complete rehash of the first movie. Absolutely pointless movie. In fact, he took all the sceanrio from the first film, and they remade it in Omen IV, with the exception of the female antichrist this time. It even ends up just like the first! The music is too busy and interferes, and since it is largely a copy of Omen I, it is extremely predictable. This is not a terrible film, it is not terribly made, there are much worse films, it simply did not make any sense. The 2006 Omen remake is much worse, even more meaningless than this, so I think it is. If you had someone put a gun on your head and you had to watch this sequel or the 2006 film, I would choose that.
