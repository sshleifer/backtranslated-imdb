Just saw it yesterday at the Sao Paulo International Film Festival. Immediately before leaving, I came here to see how he was rated, and at that time it was 7.4, a pretty good indicator ... <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes I was impatient to go out (I never did of this), but I was embarrassed to do this because the producer of the film was on the show. <br /> <br /> I didnâ€™t like it, the dialogues are small and do not lead to anything, the characters are smaller than the dialogues, nothing Lead anywhere, and the worst and worst: a lot of Siemens and Organics advertisements for the film. Despite the fact that I had already paid to go to the cinema and entertain myself, I still have to be bombarded with the main character, chatting on the Internet, and the Siemens mobile phone that appears all the time on her laptop; or another character bathing or cutting hair, just so that Organics Shampoo is incredibly presented on the screen! All this would be tolerable if the plot, characters, romances - everything was good, but it was bad, very bad! Sex in the city "I do not know how to do." <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time and money.
