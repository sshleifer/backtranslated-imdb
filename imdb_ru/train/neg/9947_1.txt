This film was terrible. I swear they didn't even write the script, they just traced it through the whole movie. Ice-T was damn annoying. * SPOILERS Phht more like reasons not to watch it * They sit down and have breakfast for 20 minutes. he could have left for a long time. The land was heavy, it would be almost impossible to track him down without dogs. And when ICE-T is on this Hill and uses this Spaz-15 Assault SHOTGUN, how does its sniper rifle (and then chop down a tree with eight shells? It would take thousands of shells to cut down a tree of that size.) 100 yards. And they even saw the reflection. What reflected the light ?? I have not seen the opportunity for this thing. Also, when he was shot in the gut and he kept going, it was retarded, he would bleed right there. Plus the finale, where he puts a stone or a cigarette in a guyâ€™s barrel. It will not blow up and kill him. The bullet will still fire, killing the Ice T, but will ruin the barrel
