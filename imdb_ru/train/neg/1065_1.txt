On the recommendation of a friend, my wife and I invited another couple to this film. I really apologized to them - all four of us hated it and spent the whole time looking at our hours, waiting for the end of the film. Half the vignettes are fancy, with very little entertainment value. There were few scenes of Paris - for example, I was looking forward to a few photos of the Latin Quarter, but I could not find out. Most of the scene was inside the bar. No one in the theater laughed at anything and did not react at all. If you like weird, pretentious, pseudo-intelligent films, do not miss it. If you are as down-to-earth as I am, you will be sorry that you saw it.
