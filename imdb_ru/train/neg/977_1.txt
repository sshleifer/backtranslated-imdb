"Fever" is not a bad movie; This is a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Is it possible that the American audience and critics are so stunned and lobotomized by excrement that Hollywood shakes up that they will praise heaven, even a mediocre film, almost without laughter? This is the only reason why I can think about why this horrible romantic comedy (and I use this term fluently because there’s nothing funny about this movie) gets good reviews. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie, stunned by the fact that the writers Lowell Gantz and Babalu Mandel would have thought for a moment that their script was funny. <br /> <br /> Brilliant Nick Hornby usually translates film well. He adapted the film Fever for a British film featuring Colin Firth and Ruth Gemmell in 1997; Peter Hedges found Hornby’s voice in the film “About the Boy” (2002), and when, in 2000, High Fidelity was Americanized for the film, writers DV De Vincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg were not mistaken because they retained the essence of Hornby’s wit and humor. They shot one of the best films of the year. <br /> <br /> Why is the American version of “Fever Pitch” so painfully erroneous? The British version was not a masterpiece, but it was charming, funny, unexpected, and gave us two characters that we could love, respect and understand. <br /> <br /> But Ganz and Mandel cut out all the funny in the work of Hornby. Americanizing the story, they destroyed it, removing everything that was good and unique in the work of Hornby, and replacing it with ordinary tediousness. <br /> <br /> They turned a funny story into a formal romantic comedy, never deviating from a wretched formula once. Lindsay (Drew Barrymore) has three girlfriends, each of whom performs her own function. One is overweight, the second is cynical and ambitious, and the third is romantic. Want to guess how many male friends have Ben (Jimmy Fallon)? <br /> <br /> What made High Fidelity so funny was not only a good lead man and woman, but also support for auxiliary characters. In this “Fever Pitch”, six fellow friends don't do or say nothing particularly funny. They are so insignificant, they are not even decorative. The only reason they star in the film is because the formula requires it. Poor Ion Sky turns out to be Lindsay's buddy in an ungrateful role. Beautiful Skye must have wanted Lloyd Dobler to attack and take her. If you think Cusack could be a great Ben. Of course, Cusack is too smart to join such an extremely tedious scenario. <br /> <br /> In this film there is not a single lonely moment that seems original or not forced. Every turn of the plot is predictable, every unsuccessful telegraph joke. Ganz and Mandel are working for a laugh. The first 45 minutes are so painfully slow that you wonder if these guys understood that they were writing comedies. You can mark the plot twists in this movie with your own watch. It is as if Ganz and Mandel composed it with some kind of screening formula of the guru pasted on the wall. When they got to a certain page, they looked at the formula and said, "Well, the guru says that this should happen now." And Presto! <br /> <br /> Directed by Bobby and Peter Farrelli do not help the film. They have no idea how to present their story and characters (they convey the story of VO not to the main character, but to another guy who sits behind Ben in Fenway Park). Thanks to some extremely awkward writing, we have to watch Barrymore and Fallon stumble during their unfunny first meetings. <br /> <br /> Barrymore does cute and charming better than most. In her prime, she is as good as Goldie Hawn. But even her cutie can not save this unusually terrible film. She struggles to get a little energy and humor out of this story. After about 30 minutes of the film, Lindsay tells Ben: “You're funny.” The only explanation for her comment is that it was in the script. Ben Fallon never says anything remotely funny. Fallon is neither witty nor funny; when he makes a comedy, he overplays. <br /> <br /> Fallon was never good on Saturday Night Live. He was probably the least funny person on this show. Remember that slop sketch of a radio DJ who made all the voices? The only reason why Weekend Update worked from time to time was because the Fallon cohort, Tina Fey, knows something about comedy. <br /> <br /> Actors who think they are funny and behave so rarely, if ever, are actually funny. It's true about Fallon. He thinks he is hysterically funny when he barely laughs. His stuttering, self-doubt did not work on a small screen; on the big screen he loses. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Fallon, his role in this picture also requires several dramatic moments. If you thought his comedy is bad, wait until you get a load of his dramatic things. It is especially painful to look at two scenes - the first in the park, the second in front of Ben's school. Scenes require an actor with a bit of dramatic ability, but Fallon has neither the knowledge nor the ability to make them work. His range of emotions doesn’t even cover the gamut from A to B. <br /> <br /> Ben has no personality or depth. Often he comes across as a jerk. And not attractive in this. It is incomprehensible that Lindsay finds attractive in him. Compare Fallon's performance with Fert in the British version, and you will understand how awfully flat, unfunny and compelled Ben Fallon and how wrong he is for this role. Watching Fallon in "Fever Pitch" makes you think about the dramatic depth and comedy nuances of Ashton Kutcher! <br /> <br /> Just like High Fidelity, the Americanized Fever Pitch could work brilliantly. It just needed better writers, more competent directors and, definitely, a stronger, more funny, clever presenter. Do yourself a huge favor: avoid this rotten film; rent the 1997 British version and read the Hornby book instead.
