What to say about this movie. Well, this is a group of good students who use bad drugs and turn into criminals who sell more bad drugs to people. Two of these people have adverse consequences, as one turns into a poisonous avenger, and his girlfriend throws up some creature that grows in the basement of the school. That's all you need to do, and they stretch it for 84 minutes. This movie is pretty bad and should be blocked forever. Although this is not fair, some people like Tromy films, and they can watch them if they want. Trome movies for me are the worst movies. I just watched it out of painful curiosity.
