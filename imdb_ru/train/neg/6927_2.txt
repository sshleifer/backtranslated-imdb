Although I rated this film as 2 for showing a complete lack of effort in trying to create a quality horror film, it was 10 on an unintended ridiculous scale. I could not understand what was happening in the film or who such people were, but I didnâ€™t care, because I knew that in every scene there would be something that made me cry with laughter. The dialogue is minimal throughout the entire film, but I believe that this is because they started shooting without a script. The lack of a storyline makes the film extremely versatile. It doesn't matter if you sit down and watch the movie from start to finish, or if you watch it in rewind, you will be confused with pleasure. I especially like the scene in which prisoners take turns running around the street, beating each other with sticks. I believe the doctor calls this treatment. Genius!
