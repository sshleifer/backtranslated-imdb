"ASTONISHING" shouts the LA Times from the front of the DVD box. They must have meant the fact that such a pathetic piece of shit was ever released. The film revolves around a group of girls who have a disease that causes them to become cannibals and kill innocent people in order to stay alive. Their skin exfoliates throughout the entire film, we also see severed legs, heads, etc., which are about as convincing as the set of Fluffy Felt for Halloween. There are a lot of talking people, a little human kitchen and some strange zombie hunter guy who jails skin sick patients in his closet, is tied to a chair, and then hits them on the head and cuts them into pieces ... <br /> <br /> You get the picture. Given that the acting talent is not exposed at all, and the blood is ridiculously unreal, what is the meaning of all this farrago? Looking at the video again, the guy in charge is the "director of the underground cult." Is it not like those strange religious cults in which you brainwashed, forcing you to think when the opposite is obvious? Because this is the only possible reason why I can enjoy viewing the write-off of taxes. Then in the same paragraph, he compares himself to Mike Lee, Ken Loach and George Romero. Hahahahah, oh, stop it. Now you're just stupid. <br /> <br /> Do you like this movie? Are you offended by the above opinion? If so, you must be a member of this cult. Do they pay your salaries? Do they let you see other family members? Do they make you watch Andrew Parkinsonâ€™s films until you think that he is the best director since A. Hitchcock? Say ... it sounds like a special brewery for me. And say hello to a Los Angeles critic when you return to your colony, aren't you? 0/10
