Do not waste your money or your time on this pathetic piece of film disguised as cinematography. When every third word is devoted to obscene language, and there is no real plot, as well as the cast of old actors who still give The same dated performances from the past that have not evolved in their careers, leave a lot to be said. I was expecting something better from the award-winning actor Benicio del Toro. The vision that other Puerto Ricans may have will be irreversibly distorted by such garbage as Maldemora. The stupid word in the film at the moment can be used to emphasize this point of view and can even be funny or sad depending on its context (see, for example, the film “Elsa and Fred”), but it should not penetrate the plot. The film is a complete embarrassment, and in this film there was absolutely nothing funny or even cute.
