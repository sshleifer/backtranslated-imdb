After reading the book I liked the story. While watching the film, I was disappointed that so many changes had been made. It is clear that books and films are different, but they were two different stories, only the titles and part of the history of the book remained. Read the book and you will understand the film better. The book gives you the best character development. These characters are extremely interesting and make you care about them. Places really fit the book descriptions. Some characters are not included. Television made so many wonderful books and stories in the microwave, and this is a great example of this. The contribution of the author does not always provide a good film, but sometimes it can help.
