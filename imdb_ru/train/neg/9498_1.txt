When I search for new cars, I expect that the boats will not show me. When I drink the fountain pen, I should expect the drink to contain cola. When I watch a movie that adorns itself in the name of an excellent scientist, I expect that this somehow relates to this person or his work. It could be people discussing my grandmother's diary. The material in question is relevant only in the fact that they vaguely tirade science. I fell asleep the first time I tried to watch it, and the second time I stopped watching it. <br /> <br /> I love science and documentaries. I'd rather watch them for the last blockbuster. However, it does not give anything worthwhile? Avoid at all costs.
