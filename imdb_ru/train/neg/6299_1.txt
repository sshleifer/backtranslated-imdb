This inept adaptation, perhaps one of Martin Amisâ€™s weaker novels, is not even able to make a comparison with other drug-addicted works, such as Requiem for a Dream or anything written by Irwin Walsh when he is trying to decide whether this is a slap or hyper-realistic hallucination. <br /> <br /> The group of the Fired March, whose aloof directorial work in supersaturated tones, converges in a mansion in anticipation of the appearance of three American friends at the weekend, where they use decadent drugs. And it's all. With the exception of a ridiculous storyline, which should soon become the main storyline about an extremist cult group that expresses itself by the violent murder of world elite figures, whether political or spoiled. In the first video you know exactly where it goes. <br /> <br /> What does a talented actor like Paul Bettany do in this tedious, poorly written bore? Made before his glory and Jennifer Connelly, one can be sure that if he were offered this garbage, he would immediately change agents! Avoid.
