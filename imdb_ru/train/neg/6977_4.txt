I read all the rave reviews here and was impressed by the imagination of those who loved this film. I can't say I found a lot to recommend it. The soundtrack of Leonard Cohen is not only overly tough, but also gloomy. The film looks plausible enough, but something has to happen to make it work, and nothing special: a superficial plot (not a real problem for me), a little character development, nothing thematic. It is just tiring. Despite its shortcomings, there are moments of genuine surprise in Cimino's “Heaven's Gate”, and this is a film that I would rather watch again. For a brilliant rethinking of the West, “Deadwood” HBO is far superior to “McCabe”.
