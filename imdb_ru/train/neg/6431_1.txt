This film - a terrible distortion of lies and exaggerations, which collected the most shameless crazy, ever worked on a television film. The story is wrong and a complete lie. There is nothing in this film that accurately depicts Senator McCarthy. This is just a terrible scam, and it surprises me that anyone who is associated with this industry has ever gotten another job in the industry. The Marxist-Leninists, who wrote this garbage, did it to attack a man who was justified by history and their fear that anyone would dare to destroy communism. Unfortunately, for these communist jobs, Ronald Reagan took the place where McCarthy stopped, and they could not stop him, thus the end of the Soviet Union and his "cohorts." <br /> <br /> Never, never watch this movie if you are looking for the truth about Senator McCarthy. Read Ann Coulter's Treason to get a better look at the truth about Senator McCarthy. <br /> <br /> It will also help if you read about what actually happened to Senator McCarthy, by reading http: // www. thenewamerican.com/tna/1996/vo12no18/vo12no18_mccarthy.htm
