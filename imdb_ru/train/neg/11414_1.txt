This movie makes "American Pie" a difficult movie! No additional comments are required. Humor is cheap, the dialogues are stupid, and the actors are awkward. Each cliche is used several times without any original changes. And, worst of all, the film turns out to be more Catholic than the Pope. It's so sad.
