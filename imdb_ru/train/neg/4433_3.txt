I really wanted to love this movie a lot more than me. This is because I love wacky foreign comedies - especially weird ones that take you by surprise. However, although this one often caught me by surprise, these surprises were almost never pleasant. It reminded me of South Park in the fact that almost EVERY social norm was broken until the only ones who were in touch were too sick to be funny. For example, after studying adultery, drug abuse (of almost any kind â€” from a pot, heroin, speed, to sniffing glue), prostitution, S & M, suicide, murder, etc. The film got into a fun (?) Theme: pedophilia. Mom invited her son (who looked about 12 years old) to sleep with neighboring men. In fact, at some point in the film, she gives this boy to the dentist instead of paying for dental work! Funny?! You must be joking. This film just goes too far and goes into a comedy black hole. What should they laugh at: cancer or rectal tumors?
