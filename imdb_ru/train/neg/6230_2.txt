I was somehow interested in this film like a dirty cannibal. I was completely disappointed. it was the same disappointment that I felt while watching "Friday the 13th: Jason takes Manhattan." Spent so much potential! <br /> <br /> The first scene is worth seeing. then he stops. abundant breasts and glaring fashion of the 80s can not help this film. the only thing that cannibal monks eat next to this island is piranha! I am not asking about the blood level of the "cannibalism of the Holocaust," but I was looking for cheap supernatural operational blood. I have none of this. <br /> <br /> I found several parts of the battle scenes somewhat intriguing, hence the two stars. I don't think it's really worth the time it takes to watch it, though. I could show it at a party where nobody cares about what is happening and you just want something in the background. but I wouldn't tell anyone, “Oh, man, you MUST watch this movie.” it is not good enough or bad enough to deserve a lot of attention.
