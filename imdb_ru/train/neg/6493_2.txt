Oh, dear ... as an Englishman and a small part of the Welsh, fans of Anthony Hopkins' work in the industry ... today I’m really disappointed. <br /> <br /> You see that I am nobody who hoped for the best. So my comments are like "straw in the wind." But that's the thing, isn't it? - I have no desire to understand the commercial value of the work. I, a full member of the great unwashed, go to see the film to transport it to another place. Yes, suspend faith for a short period. But do not enter into a state of complete disbelief. <br /> <br /> If this were an unknown author and director, I would suggest that this “production” would be thrown into oblivion. Unfortunately, this is not the case, and I was left wide-eyed and confused. After seeing some enthusiastic reviews of this work, I’m a little worried ... <br /> <br /> Maybe I’m trying, without prejudice, to watch every movie deservedly. Regardless of the author, director, studio or even the popularity of the content. <br /> <br /> My advice, like many before me: do not write and send the same production. It is fraught with danger. Movies need to be moderated in order to preserve the appearance of credibility. <br /> <br /> As the school reports say: “They can and can achieve more ...”
