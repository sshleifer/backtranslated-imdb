Teamo Supremo - these are three children, consisting of their leader - Captain Crandall, Rope Girl and Skate Lada, each with their own battle cry (buza! Chika! Woopa!), Equipment and movements. They work for Governor Kevin and were recruited after they wanted to become heroes and play this game. They also lead a normal life and have family and school duties, but most activities take place away from the villains fighting in school. All villains have rather unique and unusual features, such as Mr. Weig and his people, who seem to never know what their plans are, but act in any case. From an evil robot to an evil baron, the three must meet with them and stop their evil, and often strange, plans to gain power, revenge, etc. <br /> <br /> The animation itself is pretty nice and smooth, but the style seems simple on purpose . The background has an overlapping color, and buildings seem futuristic. The music is pretty good, and the show as a whole is not so bad, although the style is not my favorite. <br /> <br /> Plots are almost always meaningless and ridiculous, but in the end this is a cartoon and cannot be blamed for this. However, it will not be in the same row with Fillmore! or Pepper Ann.
