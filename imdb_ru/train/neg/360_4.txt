I read the book and really enjoyed it from beginning to end. However, when I saw the movie, I was very disappointed. First of all, disrespect for Deborah Ruffin, but she was too mature to play a woman 24/25. The late Christopher Reeve was also mistaken for the same reason. According to the book, Will was about 30 years old. I would really like to see a little more about his military life, about his friend Red, about Ellie's trip, to see him, since this was an important part of the development of the characters storyline. In addition, Miss Beasley was mistakenly accepted because it was mentioned in the book that she is a large woman. I know the film didnâ€™t have the budget for Madison County Bridges, which I think was released at about the same time. <br /> <br /> But for me it was a very badly shot film with a low budget. As someone mentioned, I would like Miss Spencer to retire and write scripts for her books, as they should be. She knows her characters better than anyone, I hope she would also think about playing a casting. The film let me down!
