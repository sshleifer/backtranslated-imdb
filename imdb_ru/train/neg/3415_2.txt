In the standard submission, this is a purely terrible movie. Nonetheless, he ranks a near-perfect score on an unintended comedy scale. I can remember a few real comedies that make me laugh as much as I watched this movie. The ghost of Andy Griffith, dressed in dancing Indian attire, every time leads me into hysterics. I would not spend gas or energy on video rental to rent it, but if you happen to be lying on the sofa at 3 am and it appears on TV, check it out.
