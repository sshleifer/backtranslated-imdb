In the recent biography of Alec Guinness, I could not find too much about "Paris with love." I’m sure Guinness made a film to get a free trip to Paris. The film has no other reason for its existence. <br /> <br /> Paris, of course, is nicely photographed with this wonderful discovery of Guinness and his son, traveling through the Champs-Elysées with the Arc de Triomphe in the background. Unfortunately, from there everything goes down. <br /> <br /> There is simply no chemistry between Guinness and the young girl with whom he briefly meets in Paris. According to a recent Guinness biography written by Pierce Paul Reed, Guinness did not positively like a girl who recognized her unprofessional behavior. Regarding what Odile Vernua thought about her colleague, there are no records. They have as much chemistry as two neutered cats. <br /> <br /> Guinness has a good moment in the film, which was directly from one of his Elling comedies, when he climbs a tree, trying to find a badminton shuttlecock. But I would not wait for the movie. <br /> <br /> At least Alec got a trip to Paris from a deal.
