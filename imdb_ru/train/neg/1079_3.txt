I feel that I am the only child in the city who was irritated by Brana's performance. He is an excellent actor on most accounts, but he simply could not exercise a southern accent. I mean, it was abysmal. As if he tried too hard to be a yank. One of the previous reviewers asked why US actors were not filmed in this film. I support this concept. It's great when actors / actresses want to expand their horizons, but this is another thing to try too hard for the show to become tense. Maybe it was Altman, but he is such a great director ... <br /> <br /> Well, I really do not want to beat Branah for his absolutely disgusting accent. Everyone deserves to screw up here and there. But it's hard to watch something so annoying that you prefer to choke on a chicken bone or eat a bucket of shit than sit in the Gingerbread Man.
