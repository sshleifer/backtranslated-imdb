I never thought about watching this excuse for the film. how it was shot, illuminated, acted, etc., simply does not make sense. it's all so bad that it's hard to watch. loads of clips are repeated without boredom. it seems that in the whole film there is no “normal” person, and the existence of the “external world”, well, in general, it simply does not exist. and why this bald guy suddenly becomes invincible? this film is above stupidity. zero.
