It seems that some of the people who watched this movie watched it only in the first place, because it was filmed near the place where they live. How's that for voiced approval? If this film were shot near my house, I would not mention it in my review. It's horrible! Several reviews claim that this film is a parody or mocking horror film, it is not. It is sad to see that this film is seen as a comedy, as this makes it not only an unsuccessful attempt to shoot a horror movie, but also a comedy. Although I laughed at how incredibly bad the movie was. <br /> <br /> In this film there are 2 good things: a mask and a weapon to choose from, unfortunately, it would be more interesting to watch an hour and half of the mask and weapon lay on the table, and then watch this garbage. Social commentary on the film is also ridiculous, juvenile and stupid. Do not worry about this film, you have already spent time reading this review, do not waste time on this film. Arrggghhh! It infuriates that such films even make. I expected the entire cast to be assigned to Alan Smithy, a name used when a person, usually the director, does not want to be credited with the film because it is so bad. <br /> <br /> There is nothing useful in this film, I spent $ 1.19 on rent and I felt that I was robbed. Avoid. 1 out of 10
