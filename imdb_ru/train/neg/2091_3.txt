I remember watching the BSG pilot. I can accurately describe that night. I remember which chair I was sitting in. This show was magical. He came to life. I enjoyed the first two years of BSG. I enjoyed parts of even the third year, and I watched every episode of the fourth year completely sincerely in the hope that it would somehow turn out. Well, it is not. <br /> <br /> I watched the Caprica pilot and was delighted. There was hope for something good here. Then I started watching regular episodes, and they are becoming more and more boring. <br /> <br /> This is too obvious, too predictable. It reminds me of the ridiculous political correctness of his last disastrous show “Virtuality”. <br /> <br /> Most of his linear work on the DS9 was good. When he focused on BSG in an organized way, it was good. This was especially true at an early stage, when they more or less followed the pattern of episodes installed in the first BSG series. When they departed from this after meeting Admiral Cain and Pegasus, everything went right through. As if he wrote the rest of the show, not knowing where he was going. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this will improve. Perhaps it was just a few weaker initial episodes. But I am very, very nervous.
