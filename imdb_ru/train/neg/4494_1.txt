*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Continued ... <br /> <br /> From this point on, the entire film collapses on its own. First we meet a fraudulent program indicating that we will get ghosts, vampires, werewolves, and the like. We have a guy with a backward accent, talking endless trash, two “ghosts” who do not pursue any real goal and have no character, and a bunch of minions. Someone told me that they were vampires (straight from Blade 2), but they are so vague that I didn’t even guess. <br /> <br /> A funny guy with an accent and a funny name suffers from the same problem as the Oracle. Only much longer and much worse. He has a simple point of view on cause and effect, he does it, then continues to do it and do it until he becomes confused and stupid. His last line before leaving is comparable to the Storm line “Do you know what happens to the toad ...” in the X-Men by levels of complete bad taste. Chocolate cake is such a lazy, pitiful cliché and Monica Bellucci, because the wife does only what we expect at the moment when we see it. <br /> <br /> And then we get another kung fu fight !!! WHAT FOR? Neo, ostensibly, One. He can do anything. He has a higher power and for what he uses it. Kung bloody fu all the time. And although he can stop 1000 bullets, he still gets cuts with his sword and is still preparing food from 5 undecipherable minions (vampires?). I wanted to see mind-blowing abilities. I wanted to see how he does the wildest, the craziest and craziest people, because he can do anything. I got the same thing as before, without the "wow." <br /> <br /> Legendary car chase. It can not be bad. Well ... no, it is not. This is simply not what we were before. ALL the cool footage from this scene in the trailer. Each. So everything is possible, Wow was taken from us, so all that we get now is a good chase sequence, guess what, kung fu fight !!! Well, this is not Neo, but you would think that he would explain to his closest friends about the reality of the Matrix. At least he taught them something. It is not difficult. <br /> <br /> “Hey, Morpheus, don't worry about what happens to you in the matrix. This is not real. As long as you realize that nothing is real, then nothing can harm you. ” <br /> <br /> That's it. It's simple. <br /> <br /> OK, so the chase is not bad. It's never boring, and it's not like 16 minutes. It is so delight. And yet, it gets worse. <br /> <br /> The last climax in the film is most likely the worst possible one. They have all this elaborate plan, which includes three teams. Then they only occasionally show it between Morpheus over a long, super preaching monologue. Worse, they can never clearly define that 3 teams are needed for this plan. You know, basically, but you do not know who does what, when, therefore, when one team resigns, you just don’t care and you don’t know how it will affect what is happening. <br /> <br /> I will summarize, although it happens that Trinity can return to the Matrix to set an end. This is the only reason this happens. In this regard, the question arises, why did they need to send 6 people initially? Trinity sits down in five minutes herself! <br /> <br /> Neo's journey to the center of the Matrix (so to speak) is treated equally lazily. Oooh !!! He runs into another 100 Smith agents !!! Woooooo !!! It must have taken a lot of thought. Only now they are in the corridor, so the battle has no scale and ends after a moment. Dude, what a great ending !!! <br /> <br /> And then Architect !!! <br /> <br /> Remember everything I said was bad about the Oracle and the foreign guy? Put them together and double up, that's how really awful the Architect is. The only reasonable potential for him is that he is going to set a climax. <br /> <br /> And then he does it! <br /> <br /> Let's look at the options that he gives to Neo. Choose one door, and all of humanity will die (except 27 !!!). Choose another and all of humanity is dying !!! Given that the choice is what this film is trying to explore, it does not give the hero. If he had the choice to Save humanity, and Mrs. dies, or Save Mrs. and kill humanity, there is the potential for inner torment and stress. In addition, with Trinity in the middle of a fall, the potential of a real climber who would make the third vision more important. But no. He did not save anyone or save Mrs. <br /> <br /> The worst thing in the original Matrix is ​​Neo's death, and then the return to life at the very end. In that year, when everything turned out, everyone was so annoyed at how stupid Jar Jar was, they did not notice that at the very end of the Matrix he looked like Stephen Hawking. "The Oracle told me that I would fall in love with the One, and I love you" .... Come on !!!! How could the whole world not notice how terrible it was? <br /> <br /> What does Wachowski do in the future? Well, they make the ending of the original look better. How? Well, doing almost exactly the same thing again (only changing characters), only much worse, I think that my fa and r keys will be worn out if I continue to write much earlier than it gets worse. <br /> <br /> And the climber is just not exactly a climber. This is a reminder. <br /> <br /> In essence, this film is just a bad one. I really did not want it to be bad, but it is. Bad in many ways. And even worse, this is not a film with an insufficient budget. This is not a movie with a too short schedule. This is not a movie that was ripped off. This is not a film where too much influence came from outside. This is exactly the film that Wachowski intends to make, and behind him is Warner. And that's what makes it so terrible. At the very least, Rancid Aluminum can say that it did not have enough time or money. <br /> <br /> Matrix Reloaded. Worst movie ever made? Maybe not quite. The most disappointing and defalting movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Indisputable. <br /> <br />
