This movie is just bad. Don't even look to laugh at it. The mad professor is just annoying. Even by suspending disbelief, to allow for invisibility (which I gladly do for good bad films) and by allowing extremely stupid victims in a horror film, this film requires even more. If you're looking for women's dressing rooms for a shower scene, and casual sexual encounters, get porn, if you're looking for a good-bad movie, get something else. If you just want to waste your time on an annoying bad movie, rent it.
