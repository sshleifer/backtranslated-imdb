I remember going to watch a movie in the summer of '78 with my parents, and at that time was good at it. Of course, I was seven years old. <br /> <br /> Right before the Jackson films were released, my wife and I shot this film because she never watched it, and I felt nostalgic. <br /> Ralph Bakshi ran out of money midway through the animation process for this film, and he was forced to cut corners sharply in this production. Since this film was made mainly with the help of rotoscopy, animation techniques for people with limited budgets, it says something. Most of this film is animation only in the broadest sense of the word. There are some scenes that are obviously just people facing the screen, with some animation effects superimposed on top of them. <br /> <br /> Due to budgetary constraints, the film is already a compression. ‚ÄùThe Brotherhood of the Rings and part of Two Towers were cut even more. What you are getting is like a Cliff Memo film about books. <br /> <br /> Not everything is so bad, but the animation brings her warmth, which I lacked in Jackson. films. It's nice to imagine how this could be with decent financing. <br /> <br /> This film is also notable for the fact that the sequel did not work out. A few years later, an indecisive half-hour television series was launched that was supposed to wrap things up. All I will say about this is that it was a musical.
