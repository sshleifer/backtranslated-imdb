I think that if I went to the first school somewhere deep in the countryside and asked the lower group of English to come up with a script, it would make more sense than this. Then I could go to the theater group of the first year, and they would play it better than the jokers in this film. It sounds very strange, but I’m sure they did it as a joke and are fully aware that they don’t (see what I did there) have the skills to act or write anything, ever. <br /> <br /> Watch this only if you are incredibly drunk, highly or need a good excuse for why your decaying corpse was found with cut wrists. Now I will go to my tank and collect all the bottom at the bottom. After that, I will format it in the form of a disc and insert it into my DVD player, expecting that it will produce something much better than this tambourine. <br /> <br /> Acting - plot 0/10 - LOL / 10 breasts - 9/10
