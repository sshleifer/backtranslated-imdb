After about three minutes I began to fast forward, pausing only during nudity (why are there always such beautiful women in bad movies?). Ten minutes later I was ready, and wishing that I could get my money back from hire. People who write these films must be authorized by the MPAA. Come on, writers - the bad guys ALWAYS get into a car with a bomb activated by the good guy's console! This has been done since the days of the Ottoman Empire! In addition, to add insult to the wound, the “twist” at the end was so formal that it could come from any action movie written in the last 25 years. Burt Reynolds was fine, but he should concentrate on real films. <br /> <br /> This film - just a waste of time - run away! Run away!
