Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow is a typical 1950s teen movie in a riot movie. This is not a horror movie or fantasy. The plot concerns a group of teenagers who are going to be expelled from the club "hot rod", because they can not pay for the rent. After being kicked out, they decided to try the old haunted house. The only saving grace for the film is that the “ghost” (Paul Blaisdell in the She Creature costume) turns out to be a monster from the movie without work, played by Blaisdell.
