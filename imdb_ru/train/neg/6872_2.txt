This show had pretty good stories, but a bad dialogue. The main character was particularly annoying. Itâ€™s obvious why this show was canceled, although, like most UPN shows, I never knew that it existed at all until it was in syndicated replays. <br /> <br /> Most of his stories seemed to be copied from other shows and films, which made me think that the producers had no original idea in their minds. <br /> <br /> I have not commented enough. You must have at least ten lines of text. The special effect was not bad for the 2001 show. <br /> <br /> The dwarf was a good character.
