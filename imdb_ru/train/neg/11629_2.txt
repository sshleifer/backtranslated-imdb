** SPOILERS ** HAMOS is absolutely unrealistic, it lacks a plot, and basically it is made only to see how the stars depict themselves. The most intense scene in the film occurred when Shabana Azmi is in the shower, and then we see her TV playing the shower scene from PSYCHO. In this film, users expected that the character of Naseruddin Shah had enough memory to remember where certain shots were fired and how much! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER BEGINS *** <br /> <br /> In the end, the murderer sheds his forces on Shaban Azmi long enough for Naseruddin Shah's character to run up and shoot him! <br /> <br /> *** THE END OF THE SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> At first, it is a little funny (only a little) to hear the director and actors throw insults at each other and hear Shabana Azmi exclaiming: “ Oh shit! ”<br /> <br /> Overall, the movie baaaaaaaaaaad! <br /> <br /> Rating: ** of ********** (2 of 10)
