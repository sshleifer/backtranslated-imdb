The Girl in Need is definitely not one of Fred Astaire’s best musicals. But even in Aster’s bad movies there have always been good moments. <br /> <br /> Aster in “Damsel” - Jerry Holliday, an American music star who is in London on a personal tour. He meets Lady Alice Marshmorton (19-year-old Joan Fontaine), an excellent English heiress, who jumps into the back of a taxi, which he takes to escape from the crowd of fans. <br /> <br /> Jerry believes that Alice is forced into marriage by her rich aunt. He is trying to save her from the family estate of her family, but soon discovers that the house staff is betting on which the bridegroom, Lady Alice, will marry. Keggs (Reginald Gardiner), the cunning butler, and Albert (Harry Watson), a trashy homely boy, take turns alternately helping and sabotaging Lady Alice’s romance with Jerry to make sure they win the bet. <br /> <br /> This musical has many problems. First, there is a plot based on the novel by PG Woodhouse (who co-wrote the script). The story is slow, painful and nervous. When Fred doesn't dance, we have to endure endless annoying scenes: (a) Fred's affair with Joan Fontaine or (b) Keggs and Albert, who indulge them and each other. <br /> <br /> The butler and homely boy are especially annoying. These are one-dimensional characters of villains, guys you just want to hit in the mouth. You would like them to leave the screen and let Fred dance. <br /> <br /> Aster suffers in the absence of his usual partner, Ginger Rogers. Joan Fontaine is the vague leading lady in this film, and her wrong in the musical. She has little on her, in character, except for her beautiful face and beautiful smile. <br /> <br /> George Burns and Gracie Allen together with Jerry the publicist and his frivolous secretary. The duet adds a bit of much needed chemistry to the plot, and Gracie has some funny lines, but she’s also sometimes very annoying. <br /> <br /> The direction of the George Stevens film is not very well done. Sometimes cinematography is terrible and out of focus. There are several outdoor scenes on very foggy streets to convince viewers that we are in London, not in Hollywood. (They must have used tons of dry ice in this film.) On the other hand, the songs of George and Ira Gershwin are awesome and have become classic standards. And, of course, the dances in the film are exceptional, thanks to Aster and his choreographer Hermes Pan. <br /> <br /> But music and dance numbers are used poorly and poorly delivered. At times, the actors seem to start singing and dancing, because it's time for them to start singing and dancing. Musical numbers seem to be randomly inserted into a tortuous plot. (At some point, the butler comes out of the manor and breaks into the operetta's solo for no reason.) The numbers include:  “I dance, and I can't be bothered now” - Fred dances well on a foggy, traffic-filled London street. He spins his walking stick perfectly with a rolled up umbrella, but the number ends too soon when Fred jumps into a passing double-decker bus. (In the Broadway musical Crazy for You, Harry Groener made a much better version of this number with a group of choir girls.) <br /> <br />  “Try me” - Fred, George and Gracie perform a tapestry trio in an English cottage . George and Gracie compare Fred step by step, but the number ends badly when everyone kicks each other for no reason. <br /> <br />  “The Tight Upper Lip” (The Fun House Number) - in the amusement park, House, Fred, George and Gracie dance merrily on a rotating floor, a rotating barrel and funny mirrors at home. This is the best number of the film, but sometimes it gets a little boring. <br /> <br />  “Things are looking up” - Fred and Joan Fontaine perform one dance act together in a film, acting out all around the back forests of the manor-house. Fortunately, this is a very simple dance number, because Joan is not a very good dancer. <br /> <br />  “A Foggy Day in a London Town” - Fred wanders through a foggy manor at night, singing about a foggy day when he first met Joan in London. From time to time it looks as if it’s not sure which way it goes in the fog - very much like the musical number itself. <br /> <br />  “Good work if you can” - a great song is misused in the film. During a social event in the estate, Fred falls into a choir of singers with a stern face, who senselessly sing this song. Every time Fred joins, other singers look at him as if they want him to leave. (Again, Harry Gröner made the best dance number with this song in “Crazy For You.”)  “Drum Dance Number” - While Fred and Joan escape, Fred must stop and make one final tap dance number, hitting the band the drums. As usual, this is a great dance number. But there is absolutely no need for it, except to extend the film. <br /> <br /> The most cunning moment in the film comes when Fred decides to jump off the high stone balcony of the country estate to prove his love. for Joan Fontaine. When he jumps off the balcony, he finds a conveniently located trapezoid - this is true, * trapezoid * - hanging on a nearby tree. Fred (or rather, the stuntman in Fred's clothes) takes the trapezium and falls from it to the ground. <br /> <br /> The film is worth buying on DVD only for dance numbers, but you feel obliged to the guy who invented the quick move button on your console. The >> FF button allows you to skip other boring scenes in the film to go to dance numbers.
