SPOILER WARNING In this challenging and memorable action movie Lorenzo Lamas plays his usual role as a tough guy and a cute boy, and his future real life, the former Kathleen Keenmont, is an ass kicking a hot girl Alex. O.J. Simpson is a detective who watches his disappeared genius public persona. Translation: cable TV, filler. There is not enough skin to qualify as “pleasure of guilt.” <br /> <br /> There are gaping holes in the script. The best / worst moment: in one of the unpleasant scenes, the OJ partner expresses her disgust at the morgue. OJ replies that some bodies are quite hot, or words about it. This vague reference to necrophilia is quite offensive; but in the light of the killings that took place shortly after this film was released, it is really terrible, and therefore interesting in an unintended, horrible way. I was so amazed that I laughed until champagne came out of my nose. Now it is a guilty pleasure. BC
