STARS RATING: ***** Saturday evening **** Friday evening *** Friday morning ** Sunday evening * Monday morning <br /> <br /> The US military has just launched a new large stealth fighter that can dodge from detection unlike any other. The renegade pilot (Steve Tuissan) stole him and intends to force the US government to buy him back. Thus, they are forced to send their best man, John Sands (Seagal, who else?), To stop him, in exchange for his freedom, from the detention center, where his mind had to be erased with all the compromising information that he had learned over the years . <br /> <br /> I missed the force of the attack, because from the cover and from all the post-production operations that occurred, I could say that it would be crap, and when all the negative reviews and low user rating got into it, they just what I thought. But I decided to try FOF, because Shadow Man (from the same director) was not bad, and damn it, Seagal was my favorite action movie once, and maybe just maybe he could make a great movie again. Oh, what a fool I was. <br /> <br /> Duplication, terrible videos about stealth fighter aircraft, terrible camera work, cheap production, inconclusive, inconclusive battle scenes that have become Seagal's trademark and boring, sleep-inducing plot that doesn't go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, his next film, “Once Upon a Time in the Hood” (which I’ll skip), seems to mark the end of his contract with Sony, that is, no more. of these terrible European action movies with lenses and his next film, The Prince of Pistols, could mark the return to the cinema. Hell, he did it before, and Stallone managed to do it before him (Rocky Balboa). <br /> <br /> This is not Flying Fury. It is not even a flight of fun. This is a flight that does not even take off from the ground. *
