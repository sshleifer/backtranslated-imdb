There are bad movies, horrible movies, even boring movies ... I can watch most and endure to the end, not this time. Avoid things like the plague, annoying music everywhere, terrible editing, no comedies, she is more cunning than a novelty mug ... My mrs wanted to look at it, thinking it would be Legally Blonde stuff or something like watchable, but never better than average, Chick Flick. It was the first time she begged me to press the stop button. <br /> <br /> Girls, well, they weren't good to start with (Denise did well in Star Marine and Wild Things), but you went down to the gravel I feel like a mug after spending 30 minutes on it ... Pamela Anderson is almost unrecognizable after much construction work on her face. <br /> <br /> Please accept my advice if you want to avoid the loss of valuable oxygen and brain cells. rant on the full stuffing that is on your screen.
