The problem with the CONTRACTOR is summarized by the opening scene. The CIA wants an international terrorist to die, so contact the African American assassin James Dial. The terrorist appears in London's Old Bailey court, which raises the question of why they want to kill a terrorist if he is going to spend the rest of his life in prison? He will be out of circulation anyway. Did the CIA have a chance before his arrest? If by some chance he gets an innocent sentence, kill him. There is no logical reason to kill a person who is going to live in a high-security prison. <br /> <br /> Since the prerequisite creates a plot, the audience may prefer to ignore the hole in the plot, but in itself the spectacle adds fuel to the head. The fire . Dial's colleague is killed by a police bullet and a taxi in which they drive in accidents, but Diala is able to escape. So the police were close enough to shoot someone, but too far away to detain someone from a car accident? The film of this type of plot connivance. Dial later discovers that the police inspector is pointing a pistol at him, saying that “this airport is surrounded by armed copper veins,” but Dialu can very easily escape without giving a reason. The entire film is deceiving its audience, relying on something that is never explained. This includes an important relief character named Emily Day. Why does she help to dial the number, although he is wanted? Your guess is as good as mine. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty bad thriller, and he won’t be interested in the cast of “big names”. Wesley Snipes used to be considered a movie star, but he killed his career by shooting more and more inconsistent films. Charles Dance also appeared in a large budget of Hollywood productions such as LAST ACTION HERO and ALIEN 3, but again, he is someone who is best known for being live on DVD today, mainly cameo. Such as Lena Headey, can become major players in the movie, but they certainly can not put the CONTRACTOR in your resume.
