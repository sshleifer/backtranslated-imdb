It is very sad that Lucian Pintili does not stop making films. They get worse every time. Nicky and Flo (2003) - a depressing blow to the camera. Unfortunately, of the many films that are shot annually in Romania, the worst of them can be sent abroad (for example, the Chicago International Film Festival). This film without a plot, acting or script is a waste of time and money. Rating: 0.02 out of 10.
