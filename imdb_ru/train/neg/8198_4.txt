Alien Hunter: 5 of 10: This is me or all the films that start in Roswell, New Mexico, sucks. Take the Alien, mixed with the Thing, mixed with the Contact, mixed with all the things on the Beach, the Andromeda Strain, a scene in the class from the Raiders of the Lost Ark and drop into the small Stargate to load. <br /> <br /> The derivative doesn't even begin to describe this movie. Of course, having nothing of the original plot, they increase blood and sex, right? No, blood is a blink, and you miss this business, and sex teases it all. (James Spader causally mentions that he needs a shower, and delightful Leslie Stefanson asks to join him ??. He refuses her. AGGH!) <br /> <br /> In fact, if the film ever needed a scene in the shower revive things before this is all. I mean, if you have incredibly beautiful women in white swimsuits wandering around a research base in Antarctica, why not go all-in? <br /> <br /> Approximately 30 seconds of thrills in the whole movie “Alien Hunter” is a wonderful serious and slow way for a sci-fi adventure. To revive the plot it took a much better plot twist, and, by the way, Alien itself is a monstrously ordinary art and has practically no screen time for someone who shares half the name. <br /> <br /> I also inquired while watching the story "Children of Corn in Space." (Note that since Jason’s Friday, the 13th glory, Pinhead from Hellraiser and that Leprechaun went into space to kill poor teenagers, why not a corn field?) Characters in a corn field dress like Logan Beg's stats, and I just waited for the stalks to come alive and attack them. <br /> <br /> This, however, would be exciting and clearly against this covenant of films. The game is mostly good when Spader reiterates his role in Stargate, while Stefanson and Janine Ezer showcase the latest in Antarctic beachwear. John Lynch, however, read the entire script and behaves like a crazy bad guy long before the story tells. <br /> <br /> Alien Hunter is a disappointing derived syllable that makes me miss the real Children of the Corn in Space Film.
