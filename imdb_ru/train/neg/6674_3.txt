I have to admit that the draw in this film is directed by Eduardo Sánchez, who led the wildly popular and successful Blair Witches project. It’s also a kind of alien film, sounding like Stephen King's Dream Catchers, one of those films that critics hated, but I liked it. <br /> <br /> But no, unfortunately, I felt that for the most part, Change is a waste of time, so I will keep this review short. The premises are always promising, and reworked is no different. It tells about a group of people who have encountered strange encounters when they were younger, and, as usual, others will perceive you as an awesome imagination. Alien abduction stories always deal with probes in the holes, so I won't go into details, but you will realize that it is damn inconvenient and something that you would like to forget. <br /> <br /> What if you get a chance to get revenge? That is, you will be able to successfully track down and catch one alive. What are you going to do? For this group, this is a joyful payback time, or so they thought. And it is here that the film begins to turn into a dormant festival, with a bad, boring dialogue and an even worse act. Even if he doesn’t have enough money, there aren’t many factors, whether it’s the power of the plot or any help from the actors, to make their characters a bit interesting. This is a standard cardboard fare from a simple vanilla scenario, combined with cheap scare tactics. <br /> <br /> What is good is makeup. A lot of effort has been put into creating some things that I will not mention, because it will spoil only a few elements of what makes this film bearable. In addition, there are the usual cheap special effects, bloody and bloody moments that you have never seen before. <br /> <br /> See this as a last resort. Compared to another movie about monsters in the city - Holiday, this movie is less cheerful and takes itself too seriously. You got stuck in a boring direction, you were warned.
