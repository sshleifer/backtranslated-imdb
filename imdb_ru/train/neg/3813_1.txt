What a crime ... <br /> <br /> You forgot to brush your teeth ... let's do a 30-minute show about it, and let a couple of kids make some noise, and then ask dad to read them all, because it's that he should do. <br /> <br /> But don't forget that Uncle Joey makes some strange sounds and sad faces, and then Uncle Jessie should appear with his black leather jacket and jeans and look beautiful for a few minutes while everyone is discussing, how Mother could do something if she were there. Yes, full of funny little adventures about a whole bunch of nothing and a whole long story you can build around it. <br /> <br /> Full House will not only tire you to tears, but also make your age twenty times faster than usual.
