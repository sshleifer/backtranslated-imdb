(Honestly, Barbra, I know that it is you who click on all these "NO" in my review. 22 times? How many people did you need to instruct to help you here? You have nothing better than to look at yourself in the mirror all day?) <br /> <br /> Steven Spielberg told Barbre that this is “the best movie I have seen since“ Citizen Kane ”.” It pretty much speaks for itself - and serves as a scary warning! <br /> <br /> What are the components of an unmistakable cinematic disaster that will haunt you, never letting you forget the tears of both laughter? and pain? Ingredients: the face of Barbra Streisand, musical, feminism, the voice of Barbra Streisand, the direction of Barbra Streisand and ultra banal / idiotic background. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is full of egomaniacs, we know that a lot. Actually almost everything ?? by definition ?? must be selfish in Hollywood. Why does anyone want to act? For the "art"?!? Well, if you are stupid enough to believe what you are told in your carefully prepared interviews ?? And Streisand has the biggest ego of all! This is a real achievement. Being surrounded by narcissistic cretins, and yet have time to surpass them all ?? Great. <br /> <br /> The film, like all her solo attempts, is an egoistic journey straight from hell. Each scene in which Streisand is located is automatically destroyed. Stillborn. But since this was not enough, she sings a whole bunch of Streisandi songs ?? You know, the one that let Mariah Caris, Celine Dions and Whitney Houstons of this world have allowed to poison our precious air waves for decades. Only for this, she deserves not one, but 100 episodes from South Park, mocking her. <br /> <br /> Background premise: Streisand, dressing up as a man, ready to become a rabbi, sounds like a comedy ZAZ ZAZ. Besides the fact that this is a cliché, the obvious problem is that Streisand is not like a woman and does not look like a man ?? in fact, I'm not even sure that she is human. What does she look like in this movie? it cannot be described in words. Alien looks like a school athlete, when compared. She looks more alien than Michael Jackson in 2015. She looks HORRIBLE. <br /> <br /> Songs. They made me shiver. In particular, "Dad, do you hear how I scream, like a crazy female walrus in the heat?" and "Tomorrow at night I will prepare a sequel, YENTL 2: RETURN OF THE BITCH." <br /> <br /> Did you know that at the beginning of his career, Streisand was thinking about working his nose, but changed his mind? when they told her that her voice could change? Can you believe it? She had to do it! Killing two flies with one blow is what it would be. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading my biographies of Barbra Streisand and other Hollywood intellectuals, please contact me by email. <br /> <br /> DOES BARBRA STREET SHOULD AND, finally, resign? CLICK "YES" OR "NO".
