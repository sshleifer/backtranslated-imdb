A few years ago, a friend and I were filming a movie, and I went to see a horror movie, which, in our opinion, would be good, because John Cassavetiz starred in it. For the uninitiated, John Cassavettes was an actor, screenwriter and director (married to actress Gene Rowlands), nominated three times for Oscar, who wrote and directed many good low-budget films, using his income as an actor to keep himself afloat, until watching Incubus â€œWe did not understand that John Cassavetes' income was derived from any film he was offered. If we knew what the film was about, before we saw it, we could have avoided it altogether. But we did not come out. At that time, my friend and I jokingly pointed out that it was the worst movie ever made. Honestly, it is not. I saw a lot of badly filmed movies on Friday night at Cinemax (did I just say it out loud?), Which are much worse than The Incubus. Almost any film with Brian Bosworth is, by definition, worse than a movie than Incubus. Of course, Santa Claus conquers the Martians - this is a worse film than Incubus. However, since then I have consistently used Incubus as a threshold, below which I do not want to fall. Speaking with this friend about the film that I may have seen, I will always point out that he was better (or worse) than Incubus. <br /> <br /> http://thevillagevideot.blogspot.com/
