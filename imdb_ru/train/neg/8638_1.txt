Action, violence, sex, and harsh language are what the characters do throughout the film. And everything they do is done without a reason. Mark L. Lester (un) is known for his violent (no reason) films (Commando, The Base). The story is strange, but stupid. Actors play their stupid characters very well ... I do not say that they are stupid, but I mean that they are very bad actors. This is another low-budget unknown fighter from series B. If you saw something like Operation Delta Force, Drive, Patriot, Sanctuary or something like these bad films of the same kind as Unforgettable "... do not rent them out ... and, by the way, do not shoot any of the films that I mentioned .... I give 1 and a half out of 5.
