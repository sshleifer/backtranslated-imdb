This failure of ABC directly on TV does absolutely no justice to the brilliant fantasy novel Wrinkle in Time. Ms. Madeleine L'Engle led children and adults into a magical, fantastic and original world like no other author before her. This novel, the first in its "quartet of time", represents a beautiful view of life, the universe and time itself. However, it is easy to understand for any child or teenager. His unshakable morality is spread throughout the book. This film adaptation can be viewed as nothing more than a mockery of a work of art by Miss L'Engle. Honestly, what were they thinking? The effects look cheap and ridiculous, the plot is soft and uneven, the dialogue is contrived and almost all the magical characteristics of the novel are lost. It was a terrible attempt to display this book. I sincerely hope that someday a smart, decent director (Guillermo del Toro, David Yates, Alfonso Cuar√≥n) will make another attempt to bring this book to the screen and understand what it is: a masterpiece. This adaptation can only be compared with boring, fake and cheap art in a motel room, which does not stand still and does not affect the audience at all.
