I actually saw China O'Brien II before I saw the original China O'Brien. And I must say that the first incarnation is actually worse. But: worse = funnier! And funnier = better. If you're a movie fan like me, this is great stuff. However, if you are looking for some meaningful plot, acting, or film making skills, this is best avoided. The best part is how they shot all the battle episodes in stuttering ahead. Funny bad. Look at it for a laugh, look at it for meaningless entertainment, but whatever you do, watch it for free on TV.
