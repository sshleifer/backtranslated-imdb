After the opening credits, a black screen appears for about a minute. A minute of nothing, then the girl wakes up and takes a shower. Then she and two college friends go to a rock concert, after long stuffing, they hit something and slid off the road. They wake up in a cabin where an elderly woman lives in a wheelchair and her offspring. Unfortunately, the killings are very tamed for the alleged "opposite video." The completion of the twist is stupid and predictable. No one involved in this mess will ever again notice anything. So sometimes happy endings happen. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Sarah Ansley is topless, and Laurel Munson has a full frontal demonstration. <br /> <br /> My rating is: D
