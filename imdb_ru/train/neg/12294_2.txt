I watched this movie exclusively for the production. This was filmed in an old hotel whose shares belong to a friend. The plot was predictable, acting was mediocre at best, all fears were coarse, not real. <br /> <br /> I don’t remember much of the plot, and I think it’s because there wasn’t much to remember. They did not even use the hotel to the full ... The beaches are fantastic and the hotel is located on a peninsula. At low tide, you can walk almost 1/4 mile to the bay, which is actually a terrible sight first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind howls through the cracks. <br /> <br /> The best You can watch this movie with a remote control in your hand so that you can quickly move forward through the action (and I use this term) and pause the beauty of the environment!
