Visually interesting, but in the original department does not work. This tedious technique training wears out after the first battle. Jude Law has the charisma of burnt toast, but in his defense this film contains some of the worst dialogues I have ever seen on the big screen. In fact, the script is so poor that it continues to take you out of the film, forcing me to think about work, accounts, my dogs, etc. There are many moments that scream on the blue screen. Paltrow is as wooden as they are. This could be saved with the quick film “Noir” or over the camp. My only complaint about the technique is that the black and white film (excuse me, computer) would help because it looks like black and white, painted by Turner. Just a big boring cliché. I'd rather break a hip than pass this endurance test again.
