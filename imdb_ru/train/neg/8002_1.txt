What a horrible movie. Rotten tomatoes also had a good rating. do not be fooled by positive comments; It was not scary. It was not funny. It was not clever. It will not even attract your attention. I just spent 2 hours of my life watching this crappy festival. The computer generated monster was interesting to see the first couple of times. after about 15 minutes, he was no longer entertained. the dialogue was terrible, it must be a matter of translation. Another negative that stood out were idio-Americans. 3 were depicted, and they all lacked character, intelligence and judgment. Now Iâ€™ll write a couple of lines to complete this, since we must have 10. The video store employees had to slap me for bringing this name to the counter.
