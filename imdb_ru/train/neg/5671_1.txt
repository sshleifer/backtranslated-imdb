If you like to see the live animal skin, they have heads broken, dogs have a throat, my people are stomping on them, then this one is for you! But if you are somewhat normal, and you don’t need to see the real animal abuse shots, skip this. This film is trying to shock the viewer, and this is exactly the case. With sniffing animals at the beginning and killing children in the film (at least, fake), it was enough for me to turn it off. I saw films like this before showing footage from the slaughterhouse (BTK movie) and such footage should not be allowed in a horror movie. We watch horror and horror, because we know that it’s just makeup and special effects, so we don’t have to sit down to watch a movie and see how animals are actually killed. This is not what we rented the movie for. In any case, on these types of trash films a big warning sign should be pasted so that people are not surprised. As a very strong fan of horror, this turned my stomach. The entire film and film crew need a head check.
