My God, what the hell happened here? !! I'm not going to say it again, but what is this retarded film? Duplication in this case is much worse than in King Kong vs. Godzilla, Linda Miller should have been the worst actress in this, and the costumes are really stupid. It's about some kind of villain named Doctor, who makes minions build a gorilla robot that has the same power as King Kong, but when this robot breaks down, it builds another and then tries to kidnap Kong. When he does this (that is, when Linda Miller becomes annoying), he makes Kong his slave, but everything goes wrong, and King Kong escapes. Then the doctor, who sends the robot for him. <br /> <br /> Later, when I watched the movie, my head ached when Linda Miller and other clowns began to moan. When I sat in misery, watching the DVD while it was playing, I hoped that the madness in the film would end before the fight. The end must be really bad, because they might again show Kong on his island, fighting dinosaurs. <br /> <Do not watch the movie under any circumstances or if you do it ... beware of frustration you will get the ent.
