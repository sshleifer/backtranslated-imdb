The word "1st" in the title has a more sinister meaning for the viewers of this film than for its victims of crime. At least, they do not need to wander and watch how this endless film will reach its demise. <br /> <br /> 1st must mean: 1st draft of the script; 1st take is used in every performance in the final film; 1st editing in post-production; etcetera, etcetera. <br /> <br /> The film was shot not too bad, just everything in the film is worse than in the third row, from a blunt script to wooden performances. And while you suffer from this cobbled movie, after 2 hours you want to get rid of the suffering. After 160 minutes, it becomes apparent that it should have been edited in less than 2 hours. <br /> <br /> If we talk about the details associated with the settling scenario, it does not make sense. Even in the equally terrible Lake Placid film, at least the Bill Pullman and Bridget Fonda performances, built according to an extremely weak script, were thin enough to make you laugh at the film. In the 1st film, the person ends up only grieving for the time spent waiting to see what happens after the initial scene of the preparation of the suicide of the female leader. <br /> <br /> Editing is so bad that it is never introduced for one of the main characters, which I think (never said) is DA It just appears in the same scene in the middle of a conversation. Obviously, the scene where it is presented to the viewer, was thrown on the floor of the editor. And no one understood that the character that appeared out of nowhere was an unusual trick of the film. <br /> <br /> In a word, do not waste your time on this. My wife and I would like us not to do this. But at least we created our own entertainment, commenting in different parts of the film, as if it were Mystery Science Theater. "Meanwhile in Cleveland ..." !!!!
