This may be the worst example of amateur propaganda ever made. Script writers and producers should study German films of the thirties and forties. They knew how to sell. Even the clumsy leader of the Soviet style, like the godlike figure of his father, coped better. Unsatisfactory. The loss of faith, restored in the church at the last second just by the time the pope was “saved” by Hoover / God, was not so bad. Unfortunately, he seemed hasty and not melodramatic enough. A few misty heavenly shots of angelic Hoover in the corner of the screen, shining and nodding, would add a lot. The best aspect is that Hoover only saves a decent family and children, who have “proved” their value. Unfortunately, other poor homeless people were depicted as cute and even good - but God-Hoover does not help them. The best approach would be shots of them, drinking spirits, to show the justice of their condition. Finally, the bright and cheerful recovery scenes (after Hoover saved the country from depression) should have been a ride at the end. Then we saw how God-Hoover had saved not only an EUT worthy family, but all the really worthy ones. Amateur at best.
