At least the seats in the theater were comfortable, and I ate popcorn as loud as possible to stifle the poor dialogue. This is absolutely not a movie for girls. Any guys who like it are those who, ladies, can be far away from us. Stupid story, mediocre dialogue and generally cheap film. I have seen many, many films, but this one is a new winner in a bad category. If you happen to see it, then the only thing you expect is the end. So you can finally run from the theater as fast as you can.
