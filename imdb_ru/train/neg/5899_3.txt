Apparently, all the flickering people were engaged in Mikey and his work. I sat through this movie tonight. I thought that if he was twice as bad as Ringu, as I assumed from these comments, it could be worth my time. <br /> <br /> There is no such luck. <br /> <br /> I’m in search of the next great director (or writer), but I don’t think Miike is the one. I don’t have a master of arts in New York, but I know this very much: there must be a tempo in a horror film. This should also give the viewer more credulity than this film. <br /> <br /> Because of the pace of this film, I shook my head. Some scenes closer to the end stretched so badly that I walked over to the refrigerator and lingered there while Kou Shibasaki looked at the camera, it seemed, for minutes on end, with wide eyes and mouth open. A famous director once made a statement, and I paraphrase, the film could be made by turning on the camera on a beautiful woman and letting her ride. Coe is not a good enough actress to do this job. She looks paralyzed at the undead girl for more scenes than I want to remember. And she is not the only one who imitates the deer in the headlights; other cast members obviously feel the need to mimic this failure. The script gives them little room to do something else too much time. <br /> <br /> I like Asian movies. Hong Kong action films over the past 30 years, the horrors of Korea, such as “The Phone” and “Coma”, the work of Ang Lee, some of the filthy but funny Filipino films with causeless sex and fights, and others. Chakushin Ari, which I could do without.
