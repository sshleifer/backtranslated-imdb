I admit that I was a fan of original stage production. I have never seen a movie version until recently on cable and watched it with anticipation to see how my memories come alive again, because I adored the original show. Imagine my confusion. <br /> <br /> This must be the worst translation of a Broadway show into a movie ever made. They changed the story, they changed the songs, they lost their soul. I was expecting a trip to the memory lane, singing an unusually touching music and a mirror, “At the ballet” and “Hi twelve, hi thirteen”. Not! They not only falsified the music almost beyond recognition, but also spoiled the storyline by adding songs and external storylines (hi Cassie and Michael Douglas) that are not in the original, and added “drama” where it was not needed. The original had enough pathos. If you were a fan of the original Broadway show, do not worry. I'm sorry that I wasted my time and diluted my memories while watching this prank.
