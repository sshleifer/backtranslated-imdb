Jeux d'enfants or the film was incorrectly translated into English “Love me if you dare” - a film made by stupid people and about stupid people. I just don’t know how to expect something worthy of a movie with such a plot: two stupid ignorant children rely on the fact that each of them will do something (certainly extremely idiotic) to prove to each other (indistinctly?) they are "cool guys." I know that I have exaggerated some aspects, but this is what the whole film is about. They are getting older ... and instead of understanding that they are just a couple of alienated eccentrics, they continue to do their crazy things, thinking that they are wonderful people. <br /> <br /> One would expect such a film from Hollywood, and France? Even more insulting to watch a movie from the country that created Amelia a couple of years ago, to which, by the way, the movie is trying to look, but far, far away from him. <br /> <br /> Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.
