A tangled mess from start to finish. As they used to say about the Beatles songs, there was a secret message if you play LP back. If you had the patience to watch the scenes of these films from beginning to end, you would have left with the same degree of frustration. <br /> <br /> In addition to all this psychedelic confusion with fleeting memories and false starts, the most prominent characters were supporters of the film, who wanted revenge if the movie was not sorted. In these two, too, there was nothing to love. Oversupply, screams and threats were delivered in the form of comics. I think that one dimension was an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> Good, so perhaps the artsy people roll their eyes, enjoying the fact that, unlike them, we, the plebeians, simply do not understand this. Well, I'm afraid there was nothing to get. And the two major sins of any bad film are carried from start to finish. A non-existent and pitiful storyline, if you want to call it that, and certainly the worst, not a single character you would care about the least.
