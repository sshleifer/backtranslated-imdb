This spinning movie looks more like MTV music videos than a real movie. There is no real story, and when the film continues, you ask yourself: “What will happen?”; but nothing happens The story around Eric Kloka, a frustrated writer, is the only good thing. Other people seem to have nothing in common: why unite them in a movie? With music, you can make the movie the worst to watch. When I open the tap and the water goes to Bach's music, most people like to watch it, but this is not a film. A director must learn to write a script for a film lasting 100 minutes or more before he starts directing a film.
