It seems that this film has caused a stunning response, but no one understood how to criticize its methodology, which is extremely wrong. He simply continues to promote the analysis of journalistic style, which lies in the fact that he fills the lack of knowledge and prejudice among the audience to cause an emotional response and an explosion of negative diatribes. <br /> <br /> Journalism 101: tell the viewer some facts just to predispose them to conclusions that are predictable. for example, the idea of ​​civil war, chaos, looting, etc., was allegedly an unexpected reaction to the collapse of government infrastructure after the death of Hussein: was it not all a symptom of an already deprived culture? doctrinal struggle as the symptoms of these veins of Islam itself, and not the inability of the police to restrain and protect? Would they prefer the US to declare a law on the marshal? I am sure that the newspapers here would have exploded with accusations against the police state and the fascist forces. <br /> <br /> In addition to the analytic idiocy of the film, it takes several sidelines and leaves the rest without pretending to “such and refused to be interviewed ...” nevertheless, the questions they would have asked would undoubtedly be answered hundreds of requests that these people have already received. You, as vice-president, deigned to interview the first writer / producer who was probably able to distort your words. They could not scroll Condi’s film to actually show her opinion and answer some questions related to perhaps, they never watched her hearing. <br /> <br /> This is not a neutral view of the situation on the land there, this is another biased, stupid approach of journalists, who, by and large, are mindless herds. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to comment on the war should at least base their ideas on things a little more reliable than NBC's coverage and CNN commentary. These interpretations instill the same vitriol that simply creates further bipartisan movement of those who want to think, and those who want to the media were told what to think.
