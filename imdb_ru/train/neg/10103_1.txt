This movie made me go. The name was perhaps the greatest idea I heard. I thought it was an independent film about the outbreak of zombies and their desire to capture the US and a group of surviving singles, unite and plan to destroy the zombies. DEADS WRONG! This is a psychopath who has a weakness in that he kills his female arrests and gets what comes to him when a flock of zombie women rises from their graves in order to get the proper revenge. As you can see, there is nothing in the nation and district. How to start with the seriousness of this cinematic disaster that caused our nation. <br /> <br /> First, female zombies look like Victoria Secret models with a dark eyeliner and a pale face. What are zombies, but meaningless, controversial smart, cannibalistic killing machines that they eat as a result of their primitive, most basic needs? These female zombies walk like street street travelers and runway models, they speak as if they are in a bad noir film, and do not behave like real zombies. Of course, there is food and murder, but where is the meaninglessness and terrible deformity? Although this is a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satire in the zombie genre, she laughs at this genre and asks the question: “Why can't zombies be beautiful fox killing machines?” I would say that this film will be considered really bad indie the film, which was filmed and filmed by garage addicts. I would not recommend this film to anyone who loves zombie genres too much, this is an insult and not even scary.
