The plot has already been described by other reviewers, so I’ll just add that my reason for wanting to see this film was to see Gabrielle Drake in all her undoubted glory. <br /> <br /> Miss Drake should be one of the sexiest, most beautiful examples of “chic stuff” made in celluloid. From her era and the like, only the equally exquisite Jane Asher comes close. What was the actress with the musical brothers? (Nick Drake and Peter Asher) For those who, like me, admired Gabrielle, her scenes in this film will not disappoint. She has a magnificent figure, and none of this is left to the imagination here. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is very bad and, at one time, made very cheap. The song that covers the opening credits seems to go on forever and terrible.
