Why did any legitimate actor who read the script participate in this piece of shit? Oh my god, it's actually a shame to even look at it. I canâ€™t imagine the shame that these people have to feel as part of it. In addition, there seems to be some controversy as to whether River Phoenix had a cameo in the film. He was uncredited, but his list of roles here (IMDB) gives him credit. By the way ... The rain is his sister for those who asked before. This film is proof that no matter how many big "names" you have. Pig ears do not make silk wallets. I love Lorraine Bracco, but it was just sad, sad, sad ... Maybe someone will ever be able to explain to me the reason for this film. He has no attractive, entertaining or even comedic properties compared to how everything else.
