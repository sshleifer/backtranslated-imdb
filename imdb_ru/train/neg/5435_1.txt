... they bothered to make this movie? Anyone? I did not think so. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a film about coming of age, rent Summer of '42. This is not the summer of 42 years. <br /> <br /> When your main stars are Nolte and Sarsgaard, and Sarsgaard gets more time on the screen, this is your first warning sign. And, of course, for such an elaborate movie Around there are a lot of curses and skins, just to make it look "frilly". <br /> <br /> Sarsgaard made his usual uninteresting, cardboard character, underlined by moments that were supposed to be intense. Intensity is for someone with bipolar disorder. <br /> <br /> Miller is best known for her looks and what she said about the city of Pittsburgh after this film. Pittsburgh MUST take offense at her. She misrepresented the actual Pittsburgh native. <br /> <br /> Foster threw Sarsgaard for his money in a cardboard acting manner. Blimey! Was that his first role after graduation? <br /> <br /> So, we have this strange triangle. Foster is in love with Miller, but with his boss / girlfriend. He can't put Miller to bed and won't put his boss in bed. So, he communicates with Sarsgaard and Miller and observes how they turn him on. <br /> <br /> Then, after one of the pseudo-intense moments of Sarsgaard, Foster and Miller get a scene that we “treat”. in every inaccurate moaning detail. Finally, just to complete all this, Foster and Sarsgaard continue this, with Foster as Miller. Now I know how two guys do it (as if that was all I needed to know). <br /> <br /> After all that is left, this is a tragic ending for one character and a retrospective staying at 2. It forces me right in the pit of my stomach. Oh wait! It was pepperoni pizza that I just ate. <br /> <br /> I would like to come back when this film wrenched my life, please.
