Since most of the reviews for this film are devoted to ten years ago, I would like to add a more recent one, the film opens with videos about the B-17 bombardment in Germany, as well as the film directed by Oscar Werner “Hauptmann (captain) Wust” and his character. The assistant, running behind the shelter, making his way to Hitler’s Hitler’s bunker, once inside, they are taken care of by the bunker’s staff, the film is then shot on one of the many scenes featuring Albin Skoda, creating a decent impression of how Adolf Hitler unites his officer with Ultimat. Victory ", while Werner's character slowly begins to realize that the inhabitants of bunkering are drawn into the world of fantasy - not non-bunker events are depicted, the most notable of which is the flooding of the metro system to prevent Russians from advancing through them, and a minor Plot, which involves a young member of Flak and his family, who are hard to survive - this film suffers from a number of inaccuracies in the details that the German film made only 10 years after the Second World War. not included; The actor depicting Goebbels (Willy Krause) is dressed in the same form as Hitler, including the eagle. Goebbels was in a brown uniform of the Nazi party with a swastika bandage - SS soldier’s clothes, German army camouflage, a well-documented scene of Hitler's awarding an iron cross. Hitler’s youth boy was shown to have taken place INSIDE the bunker (this was done outside in the courtyard) and finally Hitler’s suicide is clearly shown as a model of the Belgian Browning of 1922 - most believe it was Walter PPK - some little actions also seem to be perfect inaccurate with a drunken dance scene near the end of the film, which is remarkable, this bit is shown as a parody of a cabaret, with a drunken wounded soldier (his hand in the bus) manic goose music to music, while the nurse is fills the combination of striptease and belly dancing, all by candlelight ... in fact it is awkward to watch - the most incredible thing is that when Werner's Captain Wust conquers the audience alone with Skoda Hitler, Hitler is shown as having fallen on the wall, inflated with drugs and delirium, when the character Werner begins to question him, Hitler's cry begins to call the SS guard, who mortally wounds Werner’s character with a shot in the back - this fabricated scene is not based on any true historical account - Werner’s character is being led away to die in the hallway While Hitler is preparing his own end, Hitler’s parting with his staff is shown, but suicide offscreen, the last seconds of the film show that Hitler’s funeral smoke slowly turns into a ghostly depiction of the face of the deceased Oscar Werner / Hauptman Vust - this film is more allegorical than the historical , and anyone interested in this period would be better to watch more recent films, such as the 1973 remake “Hitler: The Last 10 Days” or the German film “The Wreck” (Der Untergang), if they want a more truthful description of the dramatic history of these last two films based on eyewitness accounts from the first person, with the "Hitler: the last 10 days." Compiled from Gerhard Boldt’s autobiography as a staff officer in the Fuhrer’s bunker and “The Fall”, made from the memories of Hitler’s secretary, the script of the film “Der Letzte Akte” is taken from the book of Nurenberg’s American war crime judge “Ten Days to Die”, which is rather a collection of events (many obviously bizarre) than the story of eyewitnesses — surprisingly, Hugh Trevor Roper's story “The Last Day of Hitler” was never turned into a film.
