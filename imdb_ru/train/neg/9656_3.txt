This film is made for television. Nevertheless, it all started with good intentions: great scenery, original accessories and costumes. The film quickly degenerated into a terrible trash on the nose, and a greasy melodramatic acting game was thrown on TV. The characters were so well fed that sometimes I thought they were about to turn into a gall puddle of mucus, and the action was so intricate and poorly circumcised that it seemed that the soldiers were just standing and taking turns shooting at each other, the Germans were so unreal that was painful to watch. The only thing the German officers talked about was how beautiful the Americans are. Please take my word for it. I'm a big fan of the war genre, and this movie is crap. However, this DVD has an excellent additional function, covering letters from the fronts of World War I, which makes this rental not a complete waste of my time.
