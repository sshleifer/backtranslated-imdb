This film was the worst movie watching experience I have ever had, and even worse, it’s the fact that I had to watch it, and I didn’t have the opportunity to stop it because it was for school! Admittedly, the storyline was decent ... but I found the game terrible! The exception was Marianne Jean-Baptiste, I thought her performance was wonderful. She was the only highlight, without her, I doubt that I could stand watching the movie. Every time I hear someone say “dear”, I cringe! I almost attacked the client the other day, because they said "this." It made me remember one of the worst hours and a half of my life! <br /> <br /> (I apologize if it offended someone, I only express my opinion)
