My friends and I rented it for "Bad Movie Night" with high hopes, but the Brain was a bit of a disappointment. The brain itself looks great stupid, but basically it just sits on its little platform. Who would have thought that it would be cool if only three people had the brain enough for 94 long minutes? Initially, there are several things in this film, including Estevez’s host, who plays rebellious genius (we are told that his enormous intellect is incorrectly directed to his complex pranks and school tricks, which include applying a crazy glue to someone’s chair). He also has excellent facial features: a cheerful out of shape and exhausted minion who barely succeeds everywhere, and yes, some kind of chick gets naked. However, the director is in dire need of learning the art of stimulation. Over the course of the last half, things just begin to stretch and go on, at least 3 or 4 meaningless, boring scenes of the chase make up the middle third of the plot. The scenes inside the PRI complex are especially bad. For at least 15 minutes of this movie, people run up and down the same stairs. I could fix the script for this thing in half an hour - more cheese, more blood, more nudity, more brains. If you're going to make a bad horror movie, at least give me something cool to watch while my superego goes down. Perhaps the director was trying to really attract the audience to his film - by the end of this crappy holiday, I felt like one of the zombie citizens.
