This film really started well. He had the opportunity to turn into a truly heart-rending romantic love story with cinema, which captured the love between Harlan and Tobe in long, poetic and idyllic scenes. It really shouldn't have been more than that, and for a moment I was excited that someone was finally making a beautiful film in itself, another classic, timeless, perhaps a modern myth. Why, well, why, then half spoiled everything, making the main character (Norton) another psycho? Maybe I'm missing the point, but we really need another film about psychos? Or is it the need for Hollywood to portray the sore side of human nature, indicating a more common ailment in the film industry? For a moment I was going to mentally mention the name of the director; Now I feel indifferent. At least, in defense of the film, it should be added that all the actors seemed to have put their roles. In addition, Evan Rachel Wood is really a pleasure to watch and a good actress with great potential.
