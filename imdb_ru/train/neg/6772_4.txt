So, when Herbie first appeared, I was completely happy watching Dean Jones spin. I just wanted to be entertained for a few hours and eat over-buttered popcorn. Now, unfortunately, I have an exciting / delightful story waiting when I watch a movie if I don’t take any medication. And this is another good film for drugs. There is no big laughter, no complicated plot lines, no complicated turns. Herbie Fully Loaded is great for fully loaded. <br /> <br /> I saw La Lohan for the first time on the screen since she changed places with Jamie Lee Curtis (I thought she was excellent in this), and I cannot say that I was terribly impressed time. In addition to her constantly changing and distractingly unnatural hair color, she simply did not sound believable, like a child in the neighborhood who had been hanging around for a lifetime. Her “need for speed” was not consistently reflected in the film — perhaps it was somewhere else — she looked older than her part, and seemed to always look for something (party? Designer dreams? New place, where can I spend money?) ask. I could not see any chemistry with Justin Long; this novel seemed obligatory at best. The only time that Lindsay was engaged was when she spoke with Matt Dillon, who, it seemed to me, was too much like the Evil Bad Guy, Trip Murphy. <br /> <br /> It was great to see Herbie again, and I really liked the introduction to the film with material from old movies. If Disney had jumped out of Car 53 with some decorations, I could have put them on just to be true. His new function (?) Was a bit controversial (he directs the thoughts of his driver? Now he rides a skateboard?), But whatever. We all knew how this would end, but I would like him to be with someone a little less stupefied than Maggie. And I still have a headache from this lesson, Maggie, and we, the audience, drove home. <br /> <br /> What would make a film worth seeing? The old Herbie will be in a real story with a real storyline - at least Herbie is as good as Lassie - but it is clear that this requires too much. Why does Disney always return to Herbie Goes Bananas and Computer, which had tennis shoes, when it comes to innovation? <br /> <br /> I’m sure it was a great movie for children and those who have no expectations. For the rest of us ... it's when you have the flu, and you just can't take control of the rear window.
