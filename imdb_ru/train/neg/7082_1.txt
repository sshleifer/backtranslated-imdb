Well, I wrote a terrible review because the movie is terrible. As I was waiting for my other review (for Derrida), I decided to check out the old reviews of this terrible film. Look at all the positive reviews. They are EVERYTHING, I say EVERYTHING, from authors who have not rated any other film, except this one. Crimminy! and we are waiting for you in the "rosebud" review [sic]. <br /> <br /> Check out other films that rosebud reviewed and had vivid recommendations. Oh, shoot!, They, it turns out, only for other films of two authors and director. Sacred Wipers, Batman. <br /> <br /> Joe, Tony, you suck as a writer, and Tony, you can't choose a bad script. No job for you! <br /> <br /> ALWAYS CHECK POSITIVE REVIEWS FOR A LOW ESTIMATED CINEMA!
