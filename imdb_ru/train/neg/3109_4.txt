This film was not terrible, but not very good. I am a big fan of Tony Collett, I think she is a very beautiful and talented actress. The film begins with Robin Williams, who is a writer and receives a book from a 14-year-old child. The book is wonderful, and he cannot believe that the child wrote it. Tony Collett plays the guardian of children whom you do not know if this child really exists or he is inventing it all. I'm not going to spoil the movie, but I will say that the movie is not scary. <br /> <br /> The game is pretty good, and Tony Collettâ€™s performance was awesome, like Robin Williams. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the film was a huge disappointment, and I would wait until it was released on DVD.
