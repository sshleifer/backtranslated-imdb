First of all, let's begin by saying that Robert Englund Dag Bradley and Melinda Clark deserve credit for being associated with this piece of shit. I had to give this one, it would not allow me to give him a zero. Want to know how bad this movie is? My mother calls me from different parts of the city and tells me: “Son, I just watched the stupidest film ever. I replied that I said: “The language of the killer, yes? She looked like you found out about it? At first it looked like a good Freddie Melinda film. Ok, I'll give him a chance. I only watched the rest of this movie because I wrote a horror review column. I beg of you, don't waste your time or even brain cells on this ridiculous piece of shit. run away, if you see him on a shelf in a Hollywood video block or even in your local video store, flip it over and leave ... I want mine two hours ago damn it
