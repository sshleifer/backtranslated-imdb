I understand that Dill’s character must be America’s own microcosm — to see Arab terrorists under every stone, only to find out in the end that his own actions brought him to this state of siege all the time and whether he really practices goodwill for all people, everything will be rainbow and lollipops. Sorry, Wim, in the past you made amazing films that remain neutral with respect to politics, and for obvious reasons, controversy is your weak point, and they weaken this well-made, surprisingly well-made film with absurd characters, dialogues and stories. Good luck in the next movie. Another thing that pulled me by the arm was a hopeless moment when the homeless part of Los Angeles was there because of the famine, these people are not getting enough food. Indeed, these people do not eat regularly, but the real hunger of these people is spiritual hunger, emotional hunger, psychological hunger. They need self-esteem, self-esteem, dignity that you can not give a man. Yes, these people are hungry, and if they need it, it is available. I would say that this is not a center of hunger in America, but a center of alcoholism, drug addiction, distress and economic destruction. The fight against hunger, although a noble undertaking is the help of a more deeply systematic social and perennial human problem of homelessness. Bill Deal was good, and Michelle Williams was good, like a young, still (old) soul.
