Loyalty to Peter Falk is all that prevented me from giving this terrible picture (1) that she deserved. (In this regard, loyalty to Mr. Falk and made me watch this movie from head to tail.) Even if you forgive all the blatant mistakes, it was just the worst excuse for the TV movie "Colombo" created forever. I'm glad I watched it on TV for free; would hate to cough up bucks for a seal.
