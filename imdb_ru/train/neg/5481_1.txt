<br /> <br /> Alien visitors not only look just like fluffy women with armpits, and not only alien visitors can speak English very well (with an Australian accent), they also call their stars with the same names that have our earthly astronomers. given to them! <br /> <br /> And to top it all, the whole alien life knows how foul, evil, wasteful and destructive people we are. And they are very happy to tell us how bad it is. <br /> <br /> If you ever have the opportunity to watch this movie, don't do it. Well, unless you suffer from insomnia or this film or research operation without anesthesia. <br /> <br /> This film tries to convey a moral, ecological point of view, but only makes you yawn and pray that it will end soon,
