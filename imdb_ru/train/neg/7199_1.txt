What for?!! It was a tasteless, boring and embarrassing film. Embarrassment is due to the fact that they are from the city from which they made it ... Pittsburgh, PA! Why did they let these people make such a BAAAAAD film there? <br /> <br /> When this film was supposed to be released initially ... it was rather a romantic comedy ... and not a ROBO-anything. Everything changed with the courtesy of Disney. WHAT FOR???? They made a terrible interpretation of this classic comic character. Seeing Matthew Broderick laughing at his films was not fun either. Sheesh !!
