Has anyone stopped to understand what kind of film they produce here? And now let's send the former marine officer to a group of children in a cadet school, so this should be a family comedy, right? Wrong . It's just a rough comedy aimed at teens with many bad taste moments. Perhaps at that moment she could be watched extremely foolishly, but I found that Damon Wayansâ€™s voice was annoying to the limit. Does he say that in real life? If he does, he will have my sympathy, but he will not receive any money from watching his films.
