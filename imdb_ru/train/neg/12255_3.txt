... which is not really endorsement. Overall, the movie "DinoCroc" was much better. Of course, in this film, Matt Borlengy played a full bag, which the whole movie was crying about how his younger brother ate DinoCroc. But the special effects in DinoCroc were better, the storylines were better, and the action was better. Here are the problems with "Blood Surf" - 1) the crocodile killer looks like a model of a child with a retractable jaw. 2) the plot is funny. Matt Borlengi & Co. was wrecked on a desert island where they run into a rabid group of ugly Filipino natives who are trying to impose themselves on the women in the group. Which was a complete waste of 15 minutes of the film. And 3) not enough crocodile. There are several redeeming qualities of "Blood Surf" - the actresses are quite attractive, and Matt Borlengi is eaten by a crocodile by the end of the film. But if you are on your deathbed and you have enough time to watch one movie with a crocodile by Matt Borlengy / Killer, skip it and run DinoCroc instead.
