It must be the worst, and I mean the worst biker movie ever made! And it says a lot, because the series is smelly long and smelly! <br /> <br /> Now, at least, we know what happened to Ginger after her rescue from Gilligan Island! Frightened Tina Louise (she was probably afraid that someone would see this mess!) Is a stuck motorist who is tormented by the most disgusting gang of motorcyclists in cinema history. But don't worry fans! Batman, I mean, Dr. Adam West comes to the rescue. Pow! Crush! Boom! Holy Toledo, Batman! <br /> <br /> The only good moments of this “bomb” are cute women, funny battle scenes and still “sexy” Tina Louise!
