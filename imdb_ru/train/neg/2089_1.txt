Of course I watched BG. I liked S1, I liked season 2, season 3 was fine, and I liked the final. Yay, there is a side show! I did not know about it at all, one of my friends told me about it. I was very excited. <br /> <br /> I watched the first 3 episodes ... What a piece of garbage! Teenage girl drama festival. There is no science fiction ... well, hardly there. At the end of each episode we can catch a glimpse of Cylon. It's all. Who cares? They decided that the target audience for the next show would be women under 18? Boring religious nonsense, talking, moaning, boredom ... and one more thing. <br /> <br /> It's just sad that now there is nothing to look at. Stargate destroyed, BG over ...
