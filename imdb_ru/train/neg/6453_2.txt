It is hardly possible to recommend anything in this film. Chase Masterson is always a pleasure to watch and he can really act, although her role in this clanker is a waste of time. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast varies from poor to mediocre. In many films like this, someone shines through the material, and you record it for later use. There is no such luck here. An unknown creature "a monster clich√© is free with children being knocked down one by one. The monster is a man in rubber clothes who listens to the times of Paul Blesdell. So bad, that's good! The rest of the series is just so bad that bad. A little humor could to make it more acceptable, but everyone plays deadly dull stuff right up. At the end there is a twist or two, but by that time you will not care.
