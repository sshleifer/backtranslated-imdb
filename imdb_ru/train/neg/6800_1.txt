I just commented on how awfully stupid this movie is. In addition to being the plagiarism of “Executive Decisions”, “BBC-1”, or any other terrorist story, this type of film makes you appreciate watching a movie in which you can use the same basic ideas and do it well. It is difficult to blame the actors when they are given such a stupid, playful cliché script for work. This is bad enough if you once groan in a film when you face an insult to your intellect, but when you moan again and again, you have to conclude that the director is also not the brightest light bulb in the movie business, and at the same time are producers to decide this story on the screen first. Most of the low-rent actors, which you can excuse for taking on this task, because they most likely came to get money and expose, and not that some kind of joke brought them either reward or recognition. This may end up embarrassing them for such a bad judgment that they get involved in such a loser. I do not see the point in summing up the conspiracy or even in giving any examples that prove my point, for this would be a cruel and unusual punishment that no one could resist. Just as the study of well-made films can inspire you to make a good, skillfully folded work of art and beauty, the only thing you can learn by watching this monster is what NOT to do and what NOT to work ! Keep in mind.
