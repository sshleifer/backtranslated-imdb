“The Second Coming of Suzanne” is another one of those surrealist films that try to appear extremely sophisticated, but all he does is lulls the viewer to sleep. As in other films of this type, the dialogue is limited. All are much more interested in the visual aesthetics of the frame. However, cinematography stinks, so nothing can hold your attention. <br /> <br /> The video box says that this film is “one of the most exciting visual adventures ever seen in a movie.” Yes of course. This is right there with the observation of such stimulating events as a melting ice bucket or a tortoise going a mile away. 1/10
