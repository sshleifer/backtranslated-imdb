I mean the word "pedestrian." It seems the film's producers have forgotten something interesting to happen. Vera Domerga can do better than this. It is assumed that she is the mysterious, vengeful goddess Cobra, torn by love for Marshall Thompson (have an idea, eh?). Instead, she’s an ordinary potential housewife of the fifties, and the only flat expression she wears throughout the film makes me think that they shot it all early in the morning before Faith drank coffee. As for the rest of the actors, they are all so seriously “All-American” that the result is simply ridiculous. This land is more productively illuminated in Val Lewton in "People of the Cat". I think that the “Cult of the Cobra” really should be called the “Cult of Treaty Commitments.” Why do so many more talented people moan their way through a slow, predictable, derivative failure like this?
