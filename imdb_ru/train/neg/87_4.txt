I read all the books Love Come Softly. Knowing perfectly well that films cannot use all aspects of a book, but in general they, at least, have a basic meaning to the book. I was very disappointed in this movie. The only thing they have in this film that is in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit (although both parents come to the book). It's all. The storyline was so perverse and distant, yes, unfortunately, from the book, that I just could not enjoy it. Even if I did not read the book, it was too sad. I know that Pioneer's life was hard, but the whole movie was unfortunate. Rating in order to have the same family orientation of the film, which makes them big.
