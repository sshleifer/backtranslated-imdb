boring things we got here. His 5 minute shorts are better than that. know why? because there are only 5 minutes, not 91 minutes or how long it will be. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to be ... eh .. the last half hour is okay, the rest is boring and not funny = (I was hoping the trailer made it look funny, but the pace of this film is rather slow and, unfortunately, not ridiculous. Just boring claimen, who run into each other and try to make us laugh ... I don’t work. Cutting this film and adding better scenes would bring a lot of healing, but now it’s just not good.
