T. Rama Rao made some extremely beautiful films in the 1980s, but he seems to be a director who cannot grow up with changing times, styles and fashion. He seemed stuck in the same old-fashioned style of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Actors are also good, not very good. Anil Kapoor, as a rule, convincingly plays the two roles of father and son, but an incorrect script often makes him look ridiculous and pathetic. Rekha is good, but then - she is always good, but here she is nothing more than that. She makes the best of what she is given, but she always does it. In conclusion, nothing special. With Ravina everything is in order, which means normal, not bad, bad, nothing. <br /> <br /> This film is melodramatic, sometimes stupid. Maybe this is a delayed film? Well, even then it will still be below the standard. The script is terrible, the film overdid it, and the story is not going anywhere. It looks like a movie made in the early 1990s, but the script makes it look even older, the style is similar to the 1950s. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend, if you are not a big fan of the actors in the main roles.
