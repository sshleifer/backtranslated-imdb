The Giant is one of the most boring, overly long Hollywood designs in history. Many scenes seem completely unreal and devoid of energy. Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean are wasted in this big Hollywood performance. The main thing in this film is that the rancher will resist oil production on his land is absurd, and I know this because I am from Houston. Several scenes, especially Dean, serving Taylor coffee, make this boring movie. For a more accurate and interesting description of how modernism has changed a ranch in Texas, see “Hud” (one of Paul Newman’s wonderful views) or “The Last Picture Show”
