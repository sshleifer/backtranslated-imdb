If you like the original cast and the SNL show, then avoid this movie at all costs. When it first came out, my friends and I waited in the queue for more than an hour to get into a sold-out cinema. in the middle of the movie the theater was empty by 3/4. We refused to leave, thinking it would be better. When the film ended, we were the only ones left in the theater. The film lasted only one day in all cinemas, and then disappeared from view. In an interview with Mr. Mike, he declined to comment on this film. The film was an internal joke on the SNL episodes that came out immediately after the film was released and closed one day later. We all tried to contact Mr. Mike by phone and mail to get a refund, but were completely ignored.
