In the 1970s, WPIX spent “Superman Adventures” every day on weekdays for several years. From time to time we enjoyed when they hung out nearby shows to show "Superman and the Moles." I always looked forward to those days. Watching him recently, I was surprised at how bad it really is. <br /> <br /> It was not bad because of the special effects or the lack of them. True, Superman George Reeves' costume was pretty bad, the edges of the foam pad used it to make it look more impressive, being clearly visible. And the truth is, men's suits were even worse. What should have been a fluffy bedcover would not fool a ten-year-old child, since the zipper, sleeves and poorly peeling fabric, badly stitched into baggy suits, were painfully obvious. But these were excusable faults. <br /> <br /> No, what made it bad was a plot device. Again and again, Superman could not do anything to prevent the situation from getting worse. Lynch mafia looking for creatures? Instead of gathering a hysterical crowd or searching for the creatures themselves, he stands explaining the dangers of the situation to Lois and the public relations worker. Are the creatures cornered? And again he stands watching and talking, but does not save them until they are shot. Does Luke Benson, the local thief, shoot him? Attempt to kill any reasonable person, but Superman releases the person again and again to cause more problems. Superman had a lot of opportunities to fix the problem in the bud, but never used it. <br /> <br /> However, George Reeves and Phyllis Coates played their heroes well, seemingly instantly comfortable in roles, If they were given the best script for the job.
