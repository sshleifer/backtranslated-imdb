Heins and Gofort, who committed this crime, begin with the first step with the wrong foot, suggesting that Wells wrote a gothic horror and that all his lines should be taken seriously. This is simply not true. Wells was largely the heir to the Enlightenment, and his main concern was that Victorian self-satisfaction could leave the British unprepared for a world that new technologies can create — good and bad. <br /> <br /> Two are followed by terrible consequences - the main character is portrayed as a boring screamer (I was reminded of Fay Ray in the original King Kong), and not as a person trying to survive the irony of an incredible catastrophe; and the dialogues smell "Victorian", seriously telling that Wells clearly wanted to be taken on the cheek. <br /> <br /> It all looks suspicious, like Ed Wood with a huge budget to waste on the effects of CGI - which is so badly achieved, Warner Bros. cartoon factory. The 1940s could do better. (The pieces of spattered blood looked like red balls, I expected them to float away at any moment.) Think of the Yellow Submarine, as the old EU comics did. <br /> <br /> Even worse - the loss of a topic that robs. film of any reason for existence. Although the filmmakers return history to the Victorian era, they completely overlook the strange way in which Wells history predicted many of the horrors of World War I — a fact that Wells did not leave unnoticed, who reworked the theme in The Form of Coming Events after the war. <br /> <br /> Without any topic, all that we have is a lot of people running around who crash into cartoon balloons when they don’t try to get a performance in high school. about the correspondence of a drunken student Macbeth. <br /> <br /> Indeed, this is the worst, most senseless bit of sore that I went through, since my friend persuaded me to watch the Eastern European cartoon “Fantastic Planet” thirty years ago, This film was so pretentiously boring, that my friend and I and two complete strangers stopped making fun of him about halfway and sat near the screen, playing cards, using the film as a light to see the cards — his only usefulness, as far as any of us could say. <br /> <br /> But my apartment already has electric lighting, so I didn’t have to humiliate Wells with anything. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie — steal every copy you can (don't pay a cent) and burn each one. God in his wisdom created us for this very purpose.
