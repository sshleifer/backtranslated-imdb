This refers to Zatoichi films, like Star Trek films to Star Trek — except that in this case each of the originals was more interesting and interesting than this big, brilliant reissue, and also better done if substance is more important than surface. If I had never seen them, I would have thought that it was beautiful, but empty; since I had, I thought his style was inappropriate and its content was not enough. The idea of ​​resurrecting a character in a larger, fun production must have sounded good, but there was no point in this but the hope of making money; it’s just a show that is basically unable to convey the atmosphere of the character’s world and completely unable to transfer the character to where he hasn’t been yet (besides, the actor was not at his best). I was hoping to see Ichi in the later stage of life, in a story that would gracefully see him and draw some conclusions from his experience in general; it just goes through pieces from other films, seasoned with lots of sex and abuse. Not at all the same.
