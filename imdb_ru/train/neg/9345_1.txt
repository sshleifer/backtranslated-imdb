I feel as if I was being scammed on, don't fall for it. After reading the bright reviews (for many years, the director worked at Sky with a review of the film, so there should be many friends in the press who are ready to do him a favor by writing favorable reviews) developmental plot and poetic moments. Unfortunately, “Sixteen Years of Alcohol” does not fulfill the promises of critics, for the most part, donate these qualities instead of low-cost cheese special effects (what was this clichéd web there for?), Unrealistic battle choreography and mindless, mind-blowing narration, cliches and camera views. <br /> <br /> “Sixteen Years of Alcohol” starts with interesting shots in Scotland, but from here, straight down. Unfortunately, instead of spending some time creating an atmosphere, creating characters that we could take care of, or creating uncertainty - the director decides to start driving you crazy with the help of an indulgent homemade heavy voiceover. The main characters do not sympathize so badly and do so - the audience doesn’t care what happens to them, desperate actors do desperate things ... like this film! Worse, “homage” (typical of a director trying to pay his dues to past masters) is either completely cliche or unconvincing. The soundtrack is the only thing that brought me up and kept me in the cinema, but even this could not support the dramatic narrative linking the time period with the action. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the film became increasingly flawed and, frankly, annoying. I still watched this damn thing! <br /> <br /> I think I liked the attempt at realism in the film, but even it was destroyed when they were often intersected by strange and abstract, sometimes meaningless scenes. You do not need a huge budget to make a truly touching film, so much has been said about how little money they had to make this film, half a million is not a little bit of money ... THERE IS NO SUBJECT! Sometimes I wonder what the actors think ... Or their agents! <br /> <br /> Pass this turkey if you are not a masochist or brainless .... NOT MY THING <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10
