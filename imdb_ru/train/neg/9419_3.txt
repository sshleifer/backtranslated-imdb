I have never heard of this, then I learned that this is a man with a lethal lens, which I heard, but did not see. Connery's presence made me buy it, and that's not good. He wants to be something average between Dr. Strandzhelov and Mash, but it's not that funny unless you find the name of General Wombat (?) Funny. He looks like a flat thriller of the 70s until the last ten minutes when he comes to life. There are many, many flat scenes in the White House between the president and his assistants who do not work. Itâ€™s as if the initial cut was too long, and the first half was edited to get to the entire nuclear bomb ransom storyline and suicide attacks, which I think should be played for laughter, but again This is not fun. The set is great, but the studio material looks like a cheap TV. I could not believe that the man responsible for Key Largo, Crossfire and Elmer Gentry did this. A single laugh: Connery throws out a wig, puts on a helmet and jumps out of the plane. It makes Never Say Never look like a genius again.
