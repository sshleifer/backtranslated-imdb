The first part, Che in Cuba, about that part of his life. It contains too many indistinguishable battles and Che serving too many indistinguishable wounded (remember that Che was a doctor). It ends when Castro wins the revolution; Che will never get to Havana. The second part, Che in Bolivia, that guess. It contains too many indistinguishable battles and Che serving too many indistinguishable wounded. <br /> <br /> When I realized that it was supposed to be “epic” (I never knew * anything * except the name before it began), Naturally, I thought about the greatest of all these epics, about Lawrence of Arabia David Lin More on this later. <br /> <br /> Not to be a racist, but besides what I mentioned, there is the fact that there are too many characters that are, well, indistinguishable - unknown Latin American actors who look equally, especially considering that they all wear Che beards and all wear Che. This leads to the fact that the viewer cannot identify himself with anyone except Che, with Benicio del Toro (even Fidel plays a very minor role). While del Toro is awesome, think of “Lawrence” with Peter O'Toole as the only prominent character: neither Alec Guinness, nor Omar Sharif, nor Anthony Quinn, etc. You understood. <br /> <br /> Since other characters are interchangeable, this results in a loss of the link. When Che's chief assistants are killed, you do not feel regret, because you do not know who they are. Even when Che is killed (I do not think this is a spoiler), the public has no sympathy - he is simply killed. <br /> <br /> He is too one-dimensional to treat him as a person. Besides the fact that we are revolutionaries and are only inferior to Jesus in the moral aspect, we only know about Che that he is married with five children (he tells another character near the end). What was his motivation? Complete mystery. <br /> <br /> Maybe Soderbergh deliberately imitates Lin. Like Che Soderbergh, Lin never tells us anything about Lawrence, the mysterious man of Arabia. But at least Lawrence had a friend (Sharif) and associates (Guinness, Quinn). He was as courageous as the unsure, that is, possessed of human qualities. Che is like a car, about as warm as the Terminator. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this year there was another military epic - “Mongol”. Che makes the Mongolians look like a beautiful life.
