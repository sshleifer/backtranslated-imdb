** 1/2 for this farce is Diane Keaton. <br /> <br /> Someone should tell Mrs. Keaton, enough with your Annie Hall philosophy and hats. <br /> <br /> This movie is too Keaton's daughter, Sarah, dies in a traffic accident while her boyfriend survives. <br /> <br /> Keaton, whom she couldn’t be contacted by phone at first, since she was in a bag with her friend and pulled out a telephone socket, grieves in a new way for the mourners. <br /> <br /> She retreats to a summer place where all Sarah's friends live. She cleans the house, sleeps for two days, and then begins to reveal things that it is better not to reveal. It seems that sweet Sarah slept with her friend and boyfriend, who eventually married the last one. In addition, she had an abortion thanks to this guy. We are all now on this journey of guilt. <br /> <br /> Her only hope is to find the elusive diary kept by Sarah. She also hopes that the guy, the playwright Adam, will not include all this in another play. <br /> <br /> When the diary is found, it is written in Japanese. Sarah has a doctorate in this language. This is not good news for mom, when a Japanese chef translates from a diary passage in a Japanese restaurant. <br /> <br /> Naturally, in the end, everything looks good. <br /> <br /> The name of this man comes from the Wizard of Oz. Every time Mom and Sarah talked, they both said, “Hand over to Dorothy.” <br /> <br /> As if that were not enough, during this strange extravaganza Keaton tells Adam that he should not be another Woody Allen. in his film Interiors, where he tried to successfully emulate Ingmar Bergman. Ms. Keaton also tries drugs with a group. Come on guys, can we really believe that any sane person can mourn this? <br /> <br /> A mediocre fair best sums up this film.
