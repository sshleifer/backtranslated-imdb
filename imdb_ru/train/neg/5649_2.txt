I don't think this is too bad a show in the right conditions. I suffered the first season. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this show is about lawyers who are not really lawyers. God forbid that anyone actually went to law school on the basis of these shows, which I heard about, was a case where I watched some of the interview shows. It just made me shut up a bit. <br /> <br /> Among other things, Spader and Shatner, which should be the stars of the series, are the most annoying. While this may be a compliment in some situations, it is certainly not here. At first, their constant pursuit of women on the show is ridiculous. But since this is what they do literally all the time, I realized that this is as deep as the show is going to get. Attempting to intersperse some serious, dramatic and even jerky moments in the middle of this mockery of a real show does not compensate for the progressive loss of interest that I have in trying to enjoy the show. <br /> <br /> Bright and impartial “announcements of public service” by Alan Shor, where he expresses his opinion, are not impressive. Danny Crane is just annoying. I was ashamed of him and of the authors of the show for the performance of Crane in a colonial outfit. <br /> <br /> I give two stars, because there are moments when I thought that the series was trying to solve some modern problems. Everything was done with care. <br /> <br /> I think that the writers of the series realized that sexual harassment by Danny and Alan was becoming powerful even for those who were more attractive from the very beginning. The thing is, I don’t care if the series’s treatment of sexual harassment is well done, but I just felt that the author insulted me with artificial implantations of sexual banter throughout the show in the hope that my libido would continue me back for more. I am no longer a teenager, and I think this show is promising if his goal was not to please the lowest common denominator in order to get ratings. <br /> <br /> Of course, I write this after I realized that it really wouldn't be much better than that. This is a shame, because this is one of those shows that I would like to love.
