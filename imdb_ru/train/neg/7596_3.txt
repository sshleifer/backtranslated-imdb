A film featuring Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, two respected and talented actors, sounds like a great idea. Independent film sounds even better. Studios will control less content, allowing actors, writers and directors more creativity. <br /> <br /> But why is this film so soft? Ask for the dust. <br /> <br /> This film suggests that we are deeply embedded in the characters. No one has been given the right background, so we never know why characters behave like they do. <br /> <br /> Explanations for physical and emotional scars remain in our imagination, if you still have them. left at the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> I told a friend I went to see this movie and thought it was awful. <br /> <br /> Her question: â€œCan not even Colin Farrell save it? My answer: "Even Colin Farrell's ass can't save him."
