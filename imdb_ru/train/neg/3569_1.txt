Blimey! Only a film that is ridiculously awful can inspire the likes of Showgirls. I mean, where to start? Indescribably horrible song theme? Non-expressions Pia Zadora throughout the film? The fact that, despite the fact that he is in Los Angeles, he is the "land of the couch", EVERY single man (and woman!) All the time dream to sleep with Pia Zadora, any invented means? Or what about the fact that all the people in the film are not at all sympathetic, because they are either stupidly stupid (Pia), or obviously despicable scoundrels (all the others)? And given that this film was written by real “screenwriters” (Sorta), it shows a shocking lack of understanding of the film industry (who the hell delight and kiss the screenwriter?) <br /> <br /> But it is (unintentionally) funny how the hell, although one “breakdown” scene will make you giggle, and after watching the climatic “I'm not the only one who had to get to the top” on the “Awards” stage (everything is done at the usual level of acting skills that we expect as Pia), I sincerely hope that our dear th Pia really re-used this speech, when she "won" a Golden Globe. make my day <br /> <br /> In any case, if you're a fan of a bad, sentimental camp, try this tasteless movie.
