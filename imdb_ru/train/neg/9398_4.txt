... at least during his first half. If it began with three buddies in the navy and concentrated on the scenes of naval activities, it would be a much better and tougher film. The second half of the film is worth it, especially for action movies and close-ups of ships from the beginning of the 20th century, but this seems like a dull toothache. Also, don’t watch this film just because it’s Ginger Rogers. She has an important role, but she is small. <br /> <br /> The film begins with three friends from New York, engaged in the tourist trade, as well as good-natured competition for the hand of Sally (Ginger Rogers). A singing candy saleswoman along the avenue. The First World War, three friends seem to be completely indifferent to the fight, but they still join the navy. One of the three with the least civilian industry (Bill Boyd in Baltimore) replaces the commander of the other two (Robert Armstrong as the Dutchman and James Gleason as the skete). To make things more complicated, Sally fell in love with one of the three, but did not have the opportunity to tell him before three went to war. <br /> <br /> The film is a bit more interesting aboard a ship, mainly because of close shots of the ship itself, and also because the chemistry among the three buddies is plausible. However, at the age of 49, James Gleason looks a little long in the tooth to be smear, especially when it was said in the draft board that you must be between 17 and 35 years old to be eligible. <br /> <br /> One real, obvious flaw in the film that made me believe that everything outside the nautical scenes was assembled with minimal care — this was costume design or, I would say, its absence. In the scenes in New York shortly before the First World War, we all were dressed in the fashion of 1931 and everyone drove the cars of 1931 - there was no effort to start this film. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you watch several scenes with Ginger Rogers in them and the last 45 minutes devoted to the naval suicide mission, you have seen everything worth seeing here. The rest is stuffing.
