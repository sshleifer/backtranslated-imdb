No matter how you look at this film, it’s just awful. <br /> <br /> If you look at it like horror, then this is a horror-free film in which monsters are puppets. <br /> <br /> If you look at it as a comedy, then you will notice that most of the humor does not make sense and just limp. <br /> <br /> If this is romance, you will wonder why the guy would have stayed with such a B ** ch! <br /> <br /> If you look at this as an action that you can’t get for the aching hero. <br /> <br /> As you can see, this film simply does not give anything remotely entertaining. As mentioned, the monsters are obvious puppets, and this film was another attempt at a film like the Gremlins. This, however, has the worst monsters of this genre. The critters looked pretty good, as did the ghouls, damn it, even the Manchy puppets looked better than these. The characters in this film are extremely unpleasant. The hero is a tearful guard, his girlfriend always complains, they have a rogue friend who has a fighting boyfriend, and another friend who is a spasm. At some point in the movie, the hero and the military guy fight the rake ... this film is just stupid. I like the scene when they are in a terrible club scum (which is obviously not a club, but rather a snack bar), and the hero tells the waitress that none of them is 21 years old. Give me a break, I'm 25, and I look younger than any of them.
