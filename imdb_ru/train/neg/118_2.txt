They say that this is a personal film for Peter Bogdonavich. He based it on his life, but changed everything around to fit the characters who are detectives. These detectives are found with beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy, not like a detective, is it? This entire film was written by Peter, and it shows how he was not in touch with real people. You have to write what you know, and he really did it. And leaves the audience bored, confused and jealous. This is a curiosity for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten killed right after the shooting. But Patti Hanson, who in real life would marry Keith Richards, was also a model like Stratten, but much better and has a bigger role. Actually, the role of Stratten seemed forced; added. It has nothing to do with the story, which is quite confusing to begin with. In general, each character in this film is one with whom few people can communicate, unless you are a millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels of your choice. For the rest of us, it's an annoying snoring feast. This is what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with jokes, and you are annoying everything else.
