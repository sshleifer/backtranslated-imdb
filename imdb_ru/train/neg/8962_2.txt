I think this ice sucked in because it left the cube and gave us a lot of information about who and why. The original CUBE never left the cube, and it left everything to your imagination. This crappy holiday, however, gives you all this. and I didn’t like it ... Although acting is solid, I think the reason for this was depressing, because it was done by people other than ORIGINAL directors if they had Vincenzo Natali to make this prequel, or even a sequel, I think , it would be better and more loyal to the source. so I recommend that you stay far, far away, and HYPERCUBE, another film that I don’t even want to discuss ... (I gave him 2 for acting only)
