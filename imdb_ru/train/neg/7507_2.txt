This film is bad news, and I'm really surprised at the level of talent that will ever agree to appear in a piece of garbage like this one. I believe that there were a few strangled agents on Hollywood Boulevard. as a result of this fiasco. What really turns you on is that it could be good. Directors play a major role, and the subject was sufficient food to generate interest and ticket sales, but this is a failure. Several storylines move from bad to stupid at the end of the pictures, and you end up feeling like a mouse in a maze, looking for a piece of cheese that turns out to be rotten. What Spike can achieve is to take revenge on the Italians, who may have beaten him when he was a child, or insulted him, because the film talks quite a lot about keeping outdated and possibly offensive Italian stereotypes. As with any Spike Lee movie, there are some really provocative and magical shots. He has a gift to grab your psyche and bring you to your vision at least for a few memorable scenes. But the question remains ... can you tolerate the other 2 hours of scratches on your head and for hours, watching you wonder, and waiting for the end to be somewhere there.
