This film tried to be too much at the same time: a burning political satire, a Hollywood blockbuster, a juicy romantic comedy, a promo about family values ​​... the list goes on and on. He failed miserably at all of them, but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off until the end. <br /> <br /> While I appreciate the spirit behind WAR, INC., I’m very sorry to see such awkward efforts, especially when they are undertaken by its goals to reflect the absence of serious criticism, and not just poor writing, directing and production of this particular film. <br /> <br /> There is a criticism to be made about the corporateization of war. But making fun of it in this way reduces the true atrocity of what is happening. Reminds me a bit of THREE KINGS, which also simplifies the real cause for concern.
