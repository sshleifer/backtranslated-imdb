I am a fan of horror films and bloody films, and this film was so bad that I felt embarrassed not only for the “actors”, but also for the director and the bad juice of the producer, who actually invests his money in this slok. /> <br /> From the title you expect some big slaughter, some story line and at least some direction or dialogue. Instead, you get something like an episode with three violent and sexual episodes. At least I laugh at the three puppets. While watching this shit, I turned on another TV and started watching Howard Stern until something interesting happened. <br /> <br /> Of course, I continued to watch Stern. <br /> <br /> Watching this “movie” I understand that I could make a movie with three monkeys, two DV cameras, $ 50 dollars in a raffle and a broken PC. This film inspires me to create off-budget films. Watch this movie if you dare, but keep in mind ... there is a lot of nothing but talk and very little action. This makes KaZaam look like a Meryl Streep movie. <br /> <br /> I am sure that Germany did not ban it because of sex or violence. Other countries should take into account.
