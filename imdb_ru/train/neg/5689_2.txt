Over the past year, Uwe Boll showed a slight improvement in the quality of the director, releasing a competent "In the Name of the King" (Lord of the Rings clone) and proudly vulgar satire after September 11, 2001. ". But then the Seed arrived, and the counter was reset to zero, retaining its desire for legitimacy and respect, which is far beyond the reach. And I'm a fan of this guy - his films demonstrate a unique, playful concept and are never boring. <br /> <br /> Arising from his disappointment at the wild remarks received by his early films, “Seed” is a tremendously erroneous attempt at social commentary and an even worse blow to creating legendary slasher mythology (Ball often seems to take page from a successful reboot of Rob Zombie "Halloween"). The antagonist is Maxwell Sid (Will Sanderson), dumb, clumsy cattle, who killed 666 people and was sitting on death row while awaiting execution; after the unsuccessful frying of the beast, he rises from the grave to take revenge on those who put him there ... and so begins a series of completely useless unrest. <br /> <br /> Trying to create a slasher of the new millennium in According to Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees, Max Sid is too indescribable and boring to leave an impression that ultimately resembles a washed professional wrestler who performs Kills with the Tools in the same way. boring victims. In addition, the nature of Seeds and Ball’s “message” contradict each other: the death penalty is wrong, of course, but do we really have to sympathize with the soulless killer who left behind a couple of hundred corpses? I think not. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Michael Paret behaves like the sluggish, long-lost brother of James Remar’s character in the film “Dexter”: a policeman who sits around the table, flipping through newspaper clippings, and watching meaningless scenes of stopping the movement of decaying animals and people trapped in the den of the Seed. By the time he and a handful of cardboard policemen are storming the seed shelter, the sequence is so stretched, ill-conceived (almost no lighting) and uninteresting (despite a healthy dose of blood), it almost made me sleep. <br /> <br /> Inconvenient filmmaking is not limited to this sequence only: “Seed” seems to have been shot by a drunken filmmaker, as the camera swings endlessly and is woven, a technique that is more turning the stomach than the blood itself; these protracted events, which occur very rarely, only draw attention to the winding, almost non-existent narration. In the 90th minute, the film was stretched enough to be considered a form of torture, which Boll may have been aiming for all the time. <br /> <br /> Pure genius ... I think the joke is on me.
