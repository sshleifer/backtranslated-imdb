Richard Tyler is a little boy who is afraid of everything. He does not like to ride a bike or climb a tree, because he knows what accidents can happen to him. So one day he rides his bike, and since it starts to rain, he decides to wait in the library until it stops raining. There the whole story takes place. He tests all kinds of personnel and, in the end, he is no longer scary. But the whole story is incredible, and even such good actors as Macaulay Culkin, could not make the story better than it is.
