This picture began with good intentions, Bacon, a scientist, to test the theory of invisibility, and Shu, as usual, is sweet in his role. After that, everything falls apart, now it's your typical Hollywood thriller, shot on the sound stage with a lot of special effects, without any humor, wit or soul. In other words, do not waste your time watching this. Get an audiotape with John DeLancey as the Invisible Man, as well as with Leonard Nimy in the lead role. Now it was good, and H. G. Wells is well served, unlike this mess.
