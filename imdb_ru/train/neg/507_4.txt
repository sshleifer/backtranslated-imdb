Unlike my fellow reviewers, I always try to find something redemptive in any film that I see. Yes, the quality of duplication and illumination is terrible, the acting is wooden and the intro sequence is very misleading that with all these lustful lesbian vampire women with dripping blood. Something must be lost in the translation of the word "bloodsucker" from Italian in the title; almost as if the producers were originally going to make a film about a gothic vampire, and then changed their mind, but could not afford to abandon their dramatic introductory sequence, so they still attached it to the film. <br /> <br /> This movie made in 1975 was released on DVD and comes with its own theatrical trailer, which in some ways is more daring than in the movie! mid 1970s. I bought it because I am attracted to Krista Nelly (most often called “Krista Nell”). The absence of characters that I find most disappointing in many Eurolysis films of the 60s and 70s. I hoped that Imdb would show the cast of the characters, since everyone hears their names in the film, but without the cast list it’s very difficult to associate them with the appropriate actor. I think Krista Nell played Kora, but under this massive hairstyle, costume and make-up it is difficult to distinguish her for sure. <br /> <br /> Actors of their parts are mainly depicted in two dimensions, and no one stands out. Perhaps something is lost in the duplication process. What were the positive points? The music was atmospheric and, of course, if you were in beautiful lesbian soft porn used it there.The external places were good and I would like to know where they shot the castle on its island.It wants to be installed in “Ireland” (North or Republic?) In 1902, so that all tracksuit period. Some scenes that I found inadvertently funny, especially those sex scenes !! In any case, a pleasant romp. I rated it 4/10.
