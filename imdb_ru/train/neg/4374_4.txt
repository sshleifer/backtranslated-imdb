<br /> <br /> The interiors of the Maiden are so bizarre and incomprehensible that they allow the viewer to interpret her subjectively, applying any meaning he wishes, to the inexplicable excesses of sex and violence. If this were a deliberate characteristic of the film, it would be a work of postmodern brilliance, but of course it is not. <br /> <br /> Without going into details of the plot, let's quickly go through the events. An orgy is held in a private cabin, which includes topless wrestling and diapers. A van of latecomers joins a progressive orgy, but they were unwittingly followed by a monster, whom I like to call a “dirty ninja.” This monster precedes the killing of the participants of the orgy one by one, except for the notorious virgin (except for oral sex), who receives his seed and, therefore, becomes so passionate with the desire that she masturbates with someone else's hand. <br /> <br /> At last she had guts pulled out, and then a scene that seemed to imply that she was pregnant with a dirty ninja. Got it all? If you are going to rent this movie, it's best if you don't speak Japanese and you don't have subtitles. In a season filled with boring Hollywood films, including it in a VCR can be the cinematic equivalent of shock therapy. It will definitely be something else.
