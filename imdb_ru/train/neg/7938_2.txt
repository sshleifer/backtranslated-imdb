A family looking for some old roadside sights to include in their father’s coffee table book faces an old, decrepit, old, ugly show run by an eccentric one-eyed man. When their family van breaks down after leaving the show, they are forced to stay in an almost abandoned fishing camp, which was the site of a prison break a decade ago. <br /> <br /> The film had a lot of freak 'horror sub-genre, ranging from beloved' Freaks' Tod Browning (1932) to merry 'Freaked' Alex Winter (1993). These are both classics (or, most likely, “Freaked”). "Side Sho", however, will never be. And if he ever reaches the classic status. Well, it will be the obvious key to the sad state of our genre. From this ridiculously bad introductory song to a 17-year-old daughter, who is clearly older than her natural mother, this film has done little. The letter was poor quality, but not quite terrible. just boring. The direction was bad, and the rare strange effects were pretty awful and incredible. The acting was terrible, and the casting was even worse. Anyone who believed in the age of these two teenagers of camp age should not have met a teenager for a long time. Goran and violence were far from enough to compensate for the absence of any other qualities. And when there was some violence, it was not well done at all. And I can not forget to mention the final fighting scenes, which, frankly, were among the worst that I have ever seen in the film. In general, it is an easily forgotten and poorly-made horror film that deserves to be left alone at the bottom of the money box. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 2.5 / 10.
