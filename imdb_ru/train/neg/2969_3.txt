The story is very trustworthy and powerful. The technical side of the film is pretty good ... even directing. The main problem is related to the castings, which turned this film into practically another local and ordinary clich√© with a large lack of impact and even a greater lack of impression. In addition to the small role of the father, Raphael (impressively played by Asi Dayan), all the other actors, unfortunately, were not at their best. The role of the older blind girl, played by Tali Sharon, was fresh, but without any intensity as a leading role. therefore, the figure she acted became soft and restrained. There were moments and episodes that were more like a rehearsal than a real movie. But in the end, this is a good moment from which to start and make great improvements in the future.
