This film was strange, completely inexplicable and hysterical, to watch with friends while drinking in a big empty house. I really love opening things with Lisa wandering about lost in a gorgeous city. I want to be a beautiful stranger, lost in some exotic European region, although perhaps not in a horror film with a low budget. Definitely get an end where there are weird non-sexy sex scenes that were cut (at least in my DVD copy). Don't try to figure it out, just go and watch the weird bits ... and that's it. Do not watch it if you really want the plot, characterization, or something to make sense at all. Pretty nice, although you can just give up on it and decide to watch a real horror movie, such as Dead Alive.
