This film was quite absurd. There were a FEW funny parts. This is right in the trash bin in my memory, where I think: “Hmm ... this film had some funny parts, but overall, a rather funny story (or absence). <br /> <br /> I thought Ben tried too hard to be a funny guy. And I did not understand how he was a multimillionaire and still such an idiot. Anyway, I like Ben Affleck. He does a little shit, but hey, I can forgive him. I mean, I liked the girl from Jersey, I did not think that Jilly was to blame, I like him as a whole. I think he's kind of like the guy you feel sorry for, because he just can't get it right. <br /> <br /> My advice is to avoid this flick. It really didn’t develop into a workable conspiracy, and Catherine O'Hara and Jimmy J. Weren't used as much as they could be. They deserved better. In general, this film is not alone at home, it is not a New Year story, it is not Christmas holidays or any other classic. Forever forgotten
