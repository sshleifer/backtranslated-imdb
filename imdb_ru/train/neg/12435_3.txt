Alex D. Linz replaces Macaulay Calkin as the central figure in the third film of the empire, "Home Alone." Four industrial spies acquire a computer chip of the missile guidance system and ship it through the airport in a remote-controlled toy car. Because of the baggage confusion, the grumpy Mrs. Hess (Marian Seldes) gets the car. She gives it to her neighbor Alex (Linz) just before the spies appear. Spies rent a house to rob every neighboring house until they find a car. At home alone with chicken pox, Alex calls 911 every time he notices a theft occurs, but the spies always manage to escape from the police, while Alex is accused of joking. The spies are finally turning their attention to Alex, not suspecting that he has falsified devices to slyly shut up his whole house. Home 3 wasn’t terrible, but probably shouldn’t have been done, you can't just replace Macauli Culkin, Joe Sands or Daniel Stern. In Home Alone 3 there are a few funny details, but I don’t like it when the characters change in the movies, view at your own risk.
