I really felt betrayed by seeing this picture. It seemed to me that I sat and watched this film 101 minutes in vain. I do not understand what they thought when they did it. This is unlikely to fall into the murder of Jeffrey Dahmer and has no end. It seemed that they left this film open to continue. It was like watching a soprano television episode. It ends suddenly, and you know that there will be another episode next week. It also seemed to me that I had just watched the first part of a two-part film. There are many opportunities for what went wrong here; they were lazy, they ran out of money, they did not know the rest of the story, they wanted to make Dahmer 2. After watching this movie, they all sound very accurate. I watched as Geoffrey Dahmer walked through the forest. Suddenly, I hear this music playing, then an inscription appears on the screen saying that Dahmer had served 2 years of his imprisonment and was attacked by one of the prisoners and was killed at the age of 34. the forests until his death in prison. How about showing how he got there. How about showing Dahmer's trial? How about some details. I can't even explain what happened in this movie because he jumped everywhere. I actually found myself saying with disbelief: "Is this all, is this the end?" I want to complete this review by saying that there is still a good film about Damer that has yet to be made. I would like to say to the filmmakers if you are going to do it, do it right.
