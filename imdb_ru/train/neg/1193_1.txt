Do you know how sometimes you can watch a crappy movie with friends and laugh at all the shortcomings of the movie? Well, that was for it. I bought a DVD on Tower Records, because it cost $ 3, and I heard that this is a movie you can laugh at. It really is nothing but pathetic. After about 30 minutes of the film, my friends started asking me to turn it off. About 45 minutes, they begged me. An hour later, we compromised to move forward to the end, so that we could see how the conflict was resolved (and because we were constantly watching Matt Walsh). Seriously, don't watch this movie. It hurts.
