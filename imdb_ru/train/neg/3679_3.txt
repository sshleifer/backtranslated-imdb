This is a Japanese film, but English is also spoken here. This is a cute film with beautiful visual effects, showing the beautiful beauty of Hawaii. <br /> <br /> However, this was the only quality for me. The story was generally boring. Who wants to watch a young woman sulking at 90% of the film because her “pictured” husband is much older than he advertised? Of course, this may be a breakdown ... but put up with it! <br /> <br /> Only in the last 10 minutes, she turned around and loved him. By that time, it was too late for most viewers. We fell asleep by that time.
