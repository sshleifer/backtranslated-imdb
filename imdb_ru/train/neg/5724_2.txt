I agree with the last reviewer that this movie is a terrible game. Yes, there was a lot of blood and nudity. But it was overshadowed by a slow, meaningless conspiracy and a blunt end. In any case, where was this supposed to be filmed: Canadian Chinatown or Hong Kong? The hostel was a much better movie, and I would recommend seeing it instead. The technical annoyance I experienced on the DVD is that if you turn off the Spanish subtitles, they will return through several scenes, and then you will have to go back to the main menu and turn them off again. In addition, do not waste your time on distant scenes, because there is no sound, and it just looks like tourist shots.
