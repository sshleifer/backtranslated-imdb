I went into it, hoping that it would be the “thought-provoking” little pearls, people saw it as. I like indie films, and I was going to dig it too. knowing what a hot button in these topics, I expected it to be really entertaining, maybe even see the perspective of outsiders. <br /> <br /> all I can say is wow: if you are addicted to torture or mutilation you will like it personally, I don’t like the idea of ​​being deceived or cut, so I thought it was rubbish. bad script, bad game, bad story, bad direction, bad editing ... I can continue. I have no idea why the reviewer argued that he or she put forward a political point of view, giving this film 10. This is misleading and ignorant. voting for a movie on IMDb does not create a precedent! it simply allows other people to think that a similar garbage bomb can be watched while it is contradictory (this film is not very good, it tries VERY hard, but it fails). <br /> <br /> You know that the film is bad, when in 15 minutes you pray that all the main characters die horribly. unfortunately, they are dying, but not in such painful manners that would give the viewer some justice or excuse for watching the 2 hours of shit they just experienced. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, just don't worry. I got this movie in a special bin in my local video store for .50 and I feel ripped off!
