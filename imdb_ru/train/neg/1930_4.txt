Some praised _Atlantis: _The_Lost_Empire_ as a Disney adventure for adults. I do not think so - at least not for minded adults. <br /> <br /> This scenario suggests starting as a live-action movie that hit someone like crap that you can no longer sell to adults. The "triangular staff" of many old adventure films was made long before that (think The Dirty Dozen), but Atlantis represents one of the worst films in this motive. The characters are weak. Even the background that each participant throws out seems dull and awkward at best. MD / Medicine Man, a tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted sons, if we at least did not see them before, we saw the quirks of mixing and coincidence before. The story of how one of the companions, Vinnie, played by Don Novello (father of Guido Sarducci), went all the way from flower shops to demolitions is completely unconvincing. <br /> <br /> Only the main character, Milo Thatch, a young obsessed with Atlantis, voiced by Michael J. Fox, has some depth for him. The search for Atlantis Milo continues to search for his grandfather, who brought him up. The opening scene depicts a much younger Milo sitting lightly on his knee when his grandfather puts on a cork helmet on his head. <br /> <br /> And although the characters were thin at best, the best part in _Atlantis_ was the voice of talent. Perhaps Milo’s depth is not thicker than Fox’s charm. Commander Rourke loses nothing when voiced by James Garner. Although Rourke is quite a typical military type, Garner demonstrates his ability to breathe life into characters by simply placing him. Garner's vocal performance is a high point. I am sorry to say that Leonard's "The Dying King" Nimea is no more than obligatory. In addition, Don Novello, as a demolition expert, Winnie Santorini, was also known for one or two well-made, fun lines — but I always liked Father Guido Sarducci, anyway. <br /> <br /> Computer animation is also well done. Background animation, that is. The character's animation hasn't been so bad for Disney ever since Don Bluth was kicked out of the door by minimalism. Character animation does nothing if it does not make flat characters more even. In addition to landscapes, buildings and vehicles nothing special to impress. <br /> <br /> The plot was the worst. Some say trite or trite. I'm not sure about that. Any serviceable site can be turned into something new with appropriate processing. Shakespeare often began with a famous story and plot, and became famous only for the fact that he applied a new layer of paint. So treatment is a thing. And at _Atlantis_ this is clearly not. <br /> <br /> I can not begin to delve into all the logical spaces without a spoiler section. The plot was bad. The bridges of the plot break like a string, and the ending does not make sense. To add to this, the script and animation are spiced up with annoying carelessness. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> 1. At the very beginning, when Milo discovers that the runic or Celtic characters were incorrectly transliterated, the "Coast of Ireland" should be read as "The Coast Iceland ”, we have problems. The script writers should have known that the British perceive Eire or Eiranna as “Ireland” and completely ignore the older Latin term “Hibernia”. But more than that, they should be aware of the Viking plot to name the more green island Iceland and the icy island Greenland. <br /> <br /> By formulating this as an incorrectly transliterated “letter,” the authors doomed themselves to the requirement of a runic version of the English language and the post-Roman date in the script. Since this happens long after Atlantis was supposed to plunge into its underwater cave. And without visible clues and fewer technologies than Milo had, this inscription became less reliable. <br /> <br /> 2. Shepard’s journal could not have been written before the sinking of Atlantis, or he would have known nothing about a cave or a crystal lying “in the eyes of the king.” It must have been written after the dive, but even without the technology that Milo's expedition possessed, how the hell did someone get Leviathan. So how could he know more about anything after that? And why would it be written in Atlantic? <br /> <br /> This can explain the automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel. However, clairvoyance and astral travel do not require Shepard to write in the Atlantean language. So it must be some kind of automatic letter. Since none of those left in Atlantis can read, it must be the spirits of crystalline messages to the surface. It would make more sense. But in the film it was also possible to explain: Milo could find that this force had called him all his life — appeared in a dream, etc. This needed to be studied in the film. <br /> <br /> 3, Atlants simply do not need to understand modern languages. No one expects the native Indo-Europeans to communicate in Europe, more than the Romans understand that the tough “s” or their day became French “ch” (pronounced “sh”, no less!) <br /> <br /> 4. The current Atlanteans were alive before the cataclysm - when, apparently, they could * read *, but now they could not read what they were used to, or control similar mechanisms. <br /> <br /> 5. Massive illiteracy indicates a crucial flaw in the film. ANYTHING doesn’t seem to happen to this culture. It seems he is suspended in the air until Milo can save him. Even if it seems that life is not a constant struggle for survival, no one wants to write poems or write novels, and perhaps this is a combination of Atlantic school systems going down towards the end, and the absence of a good invention that led to the fall of Atlantis. illiteracy. <br /> <br /> 5. Kidu can be excused for not knowing how to read or control the equipment if she was so young when the Cataclysm of Stupidity began - But ANY THIS ** HARD ** entitles her father to deification !! The stupidity of Kashakim almost single-handedly wiped his people off the face of the earth. He killed a heap in a cataclysm, slowed down progress (there were not too many killed, but he watched a huge decline in culture and progress) until someone could take a crystal to kill everyone if they were not first boiled in lava, because giant robots were not there to protect them. <br /> <br /> The blow of blue electricity was supposed to destroy the image of Kashakim, when Kid tried to connect the image of his father with the circle of GREAT Kings of Atlantis! <br /> <br /> 6. Although Milo was the only one who could read Atlantic, Rourke and others knew enough to look at a book on the wastelands and find a page on a crystal that he knew , was a crystal, and not some stylized astrological or "phase". sun chart. <br /> <br /> 7. If Milo’s grandfather told Rourke about it, he still doesn’t explain how Rourke would have suffered if Milo read it as part of a book. Tearing out a page — which was ears in Rourke’s hand, although Milo apparently didn’t find any signs of a torn page in the book — just to warn the viewer that “something was not quite right.” If the word "crystal" would not have alarmed Milo that someone would try to steal it, Milo would not have suspected anything. This is just a hunch with dull heads. <br /> <br /> 8. The team’s “double cross” was not a change of character. We learned that Vinnie, Sweet, Audrey and Cookies walked with Rourke from the very beginning. However, the "change of heart" is not successful. It was a change, and it had to be motivated better. It is difficult to do with characters who were given nothing to begin with. <br /> <br /> 9. A little sniffing that lava flows through the dome, instead of filling the rest of the area with which we see the sequence. It is a liquid; it will not flow through the protective dome until it has filled all the lower areas. <br /> <br /> 10. The end stinks! - and has no other meaning than to pacify political correctness. With a renewed source of energy, Atlantis is no longer a weak force that needs babysitters. Giant guardian robots and heavenly cycles shooting blue lightning suggest that they should fear us less than they could. The technology is superior to ours and, of course, the beginning of the 20th century. After all, Milo needs to teach the Atlantes to read, for what? The whole idea is to leave your small, quiet, punished culture alone, and not send it to the hyperdrive. <br /> <br /> ** THE END OF SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Perhaps the plot of the “Lost World” and the situation at the turn of the centuries will let me know that this is more of a homage to pulps. The failures that I discovered in the film agree with this idea. But I am at a loss as to why I have to pay to see thin characters and draw holes simply because they were in many dime novels. And cellulose stories are part of “bullshit that they can no longer sell to adults,” anyway. We have become a little more sophisticated, and our flesh must grow. The Raiders of the Lost Ark did not lose the sensation of the pulp and avoided so much harm. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 - the movie is enjoyable, but as I think about the plot, it seeps lower and lower.
