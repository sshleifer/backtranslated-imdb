I'm not sure this is a spoiler; perhaps this is a public service. If you are one of those people who are focused on instant gratification and are missing final credits, you will miss the last line of voice-over commentary on final credits, which says that the US just surrendered to Nazi Germany on May 7, 1945 at the end of World War II . , Here are just some of the problems associated with this closure: <br /> <br /> 1) The older viewer must conjure up the equivalent of two or three more Unholy films to fill the gaping gap between the events in the movie. and this astounding conclusion. <br /> <br /> 2) An ordinary person really kicks himself that he did not “watch” one of these INSUFFICIENT “fill in forms” clicks created in their own head for free, instead of spending time and money to see it INEXPENSIVE video store (or cable). <br /> <br /> 3) This sequence of final credits of imagined newsletters may be the first information that some young viewers tell about the Second World War led them to conclude that George W. Bush is the last heir to the Nazi throne.
