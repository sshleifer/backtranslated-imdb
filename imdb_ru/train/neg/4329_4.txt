I will never forget the wit and the great comedy from the movie ORIGINAL Vacation! The lines, pace and time of events in this film are outstanding! However, this continuation of the European holidays is a serious disappointment. <br /> <br /> In this sequel, Greenswalds wins a European vacation on a game show. The problem is that many jokes in the film are nothing more than soft jokes, haha ​​laughs. For example, a flight attendant in an airplane asks Clark: “Do you want your stake in the bank?” Clark responds: “No, I’ll do it right here.” This is really the only funny line in this movie. <br /> <br /> European Vacation humor is tense. As if the authors borrowed all the jokes from the first film, tried to rephrase the script that was made earlier, and relied on a ridiculous sequence of stalking scenes at the end of the picture, just to kill time. /> <br /> Worse, nowhere can you find such natural comics as Randy Quaid in the role of cousin Eddie, and children who played Rusty and Audrey from the first film so well. Their replacements are not ridiculous, cannot act, and just look as if they go through the movements most of the time. There are also some rude sexual jokes and comments that are not only not funny, but also taste bad. <br /> <br /> Grivald should have stayed in Wally's world. The place that made them legends! Do not join them in this terrible European adventure. Viewers should re-watch the original vacation movie instead! You will be glad you did.
