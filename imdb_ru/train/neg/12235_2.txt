If you want to know what kind of music white people listened to in 1974, this film is for you. But you also have to listen to a lot of flutes and violins (see My Comments on “My Girl 1”). <br /> <br /> Humble confession: I approached My girl 2 with cynicism and irritation, having just looked at his predecessor. But, as an adopted person, who is preparing to finally begin searching for my mother, My Girl 2 made me look at the topic of the search for my mother. <br /> <br /> In other words, everything that I liked about My Girl 2 had nothing to do with My Girl 2, but related to the main character, who, like many adopted children, asks, "Who is my Mama"? And if there are my mom's home movies in the acting troupe, I will definitely make my own film about it. <br /> <br /> People are lethargic. Movies should not be lethargic. My Girl 2 (like My Girl 1) is just ... listless. <br /> <br /> Avoid, unless you are full of juice, which is comforted by a series of small troubles.
