Now I have seen this film twice, and I must say that I liked it both times. It's fast paced and fun, but ultimately stupid. Having said that he deserves to be destroyed because he spoiled something that could serve as a good continuation of the original original. For those who have seen the terrible “creeping flesh of a zombie,” it is obvious that the film’s immense flaws can be linked to Bruno Mattei, and that what deserves praise can be attributed to Fulci. This is not the empty talk of Fulci, the styles of directors contrast sharply everywhere, and you can tell who and what led, especially in the case of Matthew. <br /> <br /> The film is about an outbreak of the virus (strangely referred to as “top secret” by scientists, this secrecy is obviously more remarkable than its potentially apocalyptic effect on humanity) somewhere in Southeast Asia. The virus causes zombie-like behavior to those who have suffered, and the virus quickly spreads across a seemingly arbitrary area of ​​the earth. Our main characters involuntarily wander into the danger zone, and they have to fight for their lives with hordes of infected Asians. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be stuck halfway between a zombie movie and a bloody fight, an action adventure, and this confusion is most clearly reflected by the zombies themselves. It seems that they do not have a set of characteristics common to all. Some of them are the usual soulless shuffling that is so well presented in the original, and probably the creation of Fulci here. The other main group consists of those who, being infected with a virus, lost all sense of themselves, but were subjected to wild aggression and the desire to earn a black belt in ninjutsu. Involve their brothers in what looks like a massive tickling holiday for their unfortunate victims. Martial arts skills are not their only talents, they are well versed in guerrilla tactics, hiding on rafters and under bales of hay, and sometimes inexplicably fall out of nowhere, except the skies themselves. All this is definitely the work of Matthew. <br /> <br /> There is another, more chatty variety of zombies. This type clearly retains a sense of irony: "I really want to drink ... FOR YOUR BLOOD." The ridiculous turn at the end, in which the DJ turns into a zombie, but continues to preach senseless gibberish about the fate of humanity, only strengthens the WTF factor and destroys any hope of a serious decision. <br /> <br /> Then there is the infamous zombie head, which is slowly moving in the air, a joking skeletal smile appeared on her face, as if to say: “Yes, we know how bad it looks.” <br /> <br /> All characters are completely one dimensional, as one would expect. But it is precisely the pseudo-comic dialogue and duplication that really prevent us from taking their position seriously. Having said that the first soldier who dies really demonstrates an impressively gallant display against the insurmountable threat of a zombie. Indeed, this is the first and, perhaps, the only time when we find ourselves in a real zombie-aggro, and one of the only effective scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> The guy who played the main scientist has a heart, but there is no talent that uses pauses in his lines completely by accident, and as a result he sounds like an embarrassed asthmatic. Attempts by scientists to find an antidote on the screen are completely unconvincing, and now let's connect these two molecules! <br /> <br /> However, there are a few things that seem really effective. In the early scene, the main character explores an abandoned garage. Entering the room, we are confronted with a foggy view of a moving figure in a corner and a wriggling mass on the floor; it was all taken in diffused atmospheric light. The silence is interrupted by the appearance of a quick machete with a zombie who smashes everything in his path in his anxious despair to get it. His apparent aggressiveness is one of the few moments of real horror in the film. The theme “before” and “after”, transmitted through the hotel, where events take place at the earliest stage of the outbreak, and then as a shelter for our heroes, is saturated with a thick, moist atmosphere. There is a scene in which one of the soldiers cautiously approaches the boarded up room, in which there are clearly hordes of undead, and this is quite intense. Everything becomes more dramatic when they sit in the hotel, not knowing what is hiding at the top. But it is carelessly handled and not as efficient as it could be. <br /> <br /> In general, I would say that this film may well be called the royal failure of a potentially effective festival of tropical zombies, and not just a see-through and bad film. And for that matter, there is a lot of unintentional laughter in it, which I used to expect from all Italian and bloody from the eighties.
