I was deceived after seeing this film after reading a positive review from another site, and the person was, I'm p.o'd !!! It took me at least 15 minutes to lift him off the shelf because I didnâ€™t want anyone to see me. then another 10 minutes to take courage to take him to the counter and really use real money to rent it. I thought that all my stress would pay off by the time I came home and watch the movie, because in the review I read, the movie was a pleasant surprise; Well and a joke! If you can do it during the first hour of the movie, then you are in luck! b / c until the movie turns to horror. do not worry about it guys, you better watch the "fall damp"
