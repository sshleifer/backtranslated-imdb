Pictures that usually glorify a hero matter. For example, Bonnie and Clyde glorified the dynamic bank robbers, and you actually felt sympathy for them, despite their evil deeds. What for? These were two people who were depressed when people were desperate to survive. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no point in this film. The character Viggo Mortensen soon becomes a folk hero. What for? He is driving along the Idaho Highway on the way to the hospital, where his injured wife was taking. No one bothers to understand why he is trying to run away from everyone. Even worse, when it becomes apparent that he is not a terrorist with a red neck, no one in the government wants to help him when they are trying to save their ends. <br /> <br /> Jason Priestley acts as a radio host who relies on a story in support of our hero. <br /> <br /> The ending is absolutely incredible.
