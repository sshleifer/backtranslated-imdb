I chose this movie on the cover, which was a bad move. It was not funny at all, but the main characters were disgusting. The girl was beautiful, but the story and acting was terrible. It has absolutely nothing to do with surfing. A terrible film with a surf theme, which has nothing to do with surfing and real surfers. Catherine Zeta-Jones was beautiful, and the film is likely to be resurrected because she is now in the center of attention, being married to Gordon Gekko and everyone else, but if you haven't seen it yet, don't waste your time. A bad movie with GREAT surfing, REAL surfers and AWESOME, BEAUTIFUL cinema was in God's hands.
