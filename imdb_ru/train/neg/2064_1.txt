Oh my God. While Chevy Chase and the gang in the SNL set new highs with the thumbnail format, it fails miserably at every level. Fortunately, Chevy hardly participates in this and cannot be blamed for this complete deception. This is serious very, very bad. Despite the fact that it was a political commentary to the United States at the time of its release (1974), it still remains neither funny nor sharp. The sketches are too long, and any satirical influence they could have is lost, since they are all stretched to the point of boredom. This is considered a debut in the Chevy film, and I am pleased to report that everything he did after that improved him. Avoid, even if curious.
