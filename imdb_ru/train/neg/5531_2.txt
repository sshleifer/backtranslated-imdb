“After the First World War, an expedition was sent to Cambodia, representing the allied countries, to stop Count Mazovia’s efforts to create an army of soldiers and workers that looked like zombies. Hoping to prevent a possible outbreak of war due to the actions of Mazovia, the group is pushing through the jungle to Angkor Wat, despite the dangers. The group includes Armand, who has his own plans that contradict the wishes of the group, ”reads the summary on the cover of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Heads up! The zombie makeup department rebelled before the cameras began to rotate. <br /> <br /> In addition, this “Zombie Revolt” has little to do with the alleged predecessor of the “White Zombie” (1932) *****, which starred Bela Lugosi. If the zombies of this film did not excite you, this one certainly will not. The younger Dean Jagger (as Armand Luca) plays the role of a man obsessed with blonde Dorothy Stone (as Claire Duval). A good pair of supportive speeches: the devilish Roy D'Arcy (like Mazovia) and the subject Teru Simad (like Boone); however, none of them are given enough material to really pull it out of landfills. <br /> <br /> ** Zombie Rise (1936) Victor Halperin ~ Dean Jagger, Dorothy Stone, Roy D'Arcy
