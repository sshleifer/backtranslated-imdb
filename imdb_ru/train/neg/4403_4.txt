Whatever the merits of the film, it is poorly researched. As others have noted, in the film, the locals in Iran speak Arabic, not Persian. This is enough to lose confidence in anyone who has at least some knowledge of a region or country. The landscape can not be more different from the actual. <br /> <br /> Other factual errors: it is shown that the train operates in Afghanistan and there are no railways in Afghanistan. The Turkish ambassador wears Fez (red hat), while Fez was banned by Turkey long before the film was set. The Turkish ambassadorâ€™s daughter is actually dressed as a Hindu, and Indian classical music plays in the background in many scenes. I guess the filmmakers wanted to show an exotic woman, and Sari was what they decided to make her exotic.
