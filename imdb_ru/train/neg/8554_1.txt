The film, in all likelihood, was made in 1930 and released in 1931. I would suggest that it was very difficult for talking films to move from a quiet era. However, this particular plot by Zane Gray looks very weak. In addition, Gary Cooper probably only learned to act. The result is that it would be unacceptable by today's standards. For 1931, maybe. For 2004 is not acceptable. Some of the actors played well. Unfortunately, Indians always get a short end in these early westerns. They lived on earth long before the white man came, but according to a distorted story, they had no right to defend themselves.
