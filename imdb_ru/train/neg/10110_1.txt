This film was the worst film I've ever seen in my whole life. I'm not even joking. It was poorly done, and the actors could not act. It was a waste of my time and money. It was like a movie that my friends and I could put together. The case in which the film appeared is definitely a disguise. Nothing in the movie looks like a zombie on the front of the case. It seems that the director or make-up artist just put a black eyeliner under someone's eyes and called them zombies. Credits at the beginning of the film take almost 20 minutes of film. Which viewing titles was the best part of the film. Honestly, it was a terrible film, and I could not believe how bad it was. The scenes jumped from one to the other, and sometimes you looked like “what's going on?” The sound was terrible, and the fighting shots looked like a joke of a teenager doing a fake fight scene. <br /> <br /> If you are planning to rent or buy this film, I would advise you to at least watch the trailer because it shows how terrible it is. I would like to watch it before I rented it.
