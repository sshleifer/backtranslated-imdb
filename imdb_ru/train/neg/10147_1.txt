I usually do not comment on anything (I read the opinions of others) ... but this one, this one I have to comment on ... I was convinced that I was watching this film on worlds like action, F-117 and other high-tech things minutes I changed my mind ... Lousy game, lousy script and great science fiction. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> Just ... don't worry ... <br /> <br /> And more one thing: before watching any movie, I usually check the comments and rating of users on this site ... 3.7 points and I give this movie an attempt, now I wonder who will appreciate this movie, giving it more than 2 points ????? ?????
