Some people don't like animation. Personally, I think the animation was quite wonderful when this movie was made. There are a lot of old cartoons that I just love. My problems with this film are not related to animation, but to how it was built. All the characters are just ... well, stupid. And for this film they should not be. Obviously, everyone in LOTR has a lame problem (for a start). Just the way they behaved irritated me. My two sisters and I laughed much of this film. I think that if many people saw it before they saw new ones, they would not go. I'm glad I rented it and did not buy it. There are a few films that make me a headache. It was one of them. However, this is not the worst film I have ever seen, although it stands there. Or there, depending on your look.
