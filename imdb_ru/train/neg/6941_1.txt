This film is not only boring, but also very bad. The graphics are so bad that it is not even second-rate, but terrible. The characters do not show any facial expressions, the voice acting is empty and without a soul, and the story is absolutely not enough ... well ... everything and everything. My 5 year old likes it - but thinks it's a bit boring. I agree with him.
