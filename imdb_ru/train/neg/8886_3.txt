Not very impressed. It is difficult to suggest any spoilers for this film, because there is almost no development in the plot. Everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes, and from this moment it is the same as to observe the drying of the paint. Acting seems to be very bad, and reminds me of old black and white films of the Maoist era, which were sometimes shown on daytime Chinese television. Although it is hard to say about the female role, Juven, since the story seems to require her to walk like a wooden dummy. It reminds me of the fading star Gong Li, who somehow gained the reputation of being a good actress in the West for constantly frowning on her face. <br /> <br /> Tian Chuangzhuana's Blue Snake movie was much better. But do not be deceived by the fact that spring in a small town came in the late 40s. Unlike Blue Snake, the fact that this film was shot in times of turmoil has nothing to do with the plot itself, the ruins of the city seem to be nothing more than a picturesque backdrop. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, Tian Zhuangzhuang is simply trying to take advantage of the popularity of Chinese films in the West and appeal to a foreign audience who cannot understand the difference between a “beautiful”, “deep” or “hypnotic” film and is simply tedious and irrelevant. <br /> <br /> If any film fits the description “overvalued,” then this is it. I see no reason to stop worrying about the state of the Chinese film industry.
