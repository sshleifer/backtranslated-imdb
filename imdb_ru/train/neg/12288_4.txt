Making the film as dark and visually blurry as possible to hide budget flaws is often used in low-budget horror films, but this one goes too far. It is so poorly lit and dull (and it happens almost completely at night when it loads) that you often end up actually looking at a black screen (although perhaps a bad video transmission may also have something to do with it). Alas, “dark” is also the best word to describe the plot of the film. The filmmakers throw in a variety of (and non-original) horror ideas without any semblance of logic, and halfway there is a feeling that they almost gave up trying to make a good horror movie; you know this when you see characters who are supposed to be in mortal danger (or, in some cases, even dead) leading a small talk ....
