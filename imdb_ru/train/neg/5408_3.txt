THIS REVIEW IS EVERYTHING, ALL SPOILERS. If you plan to enjoy this movie, do not read this review. <br /> <br /> Currently, there is a problem with children's television. It is all so patronizing and condescending. "Wow, that was fun, wasn't it?" No, it was not. And, unfortunately, it seems to have penetrated into children's films. And this is what “Reindeer Flight” is all about. Admittedly, I have not seen 'Reindeer Flight' for several years, so I could be misty at some points, but I remember that I was not completely impressed with it at the time. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the story follows a lecturer who is given a book for Christmas. Now the lecturer is a respected scientist who studies the flight habits of some animals. I think they were frogs. In any case, thanks to this book, Mr. Lecturer / family man learns that deer can fly just like bullfrogs. Apparently, this book was written by a scientist many hundreds of years ago, which disappeared at the North Pole. Now, if it was me, I would throw the book in the nearest window. Flying frogs are a natural phenomenon, but flying reindeer are a fantastic and completely unrealistic concept. But, Mr. Lecturer, this is NOT me, so I think this explains why he decides to fly to the North Pole, leaving his wife and child at home, not knowing where he went. Of course, everything goes wrong, and before he finds out about it, a flying deer crashed into his private plane, and he ended up at the North Pole. <br /> <br /> Are you still watching this? Good. <br /> <br /> His family, of course, is devastated. I would too, I mean, what a sucking Christmas. Elsewhere, Mr. Lecturer finds himself in a hidden city at the North Pole, where dwarfs and a tyrannical figure live, dressed only in red and white. Instead of trying to escape immediately, as I would have done, he welcomes everyone there with open arms. This is a hidden civilization of ultra-small monsters, and he meets them with open arms. Oooo-kayyyy. They tell him a story that they are the elves of Santa Claus, and they spend the whole year around making toys for children that they don’t even know about. And Mr. Lecturer takes all this. He even admits that Santa Claus is actually a scientist who disappeared two hundred years ago or something else. There is only one problem - they do not want him to leave. The world cannot know about their secret existence. After all, before they know about it, McDonalds and Starbucks will be at every corner of the street. <br /> <br /> Still with me? <br /> <br /> Now the family of Mr. Good Guy will find the book and assume that he has gone to the North Pole. Boy, won't they be embarrassed if they find out that he just went for a brisk walk? Before the audience learns about this, they go for Christmas to the most real winter wonderland on the planet. Meanwhile, Mr. Lecturer fell ill with all the sassy dwarfs and decides to leave. I do not remember exactly, but I remember how he held Santa Claus at gunpoint. The fiery battle begins when the dwarfs attack, and he manages to escape through the sleigh of Santa. With Santa Claus in his heels and bloodlust in his eyes, Mr. Weather, thanks to a miraculous coincidence, discovers that he is flying alongside his family’s plane, which is looking for him. Therefore, he jumps on their plane, the planes fly back, and everyone lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> In fact, several shocking films have been made in the name of Christmas over the years, but because they show this festive charm, they get away with it. And this is the charm that is completely devoid of "Flight of the reindeer." There is no particular disadvantage; nothing that offends the intellect (well, of course, it is, but it’s a child’s film and, therefore, can get away with such things) or something especially offensive, but the problem is that there’s nothing special about it. It is simply not to FEEL Christmassy. And for a movie that is all about Christmas, this is a pretty serious drawback. But hey, I do not think that “The flight of the target audience of reindeer thinks about it? Why should they? They are all so seasoned with sedatives that they probably could not write "Christmas." <br /> <br /> I give it three out of ten. If it was a television movie, I would add two more stars. We all know how bad they can get.
