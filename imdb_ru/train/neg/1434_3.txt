James Bond in the desert? Well, this is what it looks like: Pierce Brosnan is finally known as Bond in “Tomorrow Never Dies” (1997) and “Golden Eye” (1995) - both were removed before this release. To be honest, the two main roles in the film are very wrong: Brosnan plays a slightly more convincing role, and Annie Galipo (like Pony, Gray Owl's love interest) has to contend with a carelessly written dialogue. <br /> <br /> Two aunts, on the other hand, are perfect. But the film is not about aunts. It's about the wilds of Canadian wildlife. And although the photo can be beautiful, there is nothing awful in the harsh reality of life in the wild. Annie Galipo, like Pony, simply cannot be convincing, unfortunately, because I really wanted to believe in her. In this film, she was a relatively inexperienced twenty-year-old girl, and this might work, but Richard Attenborough might not have been tough with her. He makes her look vulnerable, which of course she ... but in the wrong direction. <br /> <br /> But one thing is for sure, it seems perfect in everything. But mascara and eyebrow thickener in the desert? It simply does not fit, especially since she seems to ever go to forest tests with Bond (sorry, gray owl) and uses photo-surgeries for close-up kisses. <br /> <br /> I lived with forest dwellers in the Pacific Northwest, and they just don’t look so pretty and stay so cute, fighting for survival. Which brings me to another point: the film is unable to remember the period in which it is set: the 1930s. Basically, I blame the lack of brilliance scenario that the sermon enjoys at the expense of the dramatic arc, the plots and the small details that can cause a period through the action. <br /> <br /> William Nicholson wrote the screenplay and his latest sentence, Elizabeth, the Golden Age, opened three days ago, so I hope there is an improvement. <br /> <br /> Yes, I read the comments of other users, but I'm not convinced. Great potential, but misused and possibly ill-conceived. If he had a religious film, he would have been subjected to panning, but since he preaches environmentalism, the film remains somewhat above criticism, since it is “politically correct”. Sorry, for all this I do not buy it. Amen.
