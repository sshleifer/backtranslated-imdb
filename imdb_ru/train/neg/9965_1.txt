A WARNING! DETAILS OF SMALL PLOT DETECTED! <br /> <br /> I can find almost nothing positive in this film. It is written so badly that every character is a caricature, but it seems that he takes himself seriously. This is badly played, especially Ralph McKee (all with childish face, 5 feet from him), like a tough street. All elements of the plot are drawn in black and white, and each situation is almost instantly exacerbated to some extreme climax. <br /> <br /> The most blatant of all (THE ELEMENT OF THE PLOT, WHICH IS DETECTED) is perhaps the most gratuitous and skilful Scene in the history of a semi-serious film. One can only imagine how the directors say: “We need JoBet to lose its peak ... hmmm ... I understand! ... At the beginning of the film, let's give Nick some ridiculous dialogue about exposing himself in the corridors. ... then Jobet will be able to use this line on it later and REALLY be naked in the corridor ... yes, this is a ticket! "<br /> <br /> I pay tribute to the producers for tackling a weighty issue in 1984, one that turned out to be too weighty in the late 90s with events like Columbina. Nevertheless, the performance is terrible. This film could be a dark comedy in the spirit of Heathers, an obscene political statement such as the Network, or a serious exam like Brubaker. Instead, it tries to be all these things — and ultimately does not become any of these things. "Teachers" get F.
