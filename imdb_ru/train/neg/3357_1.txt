The way the viewers react to this new “adaptation” of the book by Shirley Jackson, which was advertised as NOT being a remake of the original 1963 film (quite true), will be based, I suspect, on the following: those who were big fans of the book or the original film are not they are going to think a lot about it ... and about those who have never come across them, and who are big fans of the modern Hollywood tendency to "special effects", which is the first and last word on how to "A good movie, you will like it very much. <br /> <br /> What I didn’t like about this adaptation: <br /> <br /> 1. It was NOT a real adaptation of the book. Of the articles I read, this film should have covered other aspects of the book that the first never bothered. And that seemed reasonable, no film can literally cover a book, unless it is the length of a STAND! (And not even then) But in this film there were things that were never mentioned or even hinted at in the film. He reminded me how they decided to kill the black man in the original version of the movie "Shine". I didn't like it either. In the press release of the film SHOULD say: “We got the main, very basic idea from the book of Shirley Jackson, we kept the same names of the house and several (though not all) names of the main character, but then we decided to write our own story, and hell, we first looked at “CHANGES”, “Shine and Ghost” and decided to add them a bit ”. <br /> <br /> 2. They completely lost the subject of a parapsychologist inviting a carefully selected guest, who had everything in his paranormal hands, to explore the house, which really seemed to be "born bad." No, instead, this “doctor” led everyone to the house under the false pretext of studying their “insomnia” (he really invited them there to scare them to death, and then see how they reacted to their fear ... like laboratory rats the one he mentioned never said that they were part of the experiment ... a good guy). By the way, this doctor, who did not have the same name, was different from the dedicated professional of the original film, as well as the night of the day. <br /> <br /> 3. In contrast to the statement that was used to promote both films, “some houses are just badly born”, this house was not born bad, but rather became bad because of what happened there .. And this time Nel begins to unravel the mystery (shades of change). The only problem was that the so-called riddle was so incoherently told that I am sure that for most viewers it remained a mystery ... but, firstly, there was no riddle (not in the book), because the House was bad so that to begin. His first "victim" died before she ever saw her. <br /> <br /> 4. The way the character of Luke was depicted was absolutely ridiculous. It was assumed that he was an amiable playboy who ever inherited the house (and was a true skeptic regarding his “story”) ... and in this he was just a talkative, awkward nerd who could not sleep (remember insomnia) and was an obsessive liar. <br /> <br /> 5. I was also annoyed by how the film went from almost trying to recreate the original scenes verbatim (scene with Nelia’s sister’s family and Mrs. Dudley’s little opening speech ...) to fantasy flights that made me think more of these other films than hunting. As if he could not decide what he wanted to do. <br /> <br /> 6. I missed Nela's story throughout the film. The original was so much like a gothic novel in the sense that the story was mainly told in the first person through Nel’s eyes, and we were always aware of her thoughts. This completely unique touch was completely lost in the new version. They also tried to make Nela much more heroine. The original Nel was not a bad person, but she was a bitter person (could she be different after sacrificing 11 years of her life to an egoistic old woman and an evil sister?), And she liked to moan, and she lost her temper. .. This one was too good to be true. This has never been more apparent than in the climax of the film, where the writer clearly watched GHOST too often. <br /> <br /> 7. They changed the history of the house, and that’s too much. There was no Abigail Crane (daughter of Hugh, whose legend loomed widely in the original versions), there was no "companion", and there was no nursery. There was also no "Grace" (the wives of the original doctor), and Hugh Crane's wives died completely differently. These changes have changed the story too much. I do not know whether the producers of this film should be pleased that Shirley Jackson no longer walks this earth, or they must ... BE EXTRACTED (if you understand my drift !!! !!!). <br /> <br /> In conclusion, let me leave you with some words from the original Luke (a suitable replacement for the word “house” with “film”!): “This“ film ”must be burned to the ground, and the earth is sprinkled with salt! My favorite movie of all time remains so. No competition from this.
