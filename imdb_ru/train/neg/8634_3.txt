Seeing a photo of a man who was attacked by zombies, I instilled hope that Lucio "Zombie" Fulci can cope with his old tricks. Unfortunately, besides a close-up of a rotting corpse, little can be recommended in this story about the murder of a rich man and his daughterâ€™s desire to find out who killed him. None of the characters are attractive, and by the time you know how they did it (this turn, at least, was cool), you will stop caring. The only good thing I can say is that it made more sense than the Nightmare Concert!
