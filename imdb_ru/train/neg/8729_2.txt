This is a thriller with a good concept, good acting, good photos and good intentions everywhere, but it is confused and divided in performance. <br /> <br /> The stars of Garcia are John Berlin, a judicial investigator from Los Angeles, who moved to a small California town on the orders of his friend there. Soon he becomes involved in the investigation of unsolved murder, which leads to his assumption of the existence of a serial killer, in which no one else believes. Theoretically, the famous victim is considered blind, which leads to a romance with a blind girl, - consider to be a witness - in a nearby school for the blind. <br /> <br /> Despite the intriguing story, there were too many quantum jumps and holes in the plot in this film, and I wondered: â€œHow the hell did we do that? be here? or "how do we know this?" I found it embarrassing and disconnected, despite the good play, and so on. D. John Malkovich has a small part by the end of how F.B.I. The investigator goes to Berlin. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
