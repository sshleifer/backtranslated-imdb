I watched the Malayalam Boeing Boeing film for a long time in 1985 (which, in turn, was probably inspired by the eponymous English film). The main story of Garam Masala is the same - but it is pitifully told, the cool jokes are replaced by the usual ones that can be found in regular Hindi films (the director probably tasted Hindi) ... <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t I saw the English original. But he really enjoyed the film Malayalam (filmed by Priyadarshan himself), which at the time was a comedy. Of course, the game of Mohanlal, Mukesh and Sukumari (who played the role of cook) was so natural and spontaneous. <br /> <br /> Malayalam may have struck me too much, that I cannot tolerate even minor flaws in the film. his remake hindi. But I still feel that Akshay Kumar and John Abraham outplayed. Paresh Rawal has done a decent job - but nowhere nears Sukumari. <br /> <br /> But overall, everything is fine when compared with other recent Hindi comedy films.
