An uninteresting addition to the "stalk 'n slash" cycle, which dominated the horror genre in the 1980s. It was filmed as Jokes, but released as a Hostel, which was dripping with Blood, which is an obvious abduction from the 1970 horror anthology House, which dripped Blood. Daphne Zuniga is the only recognizable person in the cast, and this was her first horror film (she also appeared in "Initiation" and "Fly II").
