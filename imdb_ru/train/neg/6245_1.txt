The only thing that proves the “Inconvenient Truth” is that Al Gore is still an idiot. These "indisputable" experts are not questioned, because the answer to their senseless hypotheses, as a rule, is lower than real science. These are mostly false scientists. The greatest source of greenhouse gases - CO2 - is people, we exhale it, and if you are not ready to start sacrificing your brothers for the sake of saving the world, this is impossible. We heard how the world should have ended as a result of man for over 50 years. Fools publish the time frame of their end of the world, and when time passes, nothing happens. “Inconvenient Truth” is just another tool by which an unfair fraction of American society can trade in its poop. <br /> <br /> As for how Al leaves the tobacco business due to his sister’s death from cancer, this is a burden too. Al could not manage his farm better than he could manage the country. He was losing money on operations, because he did not want to engage in agriculture when he could earn more money on conversational tours. The only global warming that is not in doubt is the hot air created by this gas cylinder!
