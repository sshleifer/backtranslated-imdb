Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober) - a disciple of Satan / serial killer who possesses "First Power": even being captured by Detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) and executed in the gas chamber, he is able to take the spirit out of the body to the body and continue killing . With the help of the attractive psychic Tess Seaton (Tracy Griffith, stepsister Melanie J.) He is trying to stop Channing. <br /> <br /> This concept probably had some possibilities, but in the end, “First Power” suffers from routine scenarios and film production. This is nothing that we have not seen before, sometimes better. There is no film in this film nothing that sets him apart from other supernatural horror thrillers. Moreover, it's not very exciting and certainly not scary. Phillips is hard to sell as a cynical police stereotype, and Griffith doesn't seem to be trying hard; the best actor is probably a distinctive Kober character struggling to be extremely creepy. <br /> <br /> The climax is rather dumb, and the ending is very weak. <br /> <br /> It’s not quite acceptable to rate as an average movie of its kind, therefore: <br /> <br / > 4/10
