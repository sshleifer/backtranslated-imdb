It seemed that this film has everything you need, with a good camera, sound, film, shootings, music, costumes ... but with a drum, said Gary Stretch! I don't know if it was his bad game or just a bad script, but I would say that it was both. Given his role in this role, it was difficult for me to support him even to the very end. I would like him to die in battle or one of the fights with a sword / knife. <br /> <br /> Then the trick of conspiracy to kill the king was due to the fact that the king did not have lunch and sex with his Queen? Pretty limp. And go to the extreme to kill your own son? And then to push her lover as the successor to the king? I see a thread or two here and there of historical bytes, but the way it was all presented was a farce. <br /> <br /> I don’t recognize Gary Stretch by anything else, but he was terrible. I read another user’s comments that the sound is duplicated, but I don’t think it’s duplicated ... after all, it speaks English, right? It really was awful. The lines were read directly from the coroner's table ... a flat line. Maybe he simply does not have a voice to hear tonal vibrations. <br /> <br /> In addition, I watched it to the end, so the film had at least "interest." This could be more if the script / lines and casting were given more work. The screenplay and film crew, along with the very good quality of the film - this is what really made this film above all. The cast and story were secondary. I give the film crew 10.
