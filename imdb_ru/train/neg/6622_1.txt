I, like many other Bacchan fans, eagerly awaited a remake of Sholai. This film was not that. Thank God, they did not allow them to use the name “Sholay” in the title of the film. A remake of Gopal is not worthy of the title. Camera work, locations, costumes, completely inappropriate dances, dialogues - all this together created the worst movie I've ever seen. You wonder if the actors agreed to play this film because they needed money, and Ram Gopal paid a lot of money for the cast. The only unpaid actor, the ant, was the only resemblance to the first film. The role of Abishek was completely ridiculous, did he need money to pay for Ash's wedding? Save your money, your mind and your time, do not worry about a movie or DVD when it comes out.
