This movie is a joke. I mean the funny joke "haha." What for? Because the only redeeming thing about this was a good laugh, which I received from the sheer absurdity of a meaningless, senseless plot and terrible play. Wow <br /> <br /> There are so many unanswered questions in this film ... for example; Why do these women become zombies and how? Why are there four black women who are “watchmen” of zombies, and what is their purpose? Since when do 6 people make up the "nation" of zombies? And is black mascara smeared for the eyes "scary" to anyone, anywhere? Even a 2 year old? <br /> <br /> Finally; Why was this film made at all? What for? What for? What for? No answer? This is what I was thinking about. <br /> <br /> On the demand channel, they actually released this comment after a brief review of the film: “We apologize for this film in advance.”
