I'm not sure why Spike Lee made this train sprawled out of the movie and convinced poor Stevie Wonder to perpetually connect his beautiful music with this theatrical mess. I am also outraged by the way he uses profanity as part of the usual prose of professional blacks. Abuse of his influence on ethnic viewers of cinema is a shame. Scenes that seem fictional and have nothing to do with the topic or sub-themes play as if it was written by some college student. I especially hate the ridiculous scene where two squads playfully spar for no reason, and the police come in and roughly shoot Snipes. The re-evaluation of the commercials makes the person feel that Spike does not respect his viewers or he has no idea what the film is about. The final scene seems to be added to justify the use of a sledgehammer to catch the point. This film also supports the myth that all people of culture use the F-word in casual conversation. I hope that he will understand that the rest of his films are in the same pool as this one, where he does not grow as a director. I think his alliance with the Scorcesee at Clockers was a wise move. He should be engaged in the creation of documentaries, such as "Four little colored girls." Shock films don't make an Oscar.
