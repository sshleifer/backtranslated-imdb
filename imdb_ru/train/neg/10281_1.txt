Carly Pope plays Jay Jay, the recently-named Food Critic, whose bright, domineering mother approaches her. JJ, stunned by this turn of events, then blackmailed restaurant owner Alex to entertain her mother in exchange for a “maybe” review of his dying restaurant. Alex predictably falls in love with her daughter, warming herself with her mother. There are many problems with this film, the characters are universally two-dimensional. JJ is a self-serving, hateful character, her mother is superficial and superficial. JJ's colleagues in the magazine are stingy and opportunistic. The main idea of ​​a woman over 50 years old who cannot do this on her own, without the help of men, is bad, bad, BAD. The game is equally boring, the script is boring. The film only saves grace - the settlement of New York. I would NOT recommend this movie.
