Let me be clear. I have used IMDb for many years. But just today I had a problem with registering on the site so that I could give this movie the lowest possible rating. I have seen hundreds of films, some of them are bad, some horrible. However, I have never seen such a contrast between pretense and incompetence, high intentions and failures. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino terribly played the role of a princess, but is absolutely incredible, like Phocion, a young boy. Fiona Shaw is always an interesting character, but the dialogue in the film is much worse, even than in the tasteless French play that is the source (Marivaux has never reached Hollywood so far, and we should continue in the same vein). <Br /> <br /> To illustrate, for example, that Leontin is a brilliant, passionate philosopher and scientist, she is shown feverishly pouring chemicals from beaker to beaker, shouting names of famous scientists. And the romance between Agis and the princess is played even more stupid. For this, the couple should receive a joint award "Claire Danes", which in a fair world will be awarded for gratis anachronistic and not inspired rethinking of interesting teenagers from literature as the reins of the 1990s (see "Miss Danes in Les Miserables"). <br /> <br /> In addition to the brutal plot and dialogue, there are some attempts to introduce artistic trails into the shooting. For example, there are times when several spectators disappear from view and do not see what is happening, sit on chairs and watch the main characters. The director wants us to understand that she has adapted the play. I understand. But this does not happen at all, so far away in the film. At this moment, seeing a crowd of people sitting on chairs for a moment and then disappearing, it is creepy and distracting. They are like some kind of scary crowd of zombies appearing through the fog and filling us with fear. When you see a terrible joke and a song that ends this film, you will want to wake up your own crowd of zombies and kill them all for a serious injustice that has poisoned your mind for 112 minutes. <br /> <br /> -Matfey McGuire
