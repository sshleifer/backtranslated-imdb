*** One of ten stars *** <br /> <br /> Because if that were the case, it would have turned out that F. The Virgin Mary, God of God, was so bad. I mean, I gave him all the reasonable conditions, considering that it was a direct film, but that let me down at every turn. As in many other B-films, the storyline was decent, and the filmmakers seemed to have a reasonable level of resources, but the performance was ridiculous. It is a pity that they attributed the good name of Halloween to this fiasco. <br /> <br /> The basic premise surrounds several bags from the brotherly soul, where an annual Halloween haunted house fundraising is held, when a book of satanic spells from out of nowhere hurls the fraternity boys into living hell. Well, in any case, this is an idea, but instead a large part of the film is devoted to showcasing the relationship between these fraternal boys, teeming with outrageous lesbians. Very few actual stories are devoted to Halloween or the mysterious book of spells. In fact, it pisses me off that the filmmakers thought they could get away with making such a dribble. <br /> <br /> The film is about fraternal relations. This is NOT what the movie is announced as. I am tempted to track down the producers and at least threaten them with bodily harm. Acting is as terrible as possible, it is terrible! The script is unintentionally funny. Cinematography is just lazy. The whole movie is an amateur night. Because of this film, film production on the SyFy channel looks like masterpieces. <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the film seemed to the filmmakers, who realized that they were not removing the soap opera, and they had to add some terrible sequences. The evil spell book finally comes into play and turns everyone in the haunted house into the character they dressed. I almost feel like crying when I write this review. Blimey! I mean wow! This thing was a misunderstood disaster.
