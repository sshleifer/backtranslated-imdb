I commented on this when he debuted for the first time, and gave him an overview of “thumbs in the middle,” noting that I would give him the advantage of a doubt that goes beyond just the first episode. I saw only six episodes at this point in June 2006. And, like Batman's lifelong fanatic, I can say without hesitation: this show is complete nonsense. <br /> <br /> It’s not like that. Everything. Passing by only lousy animation and design, the stories are ridiculously muddled and have no character development or explicit interest from the authors of this venture to impart any substance to any stories. <br /> <br /> And for God's sake ... is it just me or the Joker in EVERY EPISODE ?? Is Gotham such a big part of a justice system with a revolving door? Or, again, it’s just a complete lack of interest on the part of the authors to put some effort into other villains (see “No character development” above). <br /> <br /> And even worse, each Joker Tale is the same three-part formula. <br /> <br /> 1) Joker poisons people. <br /> <br /> 2) Joker intends to fill the entire city. <br /> <br /> 3) Batman saves the day. <br /> <br /> Pfeh. <br /> <br /> There was one episode that I saw that was not a story about the Joker. The name escapes me, but the villain was that vile master of Cluemaster ... an episode of "Think Thank Thunk" with a quiz. It was the worst Batman story I have ever seen, heard or read. Yes, worse than "I have Batman in my basement." <br /> <br /> I can’t say exactly what I feel is a show, because it’s probably against ToS, but it starts with “B” and rhymes with “fastardization”. Thank God for the existence of Timm / Dini / etc. the bat era that has returned from the days of Fox and Kids WB. Things are so good, and I should have known this, I simply could not last forever, unfortunately.
