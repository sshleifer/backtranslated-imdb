You do not expect such a film to be good, and it is not. This is not a budget ultra-brutal zombie film made by a bad looking hand-held camera ... and it's funny. The actors obviously never acted before, and this shows their terrible fun readings. There is no plot to see. The little conspiracy I could find seemed to have escaped a government experiment, and the zombie group seemed to be terrorizing a couple of families. The effects of blood are in fact one of the most disgusting I have ever seen. It seems that the bloody effects raided the butcher shop for all parts of the body, and in many scenes the zombies dismembered people and eaten their organs. This is a funny and disgusting film, and it is as bad as possible from the point of view of any movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 90 minutes
