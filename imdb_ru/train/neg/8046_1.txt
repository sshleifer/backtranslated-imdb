Not? I did not think so! Well, in this case, all you have to do is stay away, away from “Do you want to know the secret,” since this is only the tenth pointless slasher after “Scream”, which has absolutely no redemptive value. The plot is very funny; the characters are unbearably stupid, the blood factor is insignificant, and everything is just boring! As you know from the title, this film is mainly inspired by the film “I still know what you did last summer,” since events take place in a similar setting, and the killer’s motives are equally stupid. In any case, why someone wants to steal ideas from junk, such as "IKWYDLS", remains a mystery to me. At least, this film could depend on the precious stand of Jennifer Love Hewitt, while the girls in this junk, except brainless, are also terribly unattractive. A year after the still unsolved murder of her boyfriend Beth Morgan, her new lover, adulterer and four other rustic college students go to Florida to spend their holidays on vacation in a luxurious beach house. The killer did not take any action throughout the year, but now he follows the detachment to Florida and begins to kill them, leaving behind the title message as a kind of business card. You really do not need to be an expert in horror to quickly find out what kind of person is hiding behind an inexpressibly absurd mask, and the authors' attempts to put you on the wrong path are completely embarrassing. Since the plot is very thin, most of the film is a purely irrelevant addition, including auxiliary stories about the incompetent police forces of Florida and the “mysterious” FBI inspector who seems to have a personal account to pay. An inexplicable murder takes place behind the scenes (don't you hate it when it happens?), There is not even useless T & A that you could enjoy, and you better not start me with the quality of the dialogues. Suffering from such shit, you realize that the delightful spirit of the 80s slashers is gone forever.
