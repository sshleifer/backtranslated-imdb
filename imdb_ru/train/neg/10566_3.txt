Although I consider myself a fan of the television series Babylon 5, the original film that presented the series was a weak start. Although many of the elements that will later become mature and become more attractive in the series, are present, the pace of The Gathering is slow, the composition is somewhat inadequate, and the plot is confusing. Worse, the feature in the premiere episode is bad. Although the rating chart shows that many fans are ready to ignore these problems, I remember that The Gathering almost distracted me from what soon turned into an exciting series.
