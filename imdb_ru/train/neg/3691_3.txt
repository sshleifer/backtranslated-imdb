Firstly, I am not a big fan of Rajnikant, but Baba was a huge disappointment. Between a horrible storyline, action and songs were only mediocre. The storyline is becoming very preaching. Instead of running to an office such as NTR or MGR, Rajni seems to have almost become the next great guru of Tamil Nadu. My wife tells me that since this movie came out, Rajni has vowed to make more films! <br /> <br /> Initially we were lucky that we accidentally bought Baba online (old man Shivajiganeshana) when we tried to buy this one. .... it was a great film that made up for the fact that he bought this dirt ... except that Baba looks even worse than him! <br /> <br /> Brian
