I would prefer to have 20 root canals than go through this movie again. The Irritating Prince, Myles Berkowitz, spent almost two hours of my life with this cynical pseudo-cool. The only fun thing about this mess is the nasty off-screen dummy Mr. Samahi on boobs and ass. Berkovits takes a great concept and grinds it to dust. It is unstable and poorly done, clearly trying to make it look harsh or ridiculous. It is neither one nor the other. I rarely feel that a film is a waste of a film (or tape), but this film justifies this difference. If a date offers to see this movie, run.
