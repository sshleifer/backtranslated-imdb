Instead, go to the zoo, buy some peanuts and feed them to the monkeys. Monkeys are funny. People with amnesia who speak little, just sit there with empty eyes, are not that funny. <br /> <br /> Black comedy? There is not one black man in it, and there is nothing funny in it. <br /> <br /> Walmart somehow buys these things and puts them on his dollar stands. This is marked unrated. I think they shot a topless scene. Maybe they also took other things, who knows? All we know is that they took away; there is no more there. <br /> <br /> It seemed to me that everything was in order. There's a lot of incomprehensible though. Should it be a city? Should it be a big lake? If the church is so hot that people are fanning themselves, why are they all in a coat?
