I love Morgan Freeman. Paz Vega is an attractive, attractive and talented actress. I’m sure it would be a good movie if something happened in it. Does nothing It is short (less than 90 minutes). It was 75 minutes too long. After an hour of frustration, I looked at the remaining 20-odd minutes. Painful. <br /> <br /> Freeman plays an actor who hasn’t worked for a long time, exploring the role he can play as a cashier in a supermarket. He visits the supermarket where she works. Nothing has happened. She decides to take him home, and they go to Arbi, Target, car wash. Nothing has happened. They talk about their lives. Nothing has happened. Is always. <br /> <br /> I do not understand. But I also do not get Bill Murray's Lost in Translation and Broken Flowers films. If you like these movies, you might like this. Many people find films like this quaint, charming, or - for reasons that avoid me - find the dialogue exciting. A common device in films of this kind is a LONG silence / silence double after an actor utters a line that should be meaningful. We know that it makes sense, because it is followed by two minutes of nothing on the screen. Sorry, I have to be a philistine. I do not understand. For me, such films are not funny, not adorable and do not make you think. They are just boring. What for? Because there is no comedy. Without drama. No voltage. Laughs No waiting. Inaction. Nothing to watch. In short, I do not go to the movies. I may be bored for free. I see strange / bizarre characters in real life. I go to Target, and to fast food restaurants, and to car washes. These elements do not make a movie, even if the stars do it. I'm crying to be entertained. <br /> <br /> If you're crazy about Morgan Freeman and just want to hear him talking about anything, have fun. If you want to drool on Paz Vega, you can watch and listen to it. But nothing happens, I promise. Full Sonfest.
