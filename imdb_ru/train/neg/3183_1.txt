Sergio Leone is spinning in his grave ... If there was any film that tramples a personâ€™s life, then this is his. The bravado of the protagonist "The Lone Wolf" is boring and inconclusive, and the script, apparently, was written by a monkey with an eight-year education. Whoever thought it should be whipped by a horse. The only reason I spend time destroying it is because there are at least 10 lines. Sergio Leone's family has to sue, not because it is crap, but because it is perpetuated as MST 3000 crap. Shame. Disgust. I blame Hollywood ... at least Gary Bucy makes shit that won't hurt anyone except cocaine users and gun experts ... this film is pure blasphemy.
