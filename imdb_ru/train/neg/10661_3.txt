This is "F.B.I." starring Reed Hadley with a star guest! The film begins with a random (convenient?) Abduction, which leads to one and the other - which in fact does not indicate the main story - “The Big House, USA”. history of escape from prison. The story is very incredible, if not more. This is similar to the series, only more "cruel" (for the time). <br /> <br /> BUT - the cast is a journey! Picture this: Ralph Meeker is sent to prison; His cellmates are the following criminals: Broderick Crawford, Lon Cheney, Jr., Charles Bronson (read Muskul magazine!) and William Talman (read Detective Magazine!). Honestly! You should know that the early scene shows what happens to the “missing” boy, responding to the final “voice over”. If you do not want it to be hanged, do not miss the opening scenes between the Iceman and the boy (Peter Votrian succeeds as an asthmatic runaway). <br /> <br /> *** Big House, USA (1955) Howard W. Koch ~ Broderick Crawford, Ralph Meeker, Reed Hadley
