Well, I knew it would be an F-film in the lane (far below the standards of B-films), so I thought: “Dude, I could laugh, so let's see how some creatures kill each other. “Well, what I got could be found at your local love toy store. Random lesbian scenes, very few fights, and no plot <br /> <br /> For example, one scene, in particular, I remember (For my stupidity alone; I saw better ABC porn), where the two main characters (I can't remember their names in vain ... a great movie, huh?) Go ahead, as they usually did, and the driver got tired of driving and stopped: <br /> <br /> Driver: "Let's stop, I'm tired. Do you want to take over? “Passenger:“ Of course, I can go for a drive. ”(When stopping, the driver begins to grab the passenger’s boobs) Passenger:“ What are you doing? I’m not like that! ” “Okay then.” (Continue to take off shirts, caress, kiss, and perform fellatio) <br /> <br /> Now, the last time I checked, horror films were not in the Hollywood porn movies (if you are not in S & M, then you go elsewhere), and this definitely should not be in the main blockbuster videos. Don't get me wrong; I definitely not one of those people who hate porn, but I only watch it when necessary, and definitely don’t want to watch it if I watch a movie in regular stores, since the one I make was in one of two retailers, which I called (and probably in another, if I went and looked). <br /> <br /> The worst film in the world, no one should rent it, and it should be bought only for a public burning ceremony. If I could give him 0, I would, but I can give him only * 10.
