“National Lampoon Gos to the Movies” (1981) is the absolute worst film ever made, surpassing even the brainless Plan 9 from Space. The movie "Lampun" is unwound in three separate and unrelated vignettes, each of which shows different performers. The only common thread is the complete absence of any redemptive qualities. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe there is one. Another reviewer on this site said that fleeting nude pictures are good and he is right. Miss Hansel and Dusenberry share their assets sweetly - in the first and second parts, respectively. But their glam shows, alas, are in vain. The directors seem to have forgotten that even T & A needs a believable story to surround it, and nothing is visible. <br /> <br /> The third segment, which featured Robbie Benson and Richard Widmark, is the most disgusting of the three, and a bad choice as inflating this film. Benson plays a young cop eagerly shining his first day of service, ready to rid the streets of evil. He works in tandem with the old cynical policeman played by Widmark, and when these oil and water partners go on their first patrol together, we feel the possible atonement for the film’s earlier setbacks. Maybe, just maybe, the cynical old-timer will be reformed by a persistent sense of duty and loyalty to his new partner. Maybe it will end happily in the end. But, alas, this film is directed straight to the toilet, without ransom, without a happy ending, without any consistent story. <br /> <br /> Before "National Lampoon Go to the Movies", I thought I had already seen the worst damn Hollywood could have been. Unfortunately, I have not seen half of this. <br /> <br />
