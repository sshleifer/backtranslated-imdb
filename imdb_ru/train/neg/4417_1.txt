I am a Catholic who is taught in parish elementary schools by nuns, taught by Jesuit priests in high schools and colleges. I am still a practicing Catholic, but in the eyes of the church I am not considered a "good Catholic" because I donâ€™t believe in certain things or act in a certain way just because the church tells me about it. <br /> <br /> So back to the film ... this is bad because this nun killed two people who were supposed to be satire, as the embodiment of a female religious leader. There is no comedy in this, and satire cannot cope due to the excessive play of Diane Keaton. I have never seen a play, but if it is very different from this film, then it can be good. <br /> <br /> At first I thought that the pistol could be a fake, and the first one shot at the whole plan on the initiative of women. four former students as an attempt to demonstrate the emotional and intellectual fanatical attitude of sister Mary to the faith. But it turns out that the bullets were real, and there is a tragedy in history ... the tragedy of people's deaths (besides two former students ... the lives of aborted children, the life of a student's mother), the tragedy of dogmatic power over the love of people, the tragedy of organized religion, replacing the true faith in god. This is what is wrong with today's Islam, yesterday Judaism and Christianity.
