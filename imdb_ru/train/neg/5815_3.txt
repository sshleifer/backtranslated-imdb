I was really looking forward to this movie based on the previews and click it, but after watching it I was terribly disappointed. Slums is a completely unfunny film, mixed with Todd Solond’s type of disturbing family reality without Todd’s humor. The story stretches, and each scene is worse than the previous one. Maybe I missed the moment, but if this film is an example of each girl’s growing up, I’m glad to be a man.
