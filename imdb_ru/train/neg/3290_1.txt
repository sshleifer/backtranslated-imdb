This movie sucks! They took something from my childhood and raped it in an extension! This film was so bad that I wanted to go home and keep my dukes dvd and cry in the corner. The cast was terrible! It was not the "Dukes", it was Stifler and Jakass driving a car. When was Boss Hogg angry? When was Roscoe a cool guy? They have never been! Boss Hogg was greedy, and Roscoe was an idiot. When did Jesse smoke weed? He never did! Don't get me wrong, I'm very liberal, and with little Chiba, everything is fine, but there is no place in this film! The only thing that is good in this film is the trailers before the film and the final credits. It was a waste of time and air. Avoid at all costs !!!!!!!!
