It is curious that it is the eyes and mouth of Rene Russo, and not Buddy Gorilla, that become the center of "Buddy," a picture of Jim Henson created in the Francis Ford Coppola film Zoetrope. Somehow, the innumerable close-ups of Rousseau’s face escaped post-production, and she literally fills the screen as many times as the poor monkeys find themselves in the shadows. An unintentionally funny true story adapted from the memories of Gertrude "Trudy" Davis Lint about the wife of a rich doctor, who turns their mansion into a menagerie for pets and wild life. The film goes beyond the limits of good intentions ... it is clearly permeated with sincere sincerity. The film never shines with the magic of the "family film" that it needs, and soon people and animals seem clearly programmed (nothing here seems real). After about ten minutes, two chimps idle in Rousseau’s kitchen and start tossing a butcher’s knife back and forth (he misses Alan Cumming’s head a few inches); However, eyebrows do not rise, because it's all in a fun day. However, when the adult gorilla Buddy goes crazy during a thunderstorm, the police are called - and everyone looks at Buddy through the window while he breaks the living room furniture. Furniture should be the least of all the anxieties in this stunning failure. But at least we know that Rousseau was in good hands: whenever director Caroline Thompson needs a good cast, she gives the deadpan Rene another extreme close-up. I wonder what lipstick budget was in this picture? ** from ****
