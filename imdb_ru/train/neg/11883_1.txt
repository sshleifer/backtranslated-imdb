Waking up at 3:30 am and not being able to fall asleep, I decided that I could just as well have fun while suffering from lack of sleep. This film was on HBO, and I decided to watch it. What mistake! <br /> <br /> Here’s the plot (potential spoilers, if you don’t care): a neurotic with a passion for sweets (Josh Kornblut) works as a temporary specialist in some ridiculous company. Suddenly he is offered a chance to “go with a permanent”, which seems to be the favorite key phrase of this film. But with reliable work and reliable income, Josh decides for any stupid reason that he does not want to do this. He hopelessly copes with a few minor tasks, and his laziness and lack of ambition fill me with scorn. His inability to send several “very important” letters for a given period of time should be funny, but just stupid. Josh meets and deceives a female lawyer, and they end up in bed together (obviously, Josh's fantasy in real life, because this will never happen). A bunch of other things are happening, but now it’s too trite and pointless. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this film was declared a comedy, I only laughed at it twice; The first time was Josh Kornblut's first shot (my initial reaction was a reaction to suffocating fear), and the second was when he lay in bed with an attractive woman (yes, that's right). Josh Kornblut is perhaps the worst looking man I've ever seen in my life. He is an unattractive, overweight, balding Jew who, I believe, has sex with beautiful women. I do not sympathize with the character of Josh. He is lazy and unmotivated, and I just do not appreciate the failed attempts at humor. Skip this, even if your life depends on it.
