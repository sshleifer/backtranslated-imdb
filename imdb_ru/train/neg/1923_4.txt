It is strange that Dr. Suze’s fable, emphasizing the non-commercialization of Christmas, should be one of the most promoted, sold, and successful blockbusters of the holiday season. The general essence of Ron Howard's adaptation is that the Grinch curse against Christmas is associated with an early childhood incident, and that Whose themselves fell into the materialism of the season, with the exception of Cindy Lou, who played very well Taylor Momsen. This film makes a hot, ambitious attempt to capture Suze’s stupid and sentimental story, but the end result is a film that is mesmerizing and never gives the emotional impact of an animated version of Chuck Jones. Jim Carrey is notable for his performance in the role of the devil’s Greench, but regardless of whether it is a dialogue, pace, or extraneous plot lines littered with the original plot, turning a bitter miser into a joyful benefactor simply does not provide a convincing answer. There are some great visual effects, and the work with the makeup is amazing, but besides the technical triumphs, there are one or two elements that are missing here. <br /> <br /> Brevity? <br /> <br /> Soul? <Br /> <br /> Or maybe Jones performed the initial adaptation too well in his 25-minute cartoon, which Howard lacks in a film that lasts three hours. Howard, Carey and the team are very capable and talented, but what seems to be a winning combination is just weak and dense in its final product. If you need a full-length version, rent it on a video with an animated version of Jones, and you will see how much bigger and brilliant is not always better. I give this movie three Who-Hash out of five cans.
