Believe me, I love horror movies. I love fantastic movies. I like independent films. And I love low budget movies like "B". <br /> <br /> Sometimes I even like bad actions, silly scenarios, wooden lines, unbelievable situations, and the like. However, I did not like Christmas on Mars. <br /> <br /> It just does not work on many levels. For all the reasons listed above and many others. This includes the senseless, blatant use of images of the female genital organs. And many hints of the male genitalia are very Freudian. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that this is simply because of incompetence. Unlike some attempts to do something really different. I mean any film that has been made over the years simply cannot maintain the level of coherence and focus required by a modern audience. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that the whole movie was just a dream or a hallucination of the main character, However, unfortunately, this was supposed to happen when we saw how it all turns on the screen. <br /> <br /> The only kindness I can express is that the image at the end was stunning. If it was used at the beginning, and not at the end, it would allow to make a film where 2001 ended ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, they did not try it. I just do not understand what is so important in this film that it even needed to be shot. Was it the plot? Of course, it could not be. Was it the characters? I doubt; I mean, I could live without knowing Ed 15. Was it a dialogue? Certainly not. Music? Possibly, but most likely, the undecorated ego of principals in need of a blow. <br /> <br /> Much more effort was spent on the floor of the cutting room.
