The first scanners may not have been a great movie, but at least it was original. This is nothing new. The game, in my opinion, is worse, but the story is slower and nothing special. as in dialogue. and special effects are no better than the original. This film is in all respects inferior to the first. The only thing that is different from him is that he is sometimes loud and chaotic. But it is not. make a good movie. If they did something better with the story and made it interesting, it could be a decent movie. I actually could not get through all this without fast forward. for me it is a forgetful movie, and not by much. Despite all this, there are worse films. Being in a generous mood, I will give Scanners 2 4/10.
