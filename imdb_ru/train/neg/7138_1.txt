Acting is terrible. This movie makes "Fast and the Furious" look like a film awarded by the Academy. They throw several boobs and asses there to try to interest you, despite an EXTREMELY weak and contrived story. There is a reason that people on the Internet do not even download this movie. This film sank like an iron turd. DO NOT waste your time on renting or downloading. This film is and always will be PERMA-TURD. I'm dumber now that I watched it. In fact, this title should now be called “PERM-TURD”. Calling it a film is a parody and an insult. disgusting, disgusting, terrible, terrible, brutal, cruel, disgusting, unpleasant, disgusting, terrible, creepy, doable, fabulous, scary, terrible, terrible, gloomy, terrible, terrible , mean, nasty, offensive, abusive, repulsive, repulsive, disgusting, scandalous, scary, shameful, shocking, sick, terrible, terrifying, godless, unholy, unkind
