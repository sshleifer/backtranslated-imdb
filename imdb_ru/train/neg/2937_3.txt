An attempt to crossover to those who do not appreciate the opera, exploiting the glory of one of the greatest opera singers of all time, fails. All that is desirable in this film is an opera, and it is best to find the recording of Pavarotti doing what he does best. The plot revolves around a novel with a doctor who heals his throat, which suddenly became unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Just because it was released so long ago, it is largely forgotten. Like most opera stars, Pavarotti is a decent actor and has a stage presence besides his singing talent, and nothing he does in this film refutes this opinion. His fault lies in the fact that he does not reject the terrible scenario. Perhaps because great operas may have stupid stories, he tolerated this one. <br /> <br /> Who knows, besides those involved? Do we need to know? <br /> <br /> The plot is weak and banal. This film is like wandering through the cold mud to reflect some juicy tidbits (opera music) hanging over the mud. We have other ways to appreciate the great Pavarotti, and this is not one of them. Just take one of his many excellent opera or vocal / live recordings and find out the main tenor where it fits best. <br /> <br /> It would be one of the 100 worst IMDb films if more people remembered this and gave him some voice; it would be well-entered into the list, which includes several efforts of singers, actors, models and athletes to use their popularity through the film. Very often, things go wrong because of an incompetent game or a horrible script. Pavarotti would have been a worthy actor if he had not shown such an excellent voice. No matter how effective he was an actor (this is required by the opera), even Jimmy Stewart could not save this turkey script. <br /> <br /> I give him politely 3 out of 10, because someone can become a fan of Singing Pavarotti and the opera because of this film.
