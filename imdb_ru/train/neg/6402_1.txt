When I saw this film, around 1979, it became the first film I left in the middle. There is nothing worse than a comedy in which there is simply not enough fun, and it happens every time (although I canâ€™t speak the last 25 minutes of the movie). There was nothing original in any of the parodies. While I enjoy rare humor, where appropriate, these parodies were unnecessarily vulgar. Even more annoying was the fact that this film was advertised as "Robin William's first film", drawing on his new fame in the television series Mork and Mindy. And yet his role was so insignificant that you did not even notice him on the screen.
