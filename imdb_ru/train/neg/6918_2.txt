I went to this film, believing that he had good grades. First, it’s ridiculous that they release a film shot in 2001, seven years later, in 2008, here in India. Everything in the film looks obsolete. Even in 2001, the film looks as if it was removed in the budget for the laces. There is a scene where a taxi hits a person to find out how low a budget you can get. Anthony Hopkins doesn't seem to know what he is doing in the film. He ends up giving a long monologue to an end. If during this scene in the film there were bright sparks, I missed her when I slept in my place. Nothing in Jennifer Love Hewitt is like the devil. She wears indecent banal clothes and frowns at random children. As for Alec Baldwin, the scene where he first meets Webster should not be missed. What a waste of money! As Anthony Hopkins rightly said: “Come back home and write better!”
