First of all, let me say that I am a big fan of fanpro. I see this as a way to continue the good show long after it is canceled. Star Trek Voyages and Star Wars Revelations are examples of worthy efforts. So I have a weak point for fan-op, which means that I will lose sight of things that I usually have bad plans for. <br /> <br /> So, ST: HF. Well, first of all, good stuff. Enthusiasm is the main part of making any believable show, and, for the most part, the crew of various ships seems to have a good time with their roles. Then, the effects are not bad for home cooking, and nothing will make you really flinch. Stories are not so bad. Nothing particularly innovative, but quite solid material and, at least, the ongoing arc of the story. <br /> <br /> But there are many flaws in it. <br /> <br /> First of all, although they obviously HAVE to rob scenes from the movie Star Trek, to set up backgrounds, music and effects, I see no reason why they continued to rip off almost all other science fiction music works ever made. Everything from the Aliens to the Starship Troops raises his orchestral head at one time or another. Likewise, most of the footage is taken from other films made meekly by CGI to make it look different. For example, the gray warships, although disguised, are clearly Star Destroyers from Star Wars. And the station is also quite obvious to the Ticonderoga Fleet Combat Station from the Star Marine. In the same way, sound effects from various Star Wars films appear in space battles between fighters, as well as animation shots. In one of the scenes in the first or second season, I think you even see how two TIE fighters flew past during the battle, which can hardly affect your disbelief in any favor. <br /> <br /> Action ranges from reasonable to terribly painful to watch. Everybody improves as the seasons advance, but they expect a lot of grimacing on the screen, especially at the beginning of the season. They also made some interesting acting choices. Let's just say that the food replicators in this show seem to be constantly tuned in to the “pie” and leave it alone. <br /> <br /> The effects of makeup are generally quite effective. But they really must mercilessly slaughter a man who chose to use cheap Ferengi and Cardassian masks for anything other than the use of background or “fleeting” shots. They are simply unreal. Every time I saw one of them (except trying not to laugh too much), I always expected that the unhappy soul, dressed in it, would pull out a gun and declare that “This is a bully!” In one scene, the Cardassian is actually talking putting on one of them. Not only do the lips not move, the mask does not even have a hole where the mouth should be. Someone needs to hit hard for it. For God's sake, couldn't they take a knife with them? There are also some well-executed, but unintentionally funny makeup jobs, such as Hermann Münster, that look alike. <br /> <br /> There is nothing new in the writing, although consistent. Instead, the script works as a continuation of DS9, when ships are sent from DS12 to various missions. The new enemy, “Gray”, is not very formidable, and the storyline with their participation is, in fact, an alteration of the Borg threads. that is, Starfleet meets the Grays, the Grays are extremely powerful, Starfleet barely escapes with their lives, then with the help of technology they begin to find ways to fight the enemy, etc., etc. All this was done earlier with the Borg. <br /> <br /> Another apple of discord is dialogue. The authors of Star Trek have long had the opportunity to write "paste tehnoabbly here" in the script. Usually this means presenting a new plan to combat the enemy using “quantum phase discriminators” or “isolative charges”, etc. In other words, nonsense that tells you that they are in fact and the solution is already at hand. <Br /> <br /> The words are really just nonsense. I have no problem with this, but where ST: HF is a mess, they include comments from real people in this concept. <br /> <br /> Tactical advice, such as “We need to regroup,” sounds good, but not when a trio of characters are already spoken in the group. Similarly, when asked what the situation is, the tactical officer responds: "We count three battleships." Does he really need to count them? C'mon! I expected the questioner to ask him "Are you sure?" or "Can you double-check." But my favorite comment is: <br /> <br /> Captain: “Can we establish two-way communication?” <br /> <br /> Liaison Officer: “No, we can only send and receive ..” < br /> <br /> Well, yes! ..... <br /> <br /> Having said all this, the show improves as you move forward. Seasons 1 and 2 are pretty bad, 3 shows improvement, but 4 and 5 Begin to noticeably improve. Season 6 still looks quite reasonable. <br /> <br /> I really have a problem with choosing media for the show. QuickTime sucks, frankly, and the sooner they go into the DivX / AVI format, the better. Some We like to take our loaded shows and watch them on a decent-sized screen, rather than looking at the small QT window on the computer monitor, which not only complicates Quicktime, but also the resolution of 320x180, which shows the shows, does not scale well. this makes the show rather unsightly, as if it were a copy of a tenth generation VHS tape, the least they could do was enable high-resolution downloads. <br /> <br /> In any case, the show has a promise, and I even begin to like some characters. But these are already 40 episodes, so I'm not sure that this says so much about character development. <br /> <br /> But what you can say is free .... <br /> <br /> PS: Out of 28 votes, 19 people rated this show as 9 or 10. Hmmmm ... we watched one same show? Or are you 19 all three years old?
