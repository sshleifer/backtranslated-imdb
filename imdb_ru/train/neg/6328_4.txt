Why this film does not meet the standards? Ultimately, the answer lies in a poor, humorless scenario. Slender / medium-looking Travolta (looks rather faded in black, I must say, even with HUGE mullet) and Gross, both behave very well, like two young people dressed in pajama pants, but nonetheless silly New Yorkers aspiring open your own nightclub. Other than that, the rest of the film is just boring to watch. It’s so boring that you really shouldn’t know what happens at the climax of a movie at any level. Kelly Preston, obviously, exudes sex appeal, and sexually charged dance with her future husband Travolta is one of the few pleasures of the film. Charles Martin Smith is quite funny to watch the KGB fight Bob Smith. I personally think that the film would be better if the plot were a little changed so that the settings would not change from New York to Indian Springs, Nebraska (which is in the former Soviet Union?) - you will understand if you see the film ... Apparently, this film was shot in 1986, ready for release in 1987. I think Paramount stopped the release of the film before January 1989 because of the incredible plot. It was reported that they considered this "impracticable." However, this film, worth $ 6,000,000, collected a slightly more awkward income of $ 163,000, since it was released only KRATKO in places like Texas and Colorado, before going straight to the video. This indicates the overall poor quality of this film.
