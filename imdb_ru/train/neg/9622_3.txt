When I saw this movie being shown on TV, I was really looking forward to it. I grew up in the 1980s and, like everyone who grew up in that era, I saw films about teenagers and summer camps every 80s. So I could not wait to see this film, which completely forges this genre of film. What a disappointment!! The film was just a bunch of really bad jokes and jokes over and over again, almost without plot and without content. And the attempts of filmmakers to dark humor completely failed - some of these so-called jokes did not look anything other than just cruel and offensive. The only good things about this movie were the wardrobe, the music, and the acting. It was nice to go on a nostalgic journey and see all the styles of summer clothes of the 80s, and the same goes for music. And the acting was top-level everywhere: almost all the best Hollywood comedians were present. It is a pity that they did not have the best material for work.
