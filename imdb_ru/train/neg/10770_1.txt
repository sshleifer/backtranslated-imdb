May contain possible spoilers (Not that something in this film was new or even slightly surprised you in this regard) <br /> <br /> Why did Disney consider it necessary to rework everything they ever did oblivion? Of course, it’s cheaper for them, but after a while you don’t think that the overall quality and how people think about them will decrease. House Of Villains is a disgusting demonstration of cartoon crossovers, in which there is absolutely no point. Here are some signs of complete disregard for previous films: the voices do not even coincide remotely, and Iago is again angry (since when?!). I know that these films are aimed directly at children, but there was a time when everyone could enjoy Disney movies. Even the film’s musical number (which was a Disney specialty for years) stank. I would not recommend this film to anyone, even very young ones. All I can do is that if more films of the same caliber are released, only a small animation studio will surpass Disney in overall quality.
