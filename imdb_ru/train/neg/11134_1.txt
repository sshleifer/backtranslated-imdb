This is a very cheap werewolf. The video is dark and poorly lit. The sound is uneven, poorly recorded and mixed. The script is a cliché junk with ordinary characters, such as a tough detective who shoots werewolves with his silver pistol! [filled with silver bullets of course]. The game is wooden, like characters. FX does not exist, many extreme close-ups of werewolf jaws and biting. the only thing shown is a lot of soft T & A. Instead of throwing $ 30 for this prank, look at a really great recent photo of a werewolf: “Dog Soldiers” with Sean Pertwee
