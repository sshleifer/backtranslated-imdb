I tried to watch this movie three times. I rented it at night. It took about 20 minutes, hoping that it would be better if I rest at night. The next day we watched another 15, almost vomited, as it was stupid ... It was not even funny, stupid, sometimes it was a funny movie, but this movie was just big shit (if you know what I mean censored world in which we live). And finally, on the third day, I watched more than an hour for stupidity, and I did not enjoy a single moment! Not even one. How did this script get the green light? Oh boy! <br /> <br /> G <br /> <br /> 1/10 - for fans ... they deserve at least something for all their hard work.
