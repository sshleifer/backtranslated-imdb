This notorious ending to the career of Cohen Waters caught my attention in The Night of Bad Taste. Judging by the index of comments, I am not the first or the last person in Western Europe who finds out that this musician (undoubtedly, one of the best on our modern pop scene, even the Dutch agree with this) tried to be an actor. Whether he should make an attempt or not cannot be judged. <br /> <br /> In the Intensive Therapy, he is pretty cute, but he doesn't seem to like the film in which he participates. No one can blame him. He deserves his rating in Verheien's Hall of Fame in all respects and standards. The story of the killer maniac, who allegedly died in an accident, but was alive and angry, was told dozens of times earlier, and even without original turns, the director can present a more than mediocre story with the help of innovative settings and cinematography. <Br /> <br /> In IC there is a hospital wing and a couple of middle-class houses. The pace is boring. Tension loses the last bit of confidence in the musical score, as each appearance of the killer is accompanied by a tedious menacing tune, accompanied by orchestral flashes during the killings, which are either largely assumed and in any case as bloodless as a small budget can make them. Sex scene is free, but not attractive. However, a couple from Amsterdam can make it work. While we are talking about a couple: the whole plot between Waters and the girl does not work. A more effective emotional connection could be established on the screen if they were only accomplices who weaken their nerves halfway through physical communication. I will not even give other members of acting skills the dignity of mentioning, because they all had to be cut into tiny fatty pieces. In fact, most of them do. Those that I remember were obvious to the genre: a pretty nurse and two policemen. <br /> <br /> Consequently, in the slasher, the cavalry comes in time to need salvation. The (Anti) hero must kill the villain, mainly due to clever thinking, because former red berets do not often get roles in these films; they can overcome the illusion of invincibility that surrounds the killer. In terms of events, Wauters kills a doctor and saves a lady in trouble. <br /> <br /> No people, I did not finish. This is not how the story goes. Wouters makes his heroic attempt, but he is beaten by rage, which is approaching "A Clockwork Orange", so the girl must take on the role of the driller's killer and break through the brains of the doctors. Although this method provides more killer deaths than regular 9-mm bullets, the doctor survives to allow IC to reach the 80-minute mark. <br /> <br /> I already had to prove it. “Intensive Care” is a bad film that only Bad Tasters can watch, which can check Verheyen’s catchy statements and make some for himself, and thus try to come to terms with it. For example, the (unintended) parody of the clown mask of the doctor (Halloween) and the final confrontation in the park (chase at the end of Friday the 13th). <br /> <br /> However, let me conclude with a review with a few pathetic elements that give the IC a small estimate. George Kennedy is not one of them. All he has to do is endure a terrible monologue by another doctor / French actor and look frightened when released on fire to mark his big name with a replacement. He could play his part in the “Nude Gun” again, turning into beef, but with a longer screen time. The final may be one of them. I have never seen a maniac knocked off his feet by launching fireworks into his guts to press him against a flexible fence. This is good for a laugh. <br /> <br /> Give me one good note about intensive care ... Koen Wouters learned his lesson and devoted himself entirely to his musical career. It amazes me how many issues of the Paris-Dakar race he has to interrupt before he recovers. <br /> <br />
