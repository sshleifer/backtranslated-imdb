“Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow” (surprisingly inconvenient title) is just a bad movie; he has no heart, no deep ideas, nothing special about it. Yes, CGI backgrounds look interesting, but as a result, everything is removed in an annoying soft focus. In addition, the film uses music in the same way as, say, “Gilligan's Island” or Scooby-Doo cartoons - IT NEVER STOPS. Scary, just awful. Also, there are no fresh ideas, just pharynx, nastiness, pharynx and ..., etc., bits taken from old movies and TV shows. There is no gatekeeper here; the film seems to exist because it can. Save your money and your time. Not entertaining at all.
