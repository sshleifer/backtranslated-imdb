This telling for television is the most terrible piece of garbage that has ever hit Australian television. Neighbors in the house are boring, uninteresting, ridiculously unwise and are chosen on the basis that you are most likely to try to kill them if you live with them. As far as I know, Big Brother is the decline of Western society, showing how we, as a society, are on a steep slope towards becoming dead brains. What happened to television that was not meant for the least common denominator of society as an audience? It can not be classified as entertainment. I think it is true that the tenth channel can remove your soul. This happened to Rove McManus, who was once a respectable comedian and, having moved to Channel 10, became terribly unfunny. Except for the Simpsons, which are very cleverly made.
