Expecting to enter the theater with tickets in hand, I expected an interesting science fiction fantasy film that could finally satisfy my appetite for films about robotics, but instead I was disappointed in every aspect of it, once again proving that the amazing effects could not help boring story, which, in my opinion, was worse this year. Acting in this film also didn’t satisfy me, Will Smith didn’t show anything new in this film, but I’ve never seen his play change from the days of Men in Black, which, in my opinion, was his only success. Since then, he had to resign without spoiling his name with such names as “I, the Robot” and “Men in Black 2”. 4/10
