A really awful, pretentious, endless movie. Director Bellocchio seems fascinated by the pretty face and figure of his actress Detmers - and who can blame him? But maybe, just maybe, he should focus his attention on making a good, attractive film. I hate it when a sex movie poses as a “movie” just to become more “respectable”. Frequent, sometimes hot sex scenes - the only reason for the existence of this film. Should they look after the rest of the picture - a matter of taste. (*)
