Republican pictures appear at the end of the game in the genre of "werewolf" or "Werecat". The story has a writer returning to Paris after a long trip abroad, during which he developed a fear of the jungle, during which he had eclipses. He is a great success because his novel, which runs along with the infamous court, is a bestseller. The French government wants to know if he had access to secret documents, which seems more likely when an official is killed by a "cat." Suspicion really falls on the writer when his fiance ends. Difficult things - the return of outages, so the author does not know if he is a murderer or not. <br /> <br /> Well, the thriller is too slow to be fully used. At the beginning there are too many musical numbers and too much dead time, when everything is discussed in the middle and subsequent parts. The acting is good, and the sets are pretty good, but there is a reason that most of my friends remember only the killer he hates, he is the most interesting thing in this film. Despite the short opening hours (a little over an hour), I think the reason that this film was rarely seen on TV was that after 20 minutes you begin to lose patience. No matter how good the conversation was, I just wanted someone to do something. When it finally happened, it was too late in the last minutes. <br /> <br /> Take a pass.
