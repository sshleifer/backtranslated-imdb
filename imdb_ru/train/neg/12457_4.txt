It seems that Salvatores could not decide what to do with this film: some of this is a very weak thriller (and I say very, very weak), and partly an attempt to clarify the relationship between the main characters. Both things were tested in psychological thrillers, but in this case the film cannot unite things because of a bad, shallow script, a bad game and too dark, too boring cinema. I would say that Salvatores showed himself in other genres and in other situations where he could freely look at the characters without thinking about the plot. In general, a B-film is hardly worth your money ... Vote: 4/10
