Seeing a poster from the Smother film, I realized that I was going to live through one of those unbearable experiences that made me want to look away. However, I felt a little optimistic, because the film had a solid cast that I thought was about to save the film. Unfortunately, it did not happen. Mother is a terrible film, but it will not be performed. This is the best I can say about this. <br /> <br /> The Smother script (written by the same guys from Licenses to Wed, which explains that they have something besides talent for writing films) is full of cheap and predictable humor. Seriously, I never laughed once when I watched this movie. for nothing. After a lot of garbage, in which she was involved (as, for example, terribly cruel and doable, because I said so), some people may think that Diane Keaton’s career is putting out. However, I can not forget about the excellent performances. She brought us on the eve of decades, in films such as Annie Hall or Baby Boom. On Smother, she does her best to play her part, but her character is so badly written that she can't do anything about it. Dax Shepard left a good impression on me with his hard body. performances in the films "Mom and idiocracy." However, he does his best with his character. Mike White is also making great efforts, but he does not go too far. He is a very talented screenwriter (as he showed in the films). as “Good Girl” and “School of Rock”), so I would like him to be one of the screenwriters of this film, and not just starred in it. Liv Tyler suffers from the same situation with all the previously mentioned actors: to be lost. <br /> <br /> Smother's worst failure is completely boring and unfunny. His script is nothing but a collection of scenes and situations that we saw on comedies. Stay away from this stupid comedy.
