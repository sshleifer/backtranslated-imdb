If the original casting idea had been preserved (the hunt for Rutger, not Ice-T), this film could work. Unfortunately, racism had to come into the picture (literally) and spoil it. The production staff, predominantly black, could not allow the antagonist to be black, so they switched roles for Rutger and Ice-T. This was only the beginning of the downward spiral of this film. Ernest Dickerson's approach to the “leadership” in the news section only confirmed that this was another assignment for positive action. Master shot, close, close. Gads, "Who is the line, in any case," even uses a more creative camera work. Eric's rewriting of The Most Dangerous Game is at least an attempt to modernize the classic fairy tale, but gives us no reason for why the characters do it. We are never informed of the reasons, except for “no one will miss these people,” why the leader (rewritten as Rutger) does these things. Other than the cordial work of John McGinley and the honest work of Charles Dutton, don't worry about it. A small detail: during the shooting there was a real drunk driving accident, as a result of which F. Murray injured Abraham, which led to the death of a young driver while intoxicated, which caused the accident.
