Well - the helicopter shots are fantastic, and the director made good use of some of the main attractions of Barcelona. Otherwise ... the cost of production was blown up in the first few minutes, and the rest of the film looked like a movie of the week. Ellen Pompeo was charming and funny, watching, Abel Folk had the greatest depth and was very effective, and William Baldwin was ... well, William Baldwin. He must use his martial arts training to good advantage and be an energetic actor running with a springboard. The rest of the cast was wooden at best, but mostly paper. So, if you are nostalgic about Spain, this is a postcard with a story and a healthy dose of El Greco. If not, skip this.
