My wife and I agree that this is one of the worst films ever made. Of course, in the first ten of those whom I watched throughout the journey. At least the "Plan 9" was enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I really liked “Cristina”, “The Dead Zone”, “Fire Starter”, “Carrie” and some of his other films. I didn't give a damn about Cujo (just because the sound was so bad in the versions I saw, and I often couldn't say what people said), or "Pet Sematary (Pet Cemetery)". > <br /> But this mess was a complete mistake in every possible relationship. The “creatures” themselves seemed to be created by a 9-year-old child. (No offense to nine-year-olds.) <br /> <br /> Even “one-liners” made us moan and were not funny.
