The film is complete nonsense. We have two good actors who are missing and the dizzying actor Salman Khan to attract a female audience. The story is crap. Characters are poorly drawn. Non-existent story. No editing to talk about. Ajay Devgan is like a rock star ... it's a dream in itself. The film stretches to decline. All this talk about the fact that Arjun brought his Mann to London, allowed him to grope his girlfriend and did not allow him to play Wembley (Wimble in the process of duplication) is absurd. Selman Khan is too good acting or pretending to look too painful. I remember watching some good films from this producer Vipul Shah, but this is not one of them. It seems that all good directors are victims of a box office craze created by mumbai media morons. This is another crappy film from the Wanted series with an idiotic actor like Salman Khan, who has no place in the Good Hindi movie theater. It is good for Indian cinema, like Titanic for the winter cruise business. On a positive note, I like it when Asin dances to Bharatnatyam, when she goes to Western-style dances, when the teacher is not looking.
