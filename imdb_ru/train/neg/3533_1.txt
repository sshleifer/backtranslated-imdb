Let this film be the cradle of death for the “big twist” films made in the 1990s. Known in some circles as Kieser's Sozé Syndrome, this cinematic hand shot was now taken to death by M. Night Shayamalan, and even Ron Howard used the “BEAUTIFUL MIND” variation. However, in REVOLVER, director Guy Ritchie (known in some circles as “Mr. Madonna”) uses the Sozé motive much more obscenely. <br /> <br /> Jason Statham (with a very dubious hair head) plays the role of Jack Green (known to all as “Mr. Green”). He also may or may not be the criminal mastermind behind Mr Gold. Or perhaps Mr. Gold is an irritable spirit that may have members of the underworld. I'm not quite sure, but I don't care. REVOLVER is one of the most overwhelmed examples of cinematic excesses that I have been experiencing displeasure for quite some time. Look at the broken temporal structure, painful leaps, continuous internal monologues and painfully pretentious animation sequence. This style of "everything and the kitchen sink" makes Quentin Tarantino's creativity balanced. Cinematic smoke and mirrors only make me believe that Richie was telling this banal story as boring as I was. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with moments of revelation, which are supposedly shocking, but they come as news for Mr. Green. I wanted to love Green because I always liked Stratham as a character who is two steps ahead of everyone else. Here, however, he fights together, as a corrective reader in the classroom of university English literature. His lack of wit is combined only with the lack of restraint shown by his sworn enemy Machey (Ray Liotta). Enjoying the scenery, like a hungry person at a buffet, Liotta spits, cries and smokes through the film in an embarrassing display of replays and leopard speedometers. <br /> <br /> REVOLVER has no redemptive qualities. This is another cinematic deception from Richie, who may even surpass his pathetic remake of SWEPT AWAY as his worst movie.
