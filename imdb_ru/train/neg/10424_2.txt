I have to love this movie. The acting is very good, and Barbara Stenvik is great, but the film has always seemed very banal to me. the film makes working-class people look low and cheap. The fact that the daughter is ashamed of her mother and that the daughter does not rise above her has always caused me some anxiety to Barbara Stenvik because the mother worships her daughter, but the daughter refuses her motherâ€™s love to find happiness with her well to make a family of fathers. I wonder how many other people who have seen this film relate to this. Again the game was very good and worth watching. I really don't like the storyline. just personal preference. thank
