... And I never thought that a film deserves to get 1! But this is, frankly, the worst film I've ever watched. My wife picked it up because of the cast, but the storyline right from the DVD box seemed quite predictable. This is not a mystery or a movie for teenagers. This does not include any sensuality, if that is what the headline can offer remotely to any of you. It's just no no. Do not waste your time and money if you do not want to watch a group of young people in the Gothic style, as an adult, where the killer pursues them. Nothing new, nothing interesting, nothing worth watching. Max Makowski makes the worst of Nick Stahl.
