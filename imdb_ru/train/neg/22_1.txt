I saw this DVD in the house of my friends and thought it was a Turkish fighter with some Hollywood, but not very big names. Interested enough, I decided to give him a chance later .. It was hard to believe me. Then, after watching the videos, I thought: “We, the Turks, really suck a movie in Hollywood style ... This is an insult to the genre of robbing a film about hostages ...”, but then wait! I checked some names, and no, they were not Turkish names, and no, it was not a Turkish film; on the contrary, he was literally shot in America with an American director and crew! It made me think - again! “How can you convince names like Michel Madsen, Edward Furlong or even Arnold Voslu to take part in such a project?” with money probably ... It made me think further .. How can you raise such a sum of money to offer them an alleged international composition? Then all my meditations paid off, and I came to find the answer. Hiring the cheapest equipment and team you can find. And if it is still difficult for you to adjust your budget, then: when you are writing and directing the film that you are trying to produce, or vice versa, I have no information about it. So, the bottom line is that this is not a bad film, because everyone wants to present it as ... It makes you wonder - in my case, even to meditate - and there are many films that do not even give such an effect ... least makes you think; It makes you think .. It leaves you with disbelief .. and then It makes you wonder again ..
