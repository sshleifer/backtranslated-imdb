This is available on Dark Sky Films Drive In Double Feature, and since I just finished Barracuda, I also watched it. This is a film that turns out to be incredibly ambitious and inept at the same time. <br /> <br /> We start with two young girls who roam the streets of a foreign city, but where exactly are they? They stop to look at some Chinese seller's necklaces and try on Chinese-style clothes in the store, but then we will see Aztec dancers? And all this time, these girls are followed by two guys who eventually give up all the tricks they don't need to chase the girls on the run in the city, and they finally catch them. <br /> <br /> It seems that one of the girls has a coin around her neck, and these guys want to find the loot, and where did she get it? So, in the memories, we come back to find out. And how did they know that she has this coin? Hard to say true. <br /> <br /> Now, at the time when these two women were 10 years old, they left with their sisters and their sisters' guys on the boat, and then stopped to get some air. in their aquariums, they towed this boy back to his home dock, only for his grandfather to come out and invite “young” children to herbal tea with her grandmother. But not everyone has tea, Todd returned to the boat to check on the young girls, and then, when they are far away from her, the boat explodes, and when they return to the house, their friends mysteriously disappear. Well, it seems that these “good people” grow their own vegetables, but they wait until the meat is enchanted, and herbal tea is served to it. <br /> <br /> But the girls and Todd left the island, but now they are returning accompanied by their captors, and they are there to find the treasure, despite the fact that no one has ever shown the girls where it was before. It seems that there is someone else on the island, and the goons mysteriously begin to die, one by one, and since there are only three of them, it will not take long. And there is even a kind of happy ending that will leave the viewer as confused as during the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Two thugs seem to be high-speed fans with anger problems, and combined without acting skills they border on the mind. The village-type family is also deprived of acting ability, despite the fact that the grandfather is Hank Worden, who has appeared in many films and TV shows. The action is confusing, the terrain is even more tangled, and the island looks like Southern California. <br /> <br /> So what the hell is this? I'm not sure, but it's definitely worth seeing once, so you can think (or say), eh? 4 out of 10 is very strange.
