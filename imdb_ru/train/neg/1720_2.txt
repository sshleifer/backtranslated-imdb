A handful of non-professional actors are terrorized by a prehistoric creature. This creature appears about thirty seconds after the marginal animation of the stop motion, but oh, how will you miss this edge when in the rest of the movie the animation is replaced by production assistants who wave their teeth around the inner tube. There is no time for horror, when this film is halfway captured by these silly comics, which suddenly become protagonists; but again, you have to admit that watching them try to be funny is better than fooling around at the sheriff. Only at the end one of them is eaten, and the other is left to sit on a rock and cry tears of solitude - this is not fun!
