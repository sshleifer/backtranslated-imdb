In essence, what we have here is a little more than a remake of the 1970s fun-filled classic kitsch-horror line of death, which, ironically, looked like this shoemaker, also partially shot at an abandoned metro station in Aldvihe. <br /> <br /> It is useful to use from the obsolete platforms of the Jubilee line on Charing Cross, as well as the aforementioned Oldwich, this film contains mostly the same story - the clever murder of insane zombies in the tunnels that hunt lost passengers missed the last train - originality is not strong this point. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are not enough strengths. Blood ranges from poor to excessively bloody, while the halo of a subgollum is never fully explained, as it seems a little more than an underdeveloped plot. <br /> <br /> Franke Polente has little to do with a subtle script that ran through a lot of tunnels and screamed so often, indeed, it looked like almost everyone else in this film, beating a small dog and a pack of tamed rats. <br /> <br /> If the creepy movies shot on the London Underground are your bag, or you just want to play "Find a place on the tube," they pick it up on DVD when it goes into the shopping basket. If you are looking for a classic horror, go and dig a copy of the "Line of Death" ("Raw Meat"). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a quality well-written and well-played film, you will need to change the train .....
