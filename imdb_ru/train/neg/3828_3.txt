By 1976, the Western genre was exhausted, and the creators of this film clearly knew it. However, instead of postponing the project and freeing us from having to watch it, they still did it. Obviously, in need of an interesting topic, so that the audience came to see the film, they decided to make it as cruel and unpleasant as possible. Hell, it worked for The Wild Bunch, so why not work here? Of course, The Wild Bunch had the advantage of a superb script, but The Last Hard Men script is just old-fashioned trash. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to understand what attracted Charlton Heston and James Coburn to their respective roles. Heston plays a retired lawyer who pursues an escaped group of convicts led by a violent criminal (Coburn). The hunt becomes even more personal when Heston's daughter (Barbara Hershey) is kidnapped by convicts and subjected to sexual degradation. <br /> <br /> This is a truly bloodthirsty film, in which every time someone dies, it is shown in excessive quantities. top detail. This is really very disappointing, because the combination of stars sounds like an appetizing prospect. There is no sense of tempo or urgency in the film. It takes forever, but when the action finally comes, it is overshadowed by an emphasis on evil. All in all, this could be the worst movie Heston ever made. I am sure that this is one of the productions that he does not want to include in his illustrious resume.
