The film sucks, it was not funny, it was not exciting. they tried to make it so bad that it would be good, but they failed. and thinking that itâ€™s cool to love this film, not the hype, these are the only reasons for the success of this film ... <br /> <br /> the fact that at this moment 50% voted 10 out of 10 this film to me it seems quite interesting, either the film going public is going crazy, or this voice is unrealistic, it may have many reasons, and you need to fight it. in any case, this is not an ordinary film that flourished from word of mouth to advertising. His success can only be called a marketing miracle.
