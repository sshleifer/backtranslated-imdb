Assassin Hauser’s (John Cusack) mission is to beat up the Middle East Oil Minister, named Omar Sharif (Neykov), in the country of Turakistan, which is led by American interests. Hauser pretends to be a trade show producer so that he can get to Omar. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a satire can be so exaggerated that it becomes very annoying. Here it does too much: government, politics, music, war, people who are usually not accepted by society, and I mentioned “war”. And this is what we have here - the most annoying film, bordering on a very bad nightmare brought to life. I still ask myself why I continued with the DVD. In addition, there are so many members of the Cusack family that John Cusack seems confused that the family is just there, or is it just me? <br /> <br /> This used to be a John Cusack film, while the small one was pretty good after all. Not here. Believe that John Cusack had a hand in writing and creating this mess. Make from this what you do. <br /> <br /> There are too many events in the film, accompanied by standing firearms, bombings and shouts that you really can't focus on, or is this the point? Probably. It takes too long to set up a hit, which is largely forgotten until the last 15 minutes. At the same time, we have a meaningless banter among all in the cast. And chemistry between John Cusack and Marisa Torme? I don't think so, but you know: boy ?? girl and, and they had to take something more time. <br /> <br /> Yes, what they were supposed to be (extraordinary and annoying) the performances of Duff and Kingsley were good. But when I saw Dan Aykroyd’s character, at the beginning of the show, sitting on the toilet in a dump, I knew that the rest of the show would also go to the tank. I was not mistaken. I’m sure some will sing praises for this effort, but if the rose is still a rose under any other name, then this is also a mess ?????????? <br /> <br /> I now remember why I continued with the DVD. I was hoping that the story would somehow even out and save itself. Never did. <br /> <br /> Violence: yes. Paul: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes.
