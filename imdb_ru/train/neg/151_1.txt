This is really terrible. <br /> <br /> The only feature of this film is that the next time people ask me which vampire movie is the worst one I've ever seen, I will have the appropriate answer. <br /> <br /> I think itâ€™s shot at 35 mm, so it's already sticky as hell. I would not comment, but I noticed that some fans (probably related to the film) claimed that it was the best film since the days of The Matrix. Let me debunk the myths and lies. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good about the movie. Everything screams tastelessly. The actress is ugly. The choreography of wrestling is the worst I've ever seen. The fighting scenes are incredibly amateur. Imagine a girl waving her arms helplessly in a circle and inflicting weak blows that will not harm the kitten. Obviously, the director simply pulled people from the street to give them roles in the film. <br /> <br /> I know that the director did not have a big budget for the film, but still the best films were made earlier with a smaller budget. Unforgivable.
