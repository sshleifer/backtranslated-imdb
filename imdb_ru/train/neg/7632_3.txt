Many consider it a classic, but I obviously missed something. Life in Anaren, Texas at the beginning of the 50s is pretty boring - this means that a film about life in Anaren, Texas at the beginning of the 50s, will be pretty boring! What do so many people see in this? As soon as the last exhibition in Anaren closes, there will be nothing more to be done in the city. Duane (Jeff Bridges) underlines this at the end of the film. But even before it closes, there is nothing special to do, so basically everything revolves around sex. High school students make plans for how to lose their virginity - sometimes with each other, and sometimes with the same bored adults in the city. You see, they have nothing to do - except to have sex (sometimes with each other, and sometimes with bored teenagers) or to whine about the local high school football team. Three times something happened, and I thought it would add a bit of drama to the film. Sam (Ben Johnson) dies unexpectedly, but in fact nothing happens because of this, Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Jaysey (Cybill Shepherd) run away, but in fact nothing happens because of this, Joe Bob (Bark Doyle ) kidnaps a little girl, but nothing really happens because of this. The only thing that added something dramatic significance to the film occurred at the end with the death of Billy (Sam Bottoms), which really points to the emptiness of life in this wretched little town when men stand looking at the body, discussing where to go for breakfast . <br /> <br /> Peter Bogdanovich shot it in black and white. It is assumed that I would like to indicate how gray this city is, but the only thing that seemed interesting to me was an early look at actors such as Bottom, Shepard, Bridges and Randy Quaid. (It was also scary to see how Quaid - in 1971 - actually looks like his character, cousin Eddie, in films about National holidays on Lumpoon.) Is it a classic? I do not think so! 3/10
