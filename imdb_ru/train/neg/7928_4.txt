In fact, the film is neither horror nor sci-fi. With a very strong Christian religious theme, this film provides minimal content and does not wait. Second-level actors perform a semi-decent job of reading their boring roles. The only good performance is Sydney Penny, who plays the role of a mother ... I will not spoil the film, this is either Christ or the Antichrist. Avoid watching this movie unless you are a Christian religious fanatic with an apocalypse. <br /> <br /> Being a non-Christian, I had to watch this movie just because I wanted to write this review. It is a pity that the Sci-Fi channel had to show this film in the midst of the evening.
