There was something here that the lead woman had an ideal life that she always dreamed of after the worst possible life, starting with a child prostitute and ending with Eric Roberts. But her experience does not allow her to trust Dean Cain, and this ultimately destroys him. It sounds strange, but I like the position of Dean Cain at the end and the choice he made. He cannot hurt her because he loves her, and she is the mother of his child (I think the time frame makes it clear that this is his child, not his brother), but at the same time he cannot forgive her for everything what she did, sleep with his brother (which shows the love and duty he felt, was pretty much in one way) and then be part of his death. In the best hands, this would be the best film, but for something that I caught on the night telegram, this is not bad.
