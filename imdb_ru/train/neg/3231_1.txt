It seems that in this film many people say that he is one of the most violent of all time. After I just looked at it, I can say that it does not meet these requirements. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film is really crazy. But overall, the execution was not at all terrible. Even the final scene (the thing with the eyeball) is not so nasty. I was expecting something insane; instead, it was of lower quality than the blood shown in films like the ultra-low budget Violent Sh! T. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to see a real movie will be disappointed, as this is not a story (although most people probably know this). Gore fans will be disappointed because, contrary to faith, blood and guts are rare here. Not to mention the fact that the actress who plays the role of the victim may be one of the worst in history. <br /> <br /> No matter what people say, this film is not so shocking, it just sucks. Avoid this.
