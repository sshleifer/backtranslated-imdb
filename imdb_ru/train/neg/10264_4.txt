The head of the usual New York family, Jane Gale (as Mary Barton), works with her younger sister Ethel Grandin (as Lomie Barton) at Smirner's candy store. After Mrs. Grandin is abducted by female prostitute traffickers, Miss Gale and her police boyfriend Matt Moore (like Larry Burke) must rescue a young woman who is at risk. "Traffic in the Souls" has a reputation that is difficult to maintain - it is not surprisingly well done, and there is nothing unique in it that the "virtue" of a young woman threatens sex traders. Perhaps this can be supported as a film that deals with a topic longer than usual (it was originally claimed that it was ten commercials). The scene from New York is the main attraction after all these years. Panning prisoners behind bars is remembered, because it seems that nothing else can make the cameras move. <br /> <br /> **** Soul Movement (11/24/13) George Loan Tucker ~ Jane Gale, Matt Moore, Ethel Grandin
