DEATHSTALKER is ideal for fans of the B-fantasy movie; This almost 80-minute film parody includes everything that hacklers can ask for - non-existent plots, horrible actions (except for at least a rough-sounding old woman), ridiculous scenarios and editing of slogans, as well as background in the style of “basement” ". settings. There are no characters that would look like cute or interesting (in particular, there is NOTHING appealing to him in the main role), and the assembled actors hardly do anything to rise above the F-grade material. If this is not enough, then how about the lack of a convincing plot (there is nothing like this in this film) so that DEATHSTALKER is considered the main turkey? I was also offended by the fact that women in this film hardly serve any purpose other than 1) being topless and / or poorly dressed; 2) to rape; 3) have sex with the hero; 4) all of the above. In addition, background music is disgusting; a strange mess of electronic noise, cheese choral explosions and blatant orchestral cacophony. DEATHSTALKER is probably best suited for people looking for something to laugh at (and believe me, there are a lot of things). Otherwise, I do not recommend this CONAN of the 100th class to anyone in the least.
