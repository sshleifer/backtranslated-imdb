The overheated story "Bonjour tristesse" is taken from the first children's novel by Francoise Sagan, which became a bestseller, although God knows why. For teens wanting to get rid of a potential stepfather, this may have a certain appeal. Ignore the fact that David Niven is a playboy father, and Deborah Kerr is a future stepmother. Unfortunately, too much lies on the fragile shoulders of Jean Seberg. She is beautiful and easily performs the image of a spoiled teenager. The problem is that she can take poses, but cannot act. Anyone who saw her as Joan of Arc in "St. Joan "Otto Preminger - Seberg's first film - knows that at 19 she was unable to carry the film. This film, also Preminger, fulfills the “promise” of the first. This was her second film; she was now 20. What did Preminger think? What could Niven and Kerr make up for Seberg's lack of acting ability? No chance? Seberga's character is at the center of the story, and although she is convincing, although she may be physically 17 years old, she cannot satisfy the emotional demands of the role. I do not know if she ever became a successful actress in her short life, because she did not affect my mind in her later pictures. But anyone who thinks this film is better than a mediocre one needs a taste check. Despite Niven and Kerr, this is still a juvenile story, performed in a youthful manner by a beautiful young girl, who urgently needs acting lessons.
