There is something to love. The actors are first-class, and the script provides a good dialogue that best reflects the atmosphere of a friendly, friendly family. However, for this reason, the film does not sound believable. We see that Leo, who apparently has just learned about his HIV-positive diagnosis, essentially responds in a way that does not correspond to the favorable atmosphere in which he found himself. In addition, the film ends quite unexpectedly, avoiding the fact that Leo, his brother, and the rest of this close family must have had a love affair with him. The young actor who plays Leo's brother, Marcel, is impressive, as are all the other actors. Unfortunately, the script writers could not decide whether they want to conduct an insightful dissertation on the effect of HIV on a functional, attractive family or how destructive HIV affects the victim - so these are only hints of both. Although this film gives food for thought, it leaves the viewer to desire much more than it gives.
