The film is pretty funny and includes about four dates, then it becomes a blatant commercial for some guy you (and even his “friends”) really can't stand. This is a rather interesting concept; The film is about the search for true love in modern Los Angeles. The problem is that it sometimes seems incredibly (and poorly) scripted and clearly self-promotion. It is difficult to take care of any character and be involved in it, because the writer / actor is so selfish, not cool, not true and just incredible. You end up regretting his dates.
