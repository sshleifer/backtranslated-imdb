This film is one of the worst horror films I have ever seen. From the very first scene, I knew that it would be a great collapse. It all starts with a seemingly bad girl who kills a bunch of nuns in a mission. It turns out that the people in it were obsessed with random zombies. Well, after a few years, some college students made a commitment. Awful acting game moves from the pledge to the main athlete. Things like jock screaming at him to do things completely out of touch with the promise of reacting and exaggerating the whole "thirst to be a popular role." What really took the cake with this is the final battle. Absolutely HORRIBLE special effects with weapons. For example, guns make noise without a flash of the muzzle, and vice versa. this is accompanied by stopping the animation of zombies (why they move in stopped motion is a mystery), stupid music and about 40 guns that appear from nowhere. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is crap. Just like many others, you can rent for 50 cents in the nearest movie rental location.
