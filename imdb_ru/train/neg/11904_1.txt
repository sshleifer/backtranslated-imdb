“The end of the violence” and, of course, the Million Dollar Hotel hint at the idea that Wenders lost his sight, the ability to tell compelling stories on a moving picture map. I am afraid the “Land of Plenty” closes the coffin because it is an incredibly unimaginable, obviously sentimental and stamped film. The characters are completely flat and stereotypical, the writing, plot and direction are amateurish at best. For the first time in a long time, I could not wait to finish the film so that I could continue my life. War-torn uncle's nonsense, a patriotic abstract look at the sky in conclusion ... it all just seemed so simple and pathetic to me that it was hardly the work of a director who once created some convincing magic on the screen. What happened? I'm afraid the days of his experiments, insightful writing and interesting opportunities for filming are over. Hopefully, he will find his inspiration again ... At the Toronto Film Festival, where I saw the film, Wenders was there to present it. Having no humility at all, he offered us the following: “I hope ... no, wait ... I KNOW you will enjoy the next two hours." I'm afraid he could not be wrong ...
