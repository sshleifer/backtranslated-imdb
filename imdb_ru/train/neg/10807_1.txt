This film successfully proved that we all already know that professional basketball players suck everything except the game of basketball. Especially rap and acting. I can't even describe how bad this film really is. First, is it just me, or is it the ugliest child you've ever seen? I mean, his teeth can be used as a can opener. Secondly, why does the genie want to make a career in the music industry, when, although he has magical powers, he sucks terribly when making music? Thirdly, I read the Bible. No form, no form, said that Jesus created geniuses. Fourth, what about all the crappy special effects? I assure you that any teen with a computer prone to acne can do better than this. Fifth, why did the ending suck so badly? And what the hell is a genie? And finally, the one who created the nightmare, known as Kazam, must be dropped from the plane on the Eiffel Tower, because this film takes the word “suck” to a whole new level.
