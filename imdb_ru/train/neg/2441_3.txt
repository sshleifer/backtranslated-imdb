I thought Intensive Care was pretty bad and very unintentionally funny. But at least not as bad as I thought. Sometimes it is somewhat disturbing, but never a good shocker. <br /> <br /> Ahead spoiler <br /> <br /> The funny thing is in the ridiculous moments. But the classic moment for all times is this: the murderer killed and beat Peter (Cohen Wouters). He groans in the corner of the corridor. Amy (Nada van Ni) kneels next to him and asks: "Poor Peter, shall I bring you a band-aid?" <br /> <br /> This film was shot in Dutch and English. To save money, all license plates are in the USA, and the background in the news studio is the skyline of Manhattan. Very funny if you are Dutch and see the original Dutch version.
