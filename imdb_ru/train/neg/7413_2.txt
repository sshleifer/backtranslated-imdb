Just finished watching, I can not say that I was impressed. <br /> <br /> It all starts pretty well, the visual design and atmosphere create an eerie feeling, as in this type of film. But it all ends when the first monster Lordi appears. You will not only learn them from the lordi group, but you are also seriously mistaken in the film. Doomsday Monsters with leather jackets and piercings turned 80 years old. <br /> <br /> With regard to the plot, it begins as a similar horror film, where people fall into a hellhole. But there is no clear story about why and what is happening. Some lines are thrown to the viewer for possible reasons, but these lines never meet and do not end with anything but confusion. <br /> <br /> With all the money spent on this film, with an intriguing start and some good effects, I thought someone would take care of the product better. I wonder if Lordi would shoot this film just to prove that their show costumes can be scary (except when it's not). <br /> <br /> So the film is credible for the visual effects, I think the money had to go somewhere, but the rest is an awkward attempt by rock bands to make their pseudonyms on stage more frightening.
