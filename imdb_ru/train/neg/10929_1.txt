This film was the best Mormon film ever made. It made RM & Sons of Provo look like well-made films! It was supposed to be funny from what I was told. The best part was the best actor in the film - Travis Eberhard - if he had not been in the film, it probably would not have been done! He ruled! <br /> <br /> 10. It wasn’t funny 9. It was bit 8. There was a Thurl Big T Bailey in it, a character that didn’t make sense 7. It was made in Provo 6. It did not make fun of “Brokeback” 5 It was Larry H. Miller this 4. It was the first movie in which Clint Howard was not funny in 3. Gary Coleman chose the perfect movie 4, Return 2. They had to play on Surreal Life 1 auditions. It was made by Halestorm Entertainment !!
