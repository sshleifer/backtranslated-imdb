What is the point of creating sequels that have absolutely nothing to do with the original film? It makes no sense. That is why the continuation of the "Prom Night" is so embarrassingly bad. <br /> <br /> In the original film, a group of children hid a dark secret that ultimately kills them all, except one, in cruel revenge. Can someone explain to me what the dead prom queen, who rises from the grave to the steel crown, can do with the first film? In Prom Night 2 there were continuous plot holes that made the viewers constantly think about how this happened and why should this happen? But in the end, I think you could call it one of those films that are so bad that you end up laughing at it.
