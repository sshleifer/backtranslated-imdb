I will spend a few days devoted to Ron Howard before fully swearing in his work. Unfortunately, in dealing with Lucas at such a young age, Howard is now embraced by many of the features of Lucas. How else can you explain his frenzy of natural disasters? Of course, his only useful movie is Willow. Everything else, including this, is too dependent on surface debris. <br /> <br /> Some spoilers. <br /> <br /> He can't even have a semi-intellectual focus, like Peter Weir. No, poor Howard is so fascinated with his Spielberg fake qualities that he is quickly forgotten. <br /> <br /> Here we have an old adage: “love conquers all, even illness”. It is a pity that Howard Lynch has already gone through all the subtext with great skill. Hell, even Disney did better than that. Ron even loses opportunities presented by imaginary realities. <br /> <br /> Howard’s comment is terrible. Don't even rent a DVD. <br /> <br /> Final Analysis = = Cinematic hit
