I can hardly find the words to express how horrible this film is. I was sold under the promise of action with Segal and stealth planes, which are usually made for an entertaining action movie. I can honestly say that it is better to knock out your eyes with a cocktail stick than watch this movie again. The acting was so terrible that it was almost funny. The story was insanely weak, with plot holes so deep that F117 could fly through them. The script was so bad that if I had learned that a 10-year-old was writing it, I would not be surprised. Directing and production is so amateur that I would not even hire these people to shoot a wedding video of my worst enemy. Absolutely cardinal. Responsible for the creation of this film reduced the cost of art, and they should be ashamed of themselves. Stephen Seagal should never show his face in public again, I can’t imagine what made him agree to star in this worst film I’ve seen in my whole life.
