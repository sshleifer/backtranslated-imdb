I was lucky to watch this rubbish on Sky Cinema Max on a cold winter night. I'm not a big fan of horror movies, because most of them are just rubbish. This is even worse: this is one of the dumbest pieces of shit I've ever seen in my entire life. Horror? Yes, there are terrible things in it: the game of actors, the script and the special effects - Gosh, I laughed at this ridiculous attempt to make a film for 90 minutes. In fact, if it was a comic film, I would give it a 5. Don't even think about renting it if you don't want to laugh at the producers. <br /> <br /> Vote: 2 out of 10 did not vote because it made me laugh all the time ;-)
