I am an avid fan of horrible movies, all that is funny and funny is my game. So imagine my spirit, I went to a local rental store and found vampires against zombies. The name is just too entertaining, you know that no one in the world can do something like this, it just has to be bad. <br /> <br /> And boy, this is BAD After watching this horror movie, I literally was speechless. My friend and I sat outside, not saying a word to each other for a few minutes, we both thought about the future of our life after watching this movie. I broke a depressing silence with the words "... dude .... What?" Yes, I am a fascinating person. <br /> <br /> Here is a quick “street review” of The Plot; In the "WTF" it is not at all. Characters; No development, is forgotten. Music; Worse than porn. Vampires; Their vampires? Zombie; Their zombies? <br /> <br /> In the end; Honestly, everyone should watch this movie, so bad that I long to see it again. So do yourself a favor, look at it and get depressed.
