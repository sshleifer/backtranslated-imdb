A really amazing bunch of dads! <br /> <br /> Predictable, slow, soul-destroying, stunning film, in which it seems that cutting your own wrists with a rusty bread knife ... well, almost necessary. <br /> <br /> the acting skills are finished for a subtle dialogue, each scene is at least twice as long as necessary, the complex details of how this career or this career collapses are too boring and ordinary for words. The music would be good if you didnâ€™t have to sit down, but in fact, three good songs are not enough for the effort required to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie, I prayed God for narcolepsy or for someone to shoot me. <br /> <br /> Never, never, never.
