Bela Lugosi is a creepy mad scientist who uses orchids to care for brides to steal the essence of life for an elderly wife. The dwarf in this movie is hilarious! Many freaks, plus a lot of stuffing and no plot makes watching this movie a nightmare. I liked how all the parts eventually merged in the typical Hollywood style. The story never becomes interesting, and you feel helpless when you look. <br /> <br /> I usually pick up shots like this one, but this dwarf adds enough eeriness and entertainment to get another pair of points.
