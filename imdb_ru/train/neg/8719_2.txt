Well, I'm going with another film from industry B. It's sad enough to see some poorly made films, but I don't care if the film will be shot in industry B or C. Show some effort in your work. Characters are really bad. This act of the actor is not talking (surprise), but the plot is. As a friendly detachment, one can witness how two of their fellow soldiers have exterminated, and then continue, as if nothing had happened. I felt sick that the writer even added to the rest of the participants a scene in which they joke about how good the doctor's ass is. Give me a break.
