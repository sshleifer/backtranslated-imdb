The film is told after a remake of recent years, when the military install equipment for electronic surveillance in the desert, where attacks occurred in the first film. The crew was killed shortly before a group of soldiers on the exercises revealed that no one would be found. You can fill in the rest. <br /> <br /> This is a picture of salary everywhere. It seems there is no passion for anyone, anyone for the camera. This is a film that was made for money and nothing else. At some level it should have worked, it could have been a more terrible Southern consolation (where national guards attack some people in the swamps), but instead it is not something special. In many ways, you can blame the script, written incredibly partially by Wes Craven, who again and again hits the same old goals. Add to the confusion the fact that the direction is dim, and the sequence of sequences is not so shiny that it relieves any internal tension in any scene. <br /> <br /> This is not bad as such, but poorly done and boring. Let me express my feelings in context: the reason I watched this movie was because the local multiplex screwed up and launched this movie instead , so that the children clicked "The Last Mimzy", and I wanted to see what caused the cry (I mean, the films have a lot in common - he says with sarcasm). I am convinced that this film will only frighten those who love the latest Mimzy.
