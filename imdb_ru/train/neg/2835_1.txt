Dereks seemed to be struggling to find rolls for Beau after “10”. <br /> <br /> I worked in a Florida Keys Marine Park. Once the scenario “Ghosts cannot do this” circulated among the trainers in the “fish house” where they cooked food for dolphins. There was one scene where the dolphin supposedly suggests Beau (or Bo-dolphin), asking him to "go make eggs." While reading the script, we were -lauuughed -... <br /> <br /> We didn’t end up filming any part of this movie in our facility, even though our dolphins were in "The Big Blue!" > <br /> This was supposed to be very close to the end of Anthony Quinn's life. I hope that he had fun in this film, as he certainly did nothing for his legacy.
