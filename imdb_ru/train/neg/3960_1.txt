Hi, maybe because I'm not a theatrical major or a sophisticated movie viewer ... I think this film is “Boring” and “Dumb.” <br /> <br /> I made this film because of Charles Bronson the title ... but boy, what a waste of time ... just watch 2 guys sit in the vault and talk ... <br /> < br /> The movie on this DVD was so "DARK" ... hard to watch a movie damn ... I understand that this is a 1968 movie ... but they burn it to DVD, then they have to do some kind of digital remastering. <br /> <br /> Also, I was completely surprised to see these high marks on IMDb for this film ... as I said before, I’m not as tempted as other people who have commented on this film before.
