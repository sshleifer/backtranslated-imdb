The poorly written drama / mystery of the conspiracy about the possibility that AIDS was presented to the public by the government. Voshikha plays a gay researcher looking for answers - that in this hazy plot it will be difficult to find anyone. Despite the fact that the cinema itself deserves praise, the camera is eager for the characters of true depth, not shallow, an amateur who, unfortunately, should convey this. Rating: D +
