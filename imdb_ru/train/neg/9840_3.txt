Freakish, independent, theatrical, Christian Slater are all teasers that made me look forward to an hour or so, “discovering” the film's gem. Boy, I was disappointed. Julian Po never overcomes himself. The film is relentlessly shy. I was unable to suspend disbelief even for a moment. Exaggerated, obviously theatrical scenery, exaggerated, obviously theatrical actors, exaggerated, obviously theatrical performances - well, you understand. <br /> <br /> Allegories do not need to be delivered in the style of a sledgehammer. And for Julian Po, it's hard to feel anything, because we know little about him. Funny girlfriend, annoying townspeople, idiotic cleric, stupid children - why did someone, especially someone who has lifelong ambitions to get to the sea (Slater's character) decided to stay in such a gloomy place?
