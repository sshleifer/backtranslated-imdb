Happy Go Lovely - a waste of time and talent of everyone, including the audience. The lightness of the lines of the erroneous identity of the old and hat storyline is supremely excusable. Very few people watched these films for their stories. But, as a rule, interesting minor characters were present in the plots - not here. They usually had an interesting choreography and exciting dances and catchy songs. Not Happy, Go Fine. And Vera-Ellen as the main woman played the entire film as the second banana, desperately looking for a star to play it, and instead she was called to carry the film, and she could not do it. Scottish language was wasted. Usually automatically the ubiquitous Scottish whim is absent. The photo was pedestrian. Music numbers were pedestrian. Cesar Romero gives his usual professional performance, chewing the scenery, as no one played his role, as a producer, often written by Walter Abel and Adolph Mendju. David Niven is all right, and no one could do David Niven, like David Niven. After all, if you adore Niven as much as I do, then that is reason enough to spend 90 minutes on Happy Go Lovely. If not, skip this.
