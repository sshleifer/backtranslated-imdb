An exceptionally horrible story, which I can hardly convey in words. The best part of the film was when one of the murder victims was at the end, alive and well, only to be killed again. There is a possibility that I missed some important elements of the plot, since perhaps I was in a light coma at the time when this child was included. The box in which the film goes shows scenes that are not even in the film. I was lured by the rude images of torture in slavery and the promise of "Euro-trash, sexual horror." I have a feeling that it was a budget version, and about a quarter of the film was not taken into account. All good things are more than likely. I received the addition of PG-13, which had the same meaning as the end of the new film “Planet of the Apes”. Watch it with a friend and a bottle with difficulty. You will need it.
