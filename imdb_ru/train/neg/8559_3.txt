“It's as hard to love to describe, as exciting as how to make a relationship, like a drama, like with all, like pornographic scenes thrown out as during, like a good measure, as muddled as contro- like-versy and make us more like money and like things. ”- Ellen, a lost quote. <br /> <br />“ Kissing, like, on, like, into your mouth and stuff ”is like the best artistic work you have ever done. Watch, how Ellen's hairy hands, and how Chris masturbated, was like the height of my many years of experience watching movies and stuff.But before I start playing For example, to beat the new “USA-20-something” records with my likes, let me briefly list how the highlights of this visual feast are: <br /> <br /> 1. Chris does business with his genitals And not only that: the way the camera (so elegantly managed by Ellen and Patrick) rewards the viewer with a full-screen shot of Chris's thick white belly rubbish after he finishes a non-Catholic act - it was really exciting. I can honestly say that I have never seen such grace. Chris, you have to do more of these scenes in your next films, because this is exactly what we need, as a continuation of what this brilliant, brilliant man began, Lars von Trier and his Idiots 95. A quick w *** and then a hairy, fat, white belly: what else can any moviegoer ask for ?! Needless to say, I can sit all day and watch how Chris ejaculates (despite the fact that I'm straight) ... Such poetry is in motion. Such elegance, such style. No less than complete, divine inspiration entered into the filming of this sequence - plus a large number of Zen philosophy. Even Barbra Streisand could not become more spiritual than this. <br /> <br /> 2. Ellen's hairy, thick arms. Close-ups of shaky cameras, so skillfully photographed by our two directors (I cannot emphasize this), Ellen and Patrick, often caused confusion as to the correct identification of the sex in question. There were several scenes when we saw a part of the body (leg, arm, or foot), but often it was a guessing game: does this part of the body belong to a man or a woman? Naturally, Chris and his fellow artists, Ellen, Patrick, and WhatserName, put themselves on purpose, because their bodies were ideal for creating this gender confusion. Sometimes it was difficult to guess whether you see a woman’s or a man’s leg. Patrick is very thin and effeminate in her movements, so hairless and untouched, while Ellen and another girl are so strong, like her thick legs and arms. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> 3. Brilliant - especially the way that is neatly tied to the theme of changing roles between the sexes: so original and amazing. Ellen behaves like a man, wants sex all the time, and her former Patrick wants to talk like a girl. Spiffing <br /> <br /> 4. Ellen is looking for a left mate. "He must love the Simpsons, which is pretty left." I am glad that the creators of this film decided to break the long tradition of offering us smart leftists. Ellen is such a refreshing and realistic change. The number of likes that she and her liberal friends manage to pronounce in less than 80 minutes is truly phenomenal (3849, to be exact). They managed with minimal effort to really transfer their real incompetence to the big screen, and I applaud them for it. <br /> <br /> 5. Close-ups of toes. There are many things for foot-fetishists, which, in my opinion, is a very liberal and highly commendable way of communicating with sexual minorities. In the end, footwear and foot-fetishists offer so little in modern cinema, so it's nice to see that someone cares there. <br /> <br /> KOTM, or rather KLOTLMAS, offers more than it seems at first glance. This is not just a modest little film about small people entering into empty relationships, while at the same time indulging in meaningless conversations. No, it is much more than that. It is about the light that directs all foolish creatures; the guiding light that dominates the useless life of various pseudo-artistic imitators who have just dropped out of film school, and plan to attack our senses with the help of a dull fool who we hope will play well at such ambitious festivals like Sundance and Cannes, which will allow for them to gain the necessary insecurity, therefore, some real cash for change, with which they will later hire people like Sean Penn and George Clooney to advance the salvation of this planet and solve all politically FIR problems facing the world. What better way to do this than by porn from the start? <br /> <br /> If Chris and Ellen made a camera here, as clearly stated in the end credits, then who was holding the camera when the two of them were in front of her? They probably hired a few passers-by and put the camera in their hands ... <br /> <br /> Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8 and watch my “TV and movie theater: 150 worst cases”. Nepotism "list.
