... no one is watching a movie. My husband and I went to watch it last night. It's just a small theater, but there are usually a lot of people there. Not this time! My husband and I were the only people who watched Dragon Wars last night! Now we know why. <br /> <br /> This was one of the worst films I've ever seen. Yes, CG was good, but that was all. The game, the script and the dialogue, directing, editing, etc. They were terrible! Since we were alone in the room, we were free to speak during the film. So we talked about how bad it is, that it reminded us of the Mighty Rangers of the Power of Morphine, Godzilla, Death Combat, and The Lord of the Rings. As if we expected to see Rita and Lord Zed depicting the commanders of Sauron’s army. <br /> <br /> Creatures were ridiculous. You can't just imagine the legions of dinosaur / dragon / lizard things loaded with guns without giving a reason. The Lord of the Rings has a wide range of characters, but he introduces and develops them in 3 films, not in an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> Changes in the scene are terrible. I didn’t fall asleep during the movie, but although it was too simple a plot, I found myself lost in the holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> The characters were Caucasian Americans, but they spoke almost broken English. because of a poorly written script dialogue. <br /> <br /> The last scene that could pay off some value of the film ... failed. Ethan did not cry when Sarah died ... although, in any case, he did not know her for too long during THIS life. He did not look too upset to stay at Mordor, not knowing where he was or how to return. We could not, for the love of God, find out where he was and how he got there, but if he had not been upset, we too should not have been. <br /> <br /> Yes, and why is this dress that Sarah’s spirit wore the look that she borrowed from Queen Elizabeth? One more thing ... all 3 main characters were reincarnations that were returned to complete the work. Sarah completes her task and moves on to the afterlife. Jack does it too. Then why Ethan screwed up? He was left alone, without a girl, without a map / compass / helicopter to help him return. What should he do? Send smoke signals? And if he returns home, will he simply return to his work? He was supposed to get the same mercy to be killed from the film, like other heroes. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time and money on this movie. We stayed only until the end, because we paid for it, but as soon as the loans hit, we went out the door.
