This film is so bad that you can not imagine. The game is terrible, even worse than in third-class soap operas. It's a shame that this film was the most successful in the last 20 years in Switzerland. The interaction between the soldiers did not make any sense at all. This story could be extracted from the bravo-photo-story, the dialogues were as wooden as Treebeard, and the holes in the plot were larger than the black hole in the middle of our galaxy. But in our time it does not take much to satisfy the audience. The actors were beautiful, for example, the former Miss Switzerland, and the main character was even hanged (wow!), And, of course, there was a lot of drug addiction. This is a really cool person! Especially for teenagers 12 and 13 years old. But the media created an atmosphere in which you were not allowed to abandon the film because they manipulated the dynamics of the peer group, implicitly saying that you are a nerd if you disagree with other sheep and say yes. exactly as it was when I was in the army / this is exactly what I am going to do, when I have to go to the army ... for all the stupid actions that were related to drugs and composure. And do not think that I like the army. I was there and hated it, but this film is worse than cleaning a sticky toilet with a toothbrush (which I had to do because I hurt the lieutenant). It is not necessary that every movie was difficult. Sometimes you only want to have fun for a few hours and forget about the problems, and I think this is not bad. But this kind of films affect teenagers in many ways, showing them a cool lifestyle, which is really just stupid and turns them into brainless, ignorant and self-centered idiots. But since I now, when my opinion is not very popular, now I will be silent and recommend you to avoid this terrible fraud at any cost and for this, in order to save your wit! <br /> <br /> 2/10 <br /> <br /> (sorry for my bad english)
