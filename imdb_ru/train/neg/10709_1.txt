I can't figure out what to say about this movie. <br /> <br /> It was a terrible movie ... I can't even tell you why I decided to watch it. He had so few redemptive qualities that I don’t even know where to start. <br /> <br /> The plot has moved from the implausible to the completely absurd. My whole body was tense throughout the whole movie, because I could not wait for the terrible thing to end and end. By the end of the film, I felt that I felt much lighter. <br /> <br /> The editing was bad, the acting skills were below normal, and the storyline was weak. Francoise Robinson played the role of a Native American, although she doesn’t even closely resemble someone of Indian heritage. <br /> <br /> If the film is so idiotic, it must be ridiculously stupid - at least. It was not just a pity.
