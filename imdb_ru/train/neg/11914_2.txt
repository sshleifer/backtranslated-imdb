Shiri Appleby - the cutest embodiment of evil, turned a good girl in the clone of Buffy, El. But I am running ahead, you see, Lilith was the first woman created by God as a companion to Adam. But she got all the arrogant feminist, so God expelled her from Eden. The secret order, known as Fatah, captures her, but does not kill her, so now with amnesia (which is not well explained), Lilith (now Ell) is free to become the aforementioned Buffy clone, who must fight an insane scientist who received an injection of Lilith’s blood. <br /> <br /> If the previous paragraph sounded awfully confusing, it’s because it is. The film is also boring, general, and for a film with a plot imbued with theology, he does not seem to know about it. This lousy CGIed movie in the basement of the deal, obviously, was a bad show. All I can say about not being picked up is a stunning amen. <br /> <br /> My rating: D- <br /> <br /> Additional info on DVD: Comment by author / director Bill Platt and co-author Chris Regin; and gallery Stills; Examples of video effects: before and after (there is also an “also available” choice, which, as you THINK, will lead you to some trailers, but not on the DVD covers for other films, which is a silly idea) <br /> <br /> Additional information on DVD-ROM: final shooting scenario and decryption of deleted scenes in PDF format
