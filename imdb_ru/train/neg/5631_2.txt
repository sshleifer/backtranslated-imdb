The photo on the DVD is so dark that it seemed to me that the screen was dead. I think I missed watching half the movie. However, it was poorly processed and not interesting. I did not find the story associated with the name "Black Widow". I was hoping for a secret or a thriller, but I did not interfere enough to take care of the first few shots. I rented the film specifically for Willem Defoe, and I was sad that he wasted his talent. I do not believe that Jada Kolagrand studied the creation of films long enough to create a large motion picture. She is attractive and can turn into an actor, but she has taken on too many tasks in this film. Although they are married in real life, they lack chemistry on the screen. Their relationship did not seem believable. I do not understand why other characters were even introduced into the plot.
