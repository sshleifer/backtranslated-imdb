So, American Pie: Beta House is the 6th film from the American Pie series in the series. Although it really has nothing to do with the three original American cinema films, except that some characters must be associated with the characters in the original trilogy, and Eugene Levy in it (can't this guy get the best performances?) <Br This film has very few compliments. There are no funny jokes. It is painful to look at an acting game, especially at a girl with a “southern” accent, which is more like an imitation of a Canadian to a British woman who pretends to be a hooligan, using the word “you”. This movie makes me feel like such an idiot. Why I didn't go to college, where no one goes to classes (but everyone gets good grades), girls constantly take off their clothes in public, everyone has promiscuous sex without the burden of children and STIs, and you can ejaculate everywhere family photos of a girl without her attention ? Indeed, this series has dropped to the standards of erotica porn. Maybe for the next, they finally break down and hire Ron Jeremy as leader. I'm sure they can just tie it up with the show, making his character’s 3rd uncle Stifler once deleted or something like that.
