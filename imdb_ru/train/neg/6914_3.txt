I saw this movie some time ago (working on a trailer for a production company), and it was awful. Hewitt is mediocre at best, Hopkins speaks about his performance (but still amazes Hewitt in their scenes together), and Alec looks bored. Believe me: you should avoid this movie like the plague if it ever comes out. This seems to go on forever, as the weary conspiracy unfolds at the speed of a snail. This is inexorably unfunny, cinematography is trashy, and the direction is pedestrian. Alec Baldwin must go to film school if he plans to direct again. In terms of his actions, his character is absolutely unattractive, which makes it impossible to root for him. Dan Ackroyd is pretty funny, and the amazing jury lineup near the end of the film is good, but this film is just awful.
