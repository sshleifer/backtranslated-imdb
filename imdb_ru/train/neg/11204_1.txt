:: POTENTIAL SPOILERS :: <br /> <br /> Dude, this movie was terrible. Catholic / superstitious / unsure thriller, which has already passed well compared to previous films. <br /> <br /> Doubting priest. Sex and the priesthood. Politics and religion. Church hypocrisy. The plot involving the church. The dawn of a new evil age. All kinds of dark magic voodoo fight between good and evil. <br /> <br /> Pretty silly and lame with a weak storyline. The story revolves around two concepts: absolution, more commonly known as the Sacrament of anointing the sick - the last rights that a person can ask to cleanse their sins while on the verge of death; And excommunication, the act of cutting off a person from the Church. In essence, an excommunicated person cannot receive absolution. So does the Sin Eater, and I'll leave it at that. Add all the things I’ve already listed, and you’ll receive the Order. <br /> <br /> I found a sex scene with a priest interlaced with pictures of the Virgin Mary, rather insulting to Catholics. It also ends with Heath Ledger saying (I paraphrase): “I am a redeemer and a curse of sins, I live without love, blah blah blah,” as he walks along a dark alley with a long cloak Alla “The Matrix”. <Br /> <br /> I gave this film 1 for not only stupid and unoriginal, but also because he managed to insult all faith in this process. If you want to see something better, I suggest “Prophecy” with Christopher Walken.
