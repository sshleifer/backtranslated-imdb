This is one of the fun things in youth that is easy to fool with advertising. I spoke earlier about another film in which an advertisement for a (comedy) film makes it seem funnier than it actually is. Seeing an announcement of this in 1981, I thought it would be a wildly funny movie. What my brother and I, who went and saw it with me, did not know, is that the scene used in television advertising was the very last scene in the film! <br /> <br /> Since this scene is the end result of everything that happened before in the film, I can only guess that there was nothing more fun to use! The last scene, thanks to the youth potion, doctor. Fu Manchu is turning from a long, bearded old man into a bright young Asian / Elvis, like a rock star! (With backing vocalists no less!) <br /> <br /> Peter Sellers in the 1930s, without any particular reason, tries his best to cope with the material, but he has no valid reason for his “comedy” moments. The rest of the actors were just boring, and my brother and I sat the whole time, hardly laughing at anything. Naturally, we were expecting a comedy like The Pink Panther, Peter Sellers was so good at it. <br /> <br /> Sorry, this was his last movie before he died. His appearance on the Muppets was more entertaining than this ill-conceived failure. However, I do not blame him. I blame everyone else for not trying to make a better movie about it. 2 stars generously !!
