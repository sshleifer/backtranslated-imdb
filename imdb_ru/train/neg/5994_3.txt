OK, this movie could be so good! All generations have been exposed and loved by the Thunderbirds, and this film had some features that could be found in the good Thunderbirds movie. The craft itself and the island of Tracy were actually transferred to the big screen, while maintaining the design that we fell in love with. Sophia Miles was fantastic because Lady R and Bill Paxton, although not quite who I thought to be Jeff Tracy, were solid enough ... but then the adults were taken out of the equation, and we were asked to believe that 8-year-olds could fly on 200 ton machines. <br /> <br /> Not so much the fact that the film was dedicated to children made me feel like Jonathon Frakes beats me with wet fish and laughs at the money spent with difficulty in the film it was the fact that Alan Tracy was so unpleasant in the film, and he seemed to be able to control the machines just like his brothers ... who were at least 19/20. Seriously, these are some pretty darn simple machines that you can use if that is the case. <br /> <br /> It looks like the film didnâ€™t know if he wanted to be serious or prepared. He tried to pay homage during satirization, and he simply failed on his face. 3/10 (2 for cars, 1 for Lady P)
