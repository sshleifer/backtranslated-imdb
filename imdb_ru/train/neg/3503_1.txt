And when I watch Sarah Silverman, I get the same results. I love weird, disrespectful humor. BUT this woman is so damn b-o-r-i-n-g, annoying and deserves a yawn. She is also completely lacking anything at all funny. The unfortunate way in which she tries to deliver her lines is simply dead on arrival, because she is simply not funny. I watched two episodes of her program and was ready for Novocain. <br /> <br /> My God, my child (19 years old), saw her promo at Comedy Central and said that she was a "stupid chick." I thought it was a compliment. Where she says “Watch my show or I'll kill my dog” is actually believable. I know that she wants to become a comedian. It just looks like a perverted nut case. I just don't want to see her around my dog.
