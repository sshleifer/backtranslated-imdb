I remember I loved this movie when it came out. I was 12 years old, I had a Commodore 64, and I loved to play it on Rambo. Therefore, I was very excited when I managed to buy this film really cheap. I put it in a VCR and launched: â€œMan, this film is really bad! Sylvester Stallone speaks like 3 words in the whole film (except for this terrible sentimental speech at the end), and all the time has the same facial expression. And this stupid love thing in the middle is so amazingly predictable. I just moved the whole thing forward and went to exchange the film for something else.
