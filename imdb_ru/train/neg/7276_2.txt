You can call it a flop, and this is also very important! The quality is not related to the words “National Lampoon”, but at least the recordings of “Rest House” and “Animal House” were funny, but the proposal should be their most meaningless function to date I have ever seen. Ugh! The three-part story is madly trying to parody the clichés and stereotypes that have flooded Hollywood genre films, which turns out to be completely unfunny and boorish perch. <br /> <br /> “Grow yourself.” - Jason, a corporate lawyer, decides to quit his job and part with his wife so that they both can grow and do what they always wanted to do. This is life, as Jason sees it, and he looks after the children, but his decision to go this way may be wrong. <br /> <br /> Talking about lead is boring and tough. There is only real interest - a beautiful little Diane Lane game. The satirical element here seems to indicate something, rather than simply conveying it. Stupid humor is tense, flat and especially meaningless. Peter Rigert keeps him very cool in the title role, and Teresa Hanzel in her role. <br /> <br /> “Successors of Success” - after the end of the collage Dominic Corsair gets a job as a stripper and rapes with oil. Presidents of the dairy company. For payback, she begins to be interested in the margarine industry and actually makes her way to the “top” itself. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best of the three, but the competition was not too great. I want to become more subtle with his sexual and power-oriented tone, but still they feel more sticky and forced. The idea had something promising and inventive to develop it, but the languid stimulation begins to deplete by the end, and the disastrous dialogue does not allow it to be done in any form. Humor tries, but often does not fall off, despite the hunger. Seductively Ann Dusenberry is rather cold and manipulative in everything (well after a painful ordeal) and loves to gracefully expose all of this quite A bit. Even the meager stripper outfit seems to get a full workout for the first half of the story. Appear in funny background cameos from Dick Millar, Mary Voronov, Olympia Dukakis, Fred Willard, Robert Culp and favorite turn of Joe Spinell. <br /> <br /> “Municipalities” - the Killer series, which leaves copies of its driver’s license after each murder, is traced with enthusiasm by a naive police recruit and his old gray-haired partner. However, a young cop learns that being tough is the only way a couple faces one situation after another. <br /> <br /> stupid! Oh yeah. Of course, if you are going to fake something extremely excessive, make sure that the laughter flows from it. Obviously, they forgot it! Even in his 30 minutes of running, the boy pulls it! Robbie Benson’s terribly mocking performance became quite overbearing, as the weary Richard Widmark barely played the role of his partner. Christopher Lloyd emphasizes the role of a serial killer, but his eerily crooked and sympathetic performance works well and largely reveals other potential customers. Elisha Cook Jr., Ray Perlman and Harry Rems appear. When the jokes come, they really feel out of sync and become rather stale because of their repeated mockery of these police clichés. <br /> <br /> In general, the idiotic stuff permeated with his parodies seems one-time, and the unbearable scenario is mostly inept and stupid. Only one or two jokes understand each segment, but in fact there are too many cheap stinkers or simple slips that stick in your head. This is because it actually becomes what he is trying to play a trick on, and this is mainly manifested in every story. It loses sight. The performances range from hot to cold, but those who cannot deny the embarrassment that is felt on most of their faces. The first taste of the director Bob Giraldi - "crazy growth", but "Successful success" showed a slight success of moderate effectiveness. Henry Yaglom does the hardworking, exhausted work on the "municipalities". Bright coarse drawings of Rick Meyerowitz, opening the film, are carefully thought out and set the style and mood. <br /> <br /> This comedy with a low content of eyebrows overwhelms her, replaying her, with the main interest is her familiar cameos. But in reality, is it worth going through this putrid and restless awakening, just to notice them. Well, it is up to you.
