The Guardian is all about the soulless life of Hollywood and the sad lack of imagination present in many films these days. I canâ€™t think of any good things about it, everything is so universal, so factory-made and so lazily collected that it really exists only as a commercial about how to make money from an unsuspecting, unworthy public. <br /> <br /> The story that a secret service agent plans to kill Prez may well be interesting. If he copes with a good director or caring cast. Douglas is the one who is substituted. Basinger is the first lady with whom he has an affair (an undeveloped, unresolved plot plan). Sutherland is the best friend who considers himself guilty, because there would be no film if he had not done this. And longoria is nothing. A woman with the state of Maybelin and ... that's all. I assume that when entering the secret service the requirements for women are less. As usual in a film like this, the role of the president himself is nothing more than an instrument, a sign, and very poorly written. <br /> <br /> Clark Johnson, who gave us an equally pitiful special forces in 2003, the mechanical direction is devoid of any signature and has all the visual sophistication of a cheap television film. Douglas, Basinger and Sutherland look incredibly boring and make phone calls in their speeches from afar. Eva Longoria, the most nude woman of the 21st century, mainly only to attract the audience of "Desperate Housewives." Her role is 100% meaningless, and she does absolutely nothing to develop the plot or character development. She has barely two lines to rub each other. Truly a shameless marketing ploy. <br /> <br /> If you want punishment, do not let me stop you. But this time and money that you do not return.
