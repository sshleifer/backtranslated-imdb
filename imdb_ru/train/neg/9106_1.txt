From the very beginning of the scene, you will notice how hard they tried to imitate the very clever and powerful “Cruel Intentions”, and how far they landed. You will also notice what a terrible choice they made, choosing Robin Dunn as Valmont ... Then in the second scene you will meet two best things in this film: Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers as Catherine and her mother. That is, if you can get around the fact that Katherine was not the blonde in the first film ... Then the film continues, you see a cheap romantic story many miles ago, and you notice that Sebastian has already met Anette in the Past, here called Daniel, and Cecile, here called Cherie ... How original is this for a prequel. Then it turns into a low-budget film “Wild Things” with a lot of “oh-my” turns. As I said, Robin Dunn was a very bad choice. Not that he was a bad actor, he is a good one ... He just has no Ryan charisma. Amy Adams, who, in my opinion, is one of the most talented young actresses of our time, once again speaks. But with all the talent in the world, no one can save this garbage. In general, this "film" recalls the episode "Beverly Hills, 90210". The account was stolen from “Cruel Intentions” and “Jaws” ... Yes, they used the account from JAWBREAKER ... Could they at least leave it alone ?! You will want to go through this. If you want more cruel intentions, see Stephen Frears' Dangerous Liaisons.
