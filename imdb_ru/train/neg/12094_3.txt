This film involves the study of the nature of perversion. Some reviewers were forced to assume that, since the perversion is depicted, the film is psychologically profound; in fact, given the obscene material, it is surprisingly dull and shallow, without motivational material. Why is the main character the way she is? You will not learn from the script. For a better treatment of the same theme (and more interesting film), try Bunuel's Belle de Jour.
