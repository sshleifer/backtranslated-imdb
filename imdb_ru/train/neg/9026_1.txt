This should be one of the worst destinations I've seen. A close-up can be a very powerful shot, but when each scene consists only of close-ups, it loses all its influence. <br /> <br /> Tony Scott has some very beautiful landscapes, backgrounds of Mexico, cantines, a beautiful estate where Anthony Quinn lives, and dusty cities where Costner drives through revenge. Unfortunately, we only catch a glimpse of these places before the camera cuts off the image of a large giant head. Even the transition scenes, when Costner rides alone through Mexico, quickly turn into a close-up. <br /> <br /> Evaluation is too dramatic and intrusive, dictating every emotion we need to feel. The story itself should have been processed much better. Among other things, too many people appear out of nowhere to help Kostner - this is just a bad spelling. <br /> <br /> This is a typical thriller storyline, but many others used the same premise and did outstanding things with it. Costner “No Exit” had a somewhat similar storyline, but it was a much better movie. <br /> <br /> The ending was absolutely anti-climatic and suffered from the most melodramatic sound of the film. This film will never be great, but if we saw more of Mexico and fewer gigantic heads, this movie could be watched.
