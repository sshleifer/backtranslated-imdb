I have been an environmentalist for many years and have been looking forward to this show. I was set to record all the episodes, because I thought I could really learn some great new things. I could if I could get past Rachel. <br /> <br /> I am sure that a lot of this is done in order to appear as a reality show and attract viewers of this class. This does not work for someone who is truly interested in improving the planet. <br /> <br /> This show should be called Nugging with Rachel. <br /> <br /> Since Ed is a great source of information, maybe a second show that is really serious about the environment would be a good idea. Dodging things is not necessary for some of us. <br /> <br /> I no longer record episodes or watch a show, but Iâ€™m reporting if a real green show can be in the works.
