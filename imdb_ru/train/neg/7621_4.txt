As already noted, this formula was dropped several times, most recently as “You Receive Mail”, with Tom Hanks and Meg “Trout Pout” Ryan. Of the several versions this is my least favorite. The problem, I think, is that the studio adored the charisma of the Stars, which does not quite fit here. <br /> <br /> Chemistry between the two characters in this film never boil. There are no real sparks. Van Johnson and Judy Garland remind me of old donuts, nice but soft. And when it's boring, the rest of the film can follow. Judy, in particular, is disappointing. Looks like she has no neck! I don’t know if she had a problem with pain or anything else, but she’s like a turtle trying to push her head into her sink, all hunched up and all that. I could not understand that Van Johnson was so hot. I would make a bee line for this nice violinist. And Van was not great either. I have always considered him a rather typical Hollywood lead man, and he doesn’t do anything to dispel this image here. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the stars or the early 1900s, then you might like this movie. But there are a lot more interesting romantic comedies, and they offer you much more than just a stale delicacy.
