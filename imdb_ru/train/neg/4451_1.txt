This film was probably about as stupid as The Naked Gun (which was supposed to be). Case in point: <br /> <br /> 1. To fake it, the sinking Roberts secretly takes swimming lessons at the YWCA. After her "death", YWCA calls her husband at work to express his condolences. Hi, how did they get his work number? <br /> <br /> 2. Before leaving the city, she throws her wedding ring into the toilet. Days or even weeks later her hubby finds it in John. Does this mean that the toilet has never been flushed? <br /> <br /> 3. No explanation is given to how she pays for the care of mothers in a nursing home (because she did it behind her rich husbands). <br /> <br /> 4. At the end of this tedious film, Roberts suspects that her husband is in the house. Instead of running after her life, she runs to the kitchen to see if the banks are neatly folded.
