This somewhat suggests that most of the wonderful IMDb movie reviews are people who have watched only one movie in their entire career on IMDb, and, as you may have guessed, this movie is called Parasomnius. I often suspected suspiciously good reviews of IMDb that this is nothing more than good films, like backstage marketing, but in this case it seems rather transparent. <br /> <br /> It’s impossible to say that Parasomnia is terrible, but it’s far from a good or wonderful film that it could potentially be. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, he has a wonderful villain in Patrick Kilpatrick, who brilliantly copes with the design of terrible and evil deeds. I could easily see him play a really memorable villain on a par with Hannibal Lecter. There are some wonderful visual effects in dream episodes, in fact, if the film decided to explore this area more, it could have been something better. The actual concept of insidious hypnosis abuse is also great. <br /> <br /> Although I understand that the suspension of unbelief is necessary for immersion in any good story, it is a sign of a good story that allows you to do this. If you are annoyed by what you think is illogical or just plain silly, the story loses you, and that is what kept happening to me in this film. Other reviewers mentioned it here, and I don’t want to enter the spoiler area, but I will say that the installation at the final was particularly ridiculous and disappointing, not to mention the character’s different mental age, which only had to experience several years of life. <br /> <br /> In general, in devilishly abused hypnotism there is a germ of a great idea, but unfortunately this film cannot translate this into something special.
