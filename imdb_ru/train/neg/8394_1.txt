Allegedly, this is a horror movie DTV Z-grade. <br /> <br /> But with these lines: <br /> <br /> “It's easy to die, I have many times” <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br /> “Why are you are you reading this book? " “Because it makes the plot more interesting” <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br /> “You made your way here, now you can get out again!” (After he leads the person to the basement) < br /> <br /> (and listen to what they sing) <br /> <br /> - it’s not very clear what this film made in the era of poststructuralism is known for, in fact, or just its poor filmmaking. Acting is awful, but some actors I know, so what, they shoot them? <br /> <br /> An old house, apparently cut from a modern dwelling, is a place of murder. The (bad) movie is made at the bottom, and the story repeats again.
