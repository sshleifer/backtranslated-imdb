<br /> <br /> When I first started watching this movie last night at Cinemax, I was shocked that it was done. The brutal intentions, in my opinion, were one of the best teen-oriented films made over the years. In this prequel were some things incompatible with the original. (Sebastian's father married riches, then why does he have a rich aunt on Long Island?) <br /> <br /> Then I learned today that in reality it was not a new film, but rather a television series, Manchester Preparation. Hearing this, I realized that this is not the same as the film, just like Buffy, the vampire slayer, differs in form from the TV. <br /> <br /> I think that Roger Kamble most likely added the ending of this film, AFTER the show didn’t make Fox. It just seems that it will happen too quickly (Sebastian will become the male version of Catherine), and I just don’t know where they will go in the next episode, as this will not lead to the 1999 film (which is a newer ending directed straight away.) /> <br /> One thing I didn’t like was that he assumed that Sebastian and his father were married to wealth, which usually doesn’t look good in this area of ​​New York and mother Sinus Catarin was just an adult by her version, it does not appear that something done by a woman in her position, wives It is not a person of her social class. <br /> <br /> As a prequel, this is pretty lame. But I would be interested to see where it went as a series.
