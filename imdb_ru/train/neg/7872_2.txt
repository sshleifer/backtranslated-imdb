Anyone who wants to be an editor should watch this movie! It shows you every mistake you cannot make when editing a movie! My grandmother could have done better than that! But this is not the only reason why this film is really bad! (This is actually so bad that I cannot write a sentence without an exclamation mark!) If the first episode of Les Visiteurs was a pretty good family comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues, then this sequel badly copies the recipe of the first. Funny parts can be counted on the one hand, and maybe with half. Clavier overestimates her role even more than in the first part, Robin tries to act like Lemercier (because she replaces her), but this is “grotesque”. Lemercier is Lemercier, Robin is Robin! Even if Muriel Robin herself may be funny on stage, she’s not in this film because she doesn’t act like she did before. I know it must be difficult to replace someone who was good at the role (Lemercier received Cesar's award for the role in the first film), but she made a big mistake: instead of playing her role, she played Lemercier playing her role '! As for the story, this is too much! Of course, at the end of the first film, we knew that there would be a continuation, but Poiret and Clavier should try to write a simpler story, such as the first episode. Jokes are repeated, childish and deja vu. No, really, this is not more than 3 funny parts. The only good things are costumes and some special effects. So you only have 2 reasons to watch it: 1) if you want to learn how to edit a movie terribly, 2) if you want to waste your time or you really need a brainless moment ”! 2/10
