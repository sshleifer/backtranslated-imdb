While the original draws intelligence, this cheap remake is designed solely to shake the senses. Instead of intricate plot twists, this so-called thriller simply shows sudden and seemingly random changes in the history, which serve only to humiliate it even more with each bizarre development. Worst of all, the salt shaker turned over to the original sharp dialogue, full of unnecessary four-letter words, leaving behind a sharp but uninteresting taste. <br /> <br /> There was a promise - a broken promise. Admittedly, the prospect that Michael Kane will be able to complete the release of Catler and Sullivan, similar to Patty Herzog, is intriguing. Unfortunately, this brilliant and respected actor only tarnished his reputation by first taking on a role in this horribly rewritten nonsense, and then playing in a play that looks quite competent compared to amateur replay of Jude Law. > If you have not seen the classic original, do not pay attention to its outdated visual effects and stunts. Track it, watch it, and just enjoy the story with a half. As for the remake, pass on this insult to the original.
