This is Peter Falk's movie. Period. <br /> <br /> I was 10 years old when this film was released; At that time I was already a movie fan. Of course, neither my parents nor I had seen this film when it came out, but I was in love with the font of his advertisement and the aura that it was an Important film. Well, 34 years later, I finally saw the movie - I had never seen a single movie made by Cassavetis before. In general, he is a hacker. Zero sense of time editing. Jena's performance reminds me too much of Dustin Hoffman's work in Rain Man: technically on the same level, but completely on the same note. When Tom Cruise stole "Rain", Falk took the cake for this film. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed by the game of Gena, really everywhere - it seemed better suited for Awakenings (damn it!). This is not her fault: she is a basket from the first scene to the last. We will never know why? But the character of Falk seems real, and he perfectly performs Falk as a person with serious flaws. <br /> <br /> Shave at least an hour (an editor is needed!), and it would be an arrested portrait, and not a woman under the influence of a simple Cro-Magnon man enters into a fight with his wife who does not work, but cannot cope with his three children and long hours of work husband. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™d rather remember Cassavetes for The Dirty Dozen or Baby Rosemary. He would be the best director if he would cut his own tendency to excess - as he vividly demonstrates in this film. <br /> <br /> bob
