Hm ?? I agree with the reviewer, who said that "strange people with generous tastes review this film." I thought the film was intriguing enough to watch it. I think this is primarily because of Marsden and Speedman, and not because of the plot. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this film is slightly psychologically enticing, on the one hand, and deeply homophobic, on the other. Thumbs up on the first and triple down on the second. I am not sure that the film is intended to promote dialogue or spread fear and propaganda. <br /> <br /> I thought the game was mediocre. A lot of talk, which were about 90 degrees distorted reality. I continued to want to extract some meaning from the plot, but in the end it’s just a conversation with a madman (Speedman). I feel a little sorry for him (Speedman) because of his loss, but not quite. His loss is no more and, of course, less than the losses that are borne every day all over the world due to more significant reasons. <br /> <br /> Does the film reveal naivety about HIV / AIDS? Yes: this is the target audience. Is HIV a dark, mysterious, evil killer? What about his victims? The answer to both questions is NO. Neither HIV nor its victims have more or less evil intentions than lupus, multiple sclerosis, tuberculosis, hepatitis, cancer or their victims, for God's sake. Just because a disease is contagious does not make it either intentional or careless — or evil — it simply IS. <br /> <br /> Does this ignorance or risky risk justify? - no Should all people practice safe sex? - YES. Will safe sex save the world? - no Is safe sex real in all cases of love and passion between passionate and emotional people? ?? OF COURSE NOT. In what kind of world would we live if everyone followed the rules, no one ever risked, and sex was never spontaneous and passionate ??? Do I really ignore that the film is specifically about gay sex? ?? YES. HIV is spread through the exchange of blood or biological fluids between infected and uninfected people. Sex is not required to pass, gay or otherwise. <br /> <br /> I am always worried about the deliberate violence of one person over another. I actually thought the film really showed the absurd violent abduction, the captivity and intention of Tom towards Dan, and such insane violence happens every day. <br /> <br /> A stream of consciousness notes from the film: Tom is crazy. <br /> <br /> Why doesn't Dan ask “why,” not “what are you doing?” Conclusion: men who have sex with men get “AIDS.” Consequences: HIV = AIDS. Where was Tom's responsibility for intercourse? Why did Dan have to use a condom? "Maybe you took it down before pasting it ??" What are we talking about here? Was one of the parties unconscious? “Maybe she didn’t want to hear the truth,” are you kidding me? She is in heaven, and she is incredibly hurt by what she now knows about me, ”right? Is Dan's end of life if he has HIV? Of course not! Is that why the whole world is so homophobic? They think that gays are the cause of HIV, that they will pass it on to the rest of the world, and we will all die ?? Are you kidding me??? Are people really stupid enough to think that the reason for homosexuality ... is this a problem ??? We think so about the victims of tuberculosis? malaria? I see that Tom is injured due to the death of his wife, and he blames AIDS for this, but seriously? who is to blame? Sacrifice or virus? Are diseases really the responsibility of patients? (assuming they did not and did not seek to spread the disease). <br /> <br /> Of course, safe sex is necessary for a safe life, but it does not lead, does not fly, does not leave the house, non-living. Do we really want to blame the disease for the victims? Would safe sex between Tom and Dan prevent the final demise of Tom's wife? Perhaps, but not the sole responsibility of Dan. <br /> <br /> Tom is crazy. I mentioned this. <br /> <br /> Tom Denu: “maybe you get what you deserve” ?? COME ON! 24 days: cruel, naive and homophobic. <br /> <br /> Am I overreacting? May be. But I think that this film points out the fate of gays for their reckless and evil intentions towards the “direct world”, practicing unsafe sex when the level of homosexuals practicing safe sex is proportionate or better than that of heterosexuals. We all need to wake up and take HIV / AIDS seriously. HIV kills hundreds of thousands of direct Africans every year.
