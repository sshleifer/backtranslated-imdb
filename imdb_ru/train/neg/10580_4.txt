I saw it last week after taking a DVD on the cheap. I wanted to see it for ages, finding the plot scheme very intriguing. So my disappointment was great, to say the least. I thought the main actor was very flat. For this kind of role it took the same idea as Johnny Depp in The Ninth Gates (of which this is almost complete plagiarism), but I believe that television budgets do not always extend to such acting ability. <br /> <br /> I also thought that the direction was confusing and boring, serving only to remind me that Carpenter has not made a decent movie since "In the Mouth of Madness." As for the story - well, I was also disappointed! I do not think that this could meet my expectations, but I thought that the winnings and the explanation were bad, and how he finally received the film Anti-Climacter, to say the least. <br /> <br /> This was written by one of the main participants of AICN, and you can say that he really loves his movie, but I would like to get the best result from such a good initial premise. <br /> <br /> I took the DVD back to the store that same day!
