I bought bloodsuckers on ebay some time ago. I looked at the parts and thought it was too stupid to review again. Excessive amount of watery "blood" at the beginning is simply out of date, not to mention the sound of the wind. My friends and I made a film with a very low budget, and the effects still surpassed this crappy festival. <br /> <br /> With regard to the number of errors in this film, there are too many of them to be counted. I knew one of the actors - believe it or not, he was my THEATER teacher. HA! <br /> <br /> Final Verdict: Don't worry about this horror movie. <br /> <br /> 3 stars (out of a possible 73)
