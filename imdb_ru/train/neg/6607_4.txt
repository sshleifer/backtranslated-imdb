Not as bad as some do, although it seems to be a pity compared to the original. In my opinion, Amitabh was magnificent as the villain Babban Singh - try not to compare with Gabbar in the original, since they obviously do not go for the same effect. However, apart from some mediocre action scenes, the rest of the film has flaws. Character development was poor, and the development of the story was hopeless, with many loopholes and missing pieces of information that I would not have known if I had not read the back of the DVD case. The worst part of the film is the role of Nisha Kothari, especially this new guy named Prashant Raj. The niche is just annoying from the moment her lips first open. As for Prashant Raj - seriously, who is this guy? where is he from and why was he present at the film studio for anything other than to serve drinks? His acting abilities are zero, and he has the same tone, dialogue, and the right expression in every scene, be it action, comedy, or even a scene when someone just died. Ajay Devgan was average, at least his expressions changed, which is more than I can say for his companion error. In general, Aag RGV is worth a look at the solid work of Amitabha, as well as the very sexy Urmila Matondkar in a special appearance.
