Really bad continuation. Part 1 had a lot of funny moments - part 2 is just bad (boring) and is clearly created in order to squeeze money from the fans. <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Otto Waalx! <br /> <br /> The only slightly funny moment in the film is Helge Schneider, who seems to be excited about other characters. It's pretty easy to identify with him ... <br /> <br /> The script is careless / absent. The director must do everyone a favor and quit his job immediately. Acting is worse than playing in second grade. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is also terrible, but who can blame the filmmakers / sound producers who have worked with such a mediocre director?
