Is there a similarity between Ray Lawrence’s “Jindabyne” and his latest film “Lantana” ?? dead body and its consequences for already dysfunctional lives. But while Lantana offered some hope and resolution, Jindabyne left everything unresolved in a grim way that would leave most viewers unsatisfied, perhaps even deceived. <br /> <br /> The storyline - the aftermath of the discovery of a fisherman's corpse floating in a deaf river - is based on the story of Raymond Carver. It became part of the 1993 Robert Altman classic short cuts ensemble. Lawrence uses this topic to research and demonstrate relationships in a small, stressful Australian community. The film poses some moral questions: “Could you make the discovery of the dead body spoil your good weekend?” And more acutely for the Australians “Would it have any value if the dead person were aboriginal?” The game, especially Gabriel Byrne and Laura Linney, is commendable. And there are elements of mysticism, reinforced by haunting music, not much different from "Picnic in the Hanging Rock". <br /> <br /> If all this sounds like the basis for a good movie - be prepared for disappointment, the tempo is very slow and the killing is shown at the very beginning, thereby eliminating an element of mystery. And here we are left with these desert lives and an empty ending.
