I was so disappointed in this movie. I don’t know much about this story, so I couldn’t wait to see it played on the tape and learn a little about the story. With such a powerful true story and great actors, this seemed like an unmistakable combination. Well, somewhere their script failed. It was so scattered - is it a film about his childhood? his love life? his own disability? his speaking skills? his passion for the disabled? I'm sure there is a way to combine all these things into a good story, but this film was not that. I stayed cold, watching characters who were unpleasant not because of their disability, but because of their personality. Other minor issues: 1. Powerful soundtrack. These are the seventies - WE ARE GETTING IT ALREADY! 2. If he is such a phenomenal speaker, why don't we turn to something more than just a code snippet - and even mostly in montages?
