As far as I know, Largo Lebed was a famous Belgian comic (never read), telling about the adventures of a playboy, a kind of James Bond without a spy life! Therefore, when I had to choose a film for a 5-year-old child, I took it because the child was already a big fan of James Bond! <br /> <br /> But immediately after the opening credits, I had serious doubts: when American films offer an amazing start, is there no action and a violent sex scene ?? Then does the story get very complicated with financial movements? I thought I lost a child. <br /> <br /> But, strangely enough, he was caught by Largo and more than James Bond! <br /> <br /> Was it a great interpretation of Tomer Sisley? Difficult Largo relationship with his father? Numerous story in which friends are bad guys, bad guys are friends? Exotic places in Hong Kong, Yugoslavia? <br /> <br /> I don’t know, but he really cares about Largo (“Will he get up?), and we enjoyed our moment.
