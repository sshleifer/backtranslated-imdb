What an incomprehensible movie mess. Something about a cop who takes bullets from himself after he is shot and keeps them in a glass jar in his bathroom (and because of the size of the jar he was shot about fifty times) and a top secret guarded by five or six incompetent soldiers who for some reason are driving him to Mexico. Whether they were deliberately sent there or just really lost. And you will never hear another script include the word “moor”. Gary Busey will try out the role of Mel Gibson from "Deadly Weapons", and, although Busey is the acting actor, the script curses the entire movie to mediocrity. William Smith makes another move in the role of the Russian soldier, the same character he played in the "Red Dawn" a few years earlier. After playing biker weights for most of the 70s, it was nice to watch him expand his range by playing on communist heavyweights. Unfortunately, he will probably always be remembered best of all, like the guy Clint Eastwood beat up in the movie “Everything You Can.”
