I checked out this movie when it still had 6 votes, and he said like 7.2 or so, but seriously, this is a terrible movie. Let's deal with this. The first thing you will notice in this film is that it was filmed on a handheld digital camera owned by a freshman from a community college. The next thing you notice is that the actors, all friends of this freshman (he probably met them in the pub the night before. Thirdly, you will notice in the list that music editing is awful and they try to squeeze many songs in this the film, at intervals of 30 seconds ... also all the digital editing is done on the home PC of the first-year student mentioned ... perhaps using Windows Movie Maker. that I would not recommend this film to anyone I know, but I really sentenced writer and director to ensure that watch this movie in hell for all eternity.
