“Blank Check” is one of the worst films of the nineties. The plot is completely meaningless; his overtones of loneliness are pathetic. Do you really believe that a twelve-year-old boy, acting as a personal assistant to a millionaire, can achieve everything in this film, for example, buy a mansion for $ 300? Only the most gullible viewers will believe the concept, not to mention the basic price. Please respect your intellect and don't watch this horrible, horrible movie.
