I should have known that I had problems with Casper Van Diem as the main character. Words cannot describe, nor do they do justice to how terrible this film was. But please let me try to describe it: terrible actions, terrible dialogues, banal situations, and through all this you have the feeling that you are being forcefully fed with beliefs and propaganda from the Trinity Broadcasting Network. This is a weak attempt to show Hollywood that the film can be interesting and have a deep religious message. They failed miserably. It was clearly the worst movie I have seen in a long time.
