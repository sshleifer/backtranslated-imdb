I saw it recently, and I must say, I was touched by the factual basis of the story. However, "Holly" as a film did not work. However, I look forward to watching the documentary film produced by the producers who organized this project, because I think it will be a much more convincing work than this film. <br /> <br /> The international cast consisted of B-class actors, but their acting was appropriate, and I should especially mention the young actress who played Holly. This was her first film role, and she did a very good job, considering her the most difficult part. <br /> <br /> Ron Livingston was adequate, but soft, like Patrick, an American, eager to “save” Holly, but Chris Penn was good at this, in his last role. Unfortunately, despite my generally favorable opinion of Virginia Ledouen and Udo Kira, both of these actors were easily forgotten and did not do their best work in this film. <br /> <br /> I believe in the meaning and intentions of the film but I have to be fair, so I rate Holly 3 stars based on its shortcomings as a film. But I think the subject deserves serious consideration, and I am glad that the people who made this film also shot a documentary, which I hope will debut on the BBC and other TV channels.
