I understand that this is not BSG, and I can cope with slow shows if they are interesting, but I find myself completely uninterested and bored with this series. <br /> <br /> The formula for BSG seemed the following: Action + Adventure + Sci-Fi + Suspension + Mystery + Drama <br /> <br /> The formula for Caprica looks like this: Soft Drama + Mild Science Fiction <br / > <br /> It may be more interesting, but since episode 3 I can barely watch it. In fact, this is at the bottom of my list for viewing for a week. This is a sad state of affairs. The Syfi Channel really destroyed their lineup on Friday night. What happened to the glory days of SG1, Stargate Atlantis and BSG on Friday night? They had a good place there.
