Do not try to watch this terrible mini-series. This is a six-hour lesson, an incredible love triangle between three people who have absolutely no chemistry for each other. There is no warmth, no real passion, no real romance in this story. It's dry, boring, stretched and boring, as they come. And it does not even correspond to the expected level of technical skill. Take these six hours of your life and use them for something more worthwhile.
