Yesterday I shot it on DVD and did not understand that it was a “nature study” film, so I struggled to watch it for about an hour before I clicked the “Stop” button. <br /> <br /> Even when studying the character of Theme, I just could not get into this movie at all. Maybe I was in the mood for wanting to see something else, or maybe I had other expectations, but putting it aside, I tried my best to go on to finish watching, but gave up. The actors played their roles well, but the global combination did not come together to support my interest. The only interesting thing was that the sergeant’s pistol was stolen, and he hurried to buy another one, and the spray painted it black to make it a problem for the police. I think this film was supposed to be called "Who stole the sergeant's gun?" The scenes were well made, but having gathered them together, I again felt robbed for something connected to keep me in sight. <br /> <br /> Since I have not watched it, I would say that it makes sense to rent this film. .. may be. For me, it was a waste of time and effort watching. I will leave it up to you to try, but I would not recommend it.
