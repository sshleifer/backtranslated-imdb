-Can contain spoilers ... but believe me, this film spoils from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> I entered this film with high expectations. It was my fault. To date, I have put too much information in the record of Steve Carell. 40 year old virgin ... Little Miss Sunshine ... Office. And I also made a mistake by coming to IMDb and seeing a user rating of 7.5 before going to the movies. In the past, it has always been a very good predictor, but lately something has definitely not worked. The last time I felt embarrassed and in such a big pain in the cinema, when I watched “Blue Steel” in 1990. <br /> <br /> This click fumbled from start to finish. The script was a tasty material. Awful to write all around. "Love Killer"? "Love is an ability"? Whoever wrote this shit, he suffered from the same disease that hit American Beauty writers (authors) ... tried too much waaaaayyyyyy. The entire film was strewn with moments of “Triple Company”, such as a horrible and contrived scene in the soul. Or a meaningless / tangled aerobics scene. Or a horrible laundry scene. The moment you think that something serious and / or real is about to happen, they throw in one of these terrible moments. And this happens again and again. <br /> <br /> And what about the character of Karella? A guy meets some lame in a bookstore and suddenly falls in love? Let's face it. Their conversation sucks. Both of them should have said goodbye in a few minutes. Pay close attention to the initial conversation when you have the misfortune to watch this movie ... The character Carella is trying to say something completely random and not funny (I think the exact line was "this time when I was a child" .. that's all. seriously), but both laugh so much that coffee is about to spill out of their nose. The actors themselves looked as if they were hurt, wondering why they were forced to do what they were doing. <br /> <br /> Returning to IMDb ... you guys need to find a way to keep the film's advertising team outside of this site. I know that this is impossible, but, unfortunately, it is obvious that the first twenty or so ratings / reviews were published by 12-year-olds, or the lackeys taken in the studio. Check out the Family Stone rating ... if it's mid 5, then it should be 2 ... and it pushes.
