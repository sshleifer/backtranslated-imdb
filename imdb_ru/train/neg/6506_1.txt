If you are not a keen student of a film who should see everything, this film will not only be a waste of your time and money and a huge disappointment, but it will also make you angry incredibly. <br /> <br /> to be a story worth telling somewhere inside, but Hopkins decided to hide it and encode it under so many continuous chaotic layers, seemingly random audio-video-microparticles, causing the viewer's patience to run out through a very short time. <br /> <br /> Why would anyone, like Hopkins, choose such a heavy, most complex and highly unstable project, as anyone might guess, his first script, first score and third film. Maybe he played with it for a long time in his mind, until he became unrecognizable what he had become, even for himself. The result proves that he does not have enough experience or skills to achieve the desired result. <br /> <br /> Even the strangest films of Carpenter and Lynch, to name just two non-traditional filmmakers, had 90% greater consistency, 95% fewer characters and 99% more plot. <br /> <br /> Sir Anthony, you are targeting the stars, but unfortunately you missed a couple of light years. Please continue to act, in this department you are an incomparable giant, and no one should ask you more, even you yourself!
