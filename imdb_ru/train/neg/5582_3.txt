The 1960s were a time of change and awakening for most people. Social upheavals and unrest were common when people expressed their views. Racial tensions, politics, the Vietnam War, sexual promiscuity and drug use were all part of daily life and daily news. This film attempted to combine these historical aspects into an entertainment film, and to a large extent it succeeded. <br /> <br /> In this film, two families follow: one is white, one is black. During the first half of the film, the story follows each family on an equal basis through social and family struggles. Unfortunately, the second half of the film is almost devoted to the white family. Admittedly, there are more characters in this family, and the plot lines are mixed, but the racial aspects of this century are not given equal attention. <br /> <br /> In general, acting is well-made and historical. frames mixed with color and black and white original frames to give a documentary look to the film. The film is a work of art, but clips of famous historical personalities are used to define the timeline. <br /> <br /> I liked the film, but the situations were predictable, and the storyline was one-sided.
