If you want to be hurt or amused, or both, you may have to look elsewhere. LMOTP doesn’t even cause a lot of thought, except to rehash ordinary silly clichés. At the end of the second episode, I felt a little embarrassed because I was actually sitting in a made-up mess of a lame, harmless and antiseptic attempt at commenting and entertainment, which CBC usually gives off when creating. And once "ZOMG MUSLIMS IN RURAL CANADA ROFLMAO !!" the hype is not welcome, the show is likely to follow the cancellation, because it is so superficial, judging only by its merits. <br /> <br /> If you are not obsessed with the Muslim culture in the west and / or the smallest idiosyncrasies in this subject entertain me easily. I really do not understand how much LMOTP is a pleasure, besides satisfying the curiosity caused by the excitement. Other shows have better addressed the issue of cultural / ethnic dichotomy in Western multi-ethnic societies. LMOTP will never be among them in the field of entertainment or insights.
