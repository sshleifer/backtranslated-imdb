My family and I screened for the Underdog last night. And as bad as Underdog (my four year old loved it), Hot Rod makes it look like an Oscar worthy stuff. The only thing that could save this film was if Evel himself retired to hit Samberg in the face for shooting this film. I admit, however, that the soundtrack was good. I wasn't sure if the film was shot in the 80s, but most of the music came from Europe? Who knows. If I were you, I would take a pass. And just stay home and watch the test sample on your local TV station. Or, if you are absolutely not ready to watch it, people who are under the influence can enjoy it.
