Roy Rogers and the company are trying to get Syntown back to life - this is a ghost town that can develop if silver mining is successful. Andy Devine (like "Cookies") slaps around. Jane Frazee (in the role of Carol) loses some of her bitches because of Mr. Rogers â€™sharp eyes. Foy Willing and Riders of the Purple Sage (or is it singing?) For A.W.O.L. Bob Nolan and the sons of the pioneers. James Finlayson (from the films Laurel and Hardy) adds to the "farce" view of the "Grand Canyon Trail". A free floorboard provides a winning performance of comedy. Mule Mr. Devine kicks himself on the heels. There are energetic human notions, but the material is not grand. <br /> <br /> ** Grand Canyon Circuit (1948) William Whitney ~ Roy Rogers, Jane Frezy, Andy Devine
