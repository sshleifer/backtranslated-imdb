Unfortunately, IMDb does not allow me to judge the judges below 1. What a shame. This horrible movie is so bad that I really turned off this damn thing long before the final. There were some bright moments in the script, but the direction, editing, acting, sound quality and especially the delivery time on the line were so disgusting that they made the judges completely unbearable. <br /> <br /> The judges were advertised as a modern comic book day in western style, but in reality there was nothing of the kind. What is most like a dog's poop on the bottom of your shoes. You can try to pretend that this is good, but it just keeps stinking. <br /> <br /> Why video stores think it's normal to carry this kind of crap with constant gaps in audio and worse than high school acting is outside of me. We make films to see something better than what is shown on TV. But Judges are worse than the most miserable original of the SciFi Channel. I intend to demand my money back from the Hollywood video.
