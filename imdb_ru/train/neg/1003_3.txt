OK, I'm not Japanese. I know a little about Japanese culture and a little less about Japanese pop culture. In addition, I am Spaniard, I eat paella and I like black humor. <br /> <br /> Well, from this point of view I can comment on the film: I have no idea how pleasant it is for the Japanese audience, Mamoru Oshii is a pretty good director, despite the overly meticulous post-modern material in the style of the Talking Head, and even this was curious and for some reason interesting, and I am surprised that he came up with it. I am afraid that this may be one of those cases with a lost translation, but as a European viewer watching a film with overloaded English subtitles, I just thought it was terrible. The jokes seemed bad, the script was overcooked - I mean, give the public a break and shut up a little, damn it, the narrator - to such an extent that my head exploded due to excessive rushing talk and absurd actions. br /> <br /> However, I thought the animation was really cool. The idea is wonderful, and it is well used in these animation scenes. However, the candy ends as soon as the characters are left out to begin with an endless, not funny talk of still images. It just makes you want to transfer to the next scene of hysterical characters. <br /> <br /> I read that Mamoru Hosea actually plans a sequel for this. The idea was good, but terribly used. Maybe the second part will bring up the good parts of this first and actually make an interesting film, or maybe it will be more and more retell scenes. But damn it, if you thought the Talking head was dense, then the Amazing lives of fast-food givers will cause you to have a stroke. <br /> <br /> Of course, all these comments are based on the experience of someone from Europe. Perhaps it is completely useless for the Japanese, perhaps it was a really funny film, lost in cultural boundaries and translation. May be.
