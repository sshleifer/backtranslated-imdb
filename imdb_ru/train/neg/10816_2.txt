Oh what I needed, another 19th century film about England. Which is a lot like ordinary England, only football stadiums where no one attacks. In this picturesque setting with lords, ladies and other randomly chosen names, Charlotte Gainsburg walks aimlessly, like Jane Eyre, from this novel no one ever read willingly. in Mr. Rochesterâ€™s crib, where she is trying to teach a French girl to constantly look at an empty board. One day, Mr. Rochester (William Hurt on autopilot) returns to fall in love with Jane and all that, but there is still the question of his wife with cupcakes locked in the attic. Oops, this was not in the brochure. After some people were thrown around, and some carefully dismissed the fire (they probably rented the set), the film finally comes to an end. Everything looked really authentic, this is what I think. But again, no.
