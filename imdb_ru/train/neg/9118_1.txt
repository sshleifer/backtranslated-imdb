This is literally the worst film I've ever seen in my life. This may be the worst movie of all. Some films are so bad that they are good; this film is so bad that it passes by a pleasant camp and it just becomes awfully awful. This is anti-enantiodromy. We bought him with the intention of interrupting, and my whole family gathered around for a fun evening of clever remarks; instead, we sat in stunned silence, pitying poor Peter Sellers. <br /> <br /> This is worse than the revived Lord of the Rings. This is worse than the continuation of the Matrix. This is worse than Krull. It's worse than any Batman movie. <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances allow this film to approach ten feet from your television.
