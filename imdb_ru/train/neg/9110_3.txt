I watched this movie at 3 am at the time when I was usually very open when it came to movies. But still I think it was not good, this film was not good at all. There are many reasons for this. <br /> <br /> Acting is not so good, and from time to time the situations arising in it reminded me of the comedy “Chevrolet Chase” of the 90s. I mean, come on, for example, the situation with handcuffs and the poker situation among the servants ... This film was so clearly based on the first, and this is normal. But if I had not seen the first before I saw it, it would be terrible. As in the end, she came very suddenly, and I felt that I did not understand what had happened ... Sebastian changed very suddenly, and this film seems to have been created solely to explain number 1, and as if neither time , there was no effort to do something good. The score is the same as in the first one, and it is not at all like a film ... <br /> <br /> They had to cope with situations of great style and class, but they did not, and therefore this film turned out bad ...
