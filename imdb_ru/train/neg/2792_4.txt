STUDIO 666 (also known as “POSSESSED” in the UK) is another slasher that looks like a “right on DVD” movie. <br /> <br /> Although many movies from “straight to DVD” are fast STUDIO 666 is a sad failure. He is very slow or unintentionally cheerful in the sense that he is bad. <br /> <br /> At the time of writing each comment on the first page was a negative rating and negative feedback. Each of these people was hit on the head. <br /> <br /> Two people (at the time of writing) who wrote comments with a rating of 10 out of 10 should not be taken seriously. Obviously, they have seen several fraudulent films and have an even more limited understanding of horror. <br /> <br /> The only really positive thing I can say about this film is that it’s better than THE CHOKE and ONE OF THEM. two extremely mediocre fraudulent films that I wouldn't want my worst enemy to be! <br /> <br /> The plot of this film was supposed to be hundreds, if not thousands of times. The film has only a slight twist (and one that is poorly handled) to normal expectations. Depressed singer commits suicide. Soon, her spirit returns to seize one of her surviving friends. Mentioned obsessed friend kills. The rest of the story is really too fancy to summarize. You just have to see it yourself, provided that your interest, of course, has not faded away until the very disappearance. <br /> <br /> The acting role in the film is mostly very bad. The actress who played Dora was the exception to this. Her character was always interesting and seductive when she was on the screen. It helps to raise the film above similar modern efforts. Unfortunately, some of the lines that she was given to say were poorly written, to say the least, and thus prevented her from saving the film. <br /> <br /> Direction was equally bad. The villains did not seem a bit threatening, each murder was completely devoid of tension or tension, there was no atmosphere, and camera work was incredibly simple. Some of the special effects (if you can call it that) reminded me of the GHOST STORIES series. Unfortunately for the producers of this film, GHOST STORIES created intellectually written scripts, believable performances and made great use of camera angles. Perhaps, if the producers carefully watched this series, they would have chosen a few tricks that could save this reason for the film! <br /> <br /> The music is completely out of tune with the film. This is just rock music and not the best examples of this type. Do not start me with this terrible song, played at the very beginning! <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the film, especially the dialogues, are unintentionally funny. Unfortunately, they are not funny enough to move the film up (or should be down) to the level “so bad, that’s good.” <br /> <br /> In general, STUDIO 666 is a regular mediocre slasher with a very small noteworthy value. Aspects. I recommend this only to those who are fans of movies on DVD and wants to see every slasher made.
