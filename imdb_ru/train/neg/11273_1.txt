How can you collect this respectable cast of young British actors and come up with such a bunch of film? Horrible script, annoyingly restless camera, badly edited, badly bad. Only Rhys Ifans tries to fill his role with life. Another painful evidence that the “other” sometimes equals the “sunken one.” Why money people do not read scripts in advance? Do yourself a favor: take care of yourself and do something else - for example, by hitting your knees with a hammer. It is less painful and more fun than this movie!
