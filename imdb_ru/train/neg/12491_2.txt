Hectometer While a pleasant movie punches plot holes, points to violent acting, primitive (at best) special effects (because of which I watched this movie three times in the last six years), “Torn” is among the worst i have ever seen seen. I’m never sure who the main characters are, all I know is that the killer is using a portable guillotine, as seen on the kill scene on the dance floor. In general, I don’t really like the film, because only the first 30 minutes are pleasant, and the rest is a mess of confusing dialogues and images that cannot bring the story to a logical conclusion (which I still can’t remember)).
