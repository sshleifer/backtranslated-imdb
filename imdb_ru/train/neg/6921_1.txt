I previewed this movie and was shocked how stupid it was. It was a combination of every horror / thriller clich√© trying to comment on a lot of things, including pedophilia, worship of Satan, secret police, affairs, religion ... and it was a mess. the action was a pretty washboard; with the baby and the dude Jesus everything was all right, but apart from them ... In any case. I admire the efforts (although not entirely successful) of trying to show Christians differently ... even though they did it, the way it presented the Gospel was a bit boring and childish. But then again, maybe it should be, since he was talking to a small child ... no. in fact, I decided that everything around was bad. music ... oh god ... awful ... too dramatic. Good. I felt bad for the people who made this movie at the premiere; It seemed like a bad student project. I'm going to stop ranting about it now and say that in the end, watch this movie if you want to spend an hour and fifty minutes of your life on nonsense. here you are
