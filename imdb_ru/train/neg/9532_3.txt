So this guy named George is sitting at home alone on his birthday when two women appear. George's wife is in the hospital, taking care of his son, so when his wife is absent, George gets into the bubble bath and makes love to both girls. This is not a good scene, because it shows nothing. After that, the birthday boy wakes up the next morning, and the girls are still in his house. They make him a good breakfast, but George is not hungry. George is not very happy, and he is trying to leave them, but when he returns home, the girls are still in his house. The girls are fed up with old George, and they no longer want to cook for them. They both turn out to be the main psychopaths and use George in his little crazy game. I liked the girls just did what they wanted and ruined George's house. George was not very good for his two guests. When George said he was married, he really did not mean it. George looked like Tom Tucker to Griffin. I was for two girls all the time.
