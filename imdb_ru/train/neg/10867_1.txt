This is a film that makes you say 2 things ... 1) I can do much better than this (acting, writing and directing) 2) this is so bad, I have to leave a comment and warn others ... <br /> <br /> Looks like it was filmed with my flip video. I too believe that my friend who told me to watch this has a vendetta against me. I noticed that there are some positive posts for this home video; It must have been left by members of the film crew or people related to this film. One of the worst 3 movies I've ever seen. I hope the writers and the director will leave the business. not even talented enough to make advertising !!!!!
