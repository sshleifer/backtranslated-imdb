Adrianna, should really get a life - without Mr. Brady. She makes me sick, and this was one of the main reasons why I know more to tune in to the show. This is a pretty brainless show, and every little argument or disagreement seems to fall into the box and is analyzed to death. It makes them look / appear like they are not ready for marriage at all, and yet, I know that all these differences are part of life. I think for some it is entertainment. If this happens next season, I will feel sorry for those who have nothing to do with their lives, except to look at this garbage. Although I would not be terribly surprised. can no longer tolerate the advertisement of this show! I hope they get enough money to constantly embarrass themselves in front of the camera every week. Nevertheless, the girl "A" has a damn good ass!
