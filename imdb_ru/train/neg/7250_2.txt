After reading other reviews of this film, I came to the conclusion that the high scores were probably paid studio attendants, since the film I saw was absolutely terrible, with a wooden game, a boring script and predictable directing, one of the few advantages, Be stunning scenery, as this film has some stunning scenery with stunning vistas, dramatic skies and wide open prairies, unfortunately, when the most memorable thing in the film is the role depicted behind the actors, it must be a warning sign about the quality of the film, in general, a completely inspirational addition to the western genre, which is best avoided even at a very reasonable price, which can be obtained on DVD.
