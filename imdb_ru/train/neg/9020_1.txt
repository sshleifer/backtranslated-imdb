I mistakenly did not sleep last night, watching this thing. The only thing I can say good about this terrible film is that it can be used by film schools to show how not to shoot a film. There is no proper character development, wait, I'm not even sure that they were characters. The settings were simple and meaningless, and excessive use of split screens was wasted because sometimes they could not even synchronize with alternative snapshots. If I could give it a score of zero or minus, I would. Unfortunately, it is not even worth the time for a few laughs. <br /> <br /> This is just a sad example of how Hollywood is wasting money, and now I spend my time even thinking about it.
