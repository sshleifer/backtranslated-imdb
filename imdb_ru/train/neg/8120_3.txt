At least among those films with 100 voices and more. Nominated for the best script written directly for the screen? Brenda Bletin nominated for the best female lead role ?? Nominated for the best picture ?? I always disagree with many of the Oscar elections, but this film may well be the worst film of all time, which was marked by the Academy. The letter and the action were both terrible. In particular, Bletin’s performance was one of the worst I've ever seen, and probably the most overrated acting performance of all time. A terrible movie, not worthy of a big screen and worthy of any cable or television channel that ever played it, including HBO (where I saw it). I am only grateful that I didn’t actually pay to watch one of the most overvalued films of all time.
