Oh my god, this is one of the worst films I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot, I'm a student of the film. I do not understand why Angelina Jolie was in this film? Does she really need money? I love AJ and saw almost everything she ever had, so I watched these 2 tick another one. It was so bad! not even bad bad, just bad bad This one had 1 or 2 funny little moments, but on the whole it was bad and wasting 101 minutes. I can't even say that AJ looked good, because it's good that she didn't do that. The plot is predictable, unless you expect Romeo and Juliet to retell, then it is not. Everything around is disappointing. Maybe if you're 12, it could be a good movie, otherwise I really would not recommend it.
