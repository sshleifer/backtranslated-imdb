Oh, not a very good slasher. The so-called acting, effects, decent, but familiar and not inventive soundtrack. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film there are three deaths in a row, which creates a pretty good scene in which everything seems to go. In addition, many characters wander around, not understanding what is happening, or chasing red herring; kills time more than people. There are other deaths, and the killer is a killer with equal opportunities, not involved in any of the guns. The killer also likes to expose other people to kill innocent people. Identity is not revealed until the end, and the motive is rather subtle, and we really do not care. <br /> <br /> Presumably, the film takes place on Christmas Eve, but this is not the main factor. One scene is lit up with Christmas lights, that's all. <br /> <br /> In most cases, the film is rather dark with a muddy picture, at least in the video I was watching. Some dialogs are a bit lost in some of the opening scenes. The ending was supposed to be stronger than it was. We think we understand what happened, although there is a chance that something else has done.
