College student Alex Gardner (Nicolas Chelozzi) suffers from nightmares living in the basement of a ghoul in Alcatraz. He wants to cut off his own hand, spit out a worm, ghoul open his chest and fry over an open fire. After his friends saw him rise 6 feet above his bed, a useful teacher obsessed with the occult (Donna Denton) invites them to enter Alcatraz to counter his fears. Of course, they go in the middle of the night when nobody is there to help when things get out of control! <br /> <br /> The band finds itself in a quandary, Alex’s brother Richard (Tom Reilly) becomes obsessed and starts killing everyone, Tony Basil of fame “Mickey” appears as the useful ghost of Sammy Mitchell, the lead singer of Bodybag. She teaches Alex how to levitate from his body, and performs a dance of rock music with repetitive scenes of nightmares to clarify the time of the run. All the victims appear as ghosts-sorcerers in the spirit of the character Griffin Dunn in the American Revolution in London. The script is full of holes in the plot, funny dialogues and unsuccessful attempts at comedy. Good work in forex and excellent initial loans (both Ernest D. Farino) are the only things that deserve some merit. Vasily and Devo ("Whip It") perform several songs on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 10
