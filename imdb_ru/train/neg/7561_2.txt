Anyone who did not know about the original British lion film of 1973 “The Wicker Man” would undoubtedly have left the impression of “Poor” and “Peyri” in the cinema. <br /> <br /> As a devotee of the original, I left with the impression of "Purely poor." <br /> <br /> Of the gloomy reality, inbred stalkers, attracting the power of law and order to the web of a pagan barbaric ritual on a remote Scottish island called Summers (original), are the closest colony to Mama in the US state named Summersil , the remake hardly got to the point. <br /> <br /> This, unfortunately, is the case of what “could” be a classic remake of the classics being forged to serve the simple-minded public. NO MORE NO LESS. <br /> <br /> Gentlemen (or considering the reworked film context) The participating ladies ... hang their heads in shame.
