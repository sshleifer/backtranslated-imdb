I hate air crash movies ... ALL of them! In fact, I hate them all with passion! First, they are cheap and have no skill! Secondly, they insult the aviation industry and tell viewers that all airplanes are doing ... CHOOSE THE SKY AND HAVE GOT IT! <br /> <br /> Why am I frowning from such a movie? This can happen to any of us and with worse consequences than those who suffered from the characters in this movie ... which is the only frightening aspect of the plane crash like this one. I hate this film because it looks like all 50,000,000 chaos films with stupid planes before it! Freefall, like everyone else, is nothing but boredom before dramatic scenes with shaded nonsense are played out. <br /> <br /> Firstly, in this flying death trap we have the same delay: a family of three Cleavers, a yuppie bastard and a bitch stewardess with a big blonde hairstyle 1987. scolds anyone who is least scared! <br /> <br /> My second point is that this should not be a full-length film, but a documentary explaining everything about the Air Canada incident "Gimbli Glider", which is called "Freefall," up to precautions. <br /> <br /> My third and last point applies to all films of an airline of this caliber (with the exception of Fearless). What the hell did the male manager tell the passengers to take off their shoes there? (I could understand high heels and sharp, loose objects, but come on!) As if that would make them much safer than they are now! This plane, if they (passengers) did not know anything better: they knew that they were going to break the ground. Why do you force 100 injured people to descend from a rubber slide, which can lead to the fact that the skin exfoliates and bleeds when struck, only if they walk in their stockings on the field of garbage! Does it make any sense to anyone? <br /> <br /> Fearless and hit TV series ABC "Lost" had more depth and realism for an air crash than just "aircraft malfunction - people-panic-stewards turn into assholes - lands without wheels" in the field people wander without shoes , jackets, etc. Same old crap from the 1975 Airport! Free Fall was so typical of the movie about the crash that I almost expect to see Charlton Heston or Peter Graves burst into the damn passenger cabin at any moment. Can we at least see how these poorly acting characters return to normal life, instead of rejoicing in the people against the background of the impending tragedy that comes before them? The typical moron film "Lifetime"! Cheap and stupid! <br /> <br /> The Free Fall director should stick to cheap films for white middle-aged women with silly teenage children who use drugs and have problems in marriage. As for the suspense ... leave it to the professionals ... you hack! Why we have to spend more than an hour and a half The airport imitates paraphrasing. I hope they no longer make films about the crash of planes. If it looked like the ABC series "Lost", then there would be something to see. But this is complete nonsense, and then some more. Enough to turn every movie about the crash on a plane into “Airport 1975”! This is not “Airport”, it is a cheap, miserable waste of my time. I would not recommend this film or any film made on air for aviation to anyone, even my worst enemies.
