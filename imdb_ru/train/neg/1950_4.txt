I grew up with Scooby (like repeats, where are you). I hate slovenly people, I love Daphne and I feel that she is not complete with the whole gang. But it's sad, Scooby-Doo is a comedy to solve mysteries - not bad for spy Japanese anime. I like "what's new," they had to give Daphne, a dangerously-prone, make-up :( and try to lose jokes about sex with drugs for many generations, but this is the “clue” - Scooby’s name is attached. do something bad punk with the theme of the song. Now I will go watch my DVD from Scooby-Doo, where you can wash the dirt from this new series from my eyes
