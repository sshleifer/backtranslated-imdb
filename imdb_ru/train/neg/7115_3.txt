Okay, so the introduction, with its insane offer of a free coffin for everyone who dies of fright during the film, is so lame that it's funny. So, the first "scene of the skull" is so stretched and gloomy that it is ridiculous. The actual plot of the film is somewhat decent, there is at least some genuine food for thought in the characters' behavior, and the plot twist is decent as the horrors go. The game is average, not very bad. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is not exactly the same as 1/10. It's not terrible enough to get the lowest rating or even the second lowest. If I only read the script, I would say that this film has a decent film. Just a horrible direction and production destroys the film. So this is a bad movie, but there are worse ones.
