There are a few things wrong with this film - the character of Brenda Song, who is one of them. I do not believe that the girl - a lousy actor, to be honest, no. I think she’s given bad lines. She just has to be “this conceited, rich girl,” and although in the TV shows she plays in, it's funny, but here I don't even have a dry laugh. <br /> <br /> Either way, I really should have known what to expect when I sat down to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> The film was not that awful ... originally. Wendy's reaction to Schoen was completely natural. I mean, how would you feel if a person claiming to be a reincarnated monk, pursued you, ordering you to wear a medallion and insisting that you are needed to fight the "great evil" and save the world? Which brings me to another moment. I know that this film is completely fictional, but it still has a foundation in Chinese culture. It seems that all the “warriors” in the Wendy family were women. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I doubt the monks would be fine with that. Of course, perhaps they could somehow work it out, but they did not offer any explanation. In doing so, they simply contributed to the many foolish attempts at women's empowerment made by Hollywood and the media. <br /> <br /> But never mind this, let's continue. <br /> <br /> Wendy's character becomes more unbearable as the film continues. Yes, she is a teenager, and she is close to returning home - I mean, who wants to fight evil during her return home? The problem is that when “evil” begins to show itself, Wendy does not look as scared as he should. She is extremely casual - even for people like her. She continues not to worry about her preparation. I will use this conversation as an example, Shen: "If you do not win this battle, evil will prevail, and all good things will disappear." Wendy: "Wow, let's talk about pressure. Well ... let's talk about something else." Yes, come on Wendy. Let's also dance when you should exercise rightfully. Of course, Shen allows her, but his character has an excuse. It is better that he cooperated with her than with him, and she did not train at all, and killed them both. <br /> <br /> Oh, if we talk about this. Shen also told Wendy that he was destined to die for her in battle, as he did for her great-grandmother (I guess this is a part). <br /> <br /> This makes Wendy's actions more unforgivable. <br /> As the screenwriter would say, Wendy’s homecoming and this “great battle” take place on the same day. Do you know what Wendy is doing? Do you even have to guess? Yes, she ends up going into battle, because when she tries to go home, the monks (whom Shen locked in the body of her trainer and teachers, because she "felt weird fighting the old man"), tell her that Shen went on the battle alone, so she goes to save him. <br /> <br /> At first we see some decent fights that are really interesting. Until finally, the great evil will not leave the body of rival Wendy and create his true incarnation from the fragments of the bodies of his ancient warriors. <br /> <br /> Do not ask. <br /> <br /> In any case, Wendy panics. Then Shen goes and protects her from this guy - forgive me for having forgotten his long Chinese name - and manages to kill herself. <br /> <br /> Wendy catches Schen when he makes his long descent due to being awkwardly pushed in height. air. <br /> <br /> She calls out the title of the article in question. <br /> <br /> Now ... it was bad enough that Wendy was strong enough, too fast. No, I will not allow this to be justified, because it was her “fate” and she had “power” inside her. <br /> <br /> Since when did she learn to treat? No, the worst ... since when could she resurrect people? So Shen rose from the dead. Then Wendy and he fight the guy. <br /> <br /> He easily loses the way. Worst of all, when they jump together and kick him at the same time, and he is banished forever. Then the monks praised Wendy for her sacrifice. <br /> <br /> Two things, # 1: don't the screenwriter and director know that the battle needs a little more “dexterity”? # 2: What is the sacrifice? That she did not go back home? Because the girl did not sweat, and did not even bleed. I mean, come on now, this movie was a TV PG, I wanted to see someone suffer. <br /> <br /> Ahhh ... next. <br /> <br /> I know it sounds like I should have given the movie alone, based on my comments. You should know that part of the criticism destroys things. You do not necessarily try to look for the bad, but if it is, you attract attention to it. There is a lot of bad in this movie, but something funny happens when you never expect something to be too great. <br /> <br /> So, I guess everything was fine. It’s not that I didn’t say that this isn’t true, I wouldn’t stop anyone from looking.
