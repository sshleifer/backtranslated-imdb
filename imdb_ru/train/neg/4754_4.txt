I loved the original. It was brilliant and always will be. Strange though, in fact, I was looking forward to see a remake. I am usually a bit against rework, because there are too many of them, but it somehow intrigued me. I really enjoyed it from the start. Kane is great, as usual, and Jude Law manages to keep close to him. It was pretty clever how it was modernized, and it worked. What prevents to be really good is the last seven minutes. It completely goes away from the original, so in fact it stops being smart and just annoying. The end of the original was fantastic! So much tension was growing, and it was incredibly clever! It? He is growing not in suspense, but in despair, because it seemed that they decided to make the character Kane homosexual. It would be if they tried very hard to be different. And then ... BANG! The law is dead. Roll Credits. This film is worth watching just for the performances, but those last seven minutes really drag it out. What a pity....
