If you have not seen this yet, I say: just go, take a walk in the park, do not waste time. Neither the script nor the action is worth your money. * Spoilers * - I can't decide which was worse: the movie itself or Baldwin's hairstyle? Ellen Pompeo's acting talent is very dubious, I hope that she can improve it over time. The storyline is just incredible. The free gun of an American policeman fighting offenders in Europe alone ?? The notorious Slavic mafia are protected only by two goats ??? Emotional art teacher, leading a ruthless gang ??? Spanish policeman dumber than a bag of hammers ??? Give me a break. However, there is only one good thing about this film: at least, production costs should be lower than Ocean 12, which was as meaningless and excessive as this one.
