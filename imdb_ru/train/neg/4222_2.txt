For those of us who lived during those weeks of filming in the city and around the valley, so as not to forget the tiresome days of road closures and “filmmaking”. As a reminder to those who live here - in places such as Boulder Creek, Bonnie Dun, Davenport, the Great Pool. etc. The bank was the fire department of the Armed Forces; The chase scene included "Lunar Passage from Highway 236", "Empire Rank" and "Highway No. 1." Production: Jeffrey Jones was the most affordable, Matt Broderick was above us all - even then. As far as the film goes - the joke of the script and even more laughter regarding the acting and plot - but who cares at this level. A good time capsule for those who love our landscapes of the coast and valleys. <br /> <br /> Additional notes; Bar Joe (Jed's Tavern in the film), the original name of the film was “Welcome to Buzzot” - Old Erba’s parking lot was a town square, backyard shooting was from Grove Street in Boulder Creek; Turn off your mindset and look at several actors in their early days.
