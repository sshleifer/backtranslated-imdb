A friend told me about John Fante last summer after we talked about Charles Bukowski. I did not know that Fante was Bukovsky’s favorite writer — a writer with a similar bias and humor, with the exception of one generation earlier. Ask for the Dust was Fante's first book I read, and it remains one of my favorite novels. The novel was a brilliant work of writing about a sad, frightened young writer, presenting himself and the outside world as a self-confident, skillfully talented author who had no idea how to write about real world events about which he did not have. In the novel, the main character is a virgin, who has no idea how to win the mercies of women, about whom he desperately wants to write in magazines. The story of his strange relationship with Camilla, how he agrees to his first sexual experience with a “wounded” fan, and how he ultimately remains only with the story of his failed attempts at love, bites and is real, without a touching Hollywood ending. The adaptation of the film for some time remains a faithful book, but falls into the cinematic trap of love, permeating racism, illness and death. The essence of this story is that Bandini is a jerk, and Camilla is going crazy, and their love has never been and never will be real, no matter how much they wanted to find her in each other. This film ripped out the real meaning of this story and replaced it with shlok. I cannot believe that the person who wrote Chinatown could read this book and make a film about her that was so wrong.
