Seriously, the only good thing about this year’s ceremony is the winners. <br /> <br /> Although the ceremony itself was rather short, it was still somewhat boring. I think it's time to seriously look for a new director and producers for the show who can come up with something really new. Obviously, they tried to make the show more “fashionable” and attractive for a younger audience this year, allowing Beyoncé to perform and letting P. Diddy and Prince introduce the category. Also allowing Chris Rock to be the lead was an attempt to update the ceremony and make it more attractive. Nothing came of it. <br /> <br /> Of course, Chris Rock is a funny guy, but he wasn’t a good lead. I really just saw him as a guy who occasionally talked between different categories. His presence was not really as “big” as, for example, Billy Crystal. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the award giving was pretty dumb. Not allowing everyone to come on stage, but it was strange to present some awards in the center of the theater. <br /> <br /> However, I cannot remember that I was more pleased with the winners. None of the films has actually shifted the awards, as it has always been in the last couple of years. Does this mean that it was a good year for films with a lot of contestants? I do not think so. I think most of the films will be largely forgotten in 20 years, with the possible exception of Million Dollars and Passion of the Christ, maybe. Of course, I do not agree with every single award that was presented this year, for example, Caleb Deschanel had to win for the best cinematography, not that I didn’t like the work of Robert Richardson, he really did an amazing job for most of Oliver Stone. work, but I really feel that Deschanel deserved the reward a lot more. I would also like Jim Miller and Paul Rubel to win for better editing, and John Debney for better music. Well, okay, the Academy awards can not please everyone, I understand that. There will always be people who will complain about the winners. <br /> <br /> It was also fun to see that most of the awardees were much more nervous than the candidates and winners. Did the Prince say any of the candidates immediately? And what was the sense of humor of Sean Penn? Al Pacino and Jeremy "I hope they missed," Irons were the best hosts of the evening. <br /> <br /> In general, a very memorable show, but with good winners. <br /> <br /> 4/10
