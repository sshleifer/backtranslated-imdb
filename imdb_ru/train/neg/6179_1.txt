This film is the second worst film I've ever seen (the first one was "Ghost Rider"). There is absolutely no plot, climax, conflict or any other important details necessary to depict the story. This “film” is just another excuse for Toby Keith to show his manly side and the “tough guy he really is.” I completely spent my time watching this movie. The best part was to be final loans. If I were Ebert or Roper, I would cut off my fingers and throw them at the producers. The one who in his right mind gave Toby Keith the opportunity to play in a feature film is clearly on the same level as he. In conclusion, do not waste your time watching this film, perhaps this is the only thing you regret.
