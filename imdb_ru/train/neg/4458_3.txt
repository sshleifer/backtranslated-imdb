Most of the French films that I saw — and which I liked — were more of a conversation than an action movie, but this is normal. I found them interesting, well photographed and with intriguing actors. (However, at some point I wondered if Gerald Depardieu was in every French film that was ever filmed! It seemed that way.) <br /> <br /> This film has the same interesting visual effects and good Start. But then it began to say, talk and talk more ... which is good for drama, but not for the mystery of murder. After a while I almost fell asleep watching it. <br /> <br /> In fact, the film was more like a play in which almost all the scenes were played in the same room. So, if you like games, you should like this ... but I want a little more bang for the kill story.
