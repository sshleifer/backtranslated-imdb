The opening scene “explains” why Hart is later “immune” to an “infected person.” It is a pity that this does not explain anything: how he got what he “caught” / what it was / why it works so quickly. Then we go to "Modern Budapest". Well, was new to the past or the future? Of course, it turns out to be the past, but for a minute it looks as likely as the end of the film moved to the beginning. Sorry, I should have paid more attention, huh? Or maybe this is just poorly done. Then there was confusion about the various works that he performed in related fields, and, finally, the mention of how he had to die from the original experiment he conducted on it. Aha So n s a and the private industry got together to poison one of their best guys to see the results? He must have been one of the best guys, he is friends with the director of a chemical company, for God's sake. Then there is the substance itself: technically poison, but it mutates in immune "carriers", so we can get everything we want; poison, illness, allergic reaction, all very different things in real life. Magically, it is not infectious from one dying victim to another, only from the carrier. How convenient Then there is the protocol h a z m a t: they get into a situation without having any idea what is in stock, or how to prepare for it. Didn't the producers have enough money to show the proper erosion after the crew had just left the scene of a deadly unknown substance? I kept thinking that Hart would die from a bad cleaning technique, and the open scene would be near the end.
