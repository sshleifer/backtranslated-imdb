If you want to see a secret, do not watch it. Although there are elements directly from the Elmore Leonard territory, this is closer to the episode of Dynasty, as the director focuses on “character development” - that is, long, boring conversations between stupid, non-involved characters. Some people may make exciting films with no real action (see Exotics), but not this one. Avoid this, especially if you like the actors involved in this.
