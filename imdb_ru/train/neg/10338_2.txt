This movie is just dumb. <br /> <br /> Ralph Meeker's film as Mike Hummer and the insane climax of the film are an exercise in wooden predictability. <br /> <br /> Mike Hummer is one of them. true sociopaths of detective fiction. Unlike Marlowe and Spade, who collect pieces to solve the mystery, Hummer breaks things apart to get to the truth. This film turns Hammer into a boob, surrounding him with bad guys who ... well, too stupid to get away with. One was so badly drawn that he succumbed to the popcorn attack. <br /> <br /> Other parts of the film directly from the play "Three Puppets." For example, Velda dance in a bar or a bad guy who accidentally stabs his boss in the back. And the discontinuity of discontinuity is shameful: Frau Blucher runs along the center line of the road when the camera is pressed tightly against her legs, but she switches sides when the camera moves back for a wider frame. However, the worst break precedes the popcorn attack. The bad guy chasing Hammer passes a few seconds after our hero, except that the clock shows that he was 7 minutes behind our boy. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there were some interesting camera angles and lighting, as well as a grand finale so bad that it should be noticed, and this is the only reason he gets two out of 10 points.
