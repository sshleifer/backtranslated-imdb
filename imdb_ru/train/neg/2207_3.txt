Hammerhead is a combination of the genres of the mad scientist and the shark killer film. In a small set of types, Jeffrey Combs plays the aforementioned mad scientist who develops a creature with a human shark / hammer. Oddly enough, this creature is actually his son, whom he turned into this monster to prevent him from dying from cancer. Or something. <br /> <br /> A group of staff members is invited to a scientist’s private island. They end up being used as shark bait or shark mate. For some unknown reason, the head of IT was brought in as part of this team. Who knows why? Fortunately, he is the inventive, albeit somewhat overweight, hero of Rambo. I work with the assumption that he learned how to handle an assault rifle as part of his daily work, working on the 1st line of support. A typical day for this IT professional seems to involve establishing someone else's network connection, followed by a call to shoot the intruders. Or, perhaps, it is necessary to schedule a call in order to repair someone's computer between physical collisions with human shark ground hybrids? In any case, it is amazing and saves the day. He even caught the girl. <br /> <br /> The shark is a bit of a lame creature, but I think everything is fine, judging by the effects in this film. And the film moves at a decent pace. Of course, this is a full turn, but if you buy a movie called “Hammerhead” and expect it to be a complex drama about the emotional conflicts that a person has when he turns into a killer fish on land, then in reality you have no one to blame but yourself. In fact, there are guns, blood, girls, and perhaps even an exploding helicopter. This is rubbish, but not as bad as some might say.
