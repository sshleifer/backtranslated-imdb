This is absurd - apart from the Australian who watched this movie, I can't help but think that everyone else who submitted a review was somehow involved in the production of Elektra, given how generous they were with their praise. <br /> <br /> Admittedly, I’m not really a fan of converting comics into movies, so I didn’t live up to many expectations, and yet I found Elektra incredibly unhappy. What impressed me most was that there was so much of the unexplainable in this film that made you think: “What does this have to do with the plot?”. or "since this aspect of the character appeared?" I can only hope that these are things that may explain something in Daredevil, and I am not going to see them. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the behavior of the characters in this film seems to be turning to random moments to fit the storyline, and do not even start me about a completely meaningless romantic plot. I am also (still) puzzling over the fate of Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, who seems to have left in an inexplicable way. <br /> <br /> If I could pay tribute to this film for everything that he had to Be fantastic places in which he was shot, but otherwise I received little pleasure from Elektra. I know that we have to stop our distrust of fantasy / action movies, but almost everything in this film was so incredible or confusing (even by the standards of action movies) that it just disappointed me. <br /> <br /> Well, damn, at least Jennifer Garner looks damn good.
