How did Mike Hammer live in a penthouse with a golf bag tucked away in a corner next to a big CRT screen and a chic fireplace? No, he threw a bottle of rye and twenty unfiltered camels on a sofa or the floor of his office covered with flies, or a stinky lousy house in downtown Los Angeles, wiping a dry red crust and oiled face mud. that's it. Spillane, of course, wrote trash in paperback, but how do you make it worse? Give some desperate intriguing provider an empty check, because he thinks that any crap called Film Noir will be sold at the box office, add some hot tomatoes and, as a rule, spoil the plot line of some mentally retarded script writer. that's it!
