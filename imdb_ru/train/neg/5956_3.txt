Another horror film in which a teenage fool fights with a madman and his supernatural assistant who wants to seize power ?! Yes, but the fact that this one was from Canada gives him a slightly different feeling. The Brain made the problem teenager Jim Mazelevski undergo a course of treatment, the leader of which was a cult leader who was helped by a large, ugly brain. Can Jim stop him? I assume that since our northern neighbor has done everything they did, they have the right to make at least one funny horror movie. But, nevertheless, they will probably want to be known for their national health care and all that. <br /> <br /> The bad guy had a brain. Why not the people who made this film?
