This is not a commentary on the film itself, but on the RUSCICO DVD for North America. I don’t know if there were any other issues or updates, but the discs we rented had copyrights for 2000 if that means something. In any case, mixing the sound on these DVDs was just awful. Levels are often both up and down; when the scene switched to the panorama of the battlefield, the orchestral track thundered so loudly that I did not know which of them would blow up first — my eardrums or my speakers. When it was time for dialogue, the volume usually dropped to something barely audible. From time to time, the orchestra and Foley's work remained loud, while the dialogue was superimposed on a much lower level. My wife and I discovered that the only way to watch this movie at all from these DVDs is if one of us holds our hands on the remote to continuously adjust the volume. And, as another user already said, when we chose English audio, the dialogue continued to switch between Russian and English; and sometimes, when the characters spoke French in their native track, the duplication was in Russian, so you are a SOL, if you do not understand either one or the other. In the end, we stopped looking after the first disc. Before you shell out $ 50 for this DVD movie for your own library, I wholeheartedly recommend renting a copy to see if you can really enjoy this epic movie when saddled with such a bad sound, especially if you never read book and really want to understand the storyline.
