These 2 points are devoted to the reasonable work of Akshay Kumar. I know that Bollywood films don't really want to be realistic, but PLEASE Walt Disney’s production is more realistic than this plot. The father dies and does what any good parent does ... kick out his son with his pregnant wife. A few things that were too hard to swallow: 1. Priyanka, “the cool indoor pool in the bedroom,” and go on to live hungry in your barn in the garden; 2. Akshay unexpectedly got the job of a stuntman, he was bitten by a mad dog, then just to leave. This film is HELP to our mind. I really can’t believe that I made a financial contribution to the “people” who made this film, taking my family to watch it, we frowned, leaving the cinema, please do not expose yourself to this mess when watching, take my advice and don’t waste your “ waqt.
