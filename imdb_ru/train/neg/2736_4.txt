The only reason I comment is that I finally understand why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all understood it at the same time this week, Dr. Cox is bald because they showed these episodes in a different order than they shot them. The last episode when our beloved, nagging, Jesus-loving nurse Roberts dies, Dr. Cox shaves his head. They must have shown them out of order for some strange reason and forgot that they had escaped. To shame, scrubs. They made such mistakes before. I remember Elliot trying to date Scott Foley, and her hair got wet 2 seconds before the water hit her. I try not to notice these things, but my favorite show should reinforce this.
