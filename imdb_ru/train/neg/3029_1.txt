From the first moment this “thing” is just a terrible sequence of extremely short segments of blurred camera work. While the general plot has all the possibilities for a thriller, the story is so poorly told that I cannot buy it. From the middle of the movie, the characters' actions don't make sense to me. Stop reading now to avoid SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> For example, Ed's idea was for Edna to make coffee for them after she shot her son’s hand, far below his intended experience; it's just a really dumb idea. Dominoes, without questioning the fragmentary orders she receives from Claremont Williams to break the telephone line, just elude me; Shouldn't she long suspect Williams is renting them out? These FBI agents seem to go crazy after finding just one helicopter, and they have every reason to consider the shooting of the capital's mafia. In addition, what they do by hiding and passing information in the direction of Chiglutti, is largely an incitement to murder; It seems to me like a farewell to justice if this is how the FBI conducts investigations. In fact, if they acted this way, they would have had an irrelevant case. We end up in a car accident, which, as a rule, would at least seriously hurt, if it had not killed most of the passengers, but miraculously left them all with just a few bruises. On the contrary, immediately after the accident Domino made love to Choco, which from the Domino point of view is not based in any way on previous events, but simply under the influence of drugs in the eyeballs. <br /> <br /> The entire sequence of scenes, starting with a phone call from Claremont Williams, seems to me to have the same desirable dramatic brilliance. This, combined with the terrible, awkward work with the camera, simply makes a play that I hesitate to call a movie. I regret the wasted efforts of the main actors whose talent cannot be considered.
