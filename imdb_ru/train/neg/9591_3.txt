If you read the original novel, like me, you probably hate this thing. <br /> <br /> Absolute Beginners is a horrible conglomerate of anachronisms of the 1980s, trying to create a set of “historical period”. in the late 1950s, and unable to recreate or even pay homage to this period - the American monster _Dirty Dancing_ really looks like 1963, except that the film was financially successful, despite the equally amateur script. In addition to the “1980’s appearance too much suffering,” the characters were altered, rearranged, and understated to such an extent that the only characteristics they have with the characteristics of the novel are the slightest superficial looks and, of course, their names: Suze turns from the frivolous ex-girlfriend of the narrator and the erratic Negrofil, who willingly plans to marry the old closed queen for money (by her own admission on the first few pages) into the unfortunate and naive "Eve" - ​​the archetype, of glory and glamor, exploited and somehow deceived in a fictitious marriage by her boss, who, surprisingly, did not get van Dyke and a pointed hairstyle. She and the narrator, renamed the film “Colin” (in honor of the author of the book Colin McInnes), are also in a relationship. <br /> <br /> The character of Big Gill, a lesbian, it would seem, is still "like an ass" "in her mid-20s, who acts as a pimp in the frame of young and frightening lesbians, and one of the closest friends of the narrator, conveying frank wisdom to the narrator, turns into a kind of “named extra” with only a few ejected lines and tons of comic outfits. <br /> <br /> Fairy-tale hoplite, a young gay guy and another close friend of the narrator in the novel, also comes down to to being meaningless in a film in a camp and almost ignoring Ana. <br /> <br /> The father of the narrator in the novel is a kind of sad minor character, but in the film he played optimistically and strangely minded, despite the poor neighborhood, and the mess of his marriage with the narrator’s mother, apparently ignored. <br /> <br /> In his favor, the music (as it is) is well composed, and you must pay tribute to the film crew and writing team for what they really took a line from the book ("... someday they will write musicals about the 1950s ... ") as his inspiration for writing a musical, but in the world of bad music Clo is one of the worst performed. In contrast to _Shock Treatment_ or _Starstruck_, critical plot elements are viewed as late thoughts. Unlike _The Apple_, there is an unstable and uneven flow between musical numbers and conversational dialogue. <br /> <br /> You really can't blame him for being too 1980s to feel that he was created in the 1980s. The _Annie_ version of the film, released in 1981, gives a surprisingly well-executed tribute to the appearance of New York in the 1930s, and _Napolean Dynamite_ manages to capture the gloomy look and feel of the 1980s, despite the fact that they were made on a low budget in 2003 (although it was clearly not set up in the 1980s, those who survived a decade cannot deny that the film "feels very like the 1980s"). Obviously, it was _popular_ to do something good out of it, especially given the landmark status that the novel source has in the UK, but it most likely failed in the look and feel, as well as in the processing of the source material, which is completely disrespectful . <br /> <br /> Perhaps, if you did not read and do not intend to read the novel, you could enjoy this anachronism of the 1980s, giving a shameful parody of the modernist jazz set Soho London of the late 1950s. I can definitely see what the writing team wrote, but they could definitely do better. With Boy George as an eminent man and musicians and mixed race bands on the 1986 charts in the UK, they definitely didn’t need to cheer up the characters as they did. In fact, I would even say that the scriptwriters ultimately did what they harshly criticized both the book and the film - as a result, a group of adults twisted the crap and treated their adolescent audience as if they were two thousand. idiots to make money fast.
