It had high intellectual claims. The top management intends to give a “deep” “meaningful” rendering (with a natural voice for his mood), and he was probably influenced by the “method” of the fifties / sixties, which, when the script and direction was worth it, gave stunning results (see Clift , Newman, Winters). But here the story is terrible. Besides the fact that it moves too slowly, you can edit at least 20 minutes, including senseless memories, and the storyline will not be changed. At times it is very doubtful that Bruce Dern believes in his hero “Uncle” and his image often borders on a parody. The interesting side is just deadlocked: the relationship of a young man / hero - if we recognize that the hero himself is such a child. When he tells a small child that he will not allow anyone to harm him, some kind of long-awaited tenderness arises. But he is spoiled, and only the last scene returns to him. <br /> <br /> A Word to the Wise Instead, take Foley from close range: there are two great actors in it (Christoph Walken and Sean Penn together!), this is also an unusual film, but it is exciting, tense. Here is my Hicciometer gloomily pointing to zero.
