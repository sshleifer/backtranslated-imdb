I saw his film at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. I am a student of film at the University of Michigan, so I know something about the film. And Crispine Glover's film is outrageous. He mainly exploits the mentally retarded. Not only is the Shirley Temple an antichrist (which, I admit, a little ridiculous), it says mentally retarded to kill each other, but there is an obsession with killing snails. Crispin also plays with the idea of ​​falling in love with one of his actors, who, like all of them, is mentally retarded. PETA and human rights must be everywhere. This is not a "counterculture", as Crispin stated at the Ann Arbor Film Festival, it is exploitation.
