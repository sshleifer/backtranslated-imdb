As big as a Texas prairie, and as boring. Even Liz Taylor, James Dean, Chill Wills and Dennis Hopper cannot let go of this crowded boat. Taylor actually looks bad - the wrong wardrobe, the wrong hairstyles and the wrong makeup - a unique achievement in her wonderful career. Hopper gives the only plausible idea, and Dean at the peak of the stage shows a remarkable talent as something we donâ€™t usually remember - a comic actor. Rock Hudson is his usual prototype of Barbie Doll Ken and makes you think about what, say, Redford could do with male leadership. There is no noticeable plot that provides any kind of tension until the last twenty minutes, just a set of milestones that have little to do with each other. With the exception of Hopper, there is no character development, only a set of cardboard cutouts that appear periodically for no apparent reason, like random targets in a shooting gallery. To his credit, the film really struggles with racism and sexism at a time when they were forbidden objects, and it has a SIZE, which makes it an excellent choice to get rid of unwanted guests at home. Those who have a DVD version can get rid of some tediousness, starting with the second disc. You will not miss anything interesting.
