Amen Magselou. There was a lot of confusion. First, how do you know which movie you are buying? Stars Henry Sele in each of them. I bought this movie, thinking that this is a mini-series ... WHAT IS RESTING !! It would be a comedy if the girl had not been raped. David Hasselhoff (spelling?) OK for popcorn television, but wasnâ€™t it believable in this film (where was his English accent?) AND WHAT WITH LOVE HISTORY ??? It was assumed that the film tells about the arrival of a young man to military power, and not about how the captain of the slave ship sways when an English girl searches for his father ... <br /> <br /> If I paid for it more than 7 dollars of cinema, I would have to call the police - it would be a crime!
