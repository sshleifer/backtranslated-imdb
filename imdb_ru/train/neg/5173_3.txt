When I saw it in the store, I thought it looked really good and original. Just as Wolfs Creek meets slaughter with a chainsaw in Texas, I mean it cost only three pounds (about $ 6). Honestly, I don't think it was even worth it. <br /> <br /> It seemed that the directors - the “butchers brothers” could not decide whether they wanted to make a sly look of horror or a bloody horror film slasher. In the end, it was an enchanted bloody sadistic hour and fifteen minutes, when all the characters were one-dimensional, and you didn’t give a damn what happened to them, but try to get the audience to take care of the characters, which added a monologue and To be honest, there was no need. <br /> <br /> The only good part really was the middle / end - I won’t spoil it for you. But it was the only "good" part. <br /> <br /> In general, meaningless hours. It was like a two-hour movie, but in fact it was only 75 minutes. If you want a feature film - do not worry. If you need a slasher film - don't worry - the film moves so slowly that nothing happens.
