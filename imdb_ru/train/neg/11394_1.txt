Oh, if you scream loudly, it must be the LASTEST film I've seen all year, and I'm sorry that the usually amazing John Cusack was even involved in this brainless, stupid piece of stupidity. While Seattle Insomnia gave the same, albeit on a more subtle, somewhat more mature level, Serendipity delivers it with a sledgehammer and then plunges into its psyche for the next hour and a half or so. (and this is an hour and a half of my life, I will never come back again, thank you very much !!). It's bad enough that the main characters of this film have a level of emotional maturity of fourteen (actually I know better than fourteen ...), except maybe Jeremy Piven, who was pleasant enough. Only the first 15 minutes or so of the film in which the character Kate Beckinsale plays this annoying stupidity of the game about throwing all the sensitivity to the wind (literally), caused me the best friend, and I got angry to the limit. I said that my husband, Rockstar, has more intelligence, and at least the characters in Rockstar were not as incapable as the idiots in this “happy” mess. It is a shame to watch the heroes, who seem to have no idea about the choice in their lives and feel that they are nothing more than puppets for fate and the whims of fate. How extremely tiring. I am sure that this film will appeal to those who would rather not engage in chaotic confusion, make more difficult life choices, and then live responsibly with consequences. In the end, here’s a film in which our hero and heroine live happily only after sowing chaos and suffering in the lives of two other people (namely, their respective brides), not to mention other relatives and friends, simply to get there. <br /> <br />
