Awesome amateur filmmaker (no, not Todd Sheets), his new friend and sister exploring the cave. A friend and sister fall and flee. Meanwhile, a gang of terribly acting girls defends their "lawn". Whatever that means. This film, and I use the term VERY loose, is so bad that it is ... well, bad. Humor is painlessly unmixed, the “action” is simply sad. I’ve now seen some horrible horror films in my time, and I couldn’t get bored with my approach to watching low-budget films, but I still cry openly to those who decide to sit through it. ONLY for the most seasoned macho workers among you. but the rest run away QUICKLY! <br /> <br /> My rating: F
