This film is now my measure, with which all other films will be compared ... like, "Was it as stupid as Revolver?" Last night I was also in the auditorium of the Toronto International Film Festival, where a room filled with more than 2,000 people walked out in eerie silence, being completely stunned by 2 hours of meaningless rubbish. Jason Stratham would be amazing if he had a goal. During the first 10 minutes, he received an offer from Andre 3000 and Big Pussy (known from soprano), which makes no sense! Then there is shooting, and then Ray Liotta in embarrassing bikini panties, then animation, Ray Liotta’s naked ass, lots of shooting, gnashing of teeth, art house, I want to pretend, and Liotta’s even more awkward body that made you laugh at every show. I'm not quite sure that this was the reaction he was looking for ... anyway, not 5 times. Everyone in this film thinks they are smarter than a regular bear, and Guy Ritchie thinks he is the embodiment of the Yogi Bear. The plot lines may not have gone away, but posturing was out of sight! This film could only be worse if Madonna herself were in it.
