Nothing in this movie is funny. I thought that the premise that gave a person a random ram's libido was interesting and should have caused some laughter. WRONG! There is nothing funny in the film. For example, the main character, who makes the pass in the heat of the goat in the middle of the farmer’s yard, is not funny, it borders on obscenity. In one film, they play with bestiality on the same level, and this is not funny. <br /> <br /> We all know that dogs will eat anything, anywhere, anytime. The main character does it with everything, everywhere, always and not funny. It becomes a cliche. <br /> <br /> Rob Schneider, I think, is acceptable in this role. By this I mean that he is not a bad actor, but with rotten material it is difficult to comment on the quality. However, Colin Haskell, the other half of the romantic man’s occasions (does the number of animals that the main character is also interested in, like romantic leashes, is considered?) Seems to be confused by all this, and she should be. She seems to be acting in some kind of vacuum, cut off from all the other actors in the film. <br /> <br /> Watch this film only if you want to get bored with tasteless, boring, repetitive material.
