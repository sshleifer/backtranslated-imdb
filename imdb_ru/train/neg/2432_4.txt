Not much to say about it. The plot, which you can pretty much tie, in the first 10 minutes. There is nothing bad in this film, very few actions for an action movie. There was a chance from time to time to explore the emotions of the characters. Whether an action movie is a suitable genre for this, I have not yet decided. The Sniper was one of the easiest films to watch, without paying much attention, as there were small twists and a simple plot. Probably, I was guilty of this, so with the second watch or with unflagging attention it could be better. <br /> <br /> 4/10 (but the best of my 4 out of 10)
