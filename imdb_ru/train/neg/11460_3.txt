A rather funny play that tries to show how clever the Orcs are, but at the same time (and doesnâ€™t notice them at all) makes the audience feel silly, making the funniest movie. Richard Harris plays Quint. Sorry, this is wrong, he plays Captain Nolan, a fisherman who catches sharks for life, but is lured by a big catch and tries to catch the killer whale. When the capture of a female killer whale goes wrong (do not ask), her friend (do not ask) becomes enraged (do not ask) and begins to pursue Captain Nolan (do not ask). Soon, Captain Nolan realizes that they have something in common (do not ask). Pretty amazing filming here guys. I have to tell you, though, the beginning (with the whale's noise and nothing else) is pretty ghostly, and the end credits (with the most disgusting song) are quite interesting.
