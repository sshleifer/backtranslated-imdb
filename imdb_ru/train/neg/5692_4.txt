An endangered fighter with an interesting premise: the young potential mafia killer (Chandler) must demonstrate to his boss that he is a good service man, so he goes to California to take lessons with the very famous professional killer Beluschi) The first and most important task: to kill a young woman (Lee), which is completely strange for all of them. But is she an easy target? The film continues and develops on the basis of this basic idea, but the result is simply a bad routine; even a strange turn at the end will not save the film. Good performance Chandler. I give it 4 (four).
