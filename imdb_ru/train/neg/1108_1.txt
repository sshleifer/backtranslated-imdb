Dreary and meaningless fluff (bloody fluff, but fluff). Badly written, with meaningless and wooden dialogue. You don't care if the heroes (even the actors themselves) will live or die. A little grace or charm, little action, little sense in everything. Perhaps some of the recruiting and settlement will be of interest - those gaps between the boards of all buildings may be true to how life was lived. Collision with frames is not necessary and distracting, and the character Hoppalong Cassidy is boring and inept.
