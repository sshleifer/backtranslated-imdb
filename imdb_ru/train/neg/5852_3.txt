Bradford Dillman plays a scientist who wakes up one morning in the midst of a bloody crime scene; Having partial amnesia (or “global amnesia”, which one of the characters claims to define as an elective loss of memory), the scientist finds a private telephone detective in the phone book in the hope of restoring his life. Disgusting mixture is very poorly based on the book “The Fallen Angel” by Walter Erikson (removed in 1965 as “Mirage” with Gregory Peck). It was probably too cool for television — with the drugs and the hippies that were added to the mix — that NBC initially refused to broadcast it, as this low-budget cinema found itself in theaters. Director James Goldstone is crazy about hyperkinetic visual effects and camera stunts, and editor Edward A. Beery is going crazy about zigzag cuts. Unfortunately, their admittedly colorful tricks cannot hide the weakness of this renewed conspiracy, and the action has become terribly overripe. Dillman, under pressure to recall the events of this night, passes through the Actor's Seminar on ticks, stuttering, wiping his nose and crazy half-laugh, spitting out dialogs like "Dream ... dream ... drugs ... yes, drugs ... this sound ... bells ... help! "As a villainous fellow scientist with a Cheshire cat smile, Pat Hingle almost upstage Dilman in the department of Great Thespii, constantly addressing everyone in conversations with babies, walking like a middle-aged peacock and twisting his mouth in agony. I hope that the scientist / love interest Lange is given a short fuss, but not before she screams at Dillman's indifferent lover: "What should I do, talk to the Monkey Man? I want You!" This is one insane "Puzzle"! * 1/2 from ****
