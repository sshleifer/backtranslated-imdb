This film was so poorly written, directed and acted that it is hard to believe. This should be redone with the best script, director and casting. The worst problem is acting. You have Jennifer Beals, on the one hand, impeccable, professional and absolutely believable, and on the other, Richard, who is terribly mistaken and just resonates in this particular work. Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine are terrible, like a slave owning (and holding) a couple, although both usually do a good job. The actors (and the director) should not have focused at all - they are inconsistent and incredible. It is much better to concentrate on good work in real English. Casting is ridiculous. Why were the children of an “African” merchant (thus less socially desirable for society gens de couleur) played with very pale actors, while the supposedly socially desirable Marcel had pronounced African features, including a clearly colored blond fro As if the directors could not be bothered to read the script they cast and select suitable actors from a large number of extremely talented and physically diverse color actors. This is so strange! It can be a great movie that needs to be redone, but with people who respect the material and can choose suitable and qualified actors. There are many good actors, and it would be interesting to see how Jennifer Beals, Daniel Sunjata and Gloria Reuben deal with the appropriate cast, a good script and decent leadership.
