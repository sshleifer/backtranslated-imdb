Unfortunately, there was no 0 for the rating, otherwise I would choose it. This film lacks the stellar power that the original film possessed in such abundance. Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, Edward Hermann, innocence of newcomer Eileen Quinn and an experienced director from experienced pro John Houston (father of actress Angelica Houston) made this film so charming. Even a 1999 remake with Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Alan Cumming and Christine Chenoweth could offer more than this sequel's excuse for justifying. Before she starred in this film, Ashley Johnson was only known for playing the role of little Chrissie Siver in the “Growing Pains” show in prime time. She had several episodic roles in films, but I don’t know who thought she had enough talent to make a movie on her own. And adding Joan Collins as Lady Edwina Hogbottom is ridiculous! They didn’t have enough good actors to play major roles like daddy Warbachs, Miss Hannigan and Annie, but will they sign Joan Collins to play some kind of British? I am not surprised that this film was as bad as it was. The critics were right that they did not agree with this film, even if it was made only for television, it was a bad sequel of the film, which in other respects would be attractive.
