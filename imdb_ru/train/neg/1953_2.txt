The first episode of this new show was today, and it was awful. Not only did Shaggy have a raspy new voice that made him listen to the lines tormenting, but he was so far from the original concept and style of animation that he was hardly recognizable as the Scooby-Doo show. <br /> <br /> Even in the dark days, when Fred and Velma left, and Scooby's nephew, Skrappi, was there, the team was still solving riddles. Instead, in the new show, Shaggy and Scooby are battling with a super villain like James Bond and his minions while living in a mansion. There is not even a van called “The Mysterious Machine” (and the teaser for the next episode, which promised that the machine-robot of the transformer type will NOT calm me). How can you take Scooby Doo and do IT? <br /> <br /> The show earns two points in two scenes involving the entire Scooby-Doo gang, all of which speak in the right voices except Shaggy, and even then I'm too generous.
