Films about superheroes almost always suck, and this is no exception. His only quality is that the film CAN be worse. I would put “Batman and Robin” and “Steel” over this film, so yes, this is so bad ... <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a black superhero, check “Blankman”, this is not so ”serious "superhero movie", but at least its entertaining.
