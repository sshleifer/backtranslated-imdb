There is not one cute character in this whole film. Is this the attorney played by Kenneth Branaus whom we should attract? Well, let's see - we find out that he is a bastard lawyer who dismisses criminals for technical reasons. He treats his colleagues like cattle, involves them in his personal crisis (kills one of them in the process), jeopardizes the safety of his children, threatens the new boyfriend of his ex-wife, school administrators are trying to strengthen the police - and all for what? Because he thought with his little head! I really wanted the father and his gang to smash the stuffed lawyer and drown him in the swamp ... it would give a much more pleasant end.
