I just came to see this movie and decided to see what others think about it. Iâ€™m wondering if these people who give bright reviews watched the same movie! This is potentially a very good story, but it is not able to hit the mark. The scenario is very weak - there are so many holes on the plot that it can be an excellent failure grid for fishing scenes. The characters were not well developed, and the storyline jumps so much that I wondered: "How did we get here?" At least half a dozen times during the movie. <br /> <br /> There was no chemistry between the actors. This is probably due to the Lindsay Lohan antics during filming. It was quite clear that everyone came and did their work, but did not take on the role. <br /> <br /> This is not the movie that is worth watching ... take a walk, play a board game, take a nice warm bath and save money on what is worth it!
