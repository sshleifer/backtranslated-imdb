Although many people here praise this film, I must warn you. He has no logic at all. I think Basinger does a good job with acting, but you can't do a thriller if you have a big lack of realism. <br /> <br /> This scene draws you a good picture of the film: while Basinger is followed by murderous thugs, she decides to sit down and look at the photo she finds from her pocket. A picture from her daughter says "we love you, mommy." Who does something like that? What is the effect? And believe me when I say that this is not as stupid as some other scenes in the film. Someone said it was a “hidden gem”. Well, I have to categorically disagree, this film is hidden for some reason. And this is not a gem. Oh, and please, I don’t even want to comment on the red toolbar. It hurts my brain: D Usually, the lack of logic does not bother me if it is in small quantities, but this film is mostly made possible only because of the lack of logic. But I still give him 4, because, despite the fact that it is embarrassing by logic, he has a certain mood that makes me look to the end. <br /> <br /> Therefore, if you decide to watch this, you know that you have been warned.
