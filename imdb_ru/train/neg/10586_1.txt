This is a well-made informative film in the spirit of PBS Frontline. The problem is that Frontline has already done this piece and managed to attract Paul Bremer to tell her side of the story. Even more disturbing is the fact that the director of the film, Charles Ferguson - a former analyst, was a supporter of the war, until the occupation went south. What did he think would happen? <br /> <br /> The invasion of Poland went very well, too, until these nasty Nazis spoiled it. And this is what this film feels - an apology for occupation, not deconstruction of the act of war itself, <br /> <br /> Ferguson seems to suggest that war could be better â€” as if any war could be better.
