WOW, this movie was so terrible. I am so glad that I did not have to pay to watch this horrible movie. it looked like a historical nut went for a coke snack! previews made it worthy, but REALLY bad. I will say that the idea sounded decent, but come on. it was really very bad. If you sat down and thought about it, you would also understand that this is NOT REALISTIC. Go back that day when you think they have all these things to work with. It was not like Ben Franklin sat down once and did a damn puzzle. it was completely ridiculous, and if you want to watch a bad movie, then by all means watch this movie. ALL and ALL HORRIBLE films, this may actually be in my top 10 worst films I've ever seen.
