Hollywood's attempt to turn Jack London's life into an adventure film "Jack London" is a good idea; Of course, he led an interesting and sometimes adventurous life. This film, however, turns out to be flat and unsatisfactory. Most importantly, it lacks integrity. Michael O'Shea (like London) delivers London speeches; and it's nice to see how his bearded Jack gets “The Call of the Wild” after spending some time alone in the snowy mountains with his dog “Buck”. Virginia Mayo and Susan Hayward are both very beautiful. The film draws the sad parallels of the “Yellow Danger” between the life of London and the Second World War, which are both tense and offensive. <br /> <br /> ** Jack London (11/24/43) Alfred Santell ~ Michael O'Shea, Susan Hayward, Va.
