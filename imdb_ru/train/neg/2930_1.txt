I like British humor, I think he is one of the best in the world. I like almost all the British sitcoms (well ... maybe not Monthy Python, some jokes were great, but I didn't understand some of them.) But this League of Gentlemen is just something good to make you sick. This show was good in some way; it helped me lose weight because, looking at this piece of garbage, I feel that I am no longer hungry. It's really just disgusting, sick and not even a funny TV show, and I wonder who actually laughs at it. I watched it for about 10 minutes and turned it off. It was so disgusting to watch men dressed in women with yellow teeth peeing in a car ... I mean ... what's so funny ??? It makes me want to vomit. No humor, just disturbing images and cheap toilet laughs ... I don't know ... if you like this stuff ... you go ahead ... watch it ... but honestly, people watch and enjoy it should have some emotional issues. Garbage.
