The chillers start on a cold, dark, stormy night when the bus leaves from three passengers near the bus station, a boy named Mason (Jesse Emery), a professor at Dr. Howard Conrow College (David Wall) and a woman named Sharon Phillips (Laurie) Pennington). Inside, they discover that they missed their bus and were stuck for the night. In the waiting area, they find two other people, Ronnie (Jim Wolfe) and a sleeping woman named Lindsay (Marjorie Fitzsimmons), who is currently in a terrible nightmare ... <br /> <br /> While swimming in the indoor pool of Lindsay meets and befriends a guy named Billy Waters (Jesse Johnson), the next time Lindsay sees Billy, he dives into a pool and then apparently disappears in the air before surfacing.

Hooray) back to life ... <br /> <br /> Then we’ll go back to the bus station for the last (predictable) turn ... <br /> <br /> Scriptwriter, director and director Daniel Boyd Chillers is one of the worst the horrors I've ever seen, and I usually really like this subgenre. In Boyd’s script, there’s no need for movies like “Chillers,” you can see the final turn in a mile, and every story is really unfortunate. The first one is completely meaningless and does not seem to have an end, and the best thing about these anthologies is short, sharp stories that are rounded with a neat turn. The second story is predictable and, again, simply ends without any pay. Thus, Chillers continues the fact that each story is extremely unsatisfactory to view and has no reward for it. The dialogue and character of the character are poorly written, the stories do not seem to have their own original ideas, and the whole film sucks. At least, every story does not last long, and I liked the idea of ​​link segments. <br /> <br /> Director Boyd obviously worked with a very small budget, and it shows. All I can say is that if you want to see a story longer than 15 minutes, fully located in the pool, then the Chillers are for you. Stories are neither smart nor scary, nor any kind of tension or accumulation of anything. Having said that he does have some good scenes and some amazing competence shines through from time to time. The violence and the bloodshed in Chillers is not so much; a broken heart, a decapitated head and a severed arm are as terrible as they are. <br /> <br /> Technically, chillers are bad things that won't impress anyone. Basic cinematography, bad music, cheap special effects and below-average performance. Chillers also feature one of the worst final theme songs ever, period. The acting is also very low. <br /> <br /> I’m sure Chillers did a lot of effort like a low-budget film, and at least the directors did their best, so at least I’ll be grateful for that, but it still doesn’t stop me think this shit. Similar anthological films, such as "Tales from a Crypt" (1972), "Asylum" (1972), "Asylum of Horror" (1973), "House of Horrors" by Dr. Terror (1965), "Cripshow" (1982) and "Tales from the dark side: the film ”(1990) is far superior to the chillers, so watch one of them.
