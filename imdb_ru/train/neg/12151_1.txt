this is possibly the worst game i have ever seen in a movie ... ever. and what happened to the casting. The lead lady in this film has some form of nose, and it is almost impossible to look at it for a period of time without getting stuck on her nose. You could go to your local grocery store on Sunday afternoon and easily find 50 more skilled, better looking possible leading ladies. I made an annoying mistake by renting this movie because it had a cool DVD case. This film looks like it's just some kind of educational project for a group of multimedia students at a local technical college. I would prefer to spend an hour or so on this movie to be on general access television ... at least special effects are better and people are more attractive there than anyone you see in this movie.
