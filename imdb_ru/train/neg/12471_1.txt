Living in the Middle East (in Israel), I was thrilled when I bought a ticket to Syriana. Seeing the trailer and being a thriller lover, I expected to see, above all, a fast-moving, breathtaking film that wisely traces global politics and the connection between oil, power and corruption from a new perspective. Well, I almost left the movie in the middle. The speed was painfully slow, almost all the characters were stereotypical, interlaced editing made understanding logic very difficult, but, as Steve Rhodes wrote in his review, in the end, you don't care. Save your money, save your time, choose another movie. <br /> <br /> Roby Chernitsky
