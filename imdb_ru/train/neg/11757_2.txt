Hi Arnold! it's a slow and a bit boring movie. The plot is not very creative. Character Paul Sorvino (Schenk) buys all dilapidated low-cost buildings to build a giant shopping center, shopping complex and office buildings. This plot goes back to many children's films of the 1960s. It's boring. Paul Sorvino is also not very fascinating, so the idea of ​​him as a bad guy is not very scary. Gramps recalls something about a historical document, and the rest of the film is devoted to the last 36 hours, when Arnold and Jamal must find the document with the help of the secret Helga, whose father hopes to get rich thanks to Shanki Mall. Children need to get around the city on buses, and therefore the exciting bus chase scene is not only stupid, but also underlines how this film was written for very young children. Hey, Arnold, the television cartoon is usually very interesting, and there is enough humor in it to please adults. The TV cartoon is usually faster and more creative than this movie. Hi Arnold, the movie is five times more sedative, and this is a good way to put anybody to sleep, including the kids. Hey, Arnold was not easy to stay up to the most predictable and completely boring finale. If you want to send your children in a completely non-offensive film, then this is it. I get the feeling that instead of making a 90-minute film, the producers started with a 30-minute TV cartoon and tried to expand it to 90 minutes. This story of the Mall could definitely be shown in a television cartoon. I hope Arnold will bet on a better writer, if there is a sequel.
