Like Orson Welles thirty years ago, Mike Sarn received the “biggest train in the world,” but unfortunately he lacked the ability to do something more than just watch his train turn into a train wreck, which since they say with shock. and a strange kind of fear. Although postmodern interpretations somehow claim to be treated as gay or even a feminist treatise, the fact is that it was a serious disaster in 1970 and remains so today. so royally remains a carefully guarded secret. Only Michael Cimino ever approached the political and artistic Armageddon, which constitutes the “Gate of Heaven”. Both films seemed to be ego-trips for their respective directors, but at least Mr. Cimino made one of the great films of the 1970s before squandering the studio's bounty, while Mr. Sarn’s only had a pretty fake Joanna in the cabinet. In addition, the Gate of Heaven can boast of some memorable and well-managed scenery, where, unfortunately, the Mira Breckinridge locker was empty. Simply put, it is overwhelmingly the worst example of biting an arm that feeds in Hollywood history.
