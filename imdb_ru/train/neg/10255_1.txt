He has Christopher Lee, he has huge 1970s computer banks that make teletype sounds when letters appear on the screen, he has radioactive isotopes that not only glow in the dark, but emit pulsating drum noises, he has volcanoes! evil aliens disguised as nuns! tidal waves! earthquakes! exploding cars! exploding coffee machines! and as a climax, the whole planet explodes. How the hell did this movie turn out to be incredibly boring? The answer is, my friend, because 90% of this film consists of creating frames, most of which consist of long tracks, panning or zooming in combinations, or sometimes all three that do nothing but give the crew something to do.

I can not believe that this film was released in the same year as in "Star Wars" and "Close contacts." <br /> <br /> Lee, who always seemed to me to be a clever, helpful actor who knew his limits, gives out his lines as if he were going to kill his agent for dragging him into this pile of woods. I do not blame him.
