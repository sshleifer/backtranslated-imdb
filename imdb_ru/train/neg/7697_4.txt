This mini-series is actually more interesting than some others, with a much larger budget and big aspirations. SOTD is somewhere between "Kung-Fu" and "H R Pufnstuff" in the entertainment spectrum. If it had not been for so long (almost 3 hours), I think the children would like it. There are adventures, action, "cliffhenger scenes", and not too much romance or other "unsightly" things. When you are young, you are not too critical of bending rubber swords, hiking action, and repetitive scenes. (At least two scenes are repeated in the film the same way, as was done in the old-time TV shows, in order to bring the audience in order.) Finally, children usually more perceived the dialogue in American English coming from the mouth of Asian countries. actors (Not to mention the fact that several non-Asian actors play several major roles.) <br /> <br /> I was going to give this film three stars, but I felt like a director, a producer, and an actor. deserves some extra credit for at least continuing the project. This film is not art, but, like the picture of your house, it actually took some time, effort and discipline to create it. <br /> <br /> In general, it is not recommended to use your time, but it can keep children entertained while traveling in a mini van. <br /> <br /> Oh yes ... hey, IMDb! “Dialogue” is the preferred and traditional spelling. Your spell checker seems to think that “dialogue” is the correct spelling. Although “dialogue” is acceptable, both Webster and OED consider it an alternative form.
