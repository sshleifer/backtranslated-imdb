Well, when the appearance of James Miller on cameo (which looks even more blurry than in Exorcist IV) is the high point of the picture that you have? <br /> <br /> This is a bit strange, a little rock and roll: mix two drunkards with money that are dragging your child everywhere with mummy dried in the swamp (have you already figured out this - DRY in the swamp?) in the basement Christopher Walken with a bad painting job, and a little girl who could be an interesting character if they developed her. <br /> <br /> I understand, sort of, that they are going to visit her relatives. After that .... Problem: There are some interesting memories that I have to assume that her mother died in a car bombing (I think). It is never related to anything. <br /> <br /> Problem: why do we need a grandmother? Now grandma can be interesting. She speaks Gaelic, or Celtic, or something like that. Maybe you can make something out of it. The best thing they can do is that she has a habit of tobacco. That's all. <br /> <br /> Problem: as a husband, they play a real running character. Is he a type actor (will he sell his wife to the devil? Maybe he can count on a trust fund that he manages for her), or is he imposed on a type (after all, he has a good haircut and good clothes)? He drinks, he hesitates. He is not a bad guy. Not very good. But unpleasant. Why didn't they do something to him? <br /> <br /> No problem: an old guy appears. Husband knocks him down. He returns to shoot down her husband. (This is pretty silly, but at least THIS character is motivated.) NOW - she is an alcoholic, he is an alcoholic; he could marry her just for her money. Grandma is locked in the bedroom. The blind uncle takes our heroine to the basement to show her the witch's mummy (are you following this?), Which can come to life. In fact, you KNOW that it comes to life, the music swells. A little girl lives in the house, brings tea to her grandmother (opens the door for this) and provides her grandmother with cigarettes. Periodically, the grandmother comes out. But nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Husband and wife lose a child in the house, subsequently losing their bedroom. Uncle cut his throat in the basement. The leading lady has a nosebleed. Husband drinks. They both drink. Despite all this, the terrible truth that is referred to in the first spoken voice is, my God, an abortion, when the leading woman was twelve years old. <br /> <br /> Despite all this hanging thread of ingredients, no one managed to get the story on the screen. There is no bridge between situations, no transition from mild anxiety to horrible horror, just long, slow scenes that won't go anywhere; no one really had anything to worry about - and they had places for it - an innocent child in charge of drunks, a grandmother who can be locked up because she is a monster, but no, her worst mistake is to smoke. She has great hair, good makeup. <br /> <br /> In short, without plot. Just a little random (predictable) violence in a dark library with gushing rain and a sound track forcing us to participate. You need more than a few drunkards and Christopher Walken to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​were good. Oh. Good scenery, nice wardrobe. The operator, at least, knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> I bought it. Poor me
