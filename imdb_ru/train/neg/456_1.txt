Add to the list of caricatures: the southern preacher and the "congregation", the singer with torches (Sophie Tucker?), The Dance Choir and The Mills Brothers - this only aggravates the situation. <br /> <br /> Hateful burlesques of "black" performers who themselves often appear in films to parody themselves and their race. Although the "Negro Comedy" may have been adopted at one time, today it is extremely insulting, and I doubt that it has ever been funny. Although I would not be offended, I do not think that I would laugh at the weak attempts at humor. However, as an 11-year-old white boy, I may not have understood some of them.
