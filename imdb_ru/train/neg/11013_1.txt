I enjoy bad movies, but it will not lead to anything. Despite what the assholes said, it is NOT funny. I know comedies and underground films, but itâ€™s so boring that a director and a director should NEVER be prohibited from sending anything other than local cable access EVER! To love films and comedies is to despise this film. Perhaps I will never know how unfriendly and boring this job was. If you like this movie, you are so stupid as sober, there is NOTHING here. ZERO! If you need to compare underground movies, see Kentucky Freedom Kino or the early John Waters. The film begins with the definition of satire, and I do not call anyone to show me a satire. This rule is for a comedy IT ... If it is funny, you can say or do ANYTHING, but if it is NOT funny, you are not satirical, you are not irritable, you are simply pathetic, and this film is simply not funny. ZERO!
