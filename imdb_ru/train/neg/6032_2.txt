I am a Christian who, as a rule, believes in the theology taught on the left. At the same time, I think, “Left from the back” is one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> To have a good movie, you need a well-written script. To the left of this is extremely lacking. On the one hand, it radically deviates from the book. Sometimes this is done in order to reduce the 400-page novel to a two-hour film, but in this film I saw changes that made no sense. <br /> <br /> One more thing - character development is zero. When the characters in the story are saved (I will not say who), the book makes it clear that this is a long process of self-digging. In the film, it is fast and artificial. The book is pretty well written when people like Rayford Steele, Buck Williams, and Hattie Durham seem real, but the film’s scenarios consistently give a quick review without any significant changes. In another scene, where one character is angry about being left behind (again, I will not say who), this seems artificial. <br /> <br /> I understand, as a Christian, I’m not comfortable with myself, to say that I didn’t like this film, but I cannot, with a clear conscience, recommend a film that I think was horribly shot. Perhaps it would be better to make the first book of 2-3 films. In any case, Christians need to realize that in order to take them as directors seriously, you need to start with a high-quality film. I understand that a lot of effort probably went to Left Behind, but I see it.
