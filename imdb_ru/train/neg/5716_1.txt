This film does not deserve the next few minutes that I will spend on his criticism, but I know that many people, like me, rely on IMDb.com to help me choose films. For this reason alone, I am writing this. <br /> <br /> “Live Broadcast” is similar to the Asian version of The Show of Unbelievable Torture of 1976 (aka “Bloodsucking Freaks”) http://www.imdb .com / title / tt0077247 /. Torture, dismemberment, murder, cannibalism ... of course, it's all here along with a third-class script, a pitiful game and a twisted failure of a black comedy attempt. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in China, but everyone speaks English. There are many girls in the film who are horrified by butchering dogs in the market, but are sexually excited about entering a porn salon. One girl who dislikes the dirt in the restroom counter in a few moments is still there, dealing with her boyfriend friends (as he got there at all, maybe the only attractive thing in the whole film.) The film is absolutely terrible, even for B- movie. Even if you downloaded it for free, it would be an insult to your hard drive.
