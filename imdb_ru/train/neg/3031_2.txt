Tony Scott destroys everything that can be interesting in Richard Kelly's cliche, ambiguous, overloaded with the script. Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) was a model who dropped out of school and became a bounty hunter. This is her story ... "sort of." <br /> <br /> The problem with this garbage is that the plot is not so much, and Scott’s extreme graphic stylization acts as a distancing mechanism in each frame. it makes us indifferent to everything in Harvey's chaotic life. <br /> <br /> You just don't give a damn about Harvey. Knightley plays her like an unpleasant, cynical guy who did nothing to justify our respect. She strikes at people she doesn’t like and throws off clothes and bans when the situation demands it, but she’s not exactly realistic and no less convincing Knightley. <br /> <br /> The film is boring. It is also loud and shackled by one of the most annoying musical scores I have heard in a long time. The last twenty minutes is a bad repetition of Scott's “Real Romance” climax when the Domino gang meets two sets of rival bad guys, which is a surprise! surprise! - destined to argue with each other on top of a casino in Las Vegas. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this potentially spectacular fire completely spoiled Scott and turns into an intricate, pretentious, meaningless exercise in celluloid masturbation. This is not an artistically bold or experimental design; it’s a failure at every level, because it doesn’t give us the entry points to life and the dilemmas of its characters. <br /> <br /> Mickey Roarke looks good like a bounty hunter, but he disappears in the background as the “Narration” progresses. Chris Walken turns into another awkward cameo, and Dabney Coleman, always solid, is underused. <br /> <br /> Do not be deceived by the multi-layered, stunt surface of this film. It's still turd, no matter how much you polish it.
