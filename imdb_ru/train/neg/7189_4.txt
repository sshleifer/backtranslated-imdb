What a total disappointment! A score of 6.1 here on IMDb has created some moderate expectations, but oh, I was disappointed. The first thing that worries me is the brain, stereotypical university students. Yes, I know that teenagers can be childish and so on, but why are they always portrayed in films as full-fledged morons? There was one character who, I think, was fine, but he / she (without revealing it here) was killed far to the end. Other characters were poorly executed, and even the alleged hero / heroine simply did not do it for me. On the positive side: the plot is pretty good, and the productions are valued higher for such films. Acting was generally not very good, Rutger Hauer stands out in a small role. But all this fails with soft and smart characters. You just stop taking care of them in 10 minutes. 4/10 (and this is generous).
