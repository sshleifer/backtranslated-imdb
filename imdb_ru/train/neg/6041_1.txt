This three-woman story is a very delicate study: Muriel (Charlotte Van Dand Eind) - the youngest, Laura (Els Dottermans), who is about 37 years old, and Martha (Frida Pittores), the oldest who is Muriel's mother. They live together in the same building. They have different life expectations. Vital Laura wants a child. Muriel comes from the countryside and wants to change his life in Brussels. Martha dreams of her youth when she was a little girl. In fact, nothing happens in this film, so you are waiting for something — for example, an accident — that can dramatize this story. Over time, you will find that director Dorothe Van Den Berge wants to create a psychological portrait of only three women and nothing more. This film is disappointing because you expect women to learn from their experience, and this is not so, so you have a feeling of emptiness.
