Is this a movie ??? Is this what the Indians are trying to show ?? I think this is another attempt by a mad director to overthrow Pakistani soldiers and in fact a country ... but what we, Pakistanis, know is that we always outrun India in every part of our lives ... not only in armed counters. <br /> <br /> Well ... this is badly filmed, like in the movie "Border" at the beginning of 1997 ... and the director and writer just tried to overcome the shame of defeat in Kargil by the Pakistani armed forces, creating films like these .. . <br /> <br /> One thing is very clear ... Whenever there is a meeting between Pakistan and India .... we will win .... !!! So Mr. Datta will try to make some good movies instead of silly movies like this.
