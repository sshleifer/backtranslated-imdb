I, being a Puerto Rican, had mixed fillings about this “documentary”. At first, I was offended that Mrs. Perez compared Senora Campos with Che Guevarra. Also just a fact mr. John Leguymeso does not have Puerto Rican origin. His parents came from Colombia. Whoever conducted the research on this issue was not very accurate. I feel that the future of our race depends on education. This message should have sounded throughout the film. Education is our road to freedom and power. I think that any future efforts of this film crew should make this a center of attention. In my opinion, this film leaned toward anti-American sentiment.
