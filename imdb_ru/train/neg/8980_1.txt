I will never forget that night when I saw this movie. We were on a submarine patrolling the North Atlantic, and it was a planned evening movie. We ALL surrendered after the second video. They did not even try to show it at midnight show. Instead, I want to repeat ... That's all I really have to say, but they have this stupid rule that my comment should contain ten lines. I should not complement the comment with random words, so I just keep talking until I get my ten BS lines. I could not find George Goble in the lists, but I remember him in the film. The volume was terrible, and the songs were even worse.
