... for one of the worst Swedish films ever ... forgive me for being boring. <br /> <br /> Firstly, I did not see the first one (I was bored, which is why I watched the 2nd movie). before the 1st), well, I hope that the first is better than this one, it was filled with strange scenes and very strange plot changes, for people who have seen it and think that 4/10 is high (believe me, I too), but it made me laugh a few times, because it was so weird, so bad, and I'm still laughing, thinking of punk who came up with this idea of ​​what would happen next "Det sjunde inseglet II". Sequels that are not based on a novel or a book are not often good, and this is a great example. <br /> <br /> Well, I will be honest with you: I laughed a little, there are some decent jokes in this and humor. But don't buy it, rent it. Just let another idiot do it or download it. <br /> <br /> 4/10 This film will be remembered, and the director probably already laughed ...
