First of all, I would like to say that I am a fan of Chris Rock. I like his other films, but this film is similar to my resume. The biggest bag of shit. Initially, Chris Rock plays a novice comedian who is afraid of a scene in a comedy building called Apollo. On the way home from a concert, riding a bike, he sees a woman he likes and is hit by a truck. Some time later, he chooses the body of an old, white and selfish millionaire. Then he dresses up as Outkast musical group, trying to replay the scene from the original, where he plays the role of jockey. Secondly, he returns to Apollo and tries to become a comedian whom he tried to be in his previous body, and begins to ignore the white population and tries to become black. Do you understand my drift? This film is terrible, it tries too hard to be like the original, and in the process it turns out like a bag of shit. Just take my advice, don't even watch this movie.
