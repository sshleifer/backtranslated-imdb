Unlike many, I do not consider the premise or theme of this show to be the least offensive. Its implementation, however, is a completely different matter. Like many negative movies, all decent jokes seem to have crashed into trailers. For most of the approximately 22 minutes, we sit in the dying wait of any piece of real humor. Or, at least, something not to worry with the console or to read carpet fibers. With a few exceptions, acting is terrible; The comical excessive emotion and gesticulation of some actors may well be suitable for a late-night commercial, but not for the prime-time comedy series (even Canadian). Despite the generally accepted original cultural look, I can't help but think that this is basically a CBC shot to replicate the success of Corner Gas. Unfortunately, they got the tone - and the script - is completely wrong for the prairies. The last insult is that they obviously could not even afford to do work on location in a real small town (why? Are they so hard to find in Saskatchewan?) They thought the public would be fooled by the exteriors in the center of Regina? As a proud Canadian, I hope that this will soon disappear, and that the rest of the world, reconciled by CBC writers, will quickly forget this colossal embarrassment of the sitcom.
