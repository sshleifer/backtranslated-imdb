The scientist on the island is deeply saddened by the death of his son, who died of kidney cancer. So he thinks: why not turn my dead son into a hammerhead shark? Well, who wouldn't? It is a little difficult to cope with the fact that the hammerhead shark that kills everyone is constantly called "Paul." In addition, the cast of William Forsythe as the hero of MacGyver - salvation - a kind of hero lacks confidence. On the other hand, there are some hot chicks that make you actually look at the screen while the shark Paul bites another to death. In fact, I find bad bi films quite amusing. But, for my taste, the film would have been much better if it had been made, say, $ 1,000,000 cheaper. Then it could be fun.
