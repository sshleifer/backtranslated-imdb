It’s interesting to read viewers ’comments on the Omega code ... many of the extremely positive comments were almost literally filmed from TBN broadcasts ... the film looks like it was made to go directly to the video to be sold in stock, except for part of the "Rapture" series, which was made by some other religious group in the 70s .. do not remember it? You do not remember it in a year or two. This is the first film that I have ever seen, where it was implied that your religious duty was to go to him and buy as many tickets as possible to save souls ... very shameful ... it just shows that if you are the son of a TV reporter You can also play High Roller Hollywood producer with female tithe money ...
