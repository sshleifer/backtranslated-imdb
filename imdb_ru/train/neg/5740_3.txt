I found that Darkness is too dark. He had some cool ideas and some ambitious ideas, nice battle scenes and some unexpected moments that made you sigh! BUT, this has been emphasized to the degree of confusion. You really don't know what always happens in dark scenes, and for a film shot on Super 8 Film, you already have all that nasty grain to deal with. As in the films of Nathan Schiff, this is too much. Director Leif Jonker seems to want to make an original film, but he lacks the knowledge of how to do it. The camera is never pointed in the right place, and the lack of fundamentals such as how to shoot simple dialogue scenes and how to cover a movie also hurts. The actors are all rather uneven and hammy. But despite all these shortcomings, the music is good, there is a lot of blood, and it varies from stupid putty to really good instruments. This is a classic, as it says? Is it worthy of the praise of two discs? NO. But this is a good first attempt. Now, if these guys stop patting themselves on the back about this film (from what I understand, the only thing they ever finished) and try again, they can do more.
