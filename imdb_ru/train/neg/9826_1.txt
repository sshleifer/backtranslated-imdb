I think it would be a great movie for a true believer in organized Christian dogma, but for anyone with an open mind who believes in free will, rational thinking, the separation of church and state, and GOOD science fiction, this is a terrible joke! br /> <br /> There are some well-known actors who either needed a lot of work or wanted to share their personal convictions with the rest of us pagans. <br /> <br /> It was entertaining for me. The film was entertaining me in the same way as "Reefer Madness". This film tried to teach the addict using scare tactics, just as this film tries to teach “Christian” principles with the threat of hell and unhappiness for good people who do not share their interpretations of our world. <br /> <br /> It made me howl with laughter and at the same time scare me to understand how many people really believe that our society should go back to the good old days of the 19th century!
