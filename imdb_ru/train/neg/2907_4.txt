For Chinese critics, as well as Chinese film fans from the outside, they often choose the best film in China, and, frankly, I donâ€™t understand it at all. What I saw was one of the most typical melodramas you can imagine, gently directed and acting, with a full shrew for the main character. Wei Wei (do not laugh) is an obstinate, young married woman who has suffered with her tuberculous husband (Yu Shi) over the past few years. This is after World War II, and they live with their husband's teenage sister (Hongmei Zhang) in a dilapidated house with little money (the man was rich when they got married). Together with her husband's best old friend (Wei Li), who was also his wife's boyfriend when they were teenagers. She thinks of escaping from her husband with this man, while her husband is largely unaware of this, thinking that he can draw his younger sister to his friend. This is an installation, and it will not go anywhere, whatever you expect. I really saw the remake, directed by Blue Kite Zhuangzhuang Tian. He works half an hour longer, and in fact is also pretty boring, but at least it was beautiful. This supposed classic is pretty unbearable.
