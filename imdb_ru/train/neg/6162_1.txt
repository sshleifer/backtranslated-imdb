"Smokey And The Bandit" was not exactly Shakespeare, but then nobody wanted it to be. It was a farce, but he had brains. He had a very clever script with definable characters and a funny conclusion. People left the theater with a smile. "Hooper" does not provide any of this. No reason to smile. If this should be a tribute to the Hollywood stuntman, it makes them look terribly lazy, providing only horribly posed battle scenes and one of the most unconvincing car jumps I've ever seen. Everything looks fake, poorly removed almost on purpose. Poor Sally Field (as a girl who squeezes her arms to the side) gets her weakest role, without a single funny or clever line (“If you make this jump, I will not be here when you return”). Burt Reynolds continues to look at the camera and wink, but the joke to any audience that sits through Hooper. * from ****
