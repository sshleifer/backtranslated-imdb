CARRY ON MATRON was released in 1972, and it becomes clear that the series has reached its natural end with better recordings, such as CLEO, UP THE KYBER and SCREAMING, which were in the mid to late 60s. <br /> <br /> MATRON itself is not bad at all, we just saw it all before with a thin plot (a group of people trying to get into the hospital to steal a supply of birth control pills they plan to sell to third world countries) surrounded by jokes a little funny, though unsophisticated nature. I think this is the problem - jokes are not that funny when an inexperienced person starts to show his age. Do we need another film in which a man plays in women's clothes to lead the plot? Perhaps the worst criticism I can do is that I saw CARY ON THE MACHINE this afternoon, less than twelve hours ago, and I had a problem trying to remember a very funny phrase. This is a serious problem for comedy.
