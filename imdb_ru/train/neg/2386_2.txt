I missed this movie in the cinema, but I had a thought in my head that it was worth watching, so when I saw it on the shelves on DVD, I thought it was time to watch it. Big mistake! <br /> <br /> A long list of stars can not save this turkey, of course, one of the worst films in history. An incomprehensible plot is poorly delivered and poorly presented. Perhaps it would make more sense if I read the Robbins novel, but if the film is not completely different from the novel, and if Robbins helps in the script, I doubt that this novel should also be painful. <br /> I hope that the actors are well paid, as they looked embarrassed due to the fact that they were in this waste of celluloid and later DVD-forms, for example, Pat Morita. Even Thurman has time to look uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Save about 98 minutes of your life on something more useful, for example, trim your toenails or disassemble socks. Even if you see him in a disposable basket worth less than $ 5, do not be tempted!
