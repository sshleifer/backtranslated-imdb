This program is really overrated. A detective like the hot character of Danny Pino would be transferred to the “team of rubber guns” a few years ago. The whole team consists of sanctimonious egomaniacs who judge people whose actions go back for decades to 2007 standards. Every Vietnam veteran character they ever had turned out to be a killer, if not another Vietnamese veteran. There was only one black killer, and he was put to it by his white boss. The only Latin American killer was a “traitor race” who killed another Latin American to substitute a Latin American street child for a crime that two rich white children (naturally) committed. What a bunch of propaganda. Hey, screenwriters: minorities and the poor also commit murder. Only in this series, most white killers are top-class assassins. <br /> <br /> Moreover, arrests of people over 70, 80 and 90 years old for crimes they committed 50-60 years ago are a joke. No acting district attorney will insist on murder, because this means that the staff will be stuck in their huge medical bills until they finally kick. The state will provide services to their families and insurance companies. The prosecutor simply begs them to commit manslaughter, and they will not last a day. The only really old criminals who go to jail are either organized crime figures or ex-Nazis whose high-profile convictions contribute to a DA career.
