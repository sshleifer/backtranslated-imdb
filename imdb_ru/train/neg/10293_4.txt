Every night my wife and I watch a film, without distraction, and mostly feature films that require thinking. I have tons of patience for films that are slowly flourishing. My wife has twice as much attention as me. All this, as they say - this film is just empty and boring! It is not gone anywhere. Never bloomed. It all began quite promisingly with a promising conspiracy ... then she bakes a cookie ... leaves for Spain ... she sulks, she looks ... loans roll. Uneven, full of holes, false starts and dead ends. We flipped through several consecutive episodes when she just looked into space. Artificial depth was implied when she played with mud and cried. Zzzz ...... This is like a beautifully made film that pretends to be deep or fanciful. You will never know or understand Morvern at all. About halfway you no longer care. We just wanted to see the development of at least one of the storylines. Do not waste your time on this. I'm shocked, this is so high.
