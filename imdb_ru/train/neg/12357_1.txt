I will be short and to the point. This film was an insult to anyone with an IQ of room temperature. Sorry liberals, feminists, etc. No woman will ever be a seal. They can forget about the call or that are in battle. It will not happen. You see, no matter how difficult it is to understand or accept, men and women are physically different. Regardless of the fact that it is 2007, reality cannot change the state of things so that people cannot hurt their feelings. Men cannot give birth or breastfeed children (oh, I forgot about San Franquino). <br /> <br /> Women lack physical strength to be on a par with men in combat or in other difficult physical situations. How many women play in the NFL or NHL? And finally, I could not give a bloody cry in hell, if what I have just written grieves you. Think about it - if it upsets you, it will only warm my heart. I did not write one thing that was not true. This stupid movie is nothing like comedy and lousy.
