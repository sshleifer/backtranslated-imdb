The king is dead, long live the king! The Caddy Shack Two triad, “The Family Under the Stairs” and “Beverly Hills Troops” were so much associated with the worst movie that they seemed to be icons themselves. But there is a new king ..... yes ..... everyone welcomes the new king .... To the ground. But some things, like Tiny Tim, are so bad that they are good. Someday this can bring out the inimitable “Rocky Horror Show” as a cult film. So go see this .... this .... well, just take my word for it. Go look. Hail new king!
