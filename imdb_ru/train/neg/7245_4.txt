I'm not fond of The Pallbearer, it's not so bad, but just very slow. As the movie continues, it becomes a little more interesting, but nothing brilliant. I really like David Schwimmer, and I think he's good here. I'm not a big fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but I don't mind her sometimes, and she's fine here. “Pallbearer” is not a highly recommended movie, but if you like leading roles, you might like it.
