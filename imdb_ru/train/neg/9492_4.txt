One star for the "plot." One star for acting. One star for American dubbing with a creaky voice. Five stars for Monica Brooke and Inge Maria Grantsou with their inclination to remove all clothes. And ten out of ten for the divine Emmanuel Bear, two years before she made the Manon des sources. Bear also undresses a couple of times, but even her fully dressed enough to make this film extremely watchable. Beware of the scene where she tells her friend about the three “first times” for a girl. This is trivial, but still much more erotic than the rather ridiculous choreographic “love scenes” with the participation of Brooke, Granzov and Patrick Bauhau. By the way, cinematography is not great; shots for closing credits are the best indicator of what David Hamilton is capable of.
