This is a bad movie. Not one of the funny bads either. This is a lousy bad. It was actually painful to watch. The direction was terrible, with lots of jumping around, and the green and yellow hues used in the film make the characters look painful. Keira Knightley wasn't convincing at all, like a tough chick, and I can't believe that Lucy Liu and Mickey Rourke signed up for this criminal embezzlement of celluloid. The script was terrible, and the game looked like nails on a board. If you have not seen this, do not. You are missing nothing and will waste only two hours of your life watching this chatter. I used to see bad movies and even enjoyed them because of their mistakes. This is just a waste of time.
