This one acts like a satire in the era of the women's rights movement. Of course, this does not mean that COACH (film) is a wonderful experience. It is in the same spirit as FASTBREAK (which was better, but still manual), and is basically a standard fare. What I mean is that this film is not interesting is easy to understand. Anyone who spends time away from ordinary work, teaching a bunch of crazy people who earn their way to a sudden victory spends nothing. This is the same feeling you can get after seeing it. A good attempt to quit the opposite sex for male debt, but I expected better.
