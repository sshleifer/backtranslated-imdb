Several critics awarded this film with positive comments. I do not want to argue with their opinion, but I strongly disagree. When I first watched this movie, I was slightly impressed. But after comparing it with other films, especially with the late master Bruce Lee, I quickly changed my mind. In fact, if it were not for the title of the film, I would never have bought it. The Game of Death 2 is not related to the original Game of Death (except for the fact that one character participates in it, Billy Lo.) <br /> <br /> I was stunned to see how the Game of Death 2 looked like the Sign Dragon. The plots have striking similarities: both Bruce Lee and Bobby Lo pursue the goal of avenging a relative. These two locations are similar, in which they are both very isolated and surrounded by thousands of black belts. In both films there is an element of prostitution (women receive two guest rooms in both films). Han (“Enter the Dragon”) and minion Lewis have no arm. This is an underground drug operation in “Introduce the Dragon”, believe it or not, in the “Death Game” there is one. Han has a pet cat in the Introduce the Dragon, the director used his imagination and awarded Lewis his favorite monkey! The list continues. <br /> <br /> Regarding other aspects of the film, such as script and acting, I felt that it was very bad. It seemed to me that the director was looking for a group of martial arts masters for the filming of the film and prayed that they could act. <br /> <br /> In a positive sense, I cannot deny that the choreography is impressive. Although combat sequences contain strong elements of acrobatics, they are nevertheless skillfully executed. However, since the plot is insufficient, I could not relate to the characters, so the fighting episodes were more exhibition than the meaning of the film. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would say that this film is recommended for all martial arts lovers, but for those who love the exciting action movie with a good storyline and strong characters, I seriously do not recommend this film. , My opinion about this film may seem very biased and one-sided, but when Bruce Lee set a new standard in the martial arts cinema, especially after his masterpiece: “Join the dragon,” this film could not rise to these standards. In any case, they imitated a truly brilliant martial arts film in the hope of achieving the same level of fame. <br /> <br /> With regard to my assessment, awarding this film a very harsh rating of 1 out of 10, the film can be watched for barley, and he must be grateful for the fighting sequences in it.
