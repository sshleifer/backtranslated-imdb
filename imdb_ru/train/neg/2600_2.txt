Here we have a film that fails in almost every way when a film can fail. Horrible script, lousy game, amateur directing, ridiculous special effects ... it's just a horrible movie. Not to mention that when you get to the end, you will realize that all this does not make sense. Having spent the entire film thinking about what is happening here in the world, when everything is finally explained, you understand that the story was built on a foundation that is ridiculously impossible. In one of these disgusting sequences of “The Villain Explains the Entire Film,” we are told that our villain did something that simply cannot be done, and which absolutely does not make any sense. Oh, and after that we see that there is also some kind of jelly monster there. I’m sure Drew Barrymore would really like to pretend that this movie never happened. If for some godless reason you ever feel like sitting down and watching this film, I can suggest instead that you spend the time banging your head against the wall for 104 minutes. It would have been a much more pleasant experience than sitting in this garbage.
