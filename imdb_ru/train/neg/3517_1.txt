I don't know who wrote the script for this film, but from the first moment I was annoyed. Of all the possible decisions they can make in the mountains, why do they make the decision that is the most dangerous of all? Why do criminals behave stupidly, although they managed to get a huge amount of money out of the bank and get away with it? Why the main criminal does not get on the helicopter, does not shoot at Stallon, doesn’t have enough money and doesn’t fly away with the nestling hostage? And there are still cases of illogical behavior. I would give this film 5 points for good action and magnificent landscape landscapes, but because of the illogical behavior of the characters, I just can give this movie 1 point ...
