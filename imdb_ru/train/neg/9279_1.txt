As in many other franchise series about pop culture, this line simply did not know when to quit smoking. Instead of leaving things as they were finally finished, they continued to generate it; The first batch of this franchise failed. <br /> <br /> This movie was not supposed to be. It was not intended to be the fourth film in this line, and it certainly shows. The parcel is idiotic, and the images were the same. <br /> <br /> After the wonderful experience that was Omen, it was a big disappointment that smelled of 70s cheese and a terrible game.
