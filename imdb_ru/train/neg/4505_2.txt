“Memoirs of a Geisha” is a beautifully made film, there is no doubt about it. And in general, the game is great, at least in terms of how it portrays the characters in the script. <br /> <br /> However, so many details, small and large, are simply _wrong_ that I’m just too worried about being able to enjoy it to the fullest. The small detail that characterizes the lack of sensitivity is one scene (no, it doesn’t spoil anything) when Mamekha rings a bell hanging at the door of the house where Sayuri lives on a snowy winter day. The bell on which she rings is furin or wind chime - it is left hanging outside homes in Japan only in the summer! People in traditional Japanese homes did not have doorbells - they just opened the door and declared themselves. (You may think that this is such a trivial detail, but I would compare it with a film about America, where in July a Christmas wreath hangs on the door and no one thinks about it.) And you don’t even make me think about completely wrong hairstyles, data Maiko and Geisha, who are vaguely pan-Asian / Chinese / Kung-fu-ish, and nothing like real ones. I think that this is a rather cavalier attitude towards the culture that they are trying to portray, it really manifests itself in attitude and in the depiction of people and situations. <br /> <br /> So, I believe that the less you know about Japanese culture and the world of geisha and maiko in Kyoto (what Miyako is), the more you will enjoy it. Honestly, I think this film could have been much better ... since this is just another Hollywood version of "exotic Japan."
