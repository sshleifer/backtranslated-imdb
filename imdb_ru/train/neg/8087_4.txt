The film lacks faith in the helicopters, which was not until the 1950s. But no woman would have done what was done here, even a woman before the women's movement of the 60s and 70s. The only part of the film you could believe in was that Germany wanted to know where the landing would be. For now, ignore the fact that the British seized all the spies, but even if they did not, they would not allow them to wander in such a way as to convince the Germans that the landing would be in Calais. This is not one important thing that makes a movie not work. This is the culmination of all the bad things that make a movie a failure. Bad direction, bad scripts, the lack of authentication attempts (in general) - all this leads to the film collapsing. Generally speaking, spies should disappear in woodwork. A spy appears in anticipation, wondering whether the information they have is valid or not and worrying about detection. That was the end of the game from the start. This spy was doing something other than spying. Your only chance to get something that has some credibility and some concern, maybe read a book.
