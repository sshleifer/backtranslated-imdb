My complaints here relate to the pace of the film and the material at hand. Although the use of archival films and letters gives the film a fresh and interesting perspective, too often the material selected for selection is simply not very interesting (for example, when Goebbels complains about a particular ailment and so on. Small German hometown). In addition, the film is crawling in the coating c. 1920â€“1939, and then passes through the war years. In general, the film is a little better than the documentary of the Historical Channel, except that the director has a little more sensitivity than your regular documentary editor of The Historical Channel, and thus can make the details of Goebbels more cleverly. However, I found this desire.
