I could not believe that I spent $ 14.00 on it. The only redeeming quality is outrageous blood. Duplication was worse than ever. Looks like it was taken from a VHS camcorder. I think every pfennig was spent on special effects, because everywhere there was a lot of blood and body parts. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen, but I have to admit that copious blood was not as disgusting as it could be, because the whole movie is so stupid and incredible.
