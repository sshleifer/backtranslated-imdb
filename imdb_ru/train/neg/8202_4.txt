Whether this is a remake of The Thing (1982/1951), I think there are many factors from previous films that deny it. <br /> <br /> So the game is bad, James Spader makes a super-low reconstruction of the stargate about himself, with his mug and some strange thoughts / movements, but that's all, other actors that I did not even notice. You do not have the feeling of dating with any of the main characters. And the plot develops slowly, boringly and, yes, I know what will happen in 30 minutes. The score / music is incredibly boring, that is, there are a lot of people with an incredible mind who will earn points for Coca-Cola and credit, but this is serious shit. Some of the special effects are good if they were made in the early 90s. If you like the slimy newcomers, chills and thrills, do not make this film. This is a boring combination of “Things”, “Alien 3”, “Flash” and some production by Jerry Bruckheimer / Michael Bay, which is really very bad. Now this combination would be cool if someone knew what they were doing, and the only ones who knew about it were nobody. <br /> <br /> Although I have seen much worse, I would not recommend this film. to anyone, but if you wake up on a cold night and just want to look at something, it will pass slowly.
