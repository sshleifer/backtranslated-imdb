I have never seen a comedy that would be such a hard work to sit ... not a single laugh at that. Well, maybe one little laugh for Michael Clark Duncan as a big black bald gay virgin. But the rest was shockingly funny. From above to be devoid of all laughter, "parodies" go on forever! Stay away from this if you value your time and money. Scary !!! The worst!!!
