<br /> <br /> What remains of planet Earth is inhabited by several poor and hungry surviving rags. They should eat insects and insects, or something else, after a poisonous war, or something else, almost destroyed all human civilization. In these dark times, one of the few people on Earth who can still live in comfort, we will call him the All-Knowing Big Boss, has a big task in preventing some secret seeds from falling into the air. It seems that the All-Knowing Big Boss is the last person on Earth who knows that these disputes even exist. The spores are far from any living soul, and they are highly protected by many layers of deadly defense systems. <br /> <br /> An all-knowing big boss wants secret disputes to remain in secret protected containers. Thus, he plans to send a macho team to remove containers with disputes from all defense systems and secret locations. Sending people to a location of secret dispute makes them no longer a secret. Sending people to turn off all protective systems makes it easy to release spores into the air. How about letting sleeping dogs lie ?! <br /> <br /> One of the nice features of ENCRYPT is the radiant and elegant Vivian Vu. As the inconspicuous members of macho fighters leave with a mechanically predictable time, the attractiveness of charm Vivian W. makes the plot idea of ​​her old employer who wants her so much acceptable. She is an object of love, an object of desire is a very believable concept! <br /> <br /> Fans of Vivian Wu may want to see the outstanding B-film she starred in a couple of years ago and which is called DINNER. Burst RUSH DINNER is highly recommended. ENCRYPT no.
