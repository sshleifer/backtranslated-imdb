So far, the worst movie I've ever seen was Ben and Arthur. You really should check out the reviews on this movie instead. Statistics review of this film was distorted due to the relentless and unfair pressure from some people involved in its creation, evidence that is quite easy to find on the Internet. At the very least, the people who made Ben and Arthur were honest enough to allow him to stand on their own wobbly legs, instead of shamelessly promoting him to fuckers like me, to buy him. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is horrible, the script, the story, the actors, the actors, the direction, the picture, the montage, the music ... what else is included in the film? Whatever it is, everything is so bad here. If it were not so unpleasant, it would be funny. I kept watching him, thinking that it should get better, because I have not yet found that none of the positive reviews for him are reliable. <br /> <br /> To create a great movie, you don't need a lot of money, and a low budget does not mean that the movie should be bad. My favorite example of a small budget masterpiece is the amazing Mala Nosha Gus Van Santa, but there are many others. The secrets of the sideline "Cutting or cutting the original" - this is bad not because the people who did it did not have money, but because they had a huge ego and had no talent for anything other than self-promotion.
