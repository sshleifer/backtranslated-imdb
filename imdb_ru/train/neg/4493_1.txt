I tried to remove everything that could be considered a spoiler. I also assume that you saw the first film, or at least know the general gist, so if you don’t have it, it might not make sense. <br /> <br /> Story: this film is ahead of the audience. head again and again with weary philosophical conversations in an attempt to convey a topic. We are bombarded again and again with questions of purpose, destiny, and choice, and we have to endure the long, painful sessions of banality in which they are contained. <br /> <br /> Neo, waking up from a dream in the last film, Now begins a period of awareness of his own existence. There are many revelations in this film, about which I will not be clear, so that they do not seem to be spoilers. <br /> <br /> * If you are still worried, vague links will spoil the movie, don’t t read the paragraph below. * <br /> <br /> Strength and weakness of faith are revealed. The strengths and weaknesses of love and its temporary nature are also revealed. The interdependence of people and technology, as well as our faith in technology, is also revealed. The importance of choice and experience is revealed. The explanation of the further things that will be revealed is too detailed, so I will refrain (as required by the guide for writing a comment). By the way, by “open” I mean, like in our ears and eyes, like nails, they knock. <br /> <br /> Storyline: So how does Neo and the gang get from the end of the last movie to the beginning of the next one? In short, they retain faith, use and abuse excessively stylized actions and time, as if it goes out of fashion (and after this show, I hope that movie lovers and filmmakers will learn to appreciate a little subtlety and originality) More). More on this later. In order not to spoil anything, I will say no more than the promotional material has already done: Neo is still trying to figure out the Matrix, and he is looking for answers, trying to save people, and Zion, while the villains are following him. and his cohorts. The film starts from the point where the last one stopped. <br /> <br /> Action: while martial arts and gunfights filled their predecessor in several equal parts, this film focuses more on martial arts than on weapons, adding swords, and so on. Special effects are so often used and waving in the face of the audience that it becomes really tedious. I discussed this film with both friends and colleagues, and almost all of them found that some action films, especially the “Smith fight” that we all heard about, will be in the film - they are too long and tedious. This is a huge red flag for militant fans, because the end of the militant sequence must either leave you a little more desire or be completely content with the surprise that has just occurred. <br /> <br /> These fighting scenes lead nowhere, They are overly stylized, overly consistent, wooden and boring. In the first film there was a real sense of despair for some actions, a feeling that the struggle was for survival, and not just look good (which I honestly don’t think they are doing in Reloaded anyway) in black and leather. Watch the movie "Drunken Master" or "Iron Monkey" after this film to remind yourself of good combat sequences - you will not regret it. In addition, the “matrix abilities” that people have in Reloaded are not consistent, and what they actually do is not agreed. The first film had its inconsistencies, but they were not too bright - unlike Reloaded. <br /> <br /> Special effects are added and switched on and off. Every little thing that someone does, be it a jump, a flip, a spin, and in many cases just a pose, <br /> <br /> slow, bullet synchronization or excessive amplification by some kind of destruction. Obviously, W Bros had a lot of money to throw at this film, and they threw it, without real restraint. Keen editors might really help this, but the first film was such a hit that a free board was given, which brings us to this. . <br /> <br /> Character and dialogue. I have more or less said that the dialogue is tired and full of philosophical platitudes. Actors cannot really give their character more depth when the script and direction reflect the viewer's face or do not neglect them. Viewers are never given nuances and pithiness so that they can independently contemplate a character. <br /> <br /> Keanu's acting is tough at best. Keanu is good at confusion, and that's all he does in this film. He makes a decent attempt to show the passion between Neo and Trinity, but it fails. <br /> <br /> Lawrence tries to make everything from Morpheus, from Moses to Henry V, and be as cool as a cat in everything. With the script given to him, he makes a noble attempt, but she also fails. <br /> <br /> Moss is also not very believable. Her concern always remains the same as that of Keanu, and there is no chemistry there, although they imitate quite well in their very physical scenes. <br /> <br /> Hugo again had his strange feeling Agency program, but he also suffered from the script. I actually consider him the most interesting character from the whole group, but instead of developing, they simply make him an excuse for a huge, prolonged battle scene. <br /> <br /> In general, this film does not disappoint if you had good expectations, and alone, as in a separate film (and this is not how it should be shot), it is still terrible. I do not see the Matrix so deep, but I, at least, see in it a pleasant fantastic game, in which there are several interesting ideas, good actions, some funny lines and quite restrained symbolism and elusiveness to entertain the attentive. The reboot failed for all these indicators, and I very much hope that W Bros will give us the best experience in the 3rd part. Of course, after this film I didn’t have much hope for it.
