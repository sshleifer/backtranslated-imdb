Do not spend your money on this film. Do not even get in the car and do not think that you can watch this movie if someone else does not like you. If you need to watch a movie this weekend, go see Batman again. <br /> <br /> The script was terrible. Excellent written from a random horror movie. Given: a place in a confined space, crazy with different weapons, a curious man who manages to uncover all the clues that honest cops cannot gather, and an innocent and overly curious, but beautiful and strong woman with whom many in the audience would like to have call your girlfriend. Mix together, add a lot of badly executed blood and, damn it, let's add some freaks to “unleash” the plot a little. <br /> <br /> The game was terrible, and the characters are incredible - Borat was more believable than that. <br /> <br /> *** A spoiler *** and can someone please say how a butcher's vest can make a ricochet from a bullet after being shot, without even forcing the person who was shot to shudder ?? ? I'm in the army. We need such things for ourselves. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10, and I would put them in decimal numbers, rounded up to get the lowest possible score.
