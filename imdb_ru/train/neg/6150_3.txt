I saw this film with the intention of not loving it. I'm sure not. This is one of those films that seem to have been made exclusively for the Oscars: music throughout the entire film in almost every single frame, almost without profanity, shot in ancient times, images in sepia tones, pretentious title, NO SEX and genius, which explains everything he thinks and draws conclusions in sfx / cgi, so that we (the stupid audience) understand this. One thing that amused me is that they wrote the NOBLE PRICE WRONG! Instead, they call the Nobel price (named after an actual person named Alfred Nobel) "a noble price" ... Jesus! How can you make such a mistake in such a large production, presumably based on a true story. What a sham! What did you and others think about Ron?
