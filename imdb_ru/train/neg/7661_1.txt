The title of the worst movie of all time is one that is distributed quickly and often. In most cases, this is an exaggeration, but I would like to greet Alone in the Dark in a short list of real candidates: Plan 9 from Space, Battlefield Earth and the Adventures of Pluto Nash. <br /> <br /> When I watched a 90-minute lesson, it was difficult for me to even be awake, even when I tried so hard to laugh at the film. But, alas, I felt lonely in the dark (I tried to avoid a pun, but I could not resist) when I looked around in the hope of seeing Mike Nelson and his two robot friends. Alas, me and my friends had to give comedies throughout the film. <br /> <br /> So ... about the movie itself. Let's talk about action and effects, as this should be the only positive part of the film. The film contains evil creatures, which are a cross between xenos in aliens (they even call them xenos) and creatures in pitch darkness. May accidentally become invisible (and I assure you that this is an accident) and get injured by the light. There are also small centipedes used to control people, who make them into something like a zombie. All this is shown with outdated special effects that would be mediocre in 1997. The scene is chaotic and impossible to follow. People shooting randomly on the stage with a blue screen or an empty set of monsters that were inserted into the post. The light quickly flashes on a dark screen, causing your students to burn from overwork, while bad rock music rattles in the background. <br /> <br /> And these were the main points. The story revolves around a paranormal investigator (Slater), whose idea to look tough is to wear a black women's t-shirt with a raincoat and not shave for 2 days. Archaeologist (Raid), who is rather inept. And a government agent (Dorff) whose positions relate to the order of the barking. All three should be ashamed of their performances (not that they have ever really done a good job before), and the casting director should be ashamed. I believe that Reed and Slater are lovers in the film. The film contains one of the most awkward love scenes I have ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> Then the plot begins. Frankly, those parts that make sense are not at all interesting. The rest is illogical at best. Story holes may contain the collective egos of all three stars. The film begins with a text and voice explaining the story. This discovery lasts more than a minute, and the viewer already knows that something awful is waiting for him. This introductory narrative is later repeated in an awkward dialogue in an awkward dialogue in a very awkward and hard way until the end of the film. And the ending did not make sense. Not only did it not make sense in the world of the film, it simply did not make sense. <br /> <br /> Finally, the direction of one is Uwe Boll. Shame, that's all you can say. Its use shakes the camera to pretend the unknown. His lack of directing with the actors. Just watch Reed in scenes in which she is not the focus of the frame. A complete waste of special effects money for the effects of bullet time. Finally, he decided to use voice-over to explain something that should be painfully obvious to viewers. <br /> <br /> I paid $ 1.50 to watch this show at the second launch cinema. And even though my friends and I laughed to justify myself every quarter, I would advise people not to pay again for this film. Take about 3 friends and divide the rental price and tear this movie to a new one. <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Uwe Boll. Shame on you, Tara Reid. Shame on you, Christian Slater. Shame on you, Stephen Dorff. Shame on whoever is associated with this movie.
