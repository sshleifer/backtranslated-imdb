I am not surprised that even cowgirls get the blues if this film is anything to go through. I was expecting something better from Uma Thurman, which is why I experienced this experience. A terrible movie with only music as a redemptive quality. It is just a shame that we cannot give 0 out of 10 in these reviews. This film deserves it.
