I didn’t expect it to be a great movie, but I didn’t expect it to be so terrible. I hated my mother so much that I had to switch the channel. I turned him back, hoping that this was only one part of the film, but no. And for the daughter sitting there, you need to be embarrassed, or almost dismissed from work, or driven to distraction in your own home? Are you kidding me? I was raised to respect (and even fear) my mother, but I would quickly put her in a nearby hotel if she proves that she’s annoying in MY house. In the end, I had to follow a number of rules in my mother's house. <br /> <br /> I have not bought any of this. I tried to give him a few chances, really. Sorry.
