This film is so bad and worse in every imaginable fashion. This is not just a bad game and scenario, and this is not a weary and perverse time that is spent on watching it. What really puts this film in my hall of shame is the obvious struggle that the writers and producers do with the film to try to make it ridiculous. The actress, who replaces the descendant Jean Reno, came to old age and learned her lesson in the first film, so that they would add a new girl who was to marry. Almost all the original add-ons and jokes come back, but this time I want to rip the eyes out of their sockets, because this is a waste of a completely good movie. The torment of constant cuts and camera shots in any scene of this film can lead the viewer to cruel convolutions. This second film takes a successful original and pulls it out of the coffin and parades the corpse in the square, and distorts not only the original idea and its legacy, but also our intellect. This film, unlike the fir goose, could not fly, because in the principals returning for the “necklace” there was no plot. There is no script, since it was written and added to daily. Ignore the camera or snapshots in mind. Poor lighting and special effects are made for this. This film does not even get away for a student film in the main film 101. As this pile has passed, no one can say. It was a great loss-making investment, and it seems that no one had the strength to rid this unnatural cruel mistake from our suffering. This movie has one good part ... its END! This film is my worst No. 1 film of all time, finally, Howard Duck is no longer a goose.
