This is not just the plot that makes this movie an instant disconnect for bored viewers. This is a terrible direction with a horrible script and errors on the left and right that make it too painful to watch. Sorry, but I do not see this "fun." Just thrills pointing to a lot of mistakes and silly one-line players. Well, I wonder how stupid the directors think about their production company when this film was first introduced. Probably as stupid as the sheriff who dived into a pickup truck, full of antifreeze, with a gaping bloody wound. Unfortunately! Did I forget to mention that this sheriff is not only a bad actor, but can also relieve himself of the antifreeze that permeates the open flesh? I think he forgot when he won a not so exciting victory over a snowman.
