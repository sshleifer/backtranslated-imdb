I remember watching this movie a long time ago on TV. I remember the premise of the film about how a group of people living in a hotel was attacked by man-eating ants. What I did not remember, so this is HOW IT'S HORRIBLE !!! <br /> <br /> I recently filmed this movie on TV late at night. I am sure that this must be a mistake, because such films usually disappear and will never be found again! Suzanne Somers (at the top of her career, playing Chrissy in Company of Three) plays a rest in the Lakewood estate. Construction workers install the pool outside and randomly resent the ant nest. Or should I say, * nest ants ants * !! Ants attacked one of the workers. In one minute, he takes them off his clothes one by one, and the next minute he covers them. The following scene shows a skeleton in the mud. <br /> <br /> If you thought it was rather far-fetched, you should see how Myrna Loy plays the role of a resident in a wheelchair that flies out of the estate by plane in a helicopter! I could almost imagine how relieved she thinks she is coming out of the film through the air! <br /> <br /> In the final scenes, Suzanna, Robert Foxworth and the third guy, sitting on the floor of the hotel room with their backs to each other, are depicted blowing through a straw and covered with ants. <br /> <br /> This is basically a movie. In fact, the film does not have the appeal of "disaster" or "big star." At the time, it was intended as a “large-scale” television event. Now, if you're lucky, if it is thrown away at 4:00 am on your local TV channel. <br /> <br /> If you want to catch Susan Somers at his best, watch the episode of Company of Three. If you want Mirna Loy to do something to put bread on the table and pay bills, watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 0/10
