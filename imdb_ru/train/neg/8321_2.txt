Hayden Chrischenson and Jessica Alba are two of my least favorite actors of this century. Unite in the fact that it is entirely possible for the flattest attempt at remaking the already deplorable Butterfly Effect. Awakening is so boring and completely uninteresting that you should sleep better. Terrance Howard, still recovering from the devilish August fever, makes a decent fight when the sadistic doctor seems to be obsessed with the idea of ​​killing Christianson, and after watching his speech, I will be happy to help. <br /> <br /> Alba, still recovering after the Fantastic Four. Rise of the Silver Surfer. Naturally catastrophic and no less noticeable, as it always was. Only once was she so brilliant that she was in the safe hands of chief director Robert Rodriguez in Sin City. Could it be that Jessica Alba is not so poor an actress, as many consider her due, and perhaps her acting ability is reduced due to a bad script. If so, this explains Awake. What a scenario that would disgrace the Plan 9 scenario from Space. <br /> <br /> Jessica Alba, Hayden Christenson and Terrence Howard starred in the nervous psychological thriller of the new director / screenwriter Joby Harold about a person who experiences a frighteningly common surgical phenomenon known as “aesthetic awareness” in which those who are laid out operating table, acutely aware of what is happening around them, despite the fact that they remain completely paralyzed and unable to cry for help. When a successful young man (Kristenson) goes under the knife and realizes that anesthesia has not quite coped with his work, horror quickly comes when his excited wife (Alba) is anxiously awaiting, and a terrifying drama unfolds in the operating room. <br /> <br /> Hoping to do for the operating tables what “Final Destination” did for airplanes, this is the first effort by director Joby Harold to unfold in a bloody vanity. The sequence of pre-credits tells us that one in 700 people suffers from a phenomenon known as “anesthesia awareness” when the patient remains conscious, but paralyzed during the operation. One of these unfortunate people is Clayton Beresford, Jr. (Hayden Christensen), who is awake during a heart transplant ... and he can feel every bit of it. <br /> <br /> With interruptions in invention, when he probes his torture Mind, Awake can not introduce true horror into his new premise. The spirals from frightening simplicity into an absurd conspiracy, this is hampered by the stilted turns of Christensen and Jessica Alba. Would you like to lay out a sedative before watching? <br /> <br /> Verdict: Awake is, at best, very undemanding. A jolt-free film that surely looked better on paper. Like a movie, although its terribly common and extremely derivative. “Awake” fails to introduce horror into his new premise. The end result is really pretty lousy. Alba and Christian are the least of your worries, since the main drawback of the film is its inability to scare the audience. “Awake” is a film through which you are most likely to wake.
