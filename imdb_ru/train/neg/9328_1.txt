I was lucky! I got a peak peak from this pathetic little horror movie filmed in Texas from Artisan Entertainment a week before he came out on the shelves with a video, and let me tell you ... I rarely laughed so much in my life like when I watched this terrible megabomb flying off the rails and stealing the title of the “worst movie-killer clown” shot at the unbearably stupid Full Moon fiasco by Killjoy (I’m sure many of us horror fans were hurt by this!) it was filmed on DV, and in fact it doesn't “look” so bad in terms of quality for digital technology, but damn it, it fails with a bang in any other area where it matters! <br /> <br /> The story (insignificant) and cliché, as it is, goes like this ... The manager (Ken Hebert, who also wrote the scripts and with the director) takes skeptically his colleague Tracy (Amanda Watson) and the excited married Couple Mark and Susan (Hank Fields and Chris Buck) together at the weekend in a secluded cabin 12 miles from the nearest town. On the way, they pick up the knotty / depraved hitchhiker (Melissa Bale) at the bar and find themselves at their destination, where the nightly tale of making a bonfire about a murderous clown stalking the same forest area becomes reality when each of the profanity “Chicken friends disappear one by one, leaving only the mutilated parts of the doll to tell about their destinies. <br /> <br /> The killer clown does not even appear in the film until the very end, and it does not look like a demonic depiction of this on the video box (except for morbid obesity). He basically spends an hour trying to walk in the woods, chop wood and chat nursery rhymes. I can’t say enough bad words about the cast, especially about the two guys and the hitchhiker chick, who either engage in tasteless dialogue with minimal enthusiasm or replay at the most inappropriate moments. In fact, it does not help that the script is completely and completely devoid of uncertainty, originality, intelligence, general coherence or humor. I could talk for a few days about how inappropriate this film is, how many mistakes in continuity and how unprofessional the whole performance is, but I just nodded, noting that the whole package is a real riot in this Boy-This- Lame. <br /> <br /> Also noting that the film was released here in the USA as SICK (Serial Mad Clown Killer). Currently cataloged under the original name GRIM WEEKEND. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10
