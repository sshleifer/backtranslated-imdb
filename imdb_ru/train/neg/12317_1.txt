I apologize to the fans of this film, but this is the worst thing I've ever seen. Slow, poorly played and poorly played film is an attempt to escape from the ruthless romcoms of recent years and fail McDonald and Parker seem incapable of conveying real emotions and lifeless. They seem to be in this for any checks they receive for it, not because they thought it was a good idea. The plot is stupid! I love great movies about tiptoe just like the next girl, and this is not one !! If you avoid one movie this year ... let it be
