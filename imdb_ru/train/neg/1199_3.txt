This horror movie is very weak ... that is, if it is the right movie that I am commenting on. Nothing really horrible happens, as the family adopts a cute little German puppy Shepard. I had a German shepherd and it is a really good dog. I did not get the idea to get it from this film, but rather from the comedy “K-9”. It's a different story all together, though. This film really doesn’t have much horror at all, as the worst scene is at the end, and it looks really crappy. We also see how the guy almost laid his hand on the lawnmower. This is about it. The father suspects something, although since his family seems to be becoming rather strange, somewhere he will find out if you hold a mirror for them while they sleep, you can see that they are obsessed. In general, a really weak horror film, even by television standards ... television films that really work are pretty good, and there is another haunted film in the house about a woman and these strange creatures, which is also pretty good. This one is really pretty boring.
