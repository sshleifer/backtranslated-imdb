Until today, when you talk about Japanese cinema, most people won't talk about Rashomon, Seven Ronin or Ran. For the masses, Japanese cinema means that all these monsters that we love have destroyed these Japanese cities again and again, many times in battles with each other. The first and greatest of them is Godzilla, who returned a dozen or more times and in several films met a three-headed hydra that looked like a monster from space, Hydra. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, in accordance with the time, special effects have become a little better. But part of the charm of these old films was that these city papier-mâché kits were destroyed, they looked so fake, perhaps three steps above Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> Some visitors from the future have already traveled to Japan to call for Godzilla to be destroyed when he was first discovered. And in fact, he was first discovered as a surviving dinosaur during World War II, when he defended the Japanese garrison on a Pacific island from these American forces. But later, after atomic testing on a bikini, Godzilla, a friendly dinosaur, just like Barney, became an evil machine that we used to know in the movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, you are destroying Godzilla, than you give Hydra a clean field to destroy Japan so that it does not become an economic colossus like it was by 1991, when the film was released. I will not say more, but we all know that everything is fine in Japan, as in 2010. <br /> <br /> Like all other Japanese monster films, just relax and enjoy the chaos.
