It is not mentioned whether Ann Rivers Siddons adapted the material for the “House next door” from her 1970s novel with the same name, or if someone else did it. This film, like all life, was filmed by Canadian director Jeff Vulno. After reading the book a long time ago, we decided to take a chance when the film showed on the cable channel what was clearly done for television. You know that when critical moments precede commercials, which, of course, can not be found in this version that we watched. <br /> <br /> Star of the film - Lara Flynn Boyle, who looks in a new way, thrown this viewer. the curve is due to the cosmetic transformation that this actress went through. From new brows to other parts of her body, Ms. Boyle is hardly recognizable as Colonel Kennedy, the character in the center of the mystery. It was not one of the best moments of the actress in front of the camera. This applies to the rest of the main Canadian actors who deserve better. <br /> <br /> The film feels like a cross between “Desperate Housewives” with “Stepford Wives” and other more well-known features combined with a moderate dose of creep. The best thing about the film was the home that serves as the setting.
