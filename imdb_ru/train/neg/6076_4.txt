IN THE FAN Robert De Niro plays Gil Renard. Or is it Travis Bickle? or Rupert Pupkin? Or Max Cady? You see a problem with this type of role in the fact that De Niro played very very similar characters in TAXI DRIVER, KOMILE OF COMEDY and CAPE FEAR, and, unfortunately, the characters were better developed and had better scripts. It was a bit hard for me to believe that Renard would start, as a frustrated, obsessive sports fan, to be crazy outside and out. <br /> <br /> Character arc is not the only problem with this scenario. focusing on the character (I had a problem with UNTOUCHABLES, where De Niro was supposed to be excellent, but in the end it was a bit flat), for several stretches of the film I kept thinking that Bobby Rayburn was the main character, and then the story switches to Renard. It also seems to have disappointed many sports fans, who seem to think that it should have focused a bit more on baseball. I'm not sure that this should have been originally liked by baseball fans, but again there are elements that hint at this if producers decide who and what should focus on the story <br /> <br /> I admit that I was entertained THE FAN (especially the soundtrack), but this is a very flawed film, and it should be remembered that by the mid-1990s the characters were chasing the psychos, as in “ONE WHITE WOMAN”, “WRONG ENTRANCE”, etc.
