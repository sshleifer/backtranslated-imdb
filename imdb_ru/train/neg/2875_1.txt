This is the biggest piece of shit ever. It looks like they spent more time, effort, and money on creating a DVD cover than on a real movie. I really thought that the DVD was switched from someone's homemade porn, until I recognized one of the actors from the cover. This film looks as if someone shot it for a hundred bucks and a video camera, and half spent on rats. The picture is really clear, but this, along with very unsuccessful lighting, cinematography, if you can call it that, production, acting, if this is actually what they do, and the script, if there was one, makes this film look worse than old porn At least old porn have a point. It seems that some members of PETA got together and decided to create a truly useless, meaningless PSA about animal rights and feelings. It is so worth neither money nor time. He has nothing to do with the real BTK serial killer, except for the name of the killer and some of the victims. The people who made this film should be glad that he is not yet free, or he could have followed them simply because he ruined this film so badly.
