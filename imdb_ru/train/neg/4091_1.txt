Ah, Lucio Fulci, rest in peace. This infamous Italian is best known for its “Zombie” and the totally unsightly “<br /> <br /> Psychic” and “Manhattan babe.” Well, add this to the list of inaccessible for view <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> The plot, as it were, concerns a nekkidisty woman who wears a golden mask <br /> <br /> and a thong. She needs the power of a young stunt double <br /> <br /> who has a set of magic arrows and a bow. They are magical because they glow. Arrow boy teaming up with a guy in a bad wig, <br /> <br /> and most of the movie they save each other from flat <br /> <br /> action sequences. In the end, the involuntary chick is defeated, but not before removing the mask and reminding me why I broke up with my high school friend <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> Fulci washes every shot with an orange glow and fills the screen with smoke <br /> <br />. Nothing like a smoky orange action that will make you crave Sunny Delight and cigarettes. Special effects <br /> <br /> are ridiculous. In one sequence, our ambiguously cheerful duo is attacked by dozens of arrows, which, obviously, are scratches on the film <br /> <br />. Most of the budget effects had to be spent <br /> <br /> on Fulci-licious gore, which consists entirely of splattering <br /> <br /> wounds. Hey, we can all use a good stabbed wound once a <br /> <br /> for a while, but when you fall into an unnecessary wound, it becomes boring. <br /> <br /> I always had to play with the brightness setting on my TV in any case <br /> <br /> just to see what the hell was going on. <br /> <br /> Speaking of fulfillment will accept and prophecies. <br /> look into the future a little ... if you find this movie and watch it, <br /> <br /> you will regret it. The video box scene (from Media) does not appear in the film in any context. “Conquest” is not an easy job <br /> <br />. What MST3K could do with this! <br /> <br /> This is the rating (R) for strong physical abuse, strong blood, female nudity, short male nudity and light sexual content. <br /> <br />
