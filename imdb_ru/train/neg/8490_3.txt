It was a good attempt at something, but it is too pretentious and boring to rise above low-budget attributes. Using virtual sets almost works, but in some cases it fails. I think they used a small budget well. I just want the story and most of the acting to be better. There are many parts where you see what they were aiming for, and it would be great if they actually reached these marks, but they donâ€™t. Confusing and incredible story. Bad DVD transfer too. I don't need to watch a lot in one sitting. I had to turn this off. It was too boring. I can make slow movies. But just make them attractive in some way. Visually, in plot, in acting, etc. This was not enough in all departments, so he never developed into an exciting experience. Perhaps the director's next attempt would be better.
