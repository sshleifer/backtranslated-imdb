I will be stupid and to the point. This film is not good at all. The part of the film that I loved hated acting, script, story, directing and almost all editing. Amanda Pete has proven that she can act since she was the star of Nine Yards. So she should have avoided this ten-foot pole movie. However, the infantile part of me found this film very funny. If you can forget about the low quality of production, and if you find funny jokes funny, everything will be fine. And for those of you who cannot rise from a pedestal, this is your choice. My inner child did not die, and I laughed a little. Even then, only 3 out of ten, because, like a film, it really stinks.
