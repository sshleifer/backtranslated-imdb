A disappointing, predictable film in which a woman (Mack Tyr) travels with her daughter from state to state, because she cannot maintain relationships and find happiness. In this genre, "Everywhere, but not here," starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman, they managed to better understand the relationship between mother and daughter. With the best actions.
