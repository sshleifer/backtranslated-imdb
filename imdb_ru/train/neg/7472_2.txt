This show seemed pretty good. Kira Sedgwick is a good actress, and I like police series, but somewhere in production this program went terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, the authors should have more suspects than one, you know who did it EVERY TIME !!!!! It makes it boring. The main character is incredibly annoying, and it can not be believed. I know that they wanted her to be tough, but she means a stupid and bad leader. Crimes are uninteresting and vulgar, and they simply limp to the end. As mentioned above, I hate it ... <br /> <br /> In general, it was a big disappointment and really very bad ...
