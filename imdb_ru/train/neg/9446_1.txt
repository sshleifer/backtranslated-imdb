Absolutely brutal adaptation of a wonderful children's book. The rude and inappropriate humor, some scary details and the sickening story that the motherâ€™s boyfriend wants to send the boy to military school to get him out of the way makes it totally irrelevant for children who will most likely want to see it, because the books ( 3-8 years). Do not waste your money, your time or common sense.
