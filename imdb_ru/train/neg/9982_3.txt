The story begins slowly, and for a while nothing funny happens. All the action at the end, but you do not have to laugh, because the movie is funny, but because the story is pathetic. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is, when Harvey "I'm not paranoid" Keitel really loses it, and the judge begins the slaughter. Oscar for this guy!
