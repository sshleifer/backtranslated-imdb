- Let me start by saying that “The Invasion of Star Beings” was supposed to be a parody of science fiction films from the 50s. I understand that nothing should be taken seriously. My problem is that none of this works. The parody should be funny, but this one should not. Never for all the work I have not smiled. In general, it is easy to entertain me, but I have not found the slightest amusement anywhere in The Invasion of Star Beings. <br /> <br /> - I knew that I had problems from the very beginning. Two "stars" look on the screen thanks to one of the brightest jokes - a water hose, which they can not control, which gets them both wet. These two are filmed as imitators of the Bowery Boys. Why would anyone want to emulate the actions and personality of the Bowery Boys, beyond me. After a less than glorious beginning, films continue with comic chase sequences, Indian dances, vegetable men, decoder rings and other unfunny pieces. This is just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> - I bought this on a two-DVD DVD with Invasion of the Bee Girls. This film is Oscar award-winning compared to The Invasion of Star Beings.
