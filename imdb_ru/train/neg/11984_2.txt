Ugh! Another one of those "deceived cover" DVDs. I was expecting some action, at least with bears, cats and other things on the cover. I got nothing! Bad movie! <br /> <br /> I forced myself to watch it all the time, thinking that in the end, SOMETHING will happen ... no luck. <br /> <br /> Now the reason I gave it is 2 because of the landscape; otherwise it sucks. <br /> <br /> The child was terrible, talking to himself (although I believe that they could not just start the film with dull music and without dialogue in general), making their lame karate poses on a tree stump threatening the raccoon chewing worms and (what a dumbass) kicking porcupine. And it will not be so easy to pull these feathers ... they are held like fish hooks. At least he fought a bear (weakly) a couple of times. <br /> <br /> What happened to the memory? It made a bad movie even worse. I wanted to watch a film about survival, and not some dramatic film about a child who suffers from a divorce. <br /> <br /> What else can I say? Well, maybe they should have a bear eat a child or something like that. At least it would be more exciting. <br /> <br /> People, do not waste your time on this.
