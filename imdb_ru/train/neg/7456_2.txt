Perhaps this is not the worst comedy of all time, but it is close. The producers of this film stole an hour and a half of my life, and I want to return it! <br /> <br /> Chris Kattan has been funny for about 10 minutes. His high voice and crazy wobble begin to age, and then you realize that the rest of the film is much worse. He finds himself in a long line of former SNL players who have tried movies. Some were brilliant, some failed. There is not much average in this category. Although Chris Farley was great, and then everything is in order, and then not so funny, and then dead ... so I suppose he hits the whole spectrum in one career. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like the plague. br /> <br /> c
