I have to admit that I'm a big fan of this show, so you should know how disappointed I was when I watched this movie. First of all, the plot was terrible, I thought it would be something more interesting, for example, to see what happened to Arnold's fathers, or something more interesting, but the maniac NOOOOOOO wants to destroy Arnold's house, between many other places, a lot of people try to stop it. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that the plot was not so bad after all, but what really sucks is the steps that Arnold and his friends take to stop this maniac, they become friends of a spy; they ride the bus (based on the video game, for God's sake), and even worse, they make super moves on the bus, things that many people have already tried and died, but not Arnold, Gerald and Helga, because they are experts on video games. <br /> <br /> To be honest, my mom, my sister, even me, were very disappointed after watching this movie, because it was the worst way to finish a really good cartoon. I have to admit that I used to like “Hi Arnold!” It was one of my favorite Nickelodeon cartoons, but after this movie shit I'm not quite sure if I am going to watch “Hi Arnold!” As I watched in the past. <br /> <br /> Another thing, Nickelodeon, with this huge amount of dynamite, I can assure you that not a simple street will explode, I think that the whole city can explode with this Oh, and please, if all your future films of the good cartoons will be like that, do not make more films, you give a bad critic of cartoons that used to be good. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I think it was the worst way to finish this show, a good show turned into this movie shit.
