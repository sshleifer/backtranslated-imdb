It was supposed to be one of the worst films I've ever seen, I'm 64 years old, and I'm a fan of football. I expected to see a football movie. After about 10 minutes, I began to wonder how exactly such a bad film (especially an actor) could get into the theater. About halfway through, I whispered to my husband that it was terrible, and he explained to me the facts underlying the film. Although I was a little offended (and I see how some can be VERY hurt if they were not Christians), when I was preached at the cinema, it was not that important. It was, however, a big deal to undergo such predictability and unrealistic behavior and, above all, the quality of the action. This is a suitable film for a church walk, but it must be shown in the church hall, not in the theater. I'm going to church? Yes. Do I want to go to church when I go to the movies? Would I recommend this movie? Definitely not!!!
