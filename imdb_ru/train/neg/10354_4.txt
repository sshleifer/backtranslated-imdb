I was browsing Netflix and came across this movie. Having had pleasant memories of a book as a child, I decided to check it out. This is a movie that you really must pass. <br /> <br /> It’s just not worth watching. It is very boring and uninteresting. I feel that it will be so even with small children. There is no magic in the book. This film is not so terrible, but you will find that you do not take care of it in ten minutes. <br /> <br /> There are moments that seem strange. The character of the witch is not very good. The family behaves as if there is nothing terrible in the fact that these strange things happen. I know that this is a children's film, so as an adult audience, we don’t have to look too deeply at things, but the whole movie just seems like it was written and produced by people who have never had experience creating movies before. <br /> <br /> The DVD that I started skipping in the final moments of the movie, and instead of trying to fix it, I just turned it off and sent it back to Netflix. I really didn’t care how it ended. Skip this movie and read the book.
