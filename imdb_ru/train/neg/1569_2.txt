Weak plot, improbable machine malfunction and helpless clumsy characters. At first I thought that this film was made in the seventies, because the quality of the image, as well as the plot line and drama, seems to be taken from an old episode with Kodjak. When I checked and found that it really was done back in -97, I was surprised. This is definitely one of the worst and least (thriller) films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> If you are reading this, keep in mind, if you see it, you lose time when you could do something more exciting how to watch the paint dry.
