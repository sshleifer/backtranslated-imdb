Herbie, a Volkswagen who thinks like a man, is back, now led by Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan), a young woman who hopes to become a NASCAR champion. The only thing that stands in her way is the reigning champion, Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon), who will do everything to stop them. <br /> <br /> The original love mistake was not so good. I remember that even in childhood I did not like it. I had some hope of continuing, though. I mean, the cast is pretty good, and the trailer makes it look like a pretty funny movie. Unfortunately, now Herbie is no better than he was before. The film is demonstratively weak for people over 12 years old. Perhaps he will entertain the children, but that's all. <br /> <br /> I understand that this is a children's film, and that’s all, but they could make the film a little more interesting. There was very little laughter, and towards the end it became boring. Most of the actors also seemed dead in their roles. Lindsay Lohan was fine, like Maggie Peyton. She usually gives the best performances, as in Freaky Friday and Mean Girls. Matt Dillon gave the best presentation of all. He was very good as a bad guy, although there wasn’t much work with him. Justin Long, Breckin Meyer and Michael Keaton are really just here, and they are not doing anything special. <br /> <br /> Angela Robinson is in charge, and she does an excellent job with her job. She tries to make the film interesting, but works with a weak script. Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant have written the script, and won’t they surprise you that they are also responsible for Taxi and Pacifier? These two shoot lightweight films, but they cannot make the stories interesting or enjoyable. It’s not really their fault, but hopefully next time they’ll try their best. After all, Herbie is a safe, predictable family film worth seeing if you're a kid. Everyone else should skip this. Rating 4/10
