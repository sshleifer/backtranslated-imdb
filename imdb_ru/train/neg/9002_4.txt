OK .... I just have 3 words - cheesy, cheesy and cheesy! The only feature of this film is Dean Kane. In addition, this is CHEESEBALL SUPREME !!!! <br /> <br /> There is a promising concept in the film - the underground laboratory creates a real live fire-breathing dragon - basically gives us more meetings with the “Jurassic Park” “Kingdom of Fire” ..... There are some great opportunities, but they just not realized .... The effects are decent - even if you KNOW that the dragon is CGI, it doesn't look terrible CGI .... <br /> <br /> I would not blame Dean Cain (although he is one of the producers), I would put more blame on Philip Roth - director and writer. Making a film is HIS work, and, unfortunately, it failed.
