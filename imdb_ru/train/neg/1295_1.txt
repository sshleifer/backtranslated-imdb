this is seriously one of the worst movies i have ever seen. I love Japanese movies, and I think that another film by the same director, Electric Dragon 80,000 V, is a masterpiece. I really wanted this film to be liked - Asano is a terrific actor, and the storyline was very attractive. but I could not find anything interesting in this. <br /> <br /> the film lasts forever and nothing happens. and the effects the director used — for example, constant percussion and the inordinate use of slow motion — simply added to my growing annoyance at the fact that the plot was astonishingly slow, and the actors replayed disgustingly. most of the boredom was the result of extraneous additions that were completely unnecessary — like an hour spent on asano, circumventing the cutting of Buddha statues and proclaiming that he did not worship anything. it added nothing to the plot. Japanese movie lover, and I constantly checked the time. we could not believe that this film was as terrible as it was. and the final was terrible. I thought that the director, at least, would try to reward the viewer for having managed to get through this, but unfortunately I was wrong.
