Yes, it was definitely one of those sleepless nights when I was watching channels and came across this nasty movie. For some names in the cast, I would expect a much better movie. I am almost embarrassed to see that Oscar Winner F. Murray Abraham turns into such a terrible part. I hope the money was worth it. And the students talked about fencing, as survival in war or as a result of a terrible disaster. I mean, I'm fenced, it's a fun sport, but I have never been so intense. The only reason I even watched this entire film was because the remote fell under the sofa and I was too lazy to return it.
