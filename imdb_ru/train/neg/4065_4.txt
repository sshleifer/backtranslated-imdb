... through the similar thoughts of Eric Stants. The not-so-talented director directed not a particularly good film, but I still found myself sitting in it on the closing credits, if only to see what would happen next. <br /> <br /> The rapist escapes from prison and causes his old flame. Having captured her (even if she came willingly) and threatening her to have sex (another event she also wanted to do), he found that he had kidnapped three guys who had offended her in the past. Then he decides to kill her (yes?), But breaks down and dies instead. The girl's mind breaks down (or something like that), and she is angry at the unlucky guys in the basement. <br /> <br /> Well, the inscription sucks: it is long, wordy, loaded with ten cent words, and there it is too much. <br /> <br /> The game sucks: what a minute, what a game? <br /> <br /> Shooting sucks: home videos are pretty bad, but 20-minute footage from the cemetery is just a damn insult. <br /> <br /> And the budget is a joke: get it ... "budget", it was a highlight. <br /> <br /> Yet this was the beauty. Back in the 70s, such films were released in cinemas with real budgets and talents, but not in our days. If you want to see this cruel, sexually exploited trash (don't lie, like some of us), then that's all you get today. <br /> <br /> A few short hardcore shots in the sex scene, torture with fecal material, fun with axes, anal rape with a broom stick and a long shot of a crazy chick masturbating with the same broomstick are some of the best menu items. <br /> <br /> This is not very good and it will not be remembered, but since the heyday of Joe D'Amato people have been making such films. <br /> <br /> 4/10
