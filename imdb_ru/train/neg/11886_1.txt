Watching the “act” of Josh Kornbluth in this film reminds me of my class for the production of television programs for beginners, where the “not funny” had the opportunity to prove how ridiculous they really are! <br /> <br /> It is clear that the word comes to mind when I try to review this copycat comedy. Jokes Sophomores and wired. Delivery is painfully bad. Oh !!!!!!! The letter is just stupid. This is similar to the Bob Saghet show. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is as painful as watching a skip on Saturday night live for an hour and a half (Belushi’s post). <br /> <br /> I hated this film and want to get my money back !!!
