I went to see this film with a crowd consisting mainly of the “spiritual” New Age types, who, unlike me, liked this film very much - although in the opinion of those who also knew the book (obviously, there is a book that contains more of this nonsense ), the film is not so good. So, if you tend to think of yourself as “spiritual,” believe or, at least, you can tolerate such things as “aura” and “astral body,” and do not mind the frequent use of the term “energy” outside the context of physics or technology, you can really like the film, and you will probably even like more about any book on which it appears to be based. <br /> <br /> However, if you mostly communicate with the physical universe, if your abilities to suspend disbelief are easily depleted by the senseless New Age nonsense and scenes based on them, if in addition to this you have a low tolerance for stupid light effects , to designate spirituality, and, perhaps, even to expect a reasonable non-wooden dialogue, this is my recommendation for you regarding this film: to stay. At a party. <br /> <br /> Don't even think about it. Tonight, this film replaced Dungeons and Dragons as the worst movie I've ever seen in a movie theater (I don’t count the films I watched, expecting them to be bad, such as Plan 9, etc. ). At the same time, this led to the fact that the total number of films about which I almost came out increased to two (the other is D & D). I am not going to the cinema, even to this one, but I had to do it when I first saw the visual image of the aura, because from that moment BS New Age is getting thicker and thicker. <br /> <br /> The story of a group of people associated with some old prophecies, in the pursuit of spiritual enlightenment and the desire to lead humanity to the next step in its evolution. Or something like that. They actually say that these spiritual things are the next step in human evolution, which should make anyone who has even the slightest idea of ​​what human evolution is, scare. The film is shocking with such loud chatter. Sometimes people are led to what they specifically call the “other dimension,” or perhaps the “other plan,” only to become invisible to those who have not yet achieved enlightenment around them. Kindness. <br /> <br /> At the end, the director patronizes the audience, rolling the “ideas” that make up the prophecy, painfully slowly, presumably, so that we can remember them and leave the cinema as better, more enlightened people. <br /> <br /> What's good about the movie? Some very nice full-scale pictures and some decent performances in support of Elizondo and de Almeida. <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that this seriously affects my ability to take a person seriously if they find this film interesting or acceptable. This is really cheap spiritualism of the most naive kind, and if this is not your business, you better do something else with your time and money.
