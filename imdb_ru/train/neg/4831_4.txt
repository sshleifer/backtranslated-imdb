I rented this film on Netflix after he won all the Oscars to see if he was really that good. <br /> <br /> Hurt Locker is a very realistic image (for the most part) of a group of soldiers rotating in Iraq. The film is about Will James, the reckless soldier who takes his adrenaline risk by risking and defusing bombs. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this film lacks the plot and direction of the film. This film does not have a clear story, unlike other films such as Black Hawk Down. This film tries to focus more on the characters and their different views on the war. Bigelow is well focused on the characters, but there are many moments in the film in which the dialogue seems to be delaying. Hurt Locker - 131 minutes, but still, that watch a 3-hour film. <br /> <br /> One scene in the film that was particularly horrible and destroyed the credibility of the film was a sniper scene in the middle of the film. It was unreal and very long. <br /> <br /> In general, I thought this film was fine, but the reason I gave him 6 instead of 7 was because it was a big disappointment for the Best Picture win at the Oscars. I felt that this film could have been a lot better, considering that Ryanâ€™s Rescue of the Soldier had lost the Better Picture, but was much better than this film. Another famous mention is Black Hawk Down, which won only 2 Oscars. Honestly, I do not know how it got the best picture. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an action movie filled with action movies, rent a Black Hawk Down. This film will be forgotten in a year or two.
