I recently watched "Produced Landscapes" at the Seattle International Film Festival. I was attracted to the film as a photographer, because I am both an acquaintance and a fan of Burtynskyâ€™s works. Although I believe that the film copes well with its task, I could not help but feel that it was made as an afterthought for photographs and the subsequent popular book of Burtynsky. Obviously, one of the reasons for this is the widespread use of photographs showing enlarged and enlarged images. Although this is a good effect with economical use, I felt that 75% of the film were just frames from the book of Burtynsky (which I already own). This is probably an exaggeration, but I felt that way. If you have a book or are familiar with his work, you better skip this book.
