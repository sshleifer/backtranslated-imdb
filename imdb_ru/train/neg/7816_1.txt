It really doesn't matter that the Superman comics are incredibly naive, and their goal is ten years. The important thing is that Superman Returns is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the question for you, dear readers, who among you really believes that Superman will be defeated by the bald Kevin Spacey? Anyone? As I thought. There are no spoilers. So let's move on to some serious issues right now. <br /> <br /> First, this film looks like a commercial (the scene in the bar where Superman / Clark Kent drink Budweiser is the only scene that looks as it should). Imagine advertising Superman, two and a half hours. Let's be serious, this is not "Amadeus" or "Gone." You really feel this movie is too long. And by the way, special effects are not so special. Secondly, the script is stupid. Sometimes, even if something is acceptable in a comic, in a movie, it just looks silly. And so in this case. Of course, the dialogues are shameful. I can not believe that someone took the money to write them. How many times will they feed us rascals? How many times will the laws of physics be raped? (Jesus, it's not just Superman's strength, but also the resistance of the materials with which he deals.) How many times will Lois Lane be duped by Kent? How many times will Hollywood producers look for a story in dirty comics? Since it is difficult to make a good story, why have a weak history for a beginner? It just does not work. Guys, get control. Please try. Or just stay on this strike forever, who cares. I had the feeling that the WGA was constantly on strike. No offense. I do not question the lame money that these people receive, but the quality of the product they supply. In this case, there is no quality at all. (At this point, you may ask yourself: is it so bad? Yes, it is.) <br /> <br /> Thirdly, acting is weak, which is unexpected, as directed by Brian Singer (“Ordinary suspects”). Kevin Spacey is having fun, but he is the only one. The audience is probably not in the mood for jokes. The fact is that a comic book hero can be developed into a real person, with clear motives, as well as doubts, fears, some depth. In this case, no one did this work, and the characters are not very interesting. <br /> <br /> Finally, all the efforts of the creators turn this film into a parody. The second block is so bad that it attracts attention, because nothing interesting happens on the screen anyway. The harder they try (if they try), the funnier it becomes (but it's not laughter, you might expect). <br /> <br /> The final conclusion? One word: shame. <br /> <br /> This particular film, ladies and gentlemen, is a camp. Do not waste your time and do not waste your money too. Stay at home, read a book.
