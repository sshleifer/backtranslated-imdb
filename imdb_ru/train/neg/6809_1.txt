One of Stinko from the film, which shows a shabby plot and, to be kind, acting less than Oscar caliber. But for me, the only worst flaw was the complete misrepresentation of information about a jet, especially about 747. Some of the main mistakes: <br /> <br /> 1. The absence of a flight engineer (or even a flight engineer station. 2. Incorrect identification of F-16 interceptors as F-15 (no resemblance.) 3. Loading passengers into the “aft luggage compartment” supposedly accessible from the cabin - even if such a compartment existed, placing such a large weight that far away from the stern would make the plane unusable. 4. Hollow point bullets, which It doesn’t “damage the aircraft.” 5. The whole landing procedure was so bad that I wanted to tear. SR-71 (from all aircraft) with a hermetic seal hatch 7. Opening the cabin door to the outside - to the wind - in flight! <br /> <br /> Oh, damn it, it was really a lousy movie. List of the bottom 10 years.
