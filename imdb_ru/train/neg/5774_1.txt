This film is Spike Lee's modest effort. He is capable of much more than this film. Get on the bus, being obviously anti-racist, just scold whites and humiliate black's status quo. The plot of this film is about a group of black men who ride the bus to the march of Louis Farrakhan with millions of people. The bus has all the types of people you can imagine: gay, muslim, gangbang, and uncle Tom (although they throw him out of the bus). There was only one white person on the bus. He was accused of racism the minute he got on the bus to go. Despite the fact that he was Jewish, and the fact that he explained is the situation in which he was a racist and left the bus. I hate to say this, but films like this should be aware of their own hypocracy and the enhancement of stereotypes. This should not be perceived as a triumph, but as a sad disappointment. You may think that I am a racist for writing this, but I mean well. Good luck next time, Spike.
