As you all know, JIGSAW did not make it to Blackbuster because of Full Moon employee Devin Hamilton. Devin is the one who sells all the video chains. He recently released the film BLEED, which he sold to Blackbuster at the same time as JIGSAW. He convinced the Blackbuster buyer not to take JIGSAW and double the amount of BLEED. As a result, JIGSAW looks like a flop, and BLEED looks like a hit. The main problem is that BLEED is one of the worst films ever, and as we all know, JIGSAW is, well, gold. I urge all of you to go to the BLEED page on the Internet and vote for the film that offended JIGSAW, and for all your talents. In the same way, you should go to the JIGSAW page and vote for it (if you have not already done so). We need to increase JIGSAW to at least 8 or 8.5, and BLEED - to about 2 (thus placing it on the list of the 100 worst films on the Internet). Also, try to convince friends and family to do the same. <br /> <br /> I hope you are fine, Matt
