This film is very boring, it tells the story of a woman tanker and her life. Nothing exciting happens. The director really “kept it real”, and this is similar to how the camera watches a woman who lives her life. I had to watch other films of this director in class, the rest were not so boring. This film was also watched by appointment ... it would be better to miss with a good rating !! In general, if this is not required, do not watch the movie. But you should not discount other films of this director, because they are not so bad ... and do not discount other films about Africa, they are usually good, especially when they are shot by a western director.
