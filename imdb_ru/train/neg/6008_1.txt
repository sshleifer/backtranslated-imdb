If you make a mistake by watching a movie before reading a book, please do not give up. I bought my first copy of any of the books in May of this year, and I’ve almost finished with book 10. I dare say that the film is a piece of garbage that doesn’t make the show even a sniff of justice. Although “Left Behind the Back: the Movie” only vaguely repeats the story “Left Behind the Back” (the book), the characters do not even closely correspond to reality. <br /> <br /> A few examples: Rayford never influences his feelings for Hattie (he will soon learn about the disappearances); Buck Williams is a blonde journalist, not a journalist; Chloe at Stanford, and in many books, tells how Rayford wonders if she survived; Buck and Chloe do not meet much later, at a meeting in New York organized by Hattie; Irene and Raimi are never “in the book,” but simply in Rayford’s memories; the roads are so crowded that after the amazement, Rayford and Hattie are forced to return to the suburbs by helicopter ... and so on and so forth ... <br /> <br /> And this is only from the first film; they are going to release the third. Please, even if you do not like movies, give a chance of a series of books.
