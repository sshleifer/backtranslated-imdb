This film is quite interesting because of the excellent performance of Virginia Madsen and the fact that Lindsay Haun is beautiful. However, the reason why the film is so predictable is that we have seen it all before. I did not read the book "Mother's Gift", but I hope that for the sake of Britney and Lynn Spears, it is completely different than this film. If you do not consider the end of the film that is essentially a music video, an original idea, the whole movie resembles the word "plagiarism".
