Like most comments, I saw this movie called “The Witch”, which is a reprint. Obviously Necromancy, which is the original, is better, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> Most witchcraft scenes still include most of the necromancy scenes, and they are still bad. In many ways, I think the added nudity of the witch at least added some entertaining value! But do not be fooled - there are only 3 scenes with nudity, and these are people standing around diversity. No devilish chubby pump involved! <br /> <br /> This film is so terrible that it is difficult to understand what to criticize in the first place. The dialogue is terrible and straight from the Troma locker. At least Troma is the tongue in the cheek. This is straightforward boredom in the face. The game is changing with Pamela Franklin (Flora, an obsessive child from the “Innocents”, you will believe!), The worst with its shrill, shrill voice. Wells, it seems, is just waiting for his check. The other main woman has a creepy face, so I don’t know why Pamela thought that she could trust her in the film! And the doctor is also very bad. He also looks awful, like Gene Wilder. <br /> <br /> He was clumsily filmed, scenes change for no reason, and editing is intermittent. This is because a witch is copying and pasting, and not subtle in that sense. Only lighting is in order. The sound is also terrible, and it's hard to hear with a terrifying new soundtrack that never turns off. The mother of the "ghost" is also rubbish, but the actress is so funny in acting that she at least causes an unintentional laugh. <br /> <br /> Indeed, this film (at least, the witch) is intended only for the unwary. He can't have a lot of sensible fans, because it's pretty unsightly, and I actually found it tediously boring! <br /> <br /> The best moment was when the loans rolled down - suffice it to say, it’s just better to have a bad excuse for the movie LIKE THE PLAGUE!
