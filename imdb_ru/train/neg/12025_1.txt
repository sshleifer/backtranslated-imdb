This film was on the channel "Romance", and I thought that it could be a silly film of the 80s, which at some level would be enjoyable, so my brother and I watched it. The boy did it sucks. The boy is in love with the girl - mending, his * dream * is a girl (obviously, there is a difference; and I am surprised that he realized that she was the girl of his dreams - he was struck with her from a distance of more than 30 feet. I think I just goes to show the power of the girls of the dream), the boy ends up being disguised as a woman, to be next to the dream girl (creative in the sense that this is a far-reaching plan, but not creative in the sense that it is probably better solution, you can think of), awkward situations arise, a match is going on (everything that happens, it seems, It is getting closer to the evening - either the place was somehow responsible for this strange lighting, or the actors had to wait until they left their jobs to come to the set, I suspect that the latter). Very awkward, very pathetic. It's almost never fun * accidentally *, so there’s really nothing to buy it for. If you're not interested in seeing Chad Lowe in the early days, before he finally got his cake with the role of HIV-positive gay on Life Goes On, or Gail O'Grady, who was on NYPD Blue and probably should have looked at Dennis Franz’s buttocks). But these are unlikely motives — I would say that “systematic sense disorder” would be a more justified goal. I'm surprised I looked at all this. I suppose this is such a thing, when halfway through you find yourself still watching because of some unhealthy, self-contained internal problem, and think that you could also end it so that you can tell your friends and family, that actually I watched such a horrible film, in case he gets you sympathy for the dubious state of your mental health. Can you accept the challenge?
