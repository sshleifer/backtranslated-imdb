I have seen better quality products on YouTube! I feel sorry for the actors, because the script was terrible, and the direction is shocking, I'm not sure how they could get the plot lines out - I really doubt that any actor could have saved this film, no matter how good they are. The characters were not developed at all, and there was no real cohesion in the plot, which did not seem to go anywhere. This is truly a shame, as the premise for the film was good and with better production quality, directing and script, it could be a decent movie. Of course, it was not a comedy, unless you were laughing out loud when dubbing - which was amateur, even the English actors sounded weird.
