Wow, I knew this movie would be bad, but not so bad. Spoiler comments will follow. <br /> <br /> Roddy Roddy Piper - a painfully sweet retired cop (cliche!), Helping everyone - smiling like a patient after a lobotomy operation, and mourning his dead son. His adopted son is returning from the Special Ops Armed Forces and because he has "seen things" - he is portrayed, gritting his teeth, if anyone mentions the past. Time to clean the streets from another guy who once knew Piper and his dead son (who was killed by a bad guy) and his adopted son. <br /> <br /> Oh, love interest is a pretty young lady who decides for no reason why she wants to jump on the bones of a former army guy. This takes about 2 minutes per scene. <br /> <br /> This action could save this film, but it is even worse than the storyline and the action. It was all done before, it was all done much better (Ong-Bak is a prime example). This is the worst movie I've ever seen - and I've already seen Waterworld twice. <br /> <br /> Uh, the movie is called HONOR (“Written Wrong for Americans”), and the line that says “from the creators of the Bloodsport and Kickboxer” - look at the director David Worths, and you will soon understand why they shot these 2 films, although they are more than 10 years old. Such a classic as “Shark Shark 3: Megalodon,” speaks for itself. <br /> <br /> I'll give you £ 10 if you don’t go to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> PS - I apologize for not knowing the names of the characters, but will tell you something.
