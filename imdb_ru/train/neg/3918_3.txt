This film may have been the biggest disappointment I experienced when renting movies based on IMDb reviews. In general, I just thought it was a second-rate film. <br /> <br /> Leslie Cheng is definitely bearable, as the antihero and Ma Wu cope with their character with cheerful competence. On the other hand, the makeup of Ma Wu (facial hair) is so obvious that I just could not take it seriously. He looked like an overweight teenager dressed for Halloween, complete with a beard for $ 4.95. <br /> <br /> The special effects were so-so, although the “dead” in the basement were pretty good. The tree-like language looked like something from the 1950s' bad-clicking monsters, although the POV footage from the language’s point of view was more reminiscent of Sam Rayme’s pictures in the recent Evil Dead. Pyrotechnics was terrible, and the final battle was as boring as possible. (Actually, it most closely reminded me of the episode "Lost in Space", in which the Robinsons fell into a sandstorm and ...) <br /> <br /> The plot was not particularly original and was told to countless times European tales. There was no waiting and no plot twists. In fact, you immediately know how you are introduced to good, bad and surviving characters. <br /> <br /> I just returned this movie to Netflix and then sat down to write this review. The very first thing I did was check the production date. Yes, it speaks about 1987 ... and not about 1967, as I thought. And that pretty much sums it up: production values ​​and FX are typical of the 1960s. The plot and the action seem much older, since Hollywood actually produced several interesting and complex films in the 60s. <br /> <br /> ** of *****
