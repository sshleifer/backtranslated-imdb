For years, Colomboâ€™s films have gone down; perhaps this year they have reached the bottom. Peter Falk gives the same boring performance and looks terrible in this film. As usual in this series, the protocols at the crime scene are unheard of, so the credibility is always not enough. Brenda Vaccaro is chewing on landscapes and pulling pantomime faces, and Andrew Stevens is a rather unconvincing man. (His weak, however, was a scream!) The script was by numbers and its delivery is patronizing. They should never have led Colombo in the nineties, they just left us all with one or two happy memories of clever conspiracies, the best scenarios and sharp characteristics.
