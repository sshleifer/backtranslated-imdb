This overvalued, short-lived series (miserable two seasons) is about as experimental and unique as a truck driver going to a strip bar. I'm not quite sure what they mean by “innovative” and “original” when they prey on Lynch and his little silly television opus. What are their criteria for what is original? Of course, compared to the “Bill Cosby Show” or “Hill Street Blues”, this is original Definitely. Next to Law & Order, TP spews originality left and right. <br /> <br /> TP fans often say that the show was canceled because too many viewers weren't smart enough, open enough for the supposed weirdness of the show. ", his supposed wild ingenuity, or something else. I, as a fan of oddities, have to correct this misconception. There is nothing special about TP; it's just a watchable, rather stupid whistle that whirls in a circle, twists a web in every corner, but (or because of this) ultimately will not go anywhere. Supposed strangeness is always imposed, characters do not behave as strange as they behave idioticly in half the cases. There is a difference ... <br /> <br /> Every time when I watch a sequence of "weird dreams" in "Living In Oblivion", in The dwarf gnome criticizes the director (Bushemi) for giving in to the tired old old-come-use-I think about Lynch. Do you want strange? "Eraserhead" is strange - in fact, it is outside of strangeness, it is basically abstractly. Do you want a unique TV show? Watch "Prisoner." Do you want a strange looking cast? Films Felini and Leone offer this. TP looks like an overly hidden TV crime drama in which all young people look like fashion models. The cast gives the TP a plastic look. Kens & Barbies in droves. <br /> <br /> In fact, one of the producers of TP said that Lynch was looking for “unique faces” for the series. Unique faces? How is Lara Flynn Boyle? Cheryl Fenn? How are those “goats” with a feminine face straight from men's catalogs (or gay magazines)? Do not get me wrong; There is nothing wrong with getting an attractive cast, especially with such beauties as Fenn (as Madonna would have looked if she were 1000 times more beautiful), but don't say that you are doing a “weird show with strange looking people” . ". And I never understood Lynch's erroneous charm with Kyle MacLachlan (I had to get a medal for having bothered to spell his name correctly). It is not unpleasant, but it lacks charisma, it looks too soft and polished. The ludicrous “eccentricities” of his character were not at all interesting, this is just one of Lynch’s many attempts to impose oddity, trying with all his might to justify his reputation — he completely lost his advantage, but this time. Everything that Lynch did after "The Elephant Man" was not quite normal compared to his first two films. This was often followed by mediocre efforts that relied on the relatively small but fanatical fan base of Lynch to keep him in the public eye, interpreting the meanings in his poorly composed stories that do not stand up for careful study. In other words, Lynch is the favorite of every intellectual lover. <br /> <br /> So Laura Palmer was murdered by her father ...? He was possessed by the devil or something like that. This is the best that this “great mind” could come up with ... You have B-movie horror films that end up with more originality. <br /> <br /> Lynch is not smart enough and hardworking to come up with an amazing story. <br /> <br /> Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8 and watch my TV and Movie List: 150 Worst Cronyism Cases.
