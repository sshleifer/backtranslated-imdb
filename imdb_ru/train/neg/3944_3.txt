The film “My Name Is Modesty” is based on an episode that spans about one page in Blaze’s 10th modest novel, Night of the Morning Star. He describes a case in which young Modesty (17 in the book, mid-twenties in the film) confirms its leadership in the war for the casino. Because it is set before the actual adventures of Blaze, her reliable assistant Willie Garvin is not in the film. This is one of the main problems, since the relationship between Blaise and Garvin has always been one of the fascinating aspects of novels and comics. Another problem is that the film is just incredibly boring, because in fact it is just one small episode turned into a script. Casting is fine, but Alexandra Staden is not very convincing in the role of the heroine and is in fact too old to play the young Modesty. I have the impression that this film was a quick and dirty decision in order not to lose the rights to the Blaise franchise.
