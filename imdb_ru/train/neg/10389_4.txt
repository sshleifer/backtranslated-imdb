Directed by Kevin Connor and action hero / romantic Doug McClure, the team from this ghost story in Japan. They were quite successful together in the 1970s, for example, “The Earth, which was forgotten” (1975), “At the core of the Earth” (1976), etc. Without plastic monsters that could narrate the story, the results were scuffed . and derivative in the most banal way. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a prologue filmed in the 19th century, when the samurai husband kills his wife and his lover before committing suicide. Moving forward to the present represents the couple Ted and Laura, who visits Japan and moves into the house where the tragedy occurred. <br /> <br /> There is nothing surprising in what happens next, with the spirit of the dead, beginning to accept new residents with family friend Alex (McClure), taking on the role of his wife's lover. <br /> <br /> Everything clums clumsily, along with the elegance and grace of a charging elephant, to the inevitable (but surprisingly depressing)) conclusion. The main attractions are the two weak beheadings (“Foreshadowing” can explain a lot by advertising it as a standard horror set), and love scenes with the squint-eyed but extremely strange Susan George. The first is a long inspirational play, “Don't Look Now,” with her hubby, full of piano music; the second is much shorter (probably due to her insistence) entanglement with McClure, both look rather awkward. Anyway, each cloud has a silver lining, and in both scenes its fantastic hammers are depicted, so all is not lost. <br /> <br /> In general, I cannot decide whether the “House where the evil dwells” is rubbish, watchable rubbish, or an entertaining masochistic way. If you are not in the genre, there is nothing at all, but for horror fans, it is probably enough to provoke a strange smile of rye and a grateful bow of respect for the efforts. <br /> <br /> THE BEST SCENE - in any other film, big, black, climbing trees, Japanese muttering mechanical crabs would steal the show. They were eclipsed by the legendary family meal, where a ghostly head appears in the daughter's soup. Seeing this vision, she asks what kind of soup it is (!!!!), so that beef and vegetables are told to him before uttering the immortal phrase: “Ugh, there is a terrible face in my soup.” If this was not enough, the answer is "Come on, eat your daddy soup." Laurel and Hardy rest in parts.
