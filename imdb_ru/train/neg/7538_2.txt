I watched this movie, because I like Nicolas Cage, well, it seemed to me strange and completely meaningless ... so I decided to dig a little and pick up a copy of the 70s. Wow. what a difference the original was much better. I would like you all to know that initially he really made a statement, his existence had a goal. It was a truly Christian public expressing its fear of paganism. If you dive into it, he also comments on life, but I donâ€™t want to go into details, simply, simply put, if you were disappointed and would like to know how it should look, feel free to watch a version of the 70s, a bit outdated, but much better.
