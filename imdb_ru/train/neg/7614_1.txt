This may be one of the worst films ever. <br /> <br /> 1. The most exciting part is the beginning when the guy is walking ... and walking ... and walking (spoiler). There about 15 minutes just by foot. How? <br /> <br /> 2. Not to mention the fact that there are many problems with lighting, and almost as if they even filmed night scenes during the day. <br /> <br /> 3. The game was terrible. Looks like they found a public theater (in Mexico) ... and then they took away people who were rejected. <br /> <br /> Please, for God's sake, do not shoot this film. If you know someone who owns them, apologize to them. The director must be punished through the war crimes tribunal for imposing this on the public.
