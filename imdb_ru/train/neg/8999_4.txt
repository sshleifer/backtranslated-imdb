Saturday Night Live, a graduate of National Lampoon and SCTV - all together in a sometimes funny sketch movie. <br /> <br /> However, it is very interesting to watch it now, in early 2005. Twenty years after the release of this film should happen, look at how many of their jokes became absolutely true: there is a fake movie trailer that probably wasn’t even smart at the time, for something called “Pregnant Man” that became reality with the stupidity of Arnold Schwarzenegger The Junior Film There is a commercial deception that was probably not even clever at the time, for something involving Sammy Davis Jr. and Jackie Onassis called “Celebrity Fight”, which has now become a reality thanks to pop A popular show called "Celebrity Boxing" There is a fake movie trailer that may not have even been clever at the time in which John Candy is depicted in a movie about a severed head. Check out this trailer and see how similar his pictures and plot are to the Frank Hellenlotter Basket! And finally, there is an announcement about a late late screening of a documentary about “dead sleep, only two left ...”. The title of the documentary is LAST CHIPES! Lol <br /> <br /> Four prophecies come true!
