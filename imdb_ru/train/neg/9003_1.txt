This film is really, I mean really, sucks. He has very large openings for the plot, and a 30-foot dragon can pass through them. Not to mention the dragon itself, which inevitably is the worst computer-generated image that ever existed on film. I mean, when you see something like this, you have to think, “Wow, someone actually made this film. Then released it. It takes courage. ” Whoever they are, I am sure that they no longer work in the movie business. <br /> <br /> When I shot this film, it was not on DVD, so I (reluctantly) shot his video. The first thing that appeared was the Lord of the Rings trailer for Two Towers. It was a very smart move - put this video on video. That justifies me (reluctantly) by giving the film 1 star, otherwise I would give him zero stars. Maybe the producers, although Dean Kane's star appeal (I think this is how you write it) will attract crowds (well, to the video store that is). <br /> <br /> Then they used a split-screen technique (as in the Hulk) to (I guess) compensate for the fact that the atrocity is a piece of shit film. On the cover of the box we see the image of our hero and dragon. Does a dragon look just like a dragon heart, or is it just me? In any case, the dragon in the film looks like a rejection of Gremlins 2 and has a CGI villain from the Nintendo video game from the early 90s (perhaps worse). Moreover, not the Dragons movement, as it pursues its victims - this is the same F ## cking monotonous movement - right leg, left leg, right leg left leg - DOM, DOM, DOM DOM, DOM F # $ king DOOOOOM! It just pisses me off. Perhaps the filmmakers thought it was exciting and would have the same jaw effect. Why not take a picture of the Dragon POV? In any case, it was just funny, very much like watching Weble’s cartoon. <br /> <br /> Dean Kane looks at the film a lot of confusion (he may have come to terms with the fact that this film may end his career). Don't expect Superman here. The first time I saw the trailer for this film, I thought it was an addition to the PS2 game. <br /> <br /> As for the story, this is so bad, my 5-year-old brother can come up with better ones when he unconvincingly tries to lie about why he was idle in my room while I wasn’t there. Oh, and did I really mention that I, TO THE KING # OF THE KING, HATE PEOPLE THAT MADE THIS INCREDIBLY SIZE OF A FULL ALARM FILM? !!!
