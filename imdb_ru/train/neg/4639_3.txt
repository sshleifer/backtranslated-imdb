The werewolf's eyes (1999) are a really bad movie. The premise was really good, but overall the performance was just awful. I would like the filmmakers not to hurry with this project, and not rush it into production. Some blind dude has new eyes, the bad thing is that they belong to the old evil werewolf. Nasty starts to happen to the dude when he turns into a cheese creature. Can he find a cure before his hot girlfriend finds out? Who is this weird little troll who helps him and what happened to this female cop? If you really want to know, look at the werewolf's eyes! <br /> <br /> Good idea for a movie. I just wanted the filmmakers to spend a lot of time preparing to shoot before they decided to make a movie.
