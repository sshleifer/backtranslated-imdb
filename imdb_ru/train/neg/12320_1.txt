There are no spoilers, but I have been sick since Waking the Dead began, but the last series, of which only three have been released so far, is terrible. The stories have no resemblance to the original idea of ​​the series. I found these 3 in the last series of jaws ridiculously. As a BBC license payer, after the show I called the BBC to transfer my disappointment. I am amazed that the actors of the caliber of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnston did not object to the plot lines. These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons, and they can see that they have lost all directions. This is a good job, because the last or the next series can begin with the fact that the team is investigating the death of Santa Claus! <br /> <br /> Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire, England.
