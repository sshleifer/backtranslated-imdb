Working in a video store, I consider it my solemn duty to tell about the worst films I've ever seen and warn my friends and colleagues about it. On one day, a particularly heated debate about the fact that this is the worst film, my friend dared to see me B.T.K. The killer, even stating that if I could watch the entire movie and at the same time claim that my previous choice was the worst movie ever existed, he would have watched it. I'm lost. I believe that even I made better videos than it did in high school, and it was hardly the great feats of a young genius. This film lacked not only what seemed to be a production value (it looks like it was shot on a bad video camera, although it is surprisingly clear), but also acting skills (wooden, hollow and pathetic do not scratch the surface), and just the filmâ€™s bad state of mind. I can recall the scene where I heard the breaking of the glass, suddenly reminded me of some bad school plays (I know that I often mention high school here, but this film did seem very young) in terms of a set that seemed too fake but also, as if people were reading their lines from the script, not quite sure what was really going on. My review does not make this film fair, because I cannot describe how awful the time I spent watching this film was. It is almost ironic that I do a pitiful job, describing a pathetic excuse for a film.
