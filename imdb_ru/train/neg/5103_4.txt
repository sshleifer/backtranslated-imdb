I have long heard that in order to get their start in "legitimate" films, many behind-the-camera type works on porn movies. <br /> <br /> People, producer and director of this monstrosity stayed too long. </ Br> <br /> Poor, scenic and written character, he uses a lot of very good talents (Diehl, Dorn, Eggert). <br /> <br /> There are a lot of bras here teasing a lot of sexual activity to take an alien being, but it never crosses the line ... <br /> <br /> However, after that you still want to take a shower.
