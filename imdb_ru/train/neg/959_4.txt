I would give this movie 1 out of 10 if not for ms. Speech by Claudine Barretto. and I will take this time to skip that Chris Aquino here. and ... the end. <br /> <br /> I really DO NOT watch Pinoy horror films, because the stories lack originality, and I really think that (some) authors don’t pay enough attention to the characters (and their progress) in their stories (redundant ?? ). as if they were “pushing” the movie forward when their stories stank. and, my God, creative exhaustion led them to plunder other films. What for?? why did this movie get a good review ?? I wouldn't do that much. the film was KIND OF scary, but the film seemed more bizarre because it deals with Filipino folklore ... it is on my list of the most likely. I just wish they would spend more time improving the scenes and correcting these flashback episodes, not to mention the lighting being sucked, it would not matter if the content took you away ...
