This is followed by spoilers like this, and the Matrix. <br /> <br /> I really liked the original Matrix. It was not a deep film, despite Fishburn’s attempts to philosophize, but it was quite successful, fun, and I have a weakness for racing in Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> In the original, Neo was the secret life of the rather unfortunate working cube of Anderson. Happy corporate drone, and at night the brave hacker. In the end, he is ultimately forced to choose between these lives with his actions — whether he becomes a criminal fighting a machine, or he returns to a safe, forgotten world in which he began. Interestingly, he discovers that one day a person is deprived of illusions. Life rather sucks. Next to him is his girlfriend and his buddies, but he eats processed slop, puts on sweats and lives in a truly plump mechanism. However, the truth makes him free. <br /> <br /> At least part of the fun of this first film was “what if it was me,” raised in the mind of the viewer. What if _I_ was capable of the impossible? What if I were "One." It does not even matter that you are an example of The One, with such a cool name. <br /> <br /> In addition, Agent Smith made a wonderful bad guy because he embodied all the fear of the power that we carry with us. It is just as impossible to stop as a terminator and mercilessly. <br /> <br /> At the end of the Matrix, Neo must return to the Matrix to share his good news about freedom. <br /> <br /> This film is not able to fully embody the ideas of the original film, and he does it with such a lack of pleasure, such poor scripting and such poor editing that I cannot believe that they planned these changes. When the dialogue is at the fifth grade level with various long words inserted randomly, I find it hard to believe that they understand what they are saying. <br /> <br /> My short list of error characteristics: <br /> <br /> An oracle turns from slightly useful, if it is deceptive, to a completely obstructive one without any real reason. <br /> <br /> The basic “personalities” of the matrix are introduced unnecessarily - for example, the master of keys was a nice idea, but just not such an interesting character. <br /> <br /> Fishburn loses its role as an "adviser" and gets nothing to replace him. <br /> <br /> The people of Zion are not particularly Oddly enough, you would not want them to rule the world. <br /> <br /> Problems with special effects: <br /> <br /> Fight scenes are meaningless and inconstant. In the Matrix, you felt that Neo could lose, and that he needed to become something more to survive. In “The Matrix: Reload”, he is just a character from the point of view of a particularly badly traced video game. <br /> <br /> Fighting on the freeway looked rather false, and not so interesting. <br /> <br /> Pacing problems. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, the fight scenes were endless. <br /> <br /> The rave lasted too long - everyone in my row at the theater looked at their watches. Not because we object to good dances and good orgies, but because we did not know about the people depicted and did not care about us. <br /> <br /> Regardless of what the cracker wrote, the monologue should be blacklisted. He wriggled, used words that the screenwriter clearly did not understand, and was a waste of time and a murderer. The creator’s speech could have been made in a tenth of the time, and with greater danger, since “Zion exists to give the rebels a place where they can go so that they do not destroy the Matrix. There are too many people now who do not believe; in danger of being broken and killing every person connected to it. Furthermore, the earth cannot support even the people in Zion, let alone others. You can choose one person from Zion to form a new Zion, while I erase the memories of the people currently in the Matrix. "<br /> <br /> Instead, we got a long, stretched heap of chatter. If someone claims it is deep, ask for the transcript and try to break the sentences. Each of them is too long on several points and uses words with clearer and short synonyms. <br /> <br /> So, in general, you shouldn’t look. <br /> <br /> I saw the third, and despite what many reviewers said, skip it. It does not save this turkey . <br /> <br /> Reviewers who believe that the second and third films were “deep” should watch some of the actions deep films. Maybe read a book or two about rhetoric and debate, and maybe a little philosophy. This film is just not difficult to understand, but hard to digest. <br /> <br /> Scott
