This film was very disappointing. From that chatter that made me decide to see Ghostly Love (why is it called?), I expected something tricky and thoughtful with beautiful images. He did have some interesting images, but they often seemed random and had no meaning. In fact, they seemed like they were put in to fill the time. In the end, the effect was flaccid. <br /> <br /> I think the film should have been atmospheric, but it’s not. The lack of a consistent plot did not help. You could say it was mysterious, but I think it was just incoherent without atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The main character seemed to be alarmed, but the plot didn't draw me enough to take care of her situation. Without looking at the cast list, I would not know that you see the main character in childhood. The film has very little context for time, place or character. I am not a hypocrite, but sex scenes (there were several of them) seemed meaningless and even more embarrassed me, I recognized Lulu, but I was not sure whether it was the same man, different men, a lover, her husband, or she was a prostitute . Only when I saw the credits did I find that the hairy back should belong to her lover. This film managed to do something that was supposed to be shocking (dream sequences involving mother Lulu) seemed a little boring. <br /> <br /> The nail file actually made more sense because it gave some insight into Lulu's emotional state. I will not blame the actors, since I did not have much work on them. <br /> <br /> I don’t know if the lack of context or movie in the film was due to ineptitude or pretentiousness, but the end result was boring. <br /> <br /> I can't talk anymore about this.
