Have you ever sat and watched a movie when 20 or 30 minutes passed, and suddenly you realize that you have really seen the movie before? It happened to me with Young Graduates. The lid of the video box, if you can find a video, is extremely deceptive. I swear that there are no two women on the cover even in the film. <br /> <br /> In any case, I was born ten years later to appreciate the subtleties of this film, or ... this is just meaningless junk. I strongly prefer the latter, but I think some of them have developed a connection with this film. <br /> <br /> Hmm ... plot. Plot. Let's see ... somewhere there must be a conspiracy. No, I can't find it. This is largely about some high school students who are sluggish, take drugs and speak a language that was outdated decades ago. One of the students is in love with her teacher. The teacher has a frigid wife (whom he really calls an iceberg), so he is susceptible to the girlâ€™s success. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of skating, meaningless dialogue and a lot of spastic dances. Our cat BooBoo was shocked by the dancing students. She watched with amazing intensity as the dancers rotated and swayed on the dance floor. It's nice to see that at least one species has found something interesting in this relic. 1/10
