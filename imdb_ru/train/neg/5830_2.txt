Restraint in drawing. 9. Director: Matthew Barney. <br /> <br /> How did you find out when you are at the center of a pretentious feature film? Is there only 8 lines of dialogue in a 140 minute movie? Is this when Bjork wears something like a giant fluffy pete on a head in a pseudo-Asian ritual? It may be when giant poop and spines are used in the whaling bubble experiment. Or when are you ready to kill the composer for creating a minimal and still annoying version of Philip Glass score? In any case, Drawing Restraint 9 is one of the most pretentious modern feature films. At the 135th minute, he adds a bit of dullness to his claim. I would call the use of colors amazing, and the initial sequence interesting, but the rest of the film looked like it was made for a Discovery Channel documentary. Until it looks like they tried to make their own version of “P-ss Christ”, but that will be later. <br /> <br /> In fact, part of the documentary was its best parts. A superficial story about a whaling vessel, and then there is a ritual about making whale oil. In addition, there are guests in the form of Bjork and Matthew Barney, who are welcomed on the ship by passing through a humiliation ritual, which includes a head-shaved shake (I think the boy’s pranks), nicotine spots and giant fluffy pita hats from pita, Then gutting, cannibalism, and let's not forget the gigantic shit. <br /> <br /> Matthew Barney wrote that this is a “relationship between voluntary resistance and creativity.” It is almost the same as saying: “If you do not understand this, it means that you are not creative in your interpretation, so piss off because I'm an artist.” Oh wait, this is a POST-modern interpretation of this proposal and what will the film be about if it is POST-modern. But it must be Modern Art. As for the art itself. <br /> <br /> So let's begin this whole interpretation, okay? The following lines are only serious at 3/4 and should not be taken as a realistic attempt to interpret the film. <br /> <br /> The first half hour concerns divers and the construction of a giant ramp. Obviously, the ramp is a symbol of the need to rise to the standards that are dear to you, and pearl divers are looking for pearls of wisdom. Then on the whaling ship they build a crate that looks like it has a coarse whale shape. Obviously, this is a gross element of foreshadowing. <br /> <br /> On the ship, they turn whale oil into whale shape and take out part of their fins. They replace it with the spine, and then with a giant turd. It is assumed that this is the state of the film itself. When it is fat, it is interesting, but bad for you. When this is the spine, these are the "important" parts of the film, or, so to speak, the basis. Then the giant turd is the depths of the film, or when the film is crappy. <br /> <br /> Bjork and Matthew Barney, arriving on different ships, put on strange, humiliating outfits that they hadn’t even made or were symmetrically suspicious that they ran out of money, and Barney tried to quit smoking. SO, they put patches on his head. They go through a ritual and learn about the ship from a Japanese sage who tells them that there are scars on the ship from the impact of another ship; crash or crossing if you want. This inspires Bjorka and Barney, who are different from each other, to start cutting off each other's legs and eating them so that they can turn into whales themselves and become one and the same person. They intersect. Oh, I forgot to mention that it was made in a video by Robbie Williams? Then the pearl divers return with their mouths full of pearls of knowledge, which they fell to make a silly Venn diagram. Barney obviously went through 8th grade geometry. Or maybe at least some social research. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I forgot that Bjork clogged his ear, that I wanted to kill her? Sometimes it's hypnotic, but in others you just want to kill her. <br /> <br /> A feature film is one thing, and when you just throw up all sorts of symbolism in the hope of getting a reaction from people It becomes a suicidal joke. When do you cross the line between a joke in terms of art? Dali and Bunuel often made the surreal pieces of nonsense, but were more connected and / or entertaining than this piece of garbage. In Un Chien Andalou it’s crazy enough to fill as many symbols as possible in less than half an hour. <br /> <br /> So can I recommend this? Only if you like boring HIGH ART films with lots of symbolism and flat images. <br /> <br /> D +
