I watched this movie last week and I had the biggest laugh in a long time. The plot of the film is quite stupid and tangled in a poorly thoughtful form. The only plus that can be found in the film is Cory Sawier's impressive press. Alexandra Paul (I think that is her name) is terrible as the preacher's wife, who had a history of depression. Ted McKenzie is rude, and his hero is a fool in all this. And as if the fact that you think that she has sex with her son is not enough, they add unnecessary saxophone solos at every opportunity! The end and the culmination of this film is absolutely pitiable and ridiculous. I mean, who the hell does the child want to be like a crook who tried to make you think that he is your son and that you had an incestuous relationship with him!
