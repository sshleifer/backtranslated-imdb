I think Cliff Robertson was certainly one of our best actors. He has half a dozen classics. He does an excellent job here as a heavy one, but the direction is so bad, and the pace is so exhausting that it never fails. The story begins well, although it makes one wonder how he could expect his wife to hang himself. However, he spins well and carries things. Mortal ringing dual. First of all, if we took the amount of time the characters spend moving from one room to another or from one part of the house to another, it would eat up about a third of the film. Add to this, the Robertson character, sitting in bed in blue light and looking confused, may add another piece. I agree with those who said that a half hour shorter movie would have turned out pretty decent, albeit insignificant. The biggest weakness is simply an elaborate conspiracy, which, when all is said and done, leaves incredible questions. I do not insert spoilers, but when it ends, do not think too much. I can come up with ten "what ifs" without raising a sweat. It would be better if it remained a ghostly story.
