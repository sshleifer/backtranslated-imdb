Imagine that you are a schoolboy, behind a dark, crowded theater with your girlfriend. How bad should a movie be so that you feel compelled to leave the theater and go home before it ends? This movie is so bad. Indeed. Movies often become so bad that they are good; this film goes beyond that stage of evil. It hurts badly. Awful, terrible, a crime against humanity is bad.
