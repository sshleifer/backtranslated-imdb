Terry West had a good idea with this film. He just did not make it happen. There are endless shots of creepy-looking school exteriors that go on forever and probably complement the running time of the film. Also in this school there are only 2 students. Misty Mundae is good as usual, but this movie will always belong to Ruby LaRocca (which is the only reason to watch the movie at the beginning). If the script focuses on its interesting character, we will have a movie to watch. She is so gorgeous! Good news for DVD buyers, Terry West's earlier (and better) film "Blood For The Muse" is a special feature. One thing I would like to say is that in this film one feels that someone does not know how to pronounce the zest at the end of a long joke, because the end sounds exactly the same. Again, just watch this for Ruby LaRocca.
