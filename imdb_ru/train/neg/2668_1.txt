don't fall for renting this movie. This has nothing to do with escaping death row, despite the (English) title. I can't think of any good to say about the film. Bad gameplay, bad editing, bad direction ... a ridiculous “plot”, and sound / music were so annoying that it is surprising that this film has no warning sign. The only possible way to watch this movie and enjoy it is its historical quality. They just don't make films so bad anymore.
