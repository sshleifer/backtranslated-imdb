Compared to other Colombo films, this can only be rated 1 (terrible). I seriously do not understand what other reviewers have seen in this horrific movie train crash. It was only through painful charm that I continued to watch it â€” to see what a strange or inept decision the director would take. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer suggested that it was Falk's only director's exit, because it interfered with his playing. role. Actually, I think the real reason lies in the studio bosses, who must have been horrified when they saw what he did with his money. Surprisingly, they did not kill him.
