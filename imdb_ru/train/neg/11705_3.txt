This sultry melodrama is the pretty worst movie with Ingrid Bergman in the lead role I've seen. Even its bright on-screen presence cannot save this unbearably slow and tortuous film, which is almost impossible to watch without fast rewinding. <br /> <br /> Only for persistent Bergman fans; others are likely to fall asleep. I invite you to see "For Whom the Bell Tolls."
