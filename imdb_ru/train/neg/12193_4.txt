“Listen, I know that it may be a shit right now, but the pain is temporary, the film is forever. Everything that you do now burns in celluloid for all times and for thousands of years to come. ” ?? Robert De Niro <br /> <br /> Initially, it was a film for Steven Spielberg, a director who hired several screenwriters to adjust the script so that it more closely matches his themes. So, we have a dysfunctional family threatened by an abnormal monster in the form of Robert De Niro, who was recently released from prison. Like the Jurassic Park, the Poltergeist and the War of the Worlds, dysfunctional families unite to defeat the beast, and the beast is the creation of a father, a lawyer who could not defend De Niro during the trial. <br /> <br /> In the typical manner of Spielberg, a father kills a monster that undermines a family and then quickly gets rid of his sins. Like Oscar Schindler, Robin Williams, Sam Niel, Tom Cruise and almost all of the “father’s” figures on Spielberg’s land, the father recovers his father’s debt in the bitter-sweet code that Spielberg enjoys. <br /> <br /> But Spielberg eventually left the picture, and the project was instead transferred to Martin Scorsese, who at the time was trying to try his hand at a more commercial rate. The result is perhaps the worst film in Scorsese's filmography, and, ironically, his lightest. <br /> <br /> Failures and failures of the artist are often very revealing, exposing the inner workings of their art. When the story does not work, the characters do not connect or the images are not distorted, we find ourselves with some internal core. It ?? the remaining carcass is what the director cinema is about. <br /> <br /> Now “Cape Fear” is an impersonal film, so we will not find any thematic links with the rest of Scorsese's filmography (“You have already sacrificed myself”! ”shouts De Niro, but in the films the themes Catholic redemption - cookies). The film, however, reveals the language on which his filmography is based. See how Scorsese's camera desperately wanders back and forth, how he desperately approaches the door handles and windows trying to cause tension, and how all his characters shout loudly and demand attention. But more importantly, see how the film has no spatial meaning. The boat duel at the end of the film takes place on an obvious sound stage, the street parade is claustrophobic and takes place in a wider context, and the family house does not seem to exist anywhere else specifically. There is simply no geographical sense in the picture, Scorsese cannot shoot space or create any spatial environment. <br /> <br /> The reason for this is that the Scorsese chamber must always be tied or closely tied to its central heroin. For the world around a character to make sense, his camera must be focused on the character. Resnais can take you around the French hotel, Wells and Hitchcock can dance you down the street and through the building, Cameron will take a tour of Titanic, Scott can recreate the whole future cityscape, Lucas will give you someone else’s desert planet, and most other directors can create a sense of space with using close-up close-up combinations, but Scorsese cannot do this. There is no poetry, no sense of material space in his films. He is all about character. You break this leash, get out of this boxing ring, get out of a taxi, turn away from De Niro, and everything will collapse. He simply cannot move away from this very documentary style of shooting, which, in a sense, is a necessary condition for the militants. <br /> <br /> Scorsese tried to correct this problem with the “New York Bands”, where space and scenery become the central character, but even this self-consciously spatial experiment is sabotaged by Daniel Dey Lewis magnetism, the actor inexorably pulls Scorsese's camera towards him, as moth on a light bulb. <br /> <br /> 5/10 ?? Even as an ordinary B-film, it is an ugly, vulgar-looking film. Look at the matte paintings, inept attempts at tension, silly rotor-copied special effects and opening the fist fight. However, we have Robert De Niro to relax. De Niro, who conveys his body to Scorsese, as the tattooed Christ, gives the film a single magnificent scene. In an improvised romantic sequence with young Juliette Lewis, he thrusts his thumb into her mouth and kisses her. A kind of symbolic rape, the girl runs away, excited and repelled by the interests of this man. <br /> <br /> But De Niro's performance, so exquisitely superb, simply cannot imitate Scorsese. You will need an operatic tone and baroque images of someone like De Palma to do this work. But Scorsese? Not. <br /> <br /> Worth a single viewing.
