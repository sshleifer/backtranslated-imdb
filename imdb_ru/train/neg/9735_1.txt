I tried my best to sit through this annoying mess, but I just couldn't do it. Brad Dourif absolutely sucks, as the leadership and all the supporting actors were only slightly worse. <br /> <br /> Everything is just ridiculous, from the terrible game to the funny FX and the silly plot. <br /> <br /> A complete waste of time; don't worry, root canal treatment would be more enjoyable. Bamboo shards under the nails would be much nicer. <br /> <br /> Watching Uwe Boll's movie will only be a little worse than this. Get an idea?
