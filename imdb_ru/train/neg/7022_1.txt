Over 70 years of watching movies, this must be one of the worst comedies ever made. Mel Brooks, Mike Meyers and a few others made some very bad comedies, but this is the absolute bottom of the barrel. <br /> <br /> This is unfortunate from the very opening, to the cracked scene during the credits. <br /> <br /> Diana Keaton, whom I usually love, must have really needed her salary. She desperately needs to re-master her skills. <br /> <br /> Dax Shepard (I don't know who he is) needs a better director to show him how to act. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler is also not suitable for his role. <br /> <br /> Mike White must find another character, he did the same person several times too much. <br /> <br /> Ken Howard, who started many years ago as a first-class actor, is also not as good as before. <br /> <br /> I canâ€™t say anything decent about this comedy movie attempt. <br /> <br /> Ratings: * (out of 4) points 25 (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10)
