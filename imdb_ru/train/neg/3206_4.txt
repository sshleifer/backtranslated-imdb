I was glad to hear that Cesar Montano decided to make a film in Kebuano. (Not a “dialect,” as most Filipinos would call it wrong. As Cebuano and Tagalog are as illegible as French and Spanish for each other.) But I was very disappointed when I saw this film. Being Cebuano's Canadian parent, I was optimistic about the revival of Visayan film industry when I heard about this film. I was also excited to learn that it was not another stupid action film or melodrama, as Filipinos love this type of film. But, alas, I was short lived. <br /> <br /> Panagoy serves as an ego trip for Cesar Montano. Montano, of course, plays the hero of the film. And when I say “hero”, I mean the most stereotypical manners; his task is to win the heart of the girl and lead the Bolonians to victory over the Japanese. His character has no depth or complexity. He just fits the image of the hero. The remaining characters are one-dimensional; they are all suitable for their cookie roles. <br /> <br /> I’m all for sluggish / meditative films, but this film was just slow. It was not meant for anything. Just because the film is historically themed, the drama and the slow film do not make it a good film. <br /> <br /> American actor Philip Anthony is especially annoying. His performance was embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If Montano wanted to revive the Visayan film industry, he should really think it over. He said that he wanted to make Visayan films that could compete in Cannes and Toronto, etc. But, in fact, this film would be booed and hissed at such festivals. To get Visayan films into mainstream consciousness, he had to at least make a film that would attract an audience, even if it meant sacrificing quality. Obviously, he did not think about it and did not receive information about which films receive awards in Cannes, so a film that would attract an audience would be at least a step away from the door. <br /> <br /> Now I’m afraid that because of this movie, Visayan films will no longer be filmed for a long time. If I ever tell a Filipino that I want to see more Visayan films, then, of course, I will get the answer: “Visays don't make good films. Have you not seen Panagkhi Sa Suba? ”Of course, this is ridiculous, as this is one of the examples of the Visayan film, and probably the only example that anyone can see now. <br /> <br /> Examples of meditative films, and not just slow, Tagalog film “Eclipse” or “Direct Story” by David Lynch. I hate promoting Tagalog because it is endlessly and unfairly moving and pushing the throat of the non-Tagallian Filipinos, but in order to call a spade a spade, I say that Blackout is a VERY good movie. These films are highly dependent on what Hitchcock called "pure cinema." Images without words are used to transmit the story. But for the sake of these two films, I will reject the definition a bit, as these films use images without words to convey the mood of the film. and they do it very well. Panaghoi believes that if they simply take stunning pictures of the landscape, then they create a mood. <br /> <br /> And what about so many Filipino films with a dying mother or grandmother ???
