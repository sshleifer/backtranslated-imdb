Oh, CGI. Good with proper use. Sin with this is used by people who have no idea what they are doing. Unfortunately, this is not the only thing that is poorly used in this countless deplorable state. <br /> <br /> Well, anyone who read any number of my published reviews probably noticed two things. 1: I love low budget horror movies. And 2: if there’s a nice guy in this low-budget movie, I tend to point them out. So let's just get this out of the way right now. This is one low budget horror movie that I didn’t like. The action is, for the most part, terrible, the effects are ridiculous, and the script competes with Battlefield Earth as the worst thing I witnessed this year. How resident cute boy ... Dax Miller (God) wins this prize. This boy is hot! And surprisingly, he is not just an elastic body with beautiful eyes and a cute ass ... he really can play (well, as much as he can in this odious film). Now that we have household chores, let's continue. <br /> <br /> In the Cliff Notes version, here’s a story (don’t worry, I’ll try not to give anything away) ... <br /> <br /> A film crew goes to a remote island to make a documentary about two surfers ( cute guy and his buddy) who travel with sharks. They do not know a rather large saltwater crocodile hiding around the island. Krok shows up, chaos ensues, and people eat. Collapse credits. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, this film is largely blowing. It started out pretty well, but soon became foolish and stupid. The main character becomes lunch (in a rather humorous way), and our remaining heroes articulate one blow at the expense of the victims. In addition, if this crocodile is at the top of the food chain, both on land and in water, what about all the sharks around? If this thing can eat a 40-foot boat, I do not think that a few scarce sharks will remain nearby. FX is one of the worst glitches I have ever had. The CGI is terrible, and they even managed to spoil animatronic crocodiles. Attention cinematographers. National Geography. Discovery store. Crocodile Hunter. They know what crocodiles look like. You obviously did not refer to any of them, judging by the monster seen at the end of the film. And what a pirate gang? Did you just need another reason to rip the top of a woman <br /> <br /> It's funny how little subgenres appear in the movie world. With Alligator and its sequels, Lake Placid, Crocodile, and now Bloodsurf, it now appears that Crocodile / Alligator in oversized movies should now be categorized in Blockbuster. Alligator was good. Lake Placid was good. I even thought that Crocodile Tobe Hooper was good. Blood Surf sucked. <br /> <br /> My rating: D-
