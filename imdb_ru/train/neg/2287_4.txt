I saw Gretchen Mol in only two other films (“Girl 6”, “Donnie Brasco”) and I don’t really remember her, but she did a great job as a naive girl who posed for photos because it made people happy. <br /> <br /> She really didn’t think she was doing something wrong, even when she went out of business and again found her religion. <br /> <br /> The photos she took were certainly tame by today's standards, and it’s funny seeing people with cameras get all excited, and politicians preaching about the dangers of pornography. David Strathairn (Good night and good luck) played a super role here. <br /> <br /> Mary Harron (American psycho) wrote and shot an outstanding biopic about the most famous movie star girl.
