I watched this movie after I had a lot of problems downloading it through Rapidshare. And I must say that it did not deserve it. <br /> <br /> Parinda was so bloated that I was looking forward to seeing her. <br /> <br /> Parinda is one of those films that is not able to meet the standards set by other good Indian directors, despite the fact that they had a great story. Even more pathetic was to know that the story itself was not original, it was weakly based on the classic "On the Embankment." <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor was annoying, especially when he was from America. In many cases, this direction was poor quality, with the exception of a few intermediate scenes. <br /> <br /> Give this script to any of them - Ram Gopal Verme, Deepa Mehta, Maheshu Bhatt, Sudhir Mishra and I am 100% sure that they will make an amazing movie out of this. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m not saying that Parinda was bad. It was just not good enough.
