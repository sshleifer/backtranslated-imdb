I am all for the idea of ​​the grand epic of the American war of independence. This is not true. (And in this respect, neither the Emmerich / Devlin / Gibson PATRIOT. But I’m backing off.) <br /> <br /> I saw this film on an ad show in the old MGM Studios (now Sony) just before that. released. The audience had high hopes for this expensive period, written by veteran Robert Dillon, directed by the respected Hugh Hudson (from the movie “CHARIOTS OF FIRE”), and starring Al Pacino. <br /> <br /> But it didn’t take an effort to ensure that people began to squirm in their places, whisper mocking comments about Pacino’s terribly wrong accent - he had to be an American border guard of Scottish origin (!) - and was supposed to have recently emigrated from England (!!). Then the story began, and everything quickly went down. <br /> <br /> The motivation was confusing, the dialogue was brutal, the events did not have a historical or political context. That which was in the conspiracy rushed forward by an absurd coincidence; the second or third time, when the supposed lovers Pacino and Kinski stumbled upon each other, this was a bad joke. Donald Sutherland gave an impassive insight as a British officer / pederast. His accent was all over the map too. I think there were no available English actors. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of people left. Those who stayed tried to suppress a giggle, and then openly mocked. I straightened up - I thought that, at least, the battle scenes could be good. I was wrong. It is inexplicable that Hudson decided to shoot them with hand-held cameras, not even Steadicam, an insolence that gives inappropriate “authenticity” to newsreels that destroy the sense of scale. <br /> <br /> There was a half-known TV columnist in the audience a few rows ahead of me: (late) Gary Franklin from Channel 7 Eyewitness News. I could say that he was annoyed by the behavior of the rest of us. And, of course, on his television segment the next day he put the film "10" on his notorious "Franklin scale from 1 to 10", while also aptly noting the boors who interrupted the show the night before, which obviously did not when they saw him. What a jester. <br /> <br /> After this catastrophe, Pacino did not act in another film for almost 4 years. Hugh Hudson’s career has never recovered. You cannot say that I did not warn you.
