After watching this after receiving the DVD for Christmas 2005, I came here to scroll through it - but after reading the other comments, I had no heart left. Obviously, this is a film that works very well for children of a certain age. Well, let me not be a full Grinch; it may still work for some children - if they are not too saturated with media and they do not become visually too complex, for example, from watching LOTR and Harry Potter. But if you are an adult, stay away from you; You will not like it. <br /> <br /> Good moments: Barbara Kellerman in the role of the Witch, especially in her early scenes with Edmund, creates precisely the right mixture of charismatic evil and restrained madness. (At the Stone Table, she goes a little higher.) Michael Aldridge in the secondary role of Professor and Geoffrey S. Perry, since Mr. Tumnus also has a polished, skillful game that we expect from the very best BBC drama. And the suit of Aslan works very well, surprisingly well, given. They understood their eyes correctly. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: almost everything else, but in particular two areas. One, casting. England is crammed with good actors and contains tens of thousands of attractive British schoolchildren. How could they end up with these four scum? They move like wooden soldiers and say the same thing. Peter has no authority or charisma (and he is noticeably shorter than his supposedly younger brothers and sisters); Edmund just cries; and Lucy ... Sophie Wilcox in the role of Lucy is so radically, obviously, completely inappropriate for this part, that I can not imagine how she got the job. <br /> <br /> Two - animal costumes. Again, it seems that they worked for some children. If the kids are still at the level when Big Bird and Elmo are exciting, believable characters, they can be fascinated by this film. But for the viewer with the sophistication of, say, a 12-year-old who saw the Prisoner of Azkaban? When Mr. Beaver comes out of this tree, there will be a cruel, mocking laugh. The costumes simply do not work - I could not, and I think that no adult or modern teenager could suspend disbelief, looking at Mr. Beaver. Drawn animations later (griffins, etc.) Work better, they are easier to take. <br /> <br /> So: ten stars for a very young and tender soul; everyone else is reading or re-reading a book and watching the best film that unfolds in your imagination.
