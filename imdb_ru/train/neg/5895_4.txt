Is Miike Shabrol, alternating art with a tree, sometimes confusing them? Does he correspond to fifty / fifty percent of any claim to Shabrol? Do we see too much or too little Miike? I dont know. I dont know. I dont know. But I could easily fill in ten lines simply by referring to the theft, hints, and cliche of Chakushin Ari. Others here will beat most of them, although perhaps this is not Symin (hypnosis) Ochiyaya because of dirty TV shows, mocking supernatural things. Only once, when Yumi picked up a mother, like a zombie, One Missed Call struck me a bit. <br /> <br /> Another attraction: Renji Ishibashi (similar to Christopher Walken) as a detective. Ishibashi in an abusive listening story, and as the Boss of the Dead or Living Aoki from the vat of the flood and more, may be the most persuasively evil character I have ever seen. So, he's a cop.
