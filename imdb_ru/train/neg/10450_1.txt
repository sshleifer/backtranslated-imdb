This movie was the worst movie I have seen since the movie Date. I laughed the whole movie, and was not scared. It was funny how snakes searched for a certain part of the passengerâ€™s body to attack, for example, eyes, tongue, butt, chest. If we have seen the national geographic channel, we know that the snakes will not remain trapped on the body as soon as they bite. In each particular scene, the snakes bit the passengers and remained on the body, biting the person. I believe the producer did not study his information about snakes and their behavior. I can't believe I wasted my money on this film. So I do not recommend trusting this film, just wait until it is in the dollar theater or rent it.
