The first half of this film is pure delight. Novel. Funny. Great performances. A close brother and sister living in Manhattan fall in love with the same woman! Adult. Bright Witty. What else can you ask. Like a romantic comedy, it starts to freshen up. It heads into uncharted territory. And then it falls apart. <br /> <br /> This is not a universal comedy for adults, but a story about growing up from the closet, which was done many times before. What a disappointment. Like a movie about people, it starts with such a promise. Why it needs to be turned into such a pedestrian film “I am who I am.” A shot from the final shot, in which Heather Graham jumps into the air to celebrate "her happiness in finding herself," emphasizes the banality of the last part of the film. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it was different. It could be magical. It ended up the same old, same old.
