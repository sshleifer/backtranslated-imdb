I attended one of the premieres last night, and I have the following observations: <br /> <br /> 1. Just because you shot a ton of music videos does NOT make you qualified to make films. The film had an overabundance of long shots that didn't make sense, horrible angles and terrible lighting. Editing did not help this mess at all. When Dixie is late for a memorial service, her mother remembers her hand, but it’s never clear what the hell she is saying. <br /> <br /> 2. The plot was promising, but the script was thin and full of holes the size of a Ford Truck. We never understand what drives the characters, what really stands behind the conflicts that they all have with each other, and how exactly they solve them. Sixteen years of distance are erased in 4 days, apparently with magic. Deep conversations have been clouded by silly cliches. (In fact, the whole city was one big cliché of southern life.) Half the audience groaned when Toby pulled out "I got blood from your veins in the veins" ... and we were turned to this tasteless line not once, but TWO! Revelations caused a yawn, and the dramatic confessions came down to "I was stupid and stubborn." <br /> <br /> 3. The acting was all right, considering that they had to work on the script. Toby was dark and pensive most of the film, but when he smiled and lit up, he was charming. It is a pity, he did not have such time on the screen. The acting chops Kelly Preston are rather rusty, and it shows. Lindsay Haun is talented, and, of course, it is not her fault that the writers made her character so incredible in the beginning that you do not blame her father for not coming to look for her. Burt Reynolds and Tess Harper were able to make more of this film, but still looked more or less lost. (And indeed, their characters are lost in this film!) <br /> <br /> 4. If you are a fan of Toby, you will love the songs. But often in the film it was felt that the scene was called so that they could show one of his songs - or the performers on his record label. For example, the official love song for the film "Crash Here Tonight". You might think that it would play a tender love scene, but no ... we hear about 45 seconds when he goes to the memorial service. As if they said, "Well, we have to use this song somewhere." The song "Broken" pursues and best of all comes out of this film. <br /> <br /> As a result ... the promising story never develops completely, and the film is terribly uneven, as it is forcibly trying to become a vehicle for placing music and Toby Keith products for Ford Trucks. It goes from the fact that people restore destroyed bridges, to trying to talk about the power of music, but the story is told so badly that both moments are lost in this overgrown music video. I like Toby, and I really wanted to fall in love with Broken Bridges, but the people he hoped to make this film disappointed him and deserved one of his famous shoes, which you know where.
