I will not go and give them my 10 bucks, I went and bought the fourth season of the original and the best. At the very least, my children enjoy it and can watch it without worrying about what they see. I have a teenager, and she thinks that the previews are ridiculous and would prefer to see the original. And she thinks that Jessica Simpson is a terrible daisy, in fact, she thinks that she looks more like a whore than a duke of daisy. In those shorts, she could not wear anything at all. And since then, when "American Pie" has anything to do with the dukes, they are ashamed of having put this unpleasant line about sex with the machine. That in itself should have received a movie rated R. The only thing that can come of it is a film about reuniting with the originals. Lets everyone hope. So people who went and watched the movie would see how it was supposed to look.
