What is it ? Low budget sex comedy? In any case, it perfectly describes people in Spain. They could come up with a better idea, I mean, they have been making such films since the 60s ... and people like them! This is neither a comedy for teenagers, nor a family one (you cannot let your 12-year-old child watch two guys kissing in bed, he will never want to go to Spain). It should be rated as “R” because only 35+ people seem to laugh while watching: S I am really disappointed, maybe I don’t like gays (which is a rather important part of the film). <br /> <br /> Foreign humor is terrible in films (except Kusturica), do dramas! If you want a new comedy, try Talladega Nights
