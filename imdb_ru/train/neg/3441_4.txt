What the hell was that. Someone had obviously read Stephen King and Sartre in one semester. We mix existential fear with cheap horror. There were moments that were disturbing, but each of them was canceled by terrible music, computer graphics, or acting skills. <br /> <br /> The problem with strange stories like this is that it seems lazy. Even the work of David Lynch sometimes seems so, and, like his interesting shows and films, it is too long. And, unfortunately, it's only 98 minutes. <br /> <br /> The cast was attractive, and thatâ€™s it. I guess it affects the feelings of teenagers and the fear of loneliness that we all have, but it just doesn't make the characters cute enough for us to take care of their fates ... whatever they are. The final scene leaves it all mixed up.
