Oh, it was a really bad movie. The girl who plays Jennifer is okay, but I think that she behaves viciously in the film not because her crows are pulled out of her organs at night, but because she is thinking of dismissing her agent for putting her in this nonsense, Faye Dunaway behaves as if she is reworking Mama Darling, and the final is completely stupid. I really can't recommend this film at all, although, being a fan of Edgar Allen Poe, I was a little intrigued by the references to his work (Crows, curse of the family of the House of Usher and the funeral alive) - while he probably would have turned over in his grave if he knew about this movie.
