I like the slashers of the 80s, and I remember when “Silent Night / Deadly Night” was filmed from our cinemas, I was very disappointed, so I was very happy to see some of them on Fear.net. “You better watch out” is what I expected from such films. The quality of the special effects was ridiculous by today's standards, character development was too long, but on the whole it was ridiculous, ridiculous! <br /> <br /> Scenes where he loses it, because Santa, who is also a dad, feels his mother, and then, when the mafias really show lit torches - not torches, like in the 80s, but real torches! - really tickled my funny bone. Nevertheless, the scenes where he was testing the children in his area caused me a terrible feeling of a different nature. I also enjoyed trying to figure out who the characters are. It took me some time to realize that the main character was a cute teddy bear on the brothers.
