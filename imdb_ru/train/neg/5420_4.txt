WE ARE OPEN <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio format: Silent <br /> <br /> (Black and white - Short film) <br /> Stan 'n' Ollie mixed up with a pair of sluts (Kay Deslis and Vera White) after going to the theater, which burned down in their absence! Needless to say, their tyrannical wives (Vivienne Auckland and Bess Flowers) are not surprised ... <br /> <br /> Good Comedy by Leo McCary laid the narrative basis for William Sater's masterpiece Sons of the Desert (1934) with L & H playing in the forehead-beaten victims of circumstances, are forced to speak a monstrous lie, which effectively affects their consequences. Much of this is very funny, especially the scene in which Stan teases Deslie, which leads to a fierce play of jolt and jerk. However, Auckland and Flowers are undermining some of the fun, playing their roles completely straightforward, which adds an element of trouble to the henpecked scenario. Originally released in the UK under the name WE SLIP UP.
