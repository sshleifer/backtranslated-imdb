They made me watch it at school, and it was awful. The film is outdated. Episodes become confusing, because fact combined with fiction makes the story more interesting. The teachers spoke of this as pleasure, but in reality it was a terribly boring experience. I read that very few people who appear in this film are actors, but most of them they do what they do in the film in real life. This explains a stupid game very often. In addition, very often the story becomes slightly outrageous and contrived. I do not like the way some lines were written, and I would like them to have more meaning for them. Although it was written to be educational, fun, stressful, and fashionable, It ended up to be boring, dry, contrived, and old. I hope no one is wasting time watching this movie, because you simply would not see it.
