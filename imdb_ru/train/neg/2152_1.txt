This film tries to be very smart and look like Tarantino. <br /> <br /> Before you try it, you need a solid cinematic basis. These include good sound, editing, design scenery, and so on. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about the sound in this film. absolutely cruel I never again distracted on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> And before we talk about a low-budget film made in Chile, etc., let us remember that in our time sound without sound is much more achievable than it ever was. anywhere. and more information about the technique is available than ever. <br /> <br /> The sound in this movie is bad. in particular, folies are irrelevant and irrelevant in everything, the atmosphere is equally terrible. I heard at least four loud clicks during a movie that are the result of poor sound editing. the sound inside the car is awful, the sound of closing the doors of the car is awful. the sound of the ladies sings wrong. Foley is either overboard or simply not there, as a healthy person who is just bored and he gave up. spaces are wrong. everything is not so, <br /> <br /> and, nevertheless, not allowing to limit the creative potential, at the same time the film boldly tries to be clever. for example, the aquarium sound is used in the next street scene. we hear sound when we shouldn't. sound changes precede visual changes. every trick in the book is used, and yet the basics just don't exist. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of editing, we have scenes that use heavy jumps, we tinker with the timeline, etc., etc., yawn. All these techniques are simulated to very low standards. <br /> <br /> In general, the mix is ​​shit and the sound is shit. and so, the movie is crap. How can one view a film with as many fundamental flaws as a reward and high rating? New cinematic wave in Chile? What is the best creative way Chile has to offer? I hope not, and I think not. <br /> <br /> My theory is that Chile’s more selective and better talent avoided this film as a plague, perhaps because of its high risk content. equally, the film, in all likelihood, received so many unwarranted critical reviews from the so-called “world cinema” fans for the same dirty reasons. they probably revel in this rubbish. Of course, film critics rarely pay attention to technical details and quality. <br /> <br /> This movie is rubbish. it's all mouth and no pants and never deserves a rating of 6.8. the film has all the quality of production cheap Tarantino, a new wave inspired porn!
