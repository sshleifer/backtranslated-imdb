This is just the carnage of Edwin Torres' remarkable story. This film does not match the storyline in the book. And there are so many inconsistencies with the original film that you have to wonder if the screenwriter even saw the first film. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino (original and still the best Carlito) goes from prison to the beginning of the original. Here Carlito retires with his woman in paradise. <br /> <br /> What happened to Gale from Lorain, Ohio? In this issue, she is not mentioned, and Carlito retires and is likely to marry some other girl. <br /> <br /> Also, where is Kleinfeld? I think he was in the first book. <br /> <br /> I also like the way Mr. Guzman plays a completely different character in this film. He was Pachanga in the times of Pacino. Now he is Nacho Reyes, the killer from Cuba. I remember that Nacho Reyes played a much larger role in the book. <br /> <br /> A lot of time has passed since I read the book, but where did the character of Shaun Crest come from? In addition, I think this film really obscures racial tensions in Harlem, which Torres wrote about. And the mob does not receive the treatment they did in the book. They are also destroyed in this film. But, oddly enough, the group “Pleasant Avenue” is preparing for the second film. <br /> <br /> The book told a great story. This film could tell a great story. This is just a huge disappointment. To read a book. This is the best use of your time.
