so overall, I found this documentary strange and really meaningless. I know that he received awards and the like, but personally I didn’t like it very much. there was neither humor nor drama to interest you, just a bunch of oddities and their work. some people are quite different, which is not bad, just did not make a good impression on me. I was bored of this film, no offense to my creative writing teacher. The circus theme throughout the film was pretty cool, but I didn’t understand it, and robotics and taming the lion were definitely not my Green animals were neat, I really liked the many bright colors in the garden, but how did these four works come together? it just didn't make sense to me why someone made a film about it. But if you like these things, you might like it. who am I to stand in your way. I just warn you of possible suffering.
