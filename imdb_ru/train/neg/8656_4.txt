This is the first zombie review of the genre that I did, but this film is worth the review. Dinocroc is a good movie in general, but unfortunately it is still an obvious b-movie. Dinocroc itself looked great, but I thought that the film itself needed a little more weight, as in battle and violence, because whenever a crocodile is shown or in the battle scene, not much happens, except for the crocodile the crocodile is shown and either kills or runs away in a repeated process. Jane Longeneker was hot, which is a plus, and the game was better than average, and the most amazing thing was that the crocodile looked fleshy, and not like a cough from a cartoon * curse chest of drawers * coughs. I liked this film enough to enjoy what will be the continuation, and this is more than what I can say about some films in general. Only 3/6 stars and worth seeing.
