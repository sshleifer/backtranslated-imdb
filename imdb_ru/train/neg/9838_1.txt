This movie is terrible. A decent fight scene or not, the game is REALLY bad, how can you say that they read their lines from the map. With a painful delivery line to everyone in the cast. Think of watching the game in high school and clinging to the apparent lack of smoothness in the actor's interaction (strange pauses between the lines of different characters in combination with the hasty delivery of lines by others). If the whole movie were action, it could be excusable, but most of the movie includes the storyline and Family Guy style, disrespectful cuts (Oh, wow, they are poorly made). I guess they tried to be funny with it, but it worked out again when a bunch of high school / college students lounged around for a day trying to create a fun video on Youtube. <br /> <br /> Now about the battle scenes. They are not so bad, given the level of quality that can be seen throughout the film. Nothing great, of course, is anywhere else on the same level as other posters (Nothing like the Drunken Master). The fights have an overly step by step feeling, with a LOT of cuts at different angles with clearly different positions involved. <br /> <br /> In general, the only reason to watch this film is that you were one of the friends of this guy who did this very, very cheap production. Whom can you ask? Oh, the same guy who wrote, directed, produced, and looked at this high school masterpiece.
