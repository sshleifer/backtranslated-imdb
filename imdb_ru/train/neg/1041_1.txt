How many more fake films about “a piece of life” need to be made? I hope not too much. <br /> <br /> Victor Vargas's upbringing is a very shy attempt by director Peter Solett to get Hollywood's attention. Nothing wrong with that at all. What is wrong with this film, in particular, is that it ignores the audience and the clutter of every cliche in the book of supposedly “sharp” Hollywood independent production. <br /> <br /> It is supposed to be “real”, so leave the camera’s “documentary style”, except that no documentary shakes the camera intentionally ... <br /> <br /> This is " acutely ", so let's not waste time on the coverage of the film. <br /> <br /> This is “hip”, so let's ask children to use obscene words such as Al Pacino in Scarface ... <br /> <br /> And so on and so forth. All you have left is a very shy attempt to impress Hollywood, which will not impress anyone except the "rarefied" indie crowd, which, it seems, is still highly valued in every bad movie.
