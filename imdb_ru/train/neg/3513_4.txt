Jeremy Northam fights against the clone scenario “Total Recall” and a one-time romantic play to liven up an embarrassed character. Lucy Liu finishes her acting game from wooden start to finishing skill. You can't help but laugh while watching her interview on DVD when she uses the terms “Femme fatal” and “Romance”. She is not a French movie star actress, and they lack chemistry together. <br /> <br /> This film fails, not in the plot or sequence of actions, but due to lack of attention to detail in movies and filming. image of the world of technology surrounding the main characters. Few attempts are made to decorate the landscape to represent any continuous cinematic landscape or period. Cars are very 1990s, and the architecture is hardly modern, with open plans that hint at a limited budget, and not at a conscious dressing technique. <br /> <br /> This technology is very fun. Massive mainframes "2001: A Space Odyssey", equipped with portable compact discs with data collected for some inexplicable reason, despite the growing communication network, which even the most inexperienced technologist today would have known. There is clearly no research here, and, given the open source cyber community, the research would have cost a bit more than a bulletin board and personal time. <br /> <br /> The DVD interviews also show the original. The name of the film was “Company Man”, but it was probably ditched to capitalize on the Matrix deception. The title "Cypher" has only the slightest connection with the film. Terry Gilliam would do wonders with this concept; and completely rewrote the decalogue. <br /> <br /> This is the quality of a TV movie and is extremely disappointing for film production. This could be a good storyline for “Alias.”
