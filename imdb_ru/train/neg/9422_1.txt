This film tells about the experience of a couple of assassins (one of them is Burt Reynolds), a prostitute and two transvestites for several hours in one night in Miami. Convergent storylines eventually unite all people in one place and at the same time. The film was a bit interesting, but the big problem was that everything happens at night, and many scenes were literally undervalued to such an extent that it was impossible to see what was happening. In several scenes you can see where they tried to “stretch” the design process to save the images. Someone did not know how to control the movie camera. It's amazing that this movie even came out!
