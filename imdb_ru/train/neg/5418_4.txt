This film is similar to S.E. Hinton wrote in the 1970s, and Copola adapted to the screen in the early 80s, and if Trueblood really was a product of one or another, the results could have been much better (especially in the acting department). Instead, we get a pretty bad, funny piece of mediocrity. <br /> <br /> Jeff Feyi plays Ray Trublud, a former street rumble, I guess this is an accurate description. It was during the time of the militants, in which guys from the 40s to the mid-30s were used, who dressed them in fatter themes or in some more feminine choice of clothes for the gang, and they fought with lousy music of the 80s. Nevertheless, Ray is the lone caretaker of his younger brother Donnie (Chad Low in the unit where he shouts a lot), whom he inexplicably forced to leave behind at the station when, on the run from the police, he was seized and forced to serve time in the marines. Fast forward to the future, and Ray returned to the city and looking for his brother, who also became part of street gangs, although in a gang that was opposed to Ray, and now the old scores must be solved violently (and again, the police must be rejected and this time women defended in the sense of an action movie) before Ray can live at a normal pace with her brother Donnie. <br /> <br /> For the most part the movie is pretty funny. For me, much of this is associated with too much overvaluation, although not Fahey or Sherlin Fenn, who plays the waitress with whom he is friends. The gang guys and Lowe himself seem to be doing unnecessarily overly exaggerated New York street storms. However, a more serious obstacle is the redesigned storylines and, perhaps, a kind of film that was far behind its peak as a product of 1989.
