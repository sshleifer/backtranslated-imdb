Up to the end, the bad guys have an advantage - always - which calls into question the competence of the good guys. Several innocent accused of conspiracy crime are annoying. Some unnecessary dialogue in which various boring legal issues are discussed. This is just a mediocre, dumb old western, so what nonsense is it in trying to make things "realistic"? Cagney's atypical presence in the west is one of the few, if not the only, entertaining thing in the film. Somewhere in the middle there is a ridiculous marriage proposal; sort of like "Where is the Kid hiding ?? !! Where is he ?! ... Oh, and by the way, will you marry me?"
