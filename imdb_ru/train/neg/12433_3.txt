I like to keep my reviews short and simple, but that pretty much sums it up. You canâ€™t beat the first two for a number of reasons, one of which includes the talent of Chris Columbus. <br /> <br /> This film had a terrible direction, covered up with an even more terrible game. I can't even believe that these people are considered actors. <br /> <br /> It hurts to sit and watch. The storyline was a complete joke about the secret chip and Russian terrorists in their painstaking desire to get it back. Awful, rent one of the original tow and enjoy! <br /> <br /> During Christmas, the film was not even made, as in the original. One house has evolved from a great family comedy movie for Christmas as a joke without morality and conspiracy!
