Such a pretentious and lame thigh attempt. Devilish script and dialogue and a truly awkward game. Really the worst movie I've ever seen (in the movies). Nothing, in my opinion, does not save this film from a complete disaster. I saw it when he went to the cinema in Brighton. People came out, and there were more people chatting outside the toilets than in the hall! In the end, there were scandals and contempt from the remaining scanty crowd, which was rather sad, since the relatives of one of the main actors were present and looked really shy. However, the film was so bad that I really did not feel sympathy for them. Everyone has to start from somewhere, and their son began his acting career with this really terrible attempt at Tarantinism Made in the UK. 5 years have passed, but sometimes I still squeeze the memory of that sad night in the movie! This is a movie without any redemptive features! I gave it 1, because 0 was not available. They have to invent a “chart meter” for anyone involved in this sad movie mess. I know that some of them have moved on to the best things, the positive thing is that none of them could fall below this level.
