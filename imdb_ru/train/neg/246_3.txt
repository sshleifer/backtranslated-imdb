This is clearly a futuristic adaptation of Jules Verne's Mysterious Island. Sound editing is pretty bad. You hear the dialogue on the set and at the same time you hear the voices recorded in the recording booth! This is an amateur movie with actors from Boston, filmed in New Hampshire. For those who live in New England and who read this comment, the capital letter B will be surprised. This film is full of flaws. You hear the voice of the director, who gives directions and instructions for the actress. "Ok, now stand up." As for the other characters. There is this guy who speaks with his mind, not his voice, and this blue alien. Alien guy speaks with a deep voice. When he yawns or grunts, when fighting, you hear the voice of the actor. As for special effects, man! This was Brett Piper's early work when she cried loudly! Creatures are nice, but the animation is intermittent. Really sluggish. It seems like the animation of Karl Zeman in Journey to the Beginning of Time (1955). Special effects are creative. The music is good. In the end, this movie makes EQUINOX or THE DINOSAUR PLANET look like Ray Harryhausen's epic. Did you know that MYSTERIOUS PLANET is a home cinema and it had a budget for shoes? A must watch for novice filmmakers.
