“Little Man,” now on DVD, is the flop of the Vayan brothers. This is a story about a smaller offender than a small car, played by Marlon Wayans, who hides a diamond in a handbag after a robbery. He and his partner Tracy Morgan come up with a brilliant plan to disguise Marlon as a child and put him in the house of the ladies. Then he goes through all sorts of “Houses Alone” or “Children's Games”, like lawlessness, to return the jewel and be turned like a child. I was surprised at how low the humor was in this film. Jokes were made in other places so many times that they were not cute or funny. I almost think the film could have been funnier if they hadn’t used CGI and used a little actor who had been pasted over Marlon’s face. When viewing deleted scenes (without CGI), this actor was funny in the mini-me style, but they chose a different route. Several cameo roles and Tracy Morgan make some funny scenes. Spend your rent on Borat if you really want to laugh these days. <br /> <br /> http://mcmusicnotes.blogspot.com
