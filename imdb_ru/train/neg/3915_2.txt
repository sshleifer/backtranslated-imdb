This film is not only poorly written and directed, but simply unpleasant. The beautiful romance is horribly distorted in this film. Many changes were made to the storyline, apparently to simplify the timing. But what results are just confusing. The game can not overcome the script, which removes the motives of the characters for their behavior. In addition, the conversion to English does not work when everyone calls the patriarch Esteban Esteban. Horrible. Please, please read the magnificent novel in Spanish, if possible. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. It will destroy for you what can be a wonderful experience.
