Stuart Kane (Gabriel Byrne, VANITY FAIR) goes with his local friends from Jindabyne, Australia, to go fishing for a weekend, to rest, rest and relax. But when Stewart discovers the body of an aboriginal woman floating in the river, face down, it seems that everything has turned out for the worst. The biggest sacrifice of the weekend is the common sense of men. They do not go out of the ravine, but end up fishing with excellent catches. Then they go out and report the body. <br /> <br /> The city and the life of men quickly turn into a mess. Local media are attacking them, and accusations of Aboriginal prejudice rebel against local Aborigines. The wife of Stuart Claire (Laura Linney, “The Expulsion of the Evil Rose”) feels deeper meanings of what her husband and his friends did, but she has to contend with this because of her own mental illness. <br /> <br /> In the midst of all this chaos, this is the life that was this young woman, which is now a media show, hung on the morgue plate. Her murder and the subsequent dumping into the water symbolize what lay beneath the city of Jindabyne: the separation of men and women, black and white, social and outcasts. <br /> <br /> The only other people who seem to understand something of what is happening happen to two young children: the son of Stewart and Claire, who is led by the Australian half-breed, whose mother was also killed only a few years ago. A young girl lives with her grandparents and tries to let her mother go as best as possible, and it seems that the discovery of a new body ?? quite strange ?? the method by which this can be achieved (again, it is assumed that the main thread is Jindabyne). <br /> <br /> Everybody and everything in this town of Jindabyne feel what lies beneath its surface, but none of them want to dive into the muddy waters and look around (the symbols here are visible when they say that in a nearby lake, which is used for recreation and swimming, is the old city of Jindabyne under its surface). That is, until Claire forces them to do it. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting, but a bit confusing. There are too many storylines to explore, and this is simply not done; too many loose threads. The acting was fine, but the shoot was terrible. Shaky cameras, grainy or dark footage and just negligence damage the whole shoot. <br /> <br /> I like symbolic films, NORTHFORK is one of my favorite films of this kind. But Jindabyne needed to raise her head above the murky water so that she could see her own problems, which simply did not exist.
