As soon as he gets on the screen, he destroys all intelligent life forms around! But on behalf of his producers, I have to say that he does not fall into any well-known category of films, he deserves a completely new face value! This is "Neurological Drama"! This grieves and depresses every neuron in the human brain. <br /> <br /> This is the closest thing that can ever happen to a stroke without real suffering. It drives you crazy, all of you members are numb, your mouth opens and remains so, and the strangest symptom of all this is that you force yourself to want to go blind and deaf. something like a "movie". <br /> <br /> The only word that comes to my mind when I just finished my test is “STATEMENT” !!!!!!
