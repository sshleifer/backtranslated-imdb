After Highlander 2 (which I still deny about), I thought it was impossible to make a sequel that could make me cry, because it was so bad. I was wrong. I liked the original Wargames, but this movie contains inaccurate information about the computer and information about the original movie. The original Wargames at least had a few hacks that worked. Whoever wrote this movie, he did not know anything about computers, except how to use a word processor. I doubt that he or she even watched the original film. The game is not even convincing. Please save yourself, under no circumstances watch this movie. I don't care if the channel is stuck on the TV and you can't turn off the TV. THIS MOVIE WILL HELP YOUR LIFE.
