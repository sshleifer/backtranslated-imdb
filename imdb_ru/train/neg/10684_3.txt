This movie was shitty. I was not so emotionally involved in every character that I was the biggest antagonist of the film. I played it beautifully everywhere; promising myself that I’ll leave, but I’ll drink another beer, hoping that it will automatically turn into something exciting. Even in this state, I couldn't help but notice that the game of Cuba was as fragile as tracing paper. His obsessive dedication to his work was unconvincingly made just like his one-day break after the failure of his own idiot standards. Bert appeared on the screen as a general, right, a general (who wears too much makeup). I fell into a frighteningly quick snack to compete with Cuba, except that mine was real, and I kicked. Reimbursement! Repay my pinched finger!
