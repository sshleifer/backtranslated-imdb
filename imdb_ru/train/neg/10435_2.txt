When these people forge so many shots, use old shots and poison animals with gas, not to mention the fact that some scenes were filmed on the set with actors, what to believe? The old film of the countries is good, but the cruel treatment of animals and the degradation of the locals are painful to watch in these films. I know that racism is normal in these old films, but there is more to make this couple lose credibility. Introduced as pilots, they never flew their planes, Martin Johnson was an ex-vaudellian, used friends such as Jack London for financial gain, while at the same time receiving fees from them, denying his wifeâ€™s obvious depression support, all this makes these films unbearable. They were by no means the first to go to these lands, or the first to write about them. He was fine as a director and photographer, but that's all.
