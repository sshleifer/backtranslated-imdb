This is a real bomb. We must believe that Merle Oberon is the sequestered daughter of an ambitious politician who must prove to Tom Dele of the 1930s that he should be supported as a presidential candidate. Poor Merle cannot go anywhere, but he is surrounded by politicians and their quacking, trembling wives, supported only by good uncle Harry Davenport. She joins her two maids on a blind date, and Gary Cooper casually appears. Some shots of the rodeo may have revived things, a la "Inconsistencies", but with this no luck. Later, Gary breaks into a formal dinner that Merle is chairing, and although he is invited to sit down and join the group, he lectures them about their snobbery. Where did this insecure cowboy's unexpected eloquence come from? The most painful scene in the film is a ghost party that Gary organizes in his unfinished house for his absent wife Merle. Will it never end? One to avoid.
