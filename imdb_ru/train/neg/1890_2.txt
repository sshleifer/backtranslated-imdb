The problem with this title is that I'm not sure if the director is trying to make a documentary or film. Mixing two genres just doesn't work, and it leaves it all hanging in the middle of nowhere. This is all the more so since the director chose the very extremes of what should happen in our daily life, which makes him an unconvincing documentary. If it's a thriller / drama, it's too boring and monotonous. In any case, what is the moral or message that the director is trying to convey to the audience? Are there people around us who mistreat others, who want to be mistreated? What are a lot of crazy people around us? So what?
