Written by superb McGovern and directed by Frears, this film was a slight disappointment. It seemed too short. He spent too much time creating the atmosphere and laughing at the Catholic demands. Then very quickly you see that the fascists and socialists are fighting for the attention of the family and the terrible conclusion. <br /> <br /> Still, my wife thought Liam was cute.
