Creepy and lustful wolf. Young "Red" wears a full make-up and very short shorts and a bathrobe. It took about 20 minutes and realized that this could be a pedophile's dream. The "up-beat" music sounds very similar to what I hear in a strip club. I really think this film is a disgusting joke, not a family film. Gross, glad that I watched it with my daughter, I don’t want her to think that it’s okay for families to watch quasi kiddies porn together. Too bad, very sad that he is being sold as a family film, Joey Fatone will probably be embarrassed that he was in it. And what about advertising as the "effect of special effects" ??? The effects look low-budget, terrible.
