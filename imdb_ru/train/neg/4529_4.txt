I will not describe the story as it was done elsewhere. We are big fans of Clive Owen, and when our Netflix recommended a movie, we were intrigued. <br /> <br /> No wonder we never heard of this “movie” because it was a 1992 BBC television movie. This results in poor performance, a grainy image, sharp camera work and poor sound. /> <br /> But you are not against mechanics, because the story itself puts you to sleep. This is an interesting human story, but not convincing, and it is unlikely that it has an end. You don’t really care about the characters, because their life is just as boring as your life is watching this tedious movie. Save two hours and do something to make time more worthwhile.
