I saw this movie a couple of years ago. I could not sleep, and there was nothing there. So I spied it. What really turns me on is that it does not make sense, and therefore it bothers Richard tied to the wire mesh, and Jarvis begins to kiss Richard's girl when she is unconscious. Then buddy Jarvis Trubador plays some silly song on his guitar. The next morning, she reveals that Richard's girlfriend is talking to Jarvis and Truby, and then she returns to Richard and looks at him while he is still connected. Then they play funny music and the movie ends. I mean, what happened? Did they slow down? And what did she say to these two guys (Truby and Jarvis)? His perplexing and poor. I can not stand films that interfere and do not make sense. It was the worst movie I have ever seen since the 90s of The Lord of the Flies.
