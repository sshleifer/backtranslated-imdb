When I sat in this television mediocrity, I wondered why? Why did Diane Keaton agree to this garbage? The film uses meaningless invented storylines to deliver trash to thousands of homes. The film raises the political agenda to a new level. The film was meaningless, and all creditworthiness was lost due to excessive use of stereotype. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that Keaton tried to make this film worthy of attention, but in the end she needed to remember the age-old saying that you can't polish the poop. I hope that you did not spend your new year's day watching another meaningless movie for television. Now I know why the networks began to show the series on Sunday evening to save us from the garbage!
