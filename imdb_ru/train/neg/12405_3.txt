A shame! There, I felt comfortable in a chair with a beer and a bag of popcorn, waiting for another great night of Muppets night of entertainment. What did I get? Disappointed! How can dolls move from a sublime Christmas carol to this? The humor was terrible, the songs were worse than country and western (and that says something), and the plot was as confusing and poor as Blind Pew. I think the main problem was that they were biting too hard trying to capture Treasure Island. A short fairy tale, such as The Christmas Carol in Prose, is ideal because you can make Muppet's high jokes around it ... here the need to captivate the plot has stopped all the fun. Where do the dolls go next? What about the Muppets Wizard of Oz?
