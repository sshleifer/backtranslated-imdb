A television film about the ancient Egyptian curse, brought to the United States in the 1920s during the filming of the first version of the 10 commandments of DeMille, which awoke again when DeMille's scenery was discovered in the desert. <br /> <br /> One of the worst films I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> The question is, were the filmmakers serious or were they joking when they made this film? If it is serious, then this is a funny-bad movie and a great movie for its badness. If it's a comedy, it's less good, but funny for all the wrong reasons. You will laugh at this movie long and hard, probably more than many other Hollywood comedies.
