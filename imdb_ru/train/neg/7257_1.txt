I was expecting a b-movie french musical. In the end, Dery, Blanche, DeFunes were superstars of low-budget French films of that time. And it is in color! But I have a hallucination at this incredible hour of pure mediocrity. The musical numbers are terrible, but comedy is absolutely boring and stupid. And the songs? Which songs? It's just a sequence of bad numbers, one after the other. The only very rare thing about this thing is the nudity of women. It was not familiar at the time. In fact, some numbers just show us topless women. This adds to mediocrity! And try to find the young Michel Cerrault, the future great actor of French cinema, as a musician, in his very first film. Good luck!
