This is one of those films that are trying to be moody and tense, and instead end up stumbling over everything. Seeing this at a strange film festival, I was intrigued by the writing “the young college three went wrong,” but everything ended up rather disappointed. <br /> <br /> It’s hard to criticize the “truth” story, because nothing can be done about the plot, but I found it fragmented, melodramatic and totally depressing. sluggish close up. It just doesn’t work - in some scenes where it’s so stupid that instead of quiet trembling my audience suppressed giggles and rolling of eyes. <br /> <br /> The story has an interesting premise, but it just turns into darkness pathetic spiral.
