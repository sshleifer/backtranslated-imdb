I saw this movie on a Western American Airlines flight. It was so bad that the flight actually seemed longer. The conspiracy had the potential (who would not like the film about a woman who accidentally kills every Elvis imitator she meets?), But he was spoiled a million times because of a very bad letter. Toward the end - a terribly unpleasant scene where a gang of Elvis imitators are on the roof of a casino, reloading the sky, thinking that he is going to return, then a group of stars moves together to form the constellation "Elvis", which quickly shoots a lightning bolt at the imitators, throwing them through the roof. Bad ... REALLY bad. What is the theme for the whole movie. I would have avoided it at all costs.
