Judging by the hype and other reviews on this site, I was ready for an amazing horror movie about drug addicts. What I got was complete shit focusing on drug addicts. I wonder if there is another movie called “Plates” that these people watched? There are only 3 main characters, and none of them seemed to me well written or well acting. Basically, the whole movie I spent shaking my head and wondering at the stupidity of these addicts. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Do not rent this movie. Rent a Cabin Fever or some other decent horror movie. Dammit, rent Mary Poppins! Animated penguins are worse and more convincing than anything you find in Plates.
