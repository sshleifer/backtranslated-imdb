Tara Reid as an intellectual, Christian Slater (usually great) in the store dollars Constantine and Stephen Dorff as ... well, this is Stephen Dorff for Christ !!!! Personally, I just want to thank these brilliant directors for their hard work and effort. You guys are included. Here's an idea, just my humble humble opinion about how a movie comes out, but it immediately follows your previous choices, a film about the most brilliant neurophysics in history has invented one pill to cure all diseases ever known to man and get this, here is the Clinker they must play Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton. I knew you guys would love it. Seriously though you owe me $ 7.50.
