We all know that the film never pays tribute to the book, but this is an exceptional case. Important characters were cut out, Blanca and Alba were practically united into one character, most of the plots and the main elements of the main plot were excluded. Clara's clairvoyance was extremely understated, making her seem a much more superficial character than the one I recognized in the book. In the book, we learn more about her strengths and the important consequences she has had on many people, which, in turn, has become a key element in family life. In the film, she was nothing more than a special lady. The relationship between Esteban and Pedro Tercero (Tercero III, by the way, is a son, and therefore comes after Segundo II) and his relationship with Esteban and his grandson from Pancha García (not his son, whom he also made Recognition) is split in half and its value is diminished. <br /> <br /> One of the most fundamental things in the book about which the film is almost deprived: it is called “House of the Spirits”. Where is the house? It is assumed that the history of 3-4 generations of the family revolves around the "big house on the corner", as many times said in the novel. The house is at the heart of the story, but the film unfairly pushes it into the background. <br /> <br /> If I had not read the book before, I would never have guessed that such a juicy, shallow film could be based on such a rich and interesting novel.
