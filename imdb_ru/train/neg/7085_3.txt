I really tried to love this movie. It deals with an important issue in any society: sexual addiction. <br /> <br /> In this story we learn that you can lose everything when you are addicted to sex. In this case, our protagonist and hero for uninterrupted sex with all kinds of women (crazy, weird, neurotic) endangers his marriage, work, and even his life. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are terrible; mostly acting. Oh, you do not like ANY sex scenes, most of them are made with a very bad taste, and you might think that you are watching a home movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the plot simply does not make sense. How could such an intelligent and beautiful wife withstand all the troubles of her husband? How could she believe him ?! The situation with the three of them is priceless and for some time will make you laugh. <br /> <br /> In addition, the scene with the black spectator of the cinema is simply meaningless and makes you think: “Embed?”. <br /> <br /> Scenes similar to those that you will find in large numbers. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Please avoid this; it is not a soft core, it is not a documentary, it is not a dramatic feature. This is a pretentious effort on the part of a so-called documentary filmmaker or something like that. <br /> <br /> Only Mrs. Kinski’s exposed legs are worth seeing. I caught it on HBO, and I'm glad that I didn't spend my money on it. But these 90 minutes of my life will not return.
