If ever there was a comedy worse than Gray Questions, I don't know about that. The “funny” premise of the New York Jewish comedy is that Sam and Gray are mistaken for a couple of siblings, and so they decided to make friends with Sam and her friend, but found that Gray equally attracted their target - Charlie. The revelation that Gray is secretly gay is obviously just a surprise for her. There is a deeply offensive wedding sequence, a deeply embarrassing “drunken act” from Moynahan and Graham and a performance that would confuse the woods everywhere for its woodenness from Tom Kavan. Sissy Spacek demonstrates a complete inability to make a comedy and will want it cut out from her resume. Molly Shannon plays a homemade girlfriend with lumpen carelessness. Only Alan Cumming appears with any credit, but does not work seriously, and he has nothing to work with. The whole disaster is cemented by the bizarre effect of Graham, which ends with the penultimate scene, where she wears a comedy hat and coat, despite the scene at the lesbian bar. It is amazing that this film has ever been released, it has no redemption function, and should be avoided at all costs.
