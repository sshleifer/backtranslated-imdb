My comments on this film have been deleted twice, which I find rather offensive as I try to judge this film for other people. Please be tolerant of other people's opinions. Obviously, they don’t understand writing in the spirit of Nietzsche’s works, so I’ll completely change my comment. <br /> <br /> I think this is a really bad movie for several reasons. <br /> <br /> Topic: one has to be very careful in creating a film about the philosopher, which even today is not understood by the masses and among peers, causes passionate discussions. Philosophers agree that Nietzsche was a great thinker. So making a film about his life, which, obviously, includes his “ideas” is a thing to be extremely careful with or, preferably, not to do at all. Wisdom begins with knowing what you do not know. Someone might think that this is not a review of the film itself, but the film is not about an imaginary character, but about the life of a person who really lived and had / has a great influence on the world yesterday, today and tomorrow. If someone tells a story about a tomato, I can express my thoughts not only about the history itself, but also about the chosen subject - the tomato. Film producers are responsible for factual facts. Especially in this case, and this responsibility was not taken. <br /> <br /> Scenario: one of the first things I noticed was ridiculous accents. What for? It distracts from what should be; Nietzsche and the truth he found. It does not help to put things in the right geographic perspective or time! Come on, do it in English or better; Deutsch! Even Mel Gibson correctly understood this role ... allowing his characters to speak Aramaic in Passions. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it is well overvalued. <br /> <br /> 3d, Assante is not an actor to portray Nietzsche. Bad casting. <br /> <br /> Fourth, the facts are still far away. <br /> <br /> And so on. This is a waste of celluloid.
