Allegedly, a film that predicts future trends in British popular music is wrong in many ways, which is ridiculous. Tommy quick? Honeycomb? The film includes a song by Spencer Davis, two - "Animals", and one - in the live broadcast of the film "The Beatles", playing his version of "Twist and Shout" (all 1:20). But overall, a clumsy display of British music around 1964. Oh, and the hermit Herman.
