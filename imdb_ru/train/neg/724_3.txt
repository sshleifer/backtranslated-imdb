The concept for Sarafina seems reasonable, except for a musical perspective. He is trying to combine positive African music with a story describing the terrible conditions and atmosphere that black people had to endure during the filming of the film. The contradictions of each of these two elements are too obvious, and the film never justifies such a rapid shift between exultation and terror. If it was just a drama, reflecting these conditions, then perhaps it would be a good film, but the scenes in which soldiers knock down schoolchildren do not sit very well next to songs. <br /> <br /> In addition to the bad premise, acting is not the best, Goldberg plays a mediocre role, like other actors. Overall disappointing. <br /> <br /> 3/10
