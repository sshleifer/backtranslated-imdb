The movie starts slowly when we get to the cinema, we thought it looked pretty good, but after about 5 minutes we all got bored and we thought what movie we came to see, I don’t like this movie and I wouldn’t recommend the best part of the night was when the alarm and light came on again because the project collapsed because we thought we could all go home. it must be one of the worst films I have ever seen, we were all bored or tired, and most people in the cinema actually come out of the door at the end, because it was such a garbage. I'm surprised no one came out earlier than this. if you go and see, make sure that you are busy with something, better still do not go and see it at all.
