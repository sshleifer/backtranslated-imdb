I honestly have to say that I could not stop watching this film from the second one, that it began. Just for how everything was bad !!! It's like watching the paint dry out, only much more intricate. I mean, you are sitting there and just waiting for something to happen, something really, preferably something that makes the whole movie meaningful! At the end of the film, I really sat and wondered if there was any chance that I could skip the first hour, who explained everything, or I could accidentally lose consciousness during the film and skip those parts that stuck together the plot (if there was actually one) together! The main thing that really embarrassed me in this film is that the main girl (if she really was the main one) turned out to be in some kind of alternate reality, I mean, what the hell was going on at that moment ?! Suddenly she woke up and found herself in a psychiatric institute chained to a bed in which drunk doctors or something like that, and then faster than it would take me to cut my wrists, it turned over and some random vampire ate it it made no sense! I feel a desire to write letters to the authors and demand my time, I mean, I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this garbage! I’m curious to know if the filmmakers themselves knew what all this was about! it just seemed like someone had edited all the pieces that might make sense, although I think the film should have been 4 hours for this to happen! I fully support the other person who wrote the other review, I was royally deceived by this movie by its name, and only he. I am so damn grateful that I didn’t actually buy the film, no matter how many times I saw it at a local pound store. You would think that this would make me realize that the film is a complete pile of smoking trash, but honestly, I think that £ 1 was too much money to spend on this film !!!! what a damn huge waste of time and a good razor blade, i mean, i wish i had more pain than watch this movie !!!!
