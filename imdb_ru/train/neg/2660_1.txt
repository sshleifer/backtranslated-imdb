Despite this topic, this is an amateur, exhibitionist film - or an attempt to make one - which is about as interesting and audacious as the essay of a dull high school student, full of deadly "poetry." Of course, this will bother viewers who are obsessed with anxiety, but success will be explained to them, and not by the director. To truly penetrate someone's skin, we need sensitivity, discipline, technique and talent, as well as eye and hearing. The film contains one evocative image, shown as still (and also used in the video), but without development leading to or from it. If the director had an eye, he would see it as a possible starting point for an interesting film, that is, a film.
