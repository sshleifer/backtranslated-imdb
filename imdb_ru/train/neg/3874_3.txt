This film was so predictable that throughout the time you hope that the obvious suspect is innocent, and there is more. However, it is not. He just continues to act creepy, and she continues to ignore it. Mary found very incriminating evidence in his house, and she still trusted him? And what was this "persecution"? There was no trap. She confronted him, he said: “Sorry. I have to kill someone. ” He left, and that was it. They are trying to use other suspects (for example, one elderly carnival girl at the end), but they are completely underdeveloped. In fact, all the characters are underdeveloped. They have no depth, and the situation is just weird ... who hangs out at the processing plant? His is changeable and nothing is developed. For example: when she leaves her place after a beer, he finds pictures, and she runs out, and he catches her, and they end up having sex in this car ... what was it? Her reactions were not depicted. In the car, she behaved frightened, as if this could be almost rape, but all we see is her soul the next morning. booooooooo It could have been a lot better .. soooo much better.
