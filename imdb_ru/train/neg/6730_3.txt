This is a movie about how men think women think about love. No woman describes a sexual meeting for one night and does not declare it a love story. <br /> <br /> Of the ten monologues that I felt, only three actually had some kind of truth permeating them. I kept waiting until the film was better, and it improved a little, but never got better. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting concept, and I always wanted it to be good, but it never worked out. Perhaps if they really were love stories, it would have worked.
