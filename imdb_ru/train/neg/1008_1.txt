The plot of "Edison" was decent, but one actor, in particular, spoiled the entire movie. Justin Timberlake destroyed the film with every line he uttered during the film. He is undoubtedly one of the worst actors I have ever seen, and he will have the same fate as F.R.AT. National team. <br /> <br /> Justin Timberlake managed to destroy him, be it an emotional scene, an action movie, or even a silent scene. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time watching this movie. Don't even bother downloading, dwarf porn will be a much better choice. <br /> <br /> And justin, if you read this, stick to the music. Despite the fact that you are not very good at this, you have done a wonderful job, making people think that you can really sing.
