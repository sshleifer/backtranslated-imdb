Well, forget all the technical inconsistencies or physical impossibility of the space shuttle, accidentally launched by a whimsical robot with a heart of gold. Forget disgusting special effects and poorly designed one-dimensional characters. Just looking at the background of the story. First, the reason for the existence of the film, and you will see how awfully this film is complex. <br /> <br /> I know 9-year-olds who look at this insult to the intellect and just laugh. on him. The story is terrible. The action is ridiculous, and the message it is trying to show is incomprehensible. And what's even worse is that the movie cable channels let's show it! Its twice a day every two or three days! Why does someone in their right mind think that people want to see this painful piece of celluloid several times, and even more so - to see it in general? <br /> <br /> My recommendation is to not even spend energy to watch this thing. It's just not worth it.
