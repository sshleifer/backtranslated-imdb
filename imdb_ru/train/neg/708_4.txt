The story and the show were good, but it was really depressing, and I hate depressive films. Rea'Chard is great. He really played at the highest level, and the girl who played his sister was really amazing and gorgeous. Seriously, I thought she was Carmen Electra, until I saw the IMDb profile. I canâ€™t say anything bad about Peter Gallegar. He is one of my favorite actors. I love Ann Rice. I am currently reading The Vampire Chronicles, but I'm glad I watched the movie before reading the book. This is too "real" for me. I prefer the witty little things of Lestat and Louis against the slaves. Eartha Kitt was so creepy, and after her character did what she did, the film was destroyed for me; I could barely stand to watch the rest of the show. (sorry for the ambiguity, but I don't want to give anything out) Sorry, but this is just not my type of show.
