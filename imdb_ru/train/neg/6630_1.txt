This so-called remake is terrible. I went to see it tonight ... on the first day, as the wait and the hype were too complicated for me. But in the first half hour we knew that it was a disaster. This not only does not correspond to deception, but also offends the original blockbuster. There were loopholes in the script, editing was untidy quite a few times. Mohanlal, who is a great actor, did a great job. Amitabh was fine ... the director wanted to portray how angry his character was, but he was a bit overdone, which led to his strength. Ajay, who is especially smooth in such roles, also disappointed. Let's not even start with the new guy Prashant ... you couldn't be proud to start a career with something like that. Rajpal Yadav, who was thrown at a few laughs, could not even smile at anyone because of his strong humor and shrill voice. Niche Kothari proved that she is one of the worst actresses we have today. In general, RGV, which I considered one of the most talented and gifted directors in India ... failed miserably. He took on such an immense task and took on the responsibility of redoing what is known as the best Hindi film ever, and made a mess out of it.
