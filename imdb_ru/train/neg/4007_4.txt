I hope that the one who coached these losers by their accents was fired. The only distinguishing features are some of the supporting characters, 3 out of 5 of my favorites were killed by the end of the season (and one of them was a cat to show it in perspective). <br /> <br /> The whole storyline is centered around sex, and nothing more. Sex with vampires, gay sex with gay vampires, gay sex with straight vampires, sex with vampire blood, sex after drinking vampire blood, sex before vampires, sex with vampires, sex without vampires, sex because we are afraid of vampires sex because we are angry at vampires, sex, because we have just become a vampire, etc. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against sex, it would be nice if it were a little more subtle to be riddled with a storyline, you may have a storyline and then turn on sex. But they didnâ€™t even bother to do it ... and Anna Paquin is a dizzying bitch. Either she sucks, or her character sucks, I can't figure out which one. <br /> <br /> Another part of the storyline, which I think is extremely implausible, is why the 150-year-old vampire Bill, who seems to be putting his things together, will be interested in someone like Sookie. She constantly flies from him due to the fact that he can not control. He leaves for two days, and she already decides that he "will not return" and suddenly has feelings for the dogman? Give me a break. She is supposed to be a 25-year-old woman, not a 14-year-old girl. People close to her are dying everywhere, and she has the brightest smile on her face, because she just gave her V-card to some dude, because she can't read his thoughts? As the protagonist of this story, I would hope that the series will do a little more to make it understandable, and someone who is interested in your interest, and not someone whom you secretly hope to kill or fall into whom. I can not find in her character anything that I like, and even the fact that she can read minds is impressively boring and in no way interesting. <br /> <br /> I will not waste time watching the second season. June is coming.
