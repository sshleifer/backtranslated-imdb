In this film, there is no plot, no character development, and no budget. It really sucks to deliver it in a short time. Since the film has no development, it cannot even be viewed as an attempt to display artistry or make a statement against torture. Which leaves two other reasons to possibly watch this. To be shocked or crazy, like a sick little freak. Well, here too is missing. The girlâ€™s reactions just seem silly. it's very easy to say that it is a fake (to be honest, professional wrestling looks more realistic than the shit they try to cope with in this film. They throw insides into it, but she sleeps most of it, so it's just silly. really worthy the part is the end when they quickly move from scene to scene just before the needle gets into her eyes, but, to be honest, the girl is very ugly and incredibly false, except for her eyes. If you want a good torture film, look Hostel and Hostel 2. They not only contain realistic violence, but there is also a real storyline that attracts you and makes you care about people. Plus, towing movies really works on a deeper level, considering topics such as American fears of foreigners, questions morality, checking how far a person can go, human instincts against civilization, and much more, plus they are carefully written and contain good humor when the story is not focused on Violence. This is a much better choice over this piece of shit.
