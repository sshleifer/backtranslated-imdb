Last night, I decided to watch a prequel or, so to speak, the so-called prequel to Carlito's Way - “Carlito's Way: Rise to Power (2005)”, which came out right on DVD ... not surprising ... it's completely ... % & KS !!! spend time watching and I think it would be a waste of time to write about it .... I don’t understand how De Palma agreed to produce this crappy movie ... except for the fact that I take off my hat to .. Jay Hernandez, who plays young Brigante .... reminded me how De Niro got into Brando's skin to portray young Don Corleone in Godfather II ... but De Niro's difference was amazing and even got an Oscar !!! Jay Hernandez: he has the courage for trying to be young Pacino ... too bad for him, I don’t think he will play more movies, and by the way, after watching this damn movie, I sat down and watched the original way of Carlitos to get rid of the unpleasant taste of the mouth.
