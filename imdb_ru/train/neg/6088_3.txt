Why do I watch such films? - besides the fact that I have some strange erroneous masochistic belief that one day I will find a real gem among all this dross, I cannot think of one valid reason. This film was insane from start to finish - but half funny. Where, except in a bad Italian dubbed film, you might find a hot exchange of surrealistically disfigured English, like this, between an honest military type and an ominous head of secret secret materials like the Pravda concealment organization: <br /> <br / > Man in Black: Silence is better for us, until we can prove that UFOs have no militant motives. <br /> <br /> Military type: In any case, I believe that your intervention is offensive. <br /> <br /> The man in black: the one who imposes his will, is. <br /> <br /> I rewound the DVD (you understand what I mean) a good half a dozen times, and I still can't make these lines mean anything reasonable. My other favorite phrase was: <br /> <br /> “We can be pretty tough with those who are against our interests.” <br /> <br /> This is Jim's English, but not the way we know it. <br /> <br /> The other bright moments of this boring movie for me were the completely spaced out actions of the character photographer at the beginning. Burdened with the worst haircut, EVER in history, the man just wandered around, looking like a stunned fish in a bad wig, until he was kidnapped and forced to look at a piece of plexiglass by some aliens. Aliens are not most effectively seen as a POV shot — a hand-held camera with a fisheye lens — something like a ghost for the first time, but if you use it over and over again, it loses its power (by the way, if it's a shot from ), this means that for some reason, aliens always leave the room backwards). <br /> <br /> The film was shot in England. This meant that the Spanish Italian designers installed several British license plates on a pair of English cars and placed the "Union Jack" on the card of our hero ... and that was all. No other attempts to make it look like the UK. <br /> <br /> Favorite moment? When the Foley artists did not notice that the characters they were deceiving (is there such a word?), They no longer walked on the gravel, but now they were on the lawn, so their feet continued to shout loudly: "Crunch! Crunch!" noises In addition, another waste of 90 minutes of my life. I hope that they will prove that these UFOs soon have no belligerent motives ...
