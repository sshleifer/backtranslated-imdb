When I saw this trailer on TV, I was surprised. In May 2008, I was at Six Flags in New Jersey, and this was shown on a 4-D ride (you know, the ride that the seats move). I believe that the version I saw was shortened (15 minutes) and also recreated to add movement effects. It was a cute movie ... but that was all. It was informative and told about the first mission, but the end of the release of the CGI seemed a bit ... well ... banal. I was not a big fan of this film, but I would recommend this film to all parents who want to cheerfully tell their children about the first lunar voyage. I will say that the characters' actors were well selected, and the characters themselves were cute. In general, I would say if you want to bring younger children ... go for it. But if you want to take your older children, take them to another film ... they will be grateful to you.
