I blindly bought this film and am very upset that I paid as much as I did, but I would say that at least it costs rents for some cool deaths and a ridiculous game. This is not a very good movie, but I have to say that I was damn entertained. I think it can be called so bad, it's good. <br /> <br /> As I said before, acting is terrible, I feel that I could have done better by showing at least any emotions. There is nothing new in this story, and it has been made better. I think I just have a weakness for any movie such as Carnival Esq. I would say, rent it or download it, but definitely do not buy it. It does not cost more than one hour.
