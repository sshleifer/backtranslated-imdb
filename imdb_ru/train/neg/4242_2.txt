Men, I love police movies filled with action movies, shooting, chases, and so on. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was disappointed after watching this short and unsatisfactory film. We saw it all before, hostages, a bank, people around ... However, 2 bad guys who shoot down several officers and innocent people who just stay in the firing line - without a blow due to some kind of Kevlar. <br /> Not just a few shots, no, hundreds of shots. Returning to the bank, where stupid hostages did not lock the safe or the doors when the bad guys came out. How stupid the director thought we would be. <br /> <br /> Well, the footage between this fake documentary was good, but after watching the movie I just thought: why didn't the police get a decent course of shooting? And why there, where there were so many policemen, and there were special forces on a very long break. Really bad.
