To enhance the drama of this fun story of the maternity ward, it is placed in a special ward for "difficult cases." The main story is Loretta Young; She is on leave after a long prison sentence for murder. Will doctors save her child at the cost of her life or will they listen to her husband's request for the opposite? Melodrama and feelings are dominant, and at least they are not entirely honest. For example, just so that everything is in order, a psycho-neurological department is located in this hospital next to the maternity hospital, and a woman with a hysterical pregnancy can roam the theft of children. <br /> <br /> There is enough laughter and sarcasm to make it recognizable as the Warners film, mainly from Glenda Farrell, who drinks gin from her hot-water bottle while she waits to have twins who, to her chagrin, she finds that now there is a law against sale. An example of her ward: "Be careful." Farrell: "Too late to be careful." Alina McMahon, of course, is remarkably authoritative as the head nurse, but do not expect a dramatic moment to give her. <br /> <br /> The main theme of the film is that the kind of child turns anyone into a mess, Even with the obvious limitations, this film should have been better than it is.
