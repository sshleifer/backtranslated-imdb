My sister and I must watch this movie now. we laugh deaf. Can you imagine on the covers there is an Oscar nomination ?? - first, the musician mixes about 4-5 different musical styles ... and the music is not synchronized with the scenes and characters moves ... <br /> <br /> --- the main character Sylvester does not fit in there. he looks like a Mexican Tarzan. <br /> <br /> ---- Russian soldiers are everything, but not Russian faces :-) ----- well, the main points: 1. The plane, called the charter, is painted black ... <br /> <br /> 2. what was the idea when Rambo went to jump from the plane, but he was stuck? rope mix 3. Girl? best scene when she dies. She means a lot to him. has he known her for ages? he cries for her ... oh my god samurai 4. how many arrows does he have? Is his bag of arrows always full of arrows? I did not notice the scene where he collected them - but I saw the scene where the arrow remains in the solder head in Vietnam - this is very important 5. how many missiles can a helicopter hold ??? (real) I saw 4. but Rambos hit about 20 of them. <br /> <br /> 6. main part. What are Russian special army helicopters doing in Vietnam? after the war? 7. The first scene, when he enters the camp in Vietnam ... his first idea was to free the refuge that stands on a tree in outer space. Wow, what an idea than again: 1. You can cut the wire with a knife? maybe made only in vietnam? 2. Mortar - use for hitting one running person? My God, Americans really need to learn about weapons! You know how much it takes to calibrate a mortar (I think the writer has watched a lot of movies about World War II)
