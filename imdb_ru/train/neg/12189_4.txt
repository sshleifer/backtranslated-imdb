I am surprised that this film was rated so highly, although if I went with a typical scale of 71, it is c- or d, so maybe everything is in order, but this film was just a typical thriller, with the exception of dull slow and unreal . Not that the typical thriller was realistic, but this one seemed to be trying, and yet the woman who was raped did not press charges because she did not want to be cross-examined in court, even if she would expose the man who had broken her hand, knocked out of her shit and raped her for life, and also protecting the lawyer to whom she had feelings, and his family, and not random people whom she did not even know. There were other similar problems with the film, which would be normal if the film had some kind of morality, but some moral questions, such as whether it was right to try to kill / defeat Kadi before he did something illegal, were He was a little one-sided, as Cadie was just a crazy bastard, eager for revenge, so the lawyer was justified in protecting his family, as the expectation that Cady would actually rape his daughter so that he could do something legally a little absurd. So now I just spent most of my life on this stupid film, so please don’t watch it so that at least your life doesn’t change, and so my 2.5 hours or so means something.
