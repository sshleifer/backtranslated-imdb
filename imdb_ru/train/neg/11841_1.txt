What happened to Peter Bogdanovich? Once a brilliant director, a blazer trail ... now scrubbing at the very bottom ... Is this the same person who shot The Last Picture? Here he takes a somewhat interesting (albeit contrived) premise and turns it into a chewing gum, which loses the flavor at the moment when you make the first bite ... Dunst is not bad, but Izzard is mistaken like Chaplin, and all the other actors seem to be their "appearance", not because they were right on the role. Very bad. I'll go renting the "Paper Moon" again.
