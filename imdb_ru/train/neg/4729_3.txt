LIVE LITTLE, LOVE A LITTLE - one of the strangest films of Elvis. Part farce, part fluff, part surreal, and part strange. Elvis meets a very unusual girl with an annoying voice. She looks like Jennifer Aniston. The story does not make much sense, as is the case with most of Elvis Presleyâ€™s films, and there are a lot of strange characters in abundance. Not a lot of music in this, but what I have, I liked it, although not one is remembered. Strange continuity. Elvis and Michelle Carey leave at night in their beach house, but after a few minutes the courier arrives and there comes a clear daylight !! What kind?? This is about the essence of the film. What kind?? Oh, two good things about the movie: A) Elvis looks great and B) the dog steals the show.
