As a big fan of horror films, especially J-horror and Gore, I thought Nekeddo burâddo sounds pretty good. I researched the plot, read the reviews and even looked at a few photos to make sure that the movie seemed awful and terrible before downloading it. So excited that he had finished and was ready to be frightened and recoil in horror from the amazing blood I expected, I was terribly disappointed. The plot was ridiculous and didn’t even make sense and left too much unexplainable, the blood was more fun than horrific, and what about the cartoon-style sound effects? The game was probably the only thing slightly frightening about it. I didn’t understand the idea of ​​a cactus and how the mother’s husband disappeared in the middle of the sea after a flash, they both remained rather unexplained, or maybe I missed it because my mind couldn’t understand what I actually saw. I appreciate what was supposed to be; shocking and a few scenes (strange cannibalism and kisses of their own mother?), of course, were, I just think they went a little far and not even in a terrible way, they made it unconvincing, which made it more likely to be a comedy, but what horror did sight. Nevertheless, this is a very interesting film, it caused a lot of laughter from me and several friends, but, unfortunately, we expected horror, not comedy, so it’s worth watching for fun, but don’t wait for a dark, deep scary and terrifying movie ; you will just be disappointed. If it was a terrible comedy / parody, I would rate it around nine, culminating in a strange scene when my husband climbed into his wife's belly and covered her wounds, but unfortunately I gave him one horror.
