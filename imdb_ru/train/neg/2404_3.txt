Dude, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> 1) Adam Arkin is more tearful than Ross Geller from Friends. <br /> <br /> 2) The great cast is in vain (Kenneth Mars, Alan Arkin, Ed McMahon, Pat Morita, Louis Nye) with this amateur script. <br /> <br /> 3) The film suffers from terrible tempos. He jumps in a disorderly, confused manner. <br /> <br /> 4) The story doesn't even make sense. Why does he want to break the football series? What about stupid violin music? None of this is explained. <br /> <br /> 5) It's not even funny. It's like a bunch of accountants trying to improvise, saying, “Look at me! Look at me, I'm funny! ”It was an unsuccessful attempt to make another film“ Love at first bite. ” <br /> <br /> I like Larry Cohen’s films, but he failed. I couldn't wait for the loans to start. Terribly disappointed
