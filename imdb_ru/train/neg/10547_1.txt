I do not remember the film, in which I was less worried about where the heroes came from, what was happening to them and where they were going. I understand that the biggest pastime in Hollywood is the gaze, but these people are either too contemptible or too boring to waste time. Whatever the cost, however, the discussion that followed the screening under the auspices of the “Key Sunday Movie” series really did allow that three of the women showed some redemptive qualities. I disagree.
