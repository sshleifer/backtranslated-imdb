Not only does this movie have a bad plot, bad direction and a terrible game, it opens up a whole new meaning for racism. <br /> <br /> In this film, “White” chickens are whores, “White” boys are gangsters who want to be bandits, and successful (yes, again) “white” businessmen are disgusting toilets. <br /> <br /> I just wonder what will happen if I make the exact same movie with the same storyline Script, only I did it about Caucasians. “Dude, it's nice to finally see you stop meeting these black chicks.” <br /> <br /> No one seems to notice this, but watch this movie again and you will be sick of the way they portrayed the new Zealand “white boys”. Suddenly his white people, who are the main cause of gang aggression, and whores for a quick blast. Only Samoan girls have a heart, there is no such thing as a white whore. <br /> <br /> I hate that they could not make this movie without giving the Caucasian community in New Zealand a repulsive tone. If you think that I am overly generalizing, watch this film and see what you think of the “white boys”. The fact that Samoans prefer to call us “white guys” in real life does not mean that it is ridiculous. If I said, hey, black boy, I would lose my teeth. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. Do not waste your money. Don't be racist.
