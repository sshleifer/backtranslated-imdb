It took 9 years to complete this film. I think that during these 9 years someone would say, hey, this film is terrible. I have seen better acting in porn movies. The story is tired and played. The offended child turns into a serial killer. How about something new for a change. How about an abused child turns into a flower girl? At least it would be a new turn. Why does everyone who has a camera and an idea for a film (especially unusual film ideas) think they can be a director? I admire the fact that they are stuck in this film for 9 years to finish it. It shows perseverance and spirit. I hope that next time with this drive they will be able to focus on the best scenario. If you want to see a failed experiment in creating an indie film from a writer / director from Michigan, see Hate for a minute. If you want a good movie from Michigan, write about the director and director Evil Dead.
