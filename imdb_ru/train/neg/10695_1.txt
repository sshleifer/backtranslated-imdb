... Well, I read about this movie somewhere on the Internet, and many have criticized how bad and lame this movie was. And I could not be more agree with that. Then, after that, I saw this movie on DVD, I thought about it twice, and then I released a commercial for this movie on TV. Luckily, I saved my money for this shit. I sacrificed my sleep for the sake of this film, and soon it turned out that this film could not make me satisfy. So I can't judge how the movie was made, but in any case ... it still sucks. As for those who liked this film, I would apologize for igniting this film and telling how this film sucks. I do not know what you think about this movie?
