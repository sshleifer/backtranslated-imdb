A real disappointment from the great visual master Ridley Scott. An American soldier, Jane, tells the story of the first woman who had gone through hellish training in Navy Seals. Training is the most difficult and difficult of the existing ones, as the instructor in the film tells the lead character O'Neill, played by Demi Moore. There is no special message or point in this film, otherwise I could not get to it. This may be a kind of statement of rights and abilities of women, but it all sinks under weary scenes and a silly firefight at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> I really can't understand why Ridley uses so many zooms in the last shooting in the desert mentioned above ?! It looks sooooo silly, annoying and almost amateurish, so I would really like to know what the director saw in this technique. When I look at his latest film, Black Hawk's Dawn, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the battle scenes (there are plenty), and they are very intense and skillfully directed. The whole final in G.I. Jane looks ugly and nothing more than stupid and brainless shooting and killing. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the worst film of Ridley Scott, and there are no significant moments from which this great director is known. Nevertheless, I am glad that I saw it in a widescreen format, because there are a couple of great scenes and examples of Scott's abilities, but there are very few of them in this film. <br /> <br /> Disappointment and nothing compared to the classics (Blade Runner, Thelma and Louise, Alien, etc.) This talented director. Therefore, I have to give GI Jane 4/10.
