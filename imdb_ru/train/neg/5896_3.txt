One missed call, another Asian horror on a mobile phone. I recently shot a Korean horror movie on the Pon mobile phone. One missed call was as boring as that. Maybe the phones are just not scary or something like that, but this step was boring and boring. No tension or thrill for me, and the last monster was disappointingly cheesy and not scary. The film dragged a little apart and felt too long. Did not hold my attention. It seems that the phones are difficult to make frightening, it's like trying to make a creepy vending machine of pop music. And itâ€™s ridiculous to compare it with The Ring, it seems that every Asian horror film is compared to it, and so far I have not seen one that matches this. For horror filmmakers, take the phone off the hook, like a horror device.
