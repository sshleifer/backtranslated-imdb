Especially the slanderous example of Italian cult cinema with a meaningless name for download (at least, the alternative sign of Satan is even less relevant for the plot!) Does only this hybrid of Gothic Horror and Giallo (with a strong dose of erotica) come up with a flat atmosphere in everything ?? actually corresponds to a treatment that is absolutely horrible! Here we get the usual group of people (acting troupe), caught up on the island (to which they were invited by the count since he fell in love with the leading lady, the murderer of the deceased because of the missing spouse)! Characters are largely stereotypes: a middle-aged hero, but a dashing hero (played by Giacomo Rossi-Stewart and whose family history carries more than the proportion of violent tragedy), a modest heroine, a companion whore (remembering Mae West and becoming the most annoying a lot!), a meek but devoted director (forever reproached by everyone for his awkward behavior!), a couple of lesbians, a mysterious gardener (omnipresent Luciano Pigozzi, who, this time, takes action, if you know what I mean) envious housewife (although the nominal star Femi Benussi, although for what it costs, is really an ensemble piece), a religious butler fanatic, impressionable maid, etc. Although the film does not mean any kind of “unnoticeable”, atrocious duplication, snail tempo, trashy production (with scenes depicting a raging sea, shot from some black and white film!) and the fact that the killings take place only in the last half hour does not help the cause. In addition, Marcello Gombini’s assessment, although pleasant in itself, looks out of place in the current circumstances; Nevertheless, the revelation is surprisingly well thought out (given that there is no shortage of suspects).
