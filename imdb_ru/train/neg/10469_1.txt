Yes, I confess that I cried during this movie. It was so incredibly disappointing that I could not contain myself, but I cried. TBN (Trinity Broadcasting Network) did it again. First, with participation in the program "Man for a million" (former professional wrestler), and now it is. <br /> <br /> The Omega Code follows a stream of fragmentary religiously oriented films. It was quite funny, but at the same time it was anxious to find it so inaccurate from a biblical point of view. The film is about what is known as "biblical code", and not about biblical texts. This film is very poorly made; from his letter to his leadership to his terribly awful action. It depresses that people really put effort into this film. It's more like a late night movie that someone would watch on a US channel, or a direct home video, rather than a movie theater. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend you not to watch this film, even if your life depended on it.
