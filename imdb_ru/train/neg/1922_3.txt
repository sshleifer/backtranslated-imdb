About the child: why the older brother did not imagine that he would be hungry because of the bottle, some food or changing diapers? He had to shout without stopping after many hours without care. It is completely foolish to take a child from a safe place when he does not need it. <br /> <br /> And why is the road miraculously cleared when someone wants to go somewhere? Did not uprooted trees fall on the roads and block them? <br /> <br /> I canâ€™t imagine that the police at the checkpoint did not immediately follow any young man who broke him, especially when they said it was dangerous to go there. <br /> <br /> At the same time it was nice to have a film that children could easily watch, for a change.
