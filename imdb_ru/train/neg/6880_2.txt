I was excited to learn that someone had made a documentary about what it means to be a Puerto Rican. When I heard that it was Rosie Perez, I thought ... can she know what it really is to be a Puerto Rican? As far as I knew .... she was a neworic. Well, anyway, I sat anxiously with my popcorn to watch. After 10 minutes, I realized that my initial fear was correct. Rosie Perez knows little about what it means to be a Puerto Rican. This “documentary” is, rather, a personal story about how it feels to be a nuorican ... and everything connected with it. She (like most Nuorians I know) has a vague, partial and sometimes distorted sense of history. (How could they not .. they live here.) Yes, they are all proud. As it should be! But many for the most part do not know the subtleties of a REAL culture, history, political background or language. All this became very obvious with her participation in the release of Vieques. Regardless of my personal opinion on this issue ... at least I know what the hell the fight is for. There she is arrested for what she knew little about ... and participated only because it was a “Puerto Rico affair”. I really do not understand how she is not ashamed to admit it. For those of you who are not Puerto Rican, please consider this as a partial report of a woman’s journey to self-discovery and acceptance. Do not take it as a gospel ... much of it is not even true. Please consider the source. Rosie - actress; not a historian. This film is not and should never be the basis of their information for other Nuoricans. Instead, just a step towards finding additional information, studying and discussing what is the reality. Not only that which comes from the eyes of this woman.
