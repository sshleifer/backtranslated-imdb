amazing how this movie was made. I watched it while I was working at home, wrote emails and answered phone calls - I watched it ONLY because I hoped that the “revenge” part would be good. Needless to say, revenge and violent plot twists were not worth the e-mail during which they were observed. in fact, I'm not even sure what happened at the end anymore. the action was as bad as re-staging in the FBI Files show — of course, the worst re-rulings (in fact, only “arrest and trial” can be just as bad when re-staging). I didn’t even know that the presenter was in the “Blind Third Eye” until I watched the movie here on IMDb, but it’s obvious why he hasn’t shot a single movie since then. I hope he is a good singer.
