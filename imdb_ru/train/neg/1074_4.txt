I never should have started this movie, and stopped watching after 3/4. I missed a really bad ending. This film was a disappointment because it could be much better. There was a nice atmosphere, a first-class cast and director, good places. But the baaaaaad storyline is a bad script. I drew attention to the southern accent of Kenneth Branagh - it was better than the script. The plot was stupid - driven by characters acting in unreal and incredible ways. Nobody behaves like that outside of the Hollywood screenplay.
