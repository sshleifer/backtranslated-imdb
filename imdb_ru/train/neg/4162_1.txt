If you really liked the movie Resident Evil 2002, then you should just watch it, and not spend 2 hours, and you will never return. I can't believe no one commented that this film is just a cheap RE fake. First, the “special” commando powers are the unique protection of an object with a computer matrix that has artificial intelligence and a holographic projection. And this plagiarism “Hive” has a number of traps that inevitably kill one team member at a time. In the code names there is even a chess link, which was in the dialogue RE. Despite the fact that there is no zombie, “Rook”, sworn in the film, is a kind of bio-creature, a very bright color, suggestive of necrotic tissue, with many cyborg components, like the super mutant RE. So, Mr. Richard Taylor says that he is applying for credit in this story. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this is not the film, but the author had an idea to watch Resident Evil, I think
