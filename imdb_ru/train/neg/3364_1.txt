So, it all starts with a beautiful old house in the country. You have a group of people who are asked to come to this house, and (not surprisingly), the caretakers always lock the gate at night for no apparent reason. In any case, people laugh, joke, etc. This doctor tells them a terrible story about this woman and some children. They get scared, they start to feel things. Oh no, the girl sees the ghost. A little more talk, then this huge ghost comes, etc. She does, but oh no, she dies the way she does. And goes to heaven, and this evil ghost goes to hell. Two people survive and leave the house. The script is terrible, because the guy's head is cut off, and Elanor (the one who dies saving children) says “oh no”. The action is wooden, the effects are crap, and the set is a couple of rooms used again and again. Basically, if you like to laugh at badly made films, watch it, but if you are looking to scare, then be sure to miss this movie. I was very disappointed when I saw this. Very big disappointment. My sister (who very easily becomes sacred) became bored in this film, it's terrible.
