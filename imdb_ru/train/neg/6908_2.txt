This series had potential, but I believe that the budget would not allow it to see this potential. An interesting installation, not like the "lost", it collapses after the 1st episode. The whole series, 6 episodes, could make an irresistible 90-minute film, but the creators decided to pull it over and over again. Many scenes were unbearably slow and long without moving forward. The music was very annoying and did not work as a whole. There were several characters we cared about, because their characters did not grow over a certain period of time â€” well, one grew a little. The ending was as terrible as the rest of the series. The only respect here is for the art department and the decorator, they created an interesting image, too bad, the author and the director did not have enough foresight to do something interesting with this element.
