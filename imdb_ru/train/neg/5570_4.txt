let's appreciate it. <br /> <br /> entertainment: a shoddy scenario that illiterate people have typed thousands of times before typewriters ... a pathetic game, which is hampered by history ... OK, the value of production, including a good set / location and a great girl. .-rating 4/10 <br /> <br /> Social message: there is no social message in the film. he is free of thoughts ... but if I pretend that I was 10 and my IQ is 70. I feel that the message is this: don't be afraid to love? rating 0/10 undesirable things: nothing special, just mild Jewish hedonism and an arrogant attitude that the writer / director represents. in general, well, nothing degenerates -8 / 10 <br /> <br /> overall rating 4/10
