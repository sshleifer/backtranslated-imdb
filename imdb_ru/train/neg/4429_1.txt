What a piece of nonsense. <br /> <br /> I won’t even spend time assessing any points of this show. It is not worth the time. The only comment I will make is, why get such a DUMB, inarticulate stupidity, to be a star?!? <br /> <br /> There isn’t much gloomy evidence about the deteriorating mental state of networks than the fact that FOX said it would NOT return John Dow (a decent show), but would return the dead with brains like Joe Millionaire for another round of killing the brain cells of the American public. <br /> <br /> FOX lost it, IMHO.
