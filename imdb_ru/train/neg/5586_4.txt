The Man-Man tries his best to be a good film: his heart is in the right place, it tends to be epic, and he has a message that everyone will surely appreciate. But there are some problems with this picture. He tries so hard to be good and bring his thought that sometimes the viewer must feel impartial. Thus, it is quite enough that the images used in this picture are simplified - a person-person does not allow the viewer to decide what he considers correct, but drives his message into his head. Joseph Fiennes illustrates this with his role: he tries to look worried, genuinely touched and all the other emotions that you can express with the help of a single facial expression that his repertoire can offer. Add that the film is too long and loses speed towards the end, and you can easily come to the conclusion that watching the film “Man-Man” is not worth it. But there are enough moments to protect it: it’s interesting, it has some humorous scenes and the theft of Kristin Scott Thomas’s show. Of course, you should not compare it with humanistic masterpieces such as The Elephant Man (David Lynch), but you will leave the theater satisfied. It tries to capture your heart (even if your brain thinks it is too obvious) and in most cases succeeds.
