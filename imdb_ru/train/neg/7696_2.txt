Yes, nonsense! I just finished looking, and I still have a bad taste in my mouth. Too many colors, too many unnecessary add-ons to the story, too many stupid characters (I guess they wanted comic relief, but I just wanted to cry) ... too much. It is a shame to spoil one of these divine stories from the "Arab nights". Childishly, naively (both in a bad way), and with a lot of magical mistakes, I do not think that this can keep a five-year-old child for more than ten minutes. The princess is beautiful, but should be without a language, because the actress does not know how to play the role. The rest of the cast is even worse ... our "bad guy" is REALLY bad. Shame that the "good guy" is no better. The only light in this darkness is, of course, David Carradine, who, unfortunately, goes deep below his level, but at least he keeps his acting / fighting skills on top. I'm still sorry to see him in such things, but I'm glad I had something to see as a whole, so thanks, David. Only, ONLY for him, I give these 2 stars to this fiasco ... I would give more for him, but that would enhance the final score for the entire film. The rest is so bad that I might like to rate it, but there is no amateur here, whereas 1, and I think it will be too much.
