To be honest, at the time when I first heard about this show, although it might be a bad idea to make a show that makes Muslims use racial jokes against themselves, but this is the exact opposite. I realized that a show that can help people understand that if a Muslim uses such a word in real life, it does not mean that he is a terrorist. It also shows how people give Muslims notoriety because they play according to their stereotype. Watching the show, ordinary people will realize that even though Muslims can be bad, it does not mean that we are all bad, we just try to live 1 day to day, for example, how difficult it is for Amair to get on a plane and how he used words like “Explosion” or Yazer, saying that we would break the competition and people mistakenly accepted it. Being a Muslim, I know that such things usually do not happen, but they do, and many people think badly about Muslims, Afghanistan or Iraq, it is not. people will see how they mistreat us when they see this show, and this can make them think about how to act. I am glad that such a show has appeared on the air. There is a lot of evidence that Peter Moslems as terrorists, many people find them ridiculous for my opinion, it’s normal to do it from time to time, because a lot of things are ridiculed at who we are to say that you cannot make fun of it unfair but it is done often and does give people muslin a bad reputation.
