This film is included in the history of FBI, as Nott's Berry Farm - to the old west. Shamelessly sanitized version of the Federal Bureau of Investigation against Crime. Hoover's heavy hand (did he have any other look?) Shown everywhere with actors who read scripts, cheese sets, cheap sound effects and lighting. It lists all the lists, known in the mid-50s, with hints of irony or humor, from the “jungle of the Amazon” to the “barbecue in the backyard”, everything smells of sound scenes and back parts. Even the shots are canned and familiar. I suppose Mervyn Leroy got drunk every night. Except for a few (very few) interesting external frames, there is nothing interesting here, except for curiosity.
