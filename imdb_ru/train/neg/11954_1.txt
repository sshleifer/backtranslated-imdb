This movie was terrible. Throughout the film, I was puzzled and did not see any sense in it. I had to go to this site and read the review to finally understand what it was about. This film is generally not worth watching. Not only is it painful and disgusting, but completely stupid! Please do not watch if you are not one of those who like to watch bad movies. If this film calls into question Japanese society and its values ​​and roles, then this is a country that I would not like to visit or disturb. This is a completely sick movie !!!!!!!! I did not like it, because it did not make sense. My boyfriend and I sat there waiting to see if it was terrible, because this is what was on the list. It was a complete disappointment.
