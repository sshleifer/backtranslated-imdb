I think the show had a pretty good concept for the job. But the penalty was bad. The script is bad, and the acting is bad. There were many questions that could be depicted better, for example, protesting against same-sex marriages or searching for a cemetery. A show cannot be properly called a comedy show, as it lacks humor. I have to say that this show was barely successful in order to somehow change the life of the Muslim community. <br /> <br /> So far, the second season is worse than the first. I really hoped for this show, but I was disappointed. Nevertheless, I appreciate CBC for putting forward such a concept in front of the audience. In any case, I wish good luck in the future.
