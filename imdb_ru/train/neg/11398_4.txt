I saw this film primarily to see Brooke Burke (as Jill), whom I briefly met in Los Angeles at a model exhibition in her first feature film. I was hoping to see her more, but I thought that she did an excellent job with her role. Since she is such a beautiful and balanced TV host and model, this is not surprising. I was wondering why she was killed and what happened as a result. Maybe I just missed it. <br /> <br /> I was not sure about the genre of this film, and although I liked the actors, I felt that this was for a college audience. I tried to be non-judgmental, considering that horror was not my favorite genre, but I felt that I had outgrown the joke. In some places it seemed to be dragging on, forcing you to guess what strength the evil professor had, and, like in many other films, ended unsatisfactorily. <br /> <br /> Having written a couple of scenarios I know that in many cases it is difficult and can be reduced to personal opinion, how many films you have seen and studied, as well as those with which you are currently associated. <br /> <br /> In short, I thought it was an interesting, but not satisfactory plot and ending for me. If Jill (Brooke Burke) returned through the portal at the end and kicked ass, it would be a satisfactory ending and would bring a higher rating.
