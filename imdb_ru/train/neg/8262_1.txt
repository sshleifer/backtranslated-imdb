This is really terrible: painfully annoying stylized performers squeal and rob completely disconnected dialogues that occur in scenes that seem to have no purpose, have no beginning, no middle, no end, are cut off without any obvious narration or even cognitive intentions, everything in the ministry is some kind of completely uninteresting and almost undetectable "story." Worst of all, the film claims to be “style”: a crane with a remote head suddenly spiraled downwards and a sudden whip or wobbly sections appear: this whole “style” simply increases the project’s almost incredibly huge delusion and almost offensive emptiness of the material. Definitely a candidate for the worst movie ever made.
