I sat down to watch a documentary about Puerto Rico and eventually watched one movie about Nuoricans. When I go to Puerto Rico, I donâ€™t see 50% who live in poverty. When I see fighting people, they are usually Haitians, Dominicans or Cubans who have recently arrived on the island. There is no such thing as spanglish ... or you speak Spanish or not ... and from what I heard ... no. Pedro Albizo Campos is NOT MLC for me. MLK was a great man. Campos is a great man for those who want independence, which is 1%. Otherwise, he is the same locomotive as Osama bin Laden. Puerto Ricans who want independence are a bunch of fools. If you need any evidence for all of you, the dreamers of independent Puerto Rico, see Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas, the whole of South and Central America and Mexico. It worked wonders for them. This documentary is not about Puerto Rico, this documentary was about Nuyoricans and their fight. <br /> <br /> To a man who complains that there was not enough Africa on the show ... he should have been about Puerto Rico ... not Africa. Denzel will soon do it just for you. <br /> <br /> In conclusion ... all those ignorant white people who believe that we need green cards to come to the United States and want to find out how the Prime Minister works. This is not a good documentary about Puerto Rican culture. Ask the children to pay attention to the lessons of geography and history. <br /> <br /> *** Update *** <br /> <br /> Bocabonita ... "doc." It was about Nuoricans. She advertised it as if it were what we all feel. It was supposed to be called ... "Hey, soy, neworian ... lunch ... I don't speak Spanish." PLEASE STOP USING PUERTO RICO, RICANA, BORIQUE OR ANYTHING, SOMETHING RELATED TO PR ON THIS NEWURIAN LESSON HERO God forbid they play it on the island.
