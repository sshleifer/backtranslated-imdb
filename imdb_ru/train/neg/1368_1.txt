One is the highest rating I could give to this film, given that zero and negative numbers are not allowed. Pete, meaningless mess in a movie with a lot of wasted bi-list actors who did a better job, written and directed by some guy with a twelve-year-old mentality who grins and giggles from a stupid pun, and jokes and jokes, for example , Jean Stapleton's character (Ding-Bat from the film “All in the Family”), telling the character Marilou Henner that she “sways in both directions” sexually, was a cheap attempt at humor, indicating the general limp of the film ... You want a good, sassy humor? Rent Animal House, American Pie (only part one), Old School or Office.
