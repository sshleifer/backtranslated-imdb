Everything in this movie is pork wash. Pathetic acting game, terrible dialogue, ugly native girls. this film plunges into oblivion !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The director must have been a tiring weekend. Robert S. is completely lost and has no idea what is going on. College kids are the worst. No acting talent at all, very silly reasoning and just regular dumbbells. Special effects for birds. The so-called security forces around this park belong to a toy country: with dull-looking pistols, walkie-talkies that are useless; and a computer system with a roll of toilet paper. if the park is built and nothing works; why attract potential customers until everything is complete. authors must be the first victims of the disorder along with the producers and the team. The entire film in a septic tank is shot on another planet for viewing. What a pearl. Convicts should watch out for them so that they can commit suicide.
