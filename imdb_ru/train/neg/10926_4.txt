Although the idea is more original than in most science fiction films, its performance, as usual, is missing. While the practical effects of the mummy are not bad, and the character “Gun Nut” plays the main role, the only real draw is to see the reunion of Morena Baccarin and Adam Baldwin on a small screen. I suspect it was an idea all the time. They do everything they can, using what they have, but the “must see” moments were for me in the first 40 minutes or so, when Morena's character wore several shorts in the style of Tomb Raider. The cinema is not high, I know, but you cannot deny the true beauty when you see it !!! And Adam Baldwin again considers this the guy you love to hate. If you just want to see how a couple of your favorite Firefly characters are having fun with some sub-armature material, then this may be for you. If you want a good acting and character development, we suggest you look elsewhere.
