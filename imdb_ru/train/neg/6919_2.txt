My roommates and I almost turned off our TV from the many spits that we did while watching this funny piece of the self-styled pseudo-dock of the 1970s. I read about this camp festival for ages and scanned my local nightly TV shows for years in search of this elusive poop. A few years ago, our local branch of ABC was known for showing great films for its late night film (for example, Frog, Night of Lepus, etc.). Then one day it happened: at 1:40 Saturday night (more than 5 years ago) it was! We had more than 15 people, and the film did not disappoint! <br /> <br /> See! Andy Griffith is the stupidest and most harmless bad guy since Jay Davidson in Stargate! <br /> <br /> See! William Shatner has a lot of things on his head that only slightly resemble human hair (or something organic in this regard). <br /> <br /> Listen! the jawbone of the insane psychoanalysis of the 1970s, because of which "Chicken Soup for the Soul" sounds like a BF Skinner <br /> <br /> Feel! Content that any decade was better than the 70s. <br /> <br /> For those who are still reading ... The plot is surrounded by a bunch of middle classes who decide to suck their ... main boss (Griffith), joining him in a cross-dessert that covers California and Mexico . They all wear leather jackets, looking more Christopher Street than anything else. Along the way, they stop at Cantina, get drunk, smoke their joints (a sight that Robert "Mike Brady" Reed smokes at the joint - an image that you won't soon forget), start a fight, try to rape and just act like a bunch of middle-class suburban jacks. Despite the fact that I have a great copy that I recorded on TV, I WANT this copy to be released on video so that the whole world can enjoy its semi-dry dullness.
