The only film I've ever done. It's amazing, since I paid for myself and my date, and I'm really cheap. But my brain could no longer take out a bunch of garbage, especially because I could have written more funny stuff when I was tying and gagging. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning to the end, this film offends. Worse, it's not funny. Then it was not funny, and now it is not funny. But even worse, this film represents the beginning of the end of a truly smart, complex comedy. This is a juvenile, truly sophisticated scenario and ideas that marked the beginning of an era (which continues to this day), when cheap laughter and sexual insinuations dominate the culture of comedy in movies. <br /> <br /> Sexual Olympiad? What schoolboy did not think about it? Beginning of the End.
