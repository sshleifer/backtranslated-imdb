Joe Don Baker is ... Thomas Jefferson Geronimo, a plump, sweaty, deadly moron in a stupid cowboy costume that Roy Rogers would have laughed at. Somehow he still has a badge, probably because he lives in Texas and they will allow ANYTHING to be law enforcement there. <br /> <br /> This fat loser is a deputy sheriff near the border with Texas. It is not surprising that he was once a Texas Ranger, but he was kicked out, because he seemed to think that the law was his personal bouncing ball, with which you can play at your discretion. This includes the shooting of suspects who are over the international border in Mexico, beating of suspects, fraud in gunfights, threats to women, the beginning of gunfights that could have been avoided, and the ability to threaten a child’s life in the process, allowing women to promise and protect to get killed just so that he can get out of prison, etc., etc. This guy makes the Los Angeles policemen look like saints. <br /> <br /> When his partner kills a pair of itinerant Italian killers, the character Joe Don hunts them and kills one of them. He then takes another to Italy at the direction of Mr. Wilson, who rightly thinks that Joe Don is screwed up badly. In record time, he loses the Italian and in the process blows up a Maltese taxi driver. This is only the first of many deaths and major destruction that Joe Don leaves behind the trail when he rages all over Malta in search of Palermo (the Italian assassin). <br /> <br /> This is the beginning of the Mobius strip. the film in which our hero is arrested, lectures the Maltese police chief, comes out and causes more problems, he is arrested, the lecture by the police chief ... and so on and so forth. Until you want to blow your brain with a pistol with Joe Don's ivory grip and end horror. <br /> <br /> Joe Don proves his uselessness not only for the first time when Palermo escapes, but also in the subsequent pursuit of the boat in which he falls only with one blow. Then Palermo takes him after he threatens the woman with a coat hanger. You hope that Palermo will really torture him in the basement chamber into which he was placed, but no - the stripper whom he threatened came and pulled him out because he promised to protect her. Her throat is quickly cut (big surprise), and Joe Don runs away into the night. <br /> <br /> And here you are hoping that he could drown in (another) pursuit of a boat. But even the ocean does not want him and spits him onto the shore, where a poor Maltese family feeds him (what did they ever do to deserve it?), He returns to the city, where he is arrested by the police, lectures from the police chief ... arrrgghhh! The policewoman who accompanies him frees him so they can take Palermo. Why she would do something mind-blowing to ruin her career for the sake of this great spittle, I don't know. This is just puzzled. <br /> <br /> They go out to the villa where Palermo is hiding, and begin a shootout. Joe Don blithely deceives and kills Palermo. Then he says the magnificent and dazzling last line of the film: “The big one has my badge. Can you go and get it for me? ”Thank you for this immortal line, Mr. Baker. This will go down in the annals of film history as the most literate, amazing, amazing last line ever uttered by a movie character. It certainly fits all the other characters. Bravo.
