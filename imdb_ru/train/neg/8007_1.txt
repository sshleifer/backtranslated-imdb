I really, really did not expect such a film outside of America. How someone can take the subject of child sexual abuse and turn it into a “thriller” just hurts. Auteuil (which I used to admire) walked around like some kind of child saving Rambo, was ignorant and insulting all children who are sexually exploited all over the world. <br /> <br /> What is doubly depressing is the fact that the overwhelming and mundane film “Happiness” came out a year before this film. Menges and his associates should be ashamed of themselves. It's great to read some comments from more intelligent viewers out there. They were able to see the stupid and ridiculous handling of this topic. Those of you who think that this is a great cinema show a disgusting amount of ignorance, and you need to watch “Happiness” to open your mind to the real horrors of pedophilia. <br /> <br /> Do you think your child is more likely? to be abducted and sold into sexual slavery or to be molested by a neighbor, teacher, friend or even relative? HM interesting. If they are going to make a film about international child slavery of any kind, they all have to make it realistic and emotionally fascinating, and not this crap pushing buttons. 1/10
