“Steve” (Chris Hoffman) gathers a group from the high school to reunite in the cabin, where his twin brother Wes was missing. While they are there, a reptile creature in the shape of a man (which reminded me a lot of Gilman from Creation from the Black Lagoon) waits in the desert, choosing the right time to separate them one by one. Biker, Ellen Ripley's bad ass time, Kat (Chase Masterson) has an underground military bunker in which she practices experiments, while he also serves as a place of safety from things on bloody rage. Kat knows more than she says (she also lost the child), but there is another novelty that most of the group are not even aware of. This creature may just be more humane than they think ... and its former identity can shed light on the deception that was hidden only by one other person after Wes died. Kat holds the key to the many secrets that open up when the group stays near the cabin. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, most of the film stays away from the creature that jumps in the air, while we also see a foggy screen when we see it with our eyes. The film has the melodramatic Dawson Creek, which often interferes with any real tension that is needed to create a small monster. The direction is very soft, which leads to a relatively boring experience instead of causing panic. The cast is rather lifeless and uninteresting. Pretty Maggie Grace (THE FOG remake) may be the only print run for this movie.
