If someone wants to make a really, REALLY bad film, “Wizards of the Lost Kingdom” really sets the criteria for measuring the depth of evil. <br /> <br /> Start with the pseudo-Chewbacca that follows the main character ... Some poor fellow in a baggy white fluffy suit that looks like it was made from discarded pieces of carpet. Work slowly, painfully, using not so special effects that completely prevent the viewer from suspending disbelief. Add a garden gnome (just for the sake of it). <br /> <br /> Having thought this over, skip this movie completely and find something else that can be done within an hour and a half.
