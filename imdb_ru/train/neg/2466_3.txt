The last few years in the fashion have been films about zombies, which are often ironic, as well as other media incarnations of the resurrection dead, feeding on the flesh. “Fido” is a film that either tries to make money on it, is simply a manifestation of it, or both, and it falls directly into the category of ironic zombies. The joke here is that we can see the walking dead in a contrasting context of a broadly stereotypical, insanely clean, alternative history (we are after a great war with zombies, and creatures are now domesticated as slaves) of a 1950s suburb. <br /> <br /> A funny concept in itself, quite enough for a five-minute comedy sketch, but she cannot make a feature film on her own. The joke that rotting corpses for servants are incompatible with this idealized version of a small town repeats itself again and again and loses all its effectiveness. The soundtrack does not stop playing sunny melodies, while zombies kill passersby. The word "zombie" is constantly inserted into the familiar home line for others to make a cheap attempt to laugh. <br /> <br /> The very breadth and artificiality of the representation of the “nineteen fifties” here cannot but annoy me. He is so stylized, obviously, in the spirit of "Pleasantville", that he is more obvious in waving his mark around his 1950s with markers than actually having any similarity with something that could happen between 1950 and 1959. about this, as if the film boasts empty and thoughtlessly about how the more open, mundane, and superior 2000s. <br /> <br /> Since characters are such broad representations of the “types” of pop culture of the 1950s, it is difficult to develop emotional investments in them. Everyone has a few traits that he is left with - Helen is obsessed with looks, and Bill likes golf and is haunted by the need to kill his father - but they remain rather two-dimensional. Performances within the limits of this bad letter are good. The best is Billy Connolly in the role of Fido, a zombie who, according to the tradition of Boris Karloff in Frankenstein, actually conveys character and sympathy to an awkward green monster who cannot speak. <br /> <br /> There are small pieces of an unconvincing allegory: commodity fetishism, racism, classicism, military paranoia, and so on, but in fact none of this works at a comprehensive level, and the filmmakers do not; really stick to something. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film doesn’t really withstand the flimsy “Look! Zombies in “Leave this to Beaver! "" Within one and a half hours.
