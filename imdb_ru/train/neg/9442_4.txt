I tried to love this slasher, as if I was trying to enjoy all the slasher films. I mean senseless killing, mixed with a little nudity and some waiting, how can you go wrong. But Unheded, I think, is an example of a wrong formula. The main problem is the terrible game of the three main girls who landed in the house. It was as if they were under a sedative effect, and this prevented me from ever being interested in their plight. The film is focused on tension and eeriness, but by quantitative indicators it deprives him of his strength and makes the film quite boring. It's a shame, because if the film were better executed, it would be an ace. The story and characters are pretty creepy, and in the old house there are some dark and strangely humorous moments of interaction between the mother, girls and daughter. There is some good nudity and sometimes bloody bloodshed, but this is not enough to give the film the very impetus it needs. The final is rather tangled and awe-inspiring, and the film is really a big boost, but unfortunately too late. So, in my opinion, this should be avoided, unless you really dislike little-known slashers. Potential is enough, but the film delivers too little to be worth it.
