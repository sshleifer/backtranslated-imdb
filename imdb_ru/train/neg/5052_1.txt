Platoon for the Vietnam War, and Rocky IV for the heavyweight boxing championship. The story of Oliver Stone about the experience of a platoon of the US Army in Vietnam in 1968 is so exaggerated that it is ridiculous. Although most or all of the platoon events took place over a period of more than 10 years of US military engagement in Vietnam, the depiction of these events with one small group of men in such a short time (week) gives a horribly distorted picture of the war. In the platoon, the platoon people see all of the following within a week or two: American soldiers kill civilians, American soldiers rape civilians, an American sergeant kills another US sergeant, a private US kills an American sergeant US, US soldiers killed / wounded by friendly fire, 90% + killed or injured in platoon. For Stone, trying to give this film the typical experience of an American soldier in Vietnam is a shame. Two films about the Vietnam War, which I would recommend: “We were soldiers” (the TRUE story of perhaps the worst battle for American soldiers in Vietnam) and HBO’s Bright Radiant Lying.
