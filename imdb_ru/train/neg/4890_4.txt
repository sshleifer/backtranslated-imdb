The film about Vixen (Erica Gavin), who has a husband, Mount, whom she loves ... but she also loves sex! During the film, she forces several men in bed - including her husband and brother! There is also a (tame) lesbian sequence. <br /> <br /> This film put Russ Meyer on the map and was (I believe) the first critically acclaimed film to receive an X rating. It was a big hit when it came out. Unfortunately, this is not well met. <br /> <br /> This is well oriented, and Erica Gavin is just gorgeous (whatever happens to her), and she was VERY colorful ... but by today's standards she is very tame, I'm surprised that he now has a rating NC-17 - there is no hard sex, and in it only topless and in general there are no male naked bodies. In addition, it is (unfortunately) rather boring, and adding policies at the end is confusing (and rather silly). However, it is worth seeing that in 1968 it was considered very shocking. Supposedly, I saw a shortened version (which has an R rating), but I only heard a few seconds, and there are not enough of them here. <br /> <br /> Meierâ€™s next film, Outside the Valley of the Dolls, is much better and dates back VERY well. Catch it instead.
