If you want to laugh like crazy, rent a cage. Cage about the two war heroes, Billy and Scott, who are best friends. When Billy is shot in Vietnam, he can't stand up for himself, so Scott takes it. <br /> <br /> I have never seen a movie in which there would be more funny references to the two main characters. Billy and Scott love to "fight," and Scott tells Billy that he "still hurts from last night," by the way. <br /> <br /> Wonderful phrases like "Shut up!" And "Ping" Pang Pong, cut the crap! "Make you laugh for hours." The American guys who should play Mexican gang members are also top notch. As the saying goes, now is â€œparty time. Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba. I could go on forever, but just watch this movie and laugh for your money. It was so funny that I went out and bought a DVD for $ 5.99.
