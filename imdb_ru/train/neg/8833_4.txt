Without the guilt of the actors (they all put on great performances), the overall story was not very well executed. The film begins with a great zinger: a crazy old man drives a young aboriginal girl's car out of the way. But then we have to endure 40 minutes of character development with a completely new group of characters ... and we donâ€™t know why until these 40 minutes are over. It turns out that they ultimately discover the girl's body ... and the story evolves from there. <br /> <br /> Although the story really begins to evolve, it really leads to nothing. After 2 hours, I asked myself: was this the point, or was it just for the characters to fight the accusations of racism and stupidity of how they coped with the discovery? The story was ultimately unsatisfactory and felt unfinished. Although it is well-played, there is no strong enough base in the film to justify his recommendation.
