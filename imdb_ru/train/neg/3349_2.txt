I have yet to read the novel by Shirley Jackson, some of what I was going to do for a long time. I’m sure it must be worse than this movie. I remember jumping once, when I watched it the other day, although I can't remember the scene. <br /> <br /> The special effects are great, I watched it on DVD, but I’m sure it was a great show at the theater. After the first few special effects were completed, I waited for the development of the story. <br /> <br /> I thought that this film should at least be based on a classic novel, so a good story should be there, but it’s not. I had to look at the gorgeous heroine Catherine Zeta-Jones throughout the film, because there was nothing else to watch. Lily Talor was such a lame character. I did not like it a bit, something about the whiny people. Also, the guy in this film reminded me of cartoon Dudley DoRight with his voice and face. I could not relate to the characters at all. Quigon, hmm, Liam Neeson did a wonderful job trying to cope with this film with the help of some acting skills. <br /> <br /> Half or three-quarters of the way I just wanted to die to go to camp on Friday the 13th or Screaming Royal Film! At least there is some type of entertainment value. If there is no story, at least they fill it with bloody deaths or attractive women. It has nothing. <br /> <br />
