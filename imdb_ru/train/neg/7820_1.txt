or: is it a bird? This is a plane? No, look ... It's a disaster! or: no need to look at the sky. <br /> <br /> or: (... well, that's enough.) If the singer tried to make a romantic titanic film to thwart the box office, he failed, the SR Structure cannot do this, the dark and limited color scheme ( I would call it “wishi-washi”), boring ordinary dialogues, a clown with advanced alien technology, lacking fun and magic, etc. They make the film completely frustrating. <br /> <br /> This just does not work. <br /> <br /> The main thing in such a character as a superman is that he is a superhero. This is the essence, the most important thing. <br /> <br /> Love troubles and a sadly depressed depressive superpower can only be the edge in a 2:40 Superman movie, not all the time. <br /> Because then this is no longer a movie about a superman or a superhero. This is similar to (and in this case, very bad and boring) social research, where every 30 minutes a person flies around. <br /> <br /> This is a big difference. <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke. Holy Skywalker, this is Superman, so give us Supervillains, Superaxia and most importantly, Superfan. <br /> <br /> We want ENTERTAINMENT! Singer, if you want to remove the emotional drama about the soul at 2:40 about the lost and sad people? Then take the normal human characters and make a juvenile remake. <br /> <br /> They say: Superman is back. And then at the door stands supersadlisoft. <br /> <br /> The singer may have tried to kill a legend without kryptonite, but one bad movie cannot do this. Do not give up, they are planning to continue ... <br /> <br /> Next time, the singer (and Warner Brothers) will create a film about superheroes, and not about the depressive super-lamine soap, or so be it. A movie about a superhero means a colorful fantasy with lots of fun and magic. <br /> <br /> This movie looks like a very cheap box of chocolate with a super cover. Yes, technically there are all kinds, yes, there are many small conversations, there are a few jokes, action scenes, etc. But the only thing that unites all these worst parts is their poor quality. br /> <br /> This is nothing more than a super dull patchwork and one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> A funny strategy of actors (Remove them as young as possible can make a continuation in the next 25 years) will give the rest. Kate Bosworth plays a 22-year-old star reporter, she looks like 19. Superman was full five years ago, so he slept with her 6 years ago, so she was 16 years old (looks like 13) and the planet’s daily reporter who wrote “I spend a night with a superman. "Warner Brothers, this is too much. <br /> <br /> Ruth is not so bad, he plays a little wooden, but the whole movie is wooden, so ...?! Temporary good were Marsden, and sometimes poses. The rest, forget about it. Even at a distance, it is not his locality. <br /> <br /> Reeve / Hackman / Kidder acted so easily What is the difference. <br /> <br /> Jesus' poses in the end are also funny. What the hell should that be? The problem here is that they mean it seriously, not a joke. Next time Spider or Batman or does the Iron Man fall and rise like Jesus or the angels? Or they speak directly to God. Why not? They are superheroes who save human lives every day. So, at least one conversation with God every week should be possible. .. Oh my God. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this was not a completely announced film, but rather from a strange, boring parallel universe. <br /> <br /> For the Warner Brothers, this super-flame depressive film will probably be the greatest disaster in history. Not just for the money. <br /> <br /> I understand how difficult (maybe) it was to create and convey some messages or feelings, but showing lonely, lost and, unfortunately, people is not news, but thousands of films or TV shows did it better, in very old or new ones such as magnolia. And the flying frogs were more impressive than this flying super-woman, sorry, of course, superman. <br /> <br /> The singer and the WB is just nothing. In fact, it's even more than nothing, it's like a black hole that destroys the passion for films (comics / superhero) and takes away from us three hours of our life. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Smilla's younger brother (Very angry and green as the Hulk.)
