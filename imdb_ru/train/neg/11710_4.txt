There is only one reason to watch this movie if you are not affiliated with any of the stars or the producer: actress Nicole Hiltz. She is a show in this slow and wildly unlikely story of revenge. Directed by Simon Gornik, Joyce Heiser starred in the film as a devoted wife who decides to take revenge on her deceptive spouse. Yes, but not by ordinary means. She plans a full guerrilla war and recruits bad girl Nicole Hiltz as her favorite weapon. She wants Nicole (like Tuesday) to approach her ex (handsome but boring Stefan Jenkins, who has to stick to the music) to embarrass him and ruin his life. David DeLuis is good in his few short moments, and Anthony Dennison, the former star of "Crime Story", has almost nothing to do except a frown. On the other hand, at various times, Hilz looks sexy and playful, and then viciously and cunningly. She also treats the vulnerable and the "slightly psychotic." In addition, she is quite hot (although there are no ostentatious jokes), so you can understand how she can get to any guy she targets. But in this film, the performance is wasted, but it cannot be called sharp enough or interesting enough to recommend it.
