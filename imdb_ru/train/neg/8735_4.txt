This film has let me down. It was like Jaws, when Hopper ordered the mayor to close the parks, it was like Roy Schieder told the mayor to close the beaches. They both did not say it was summer! But the box says that Hopper must penetrate the head of the killer and think like one. But he really does not do anything interesting or exciting. I'm not even sure that he and his partner have experience in the police when they are in the office, wondering how they will solve this matter. They simply say that we will do the work of the police, and we will solve it. And how are things with all the old men with pool signals. I did not even begin to believe that they were mafia bosses. And then the guy who doubted the guy the crowd chose to find the killer. With his haircut of one hundred dollars and the fact that he thinks that his Di @ k is the size of a school bus. Come on, what rude lines. I thought he would hit him with a baseball bat, as in other films. I used this movie and would not buy it new. I suggest you skip this movie. Oh, and it was fun to see the microphone above the stage, where Hopper comes out for coffee.
