I saw in the capsular comments “a great game.” In my opinion, these are two great actors who give terrible performances, and with zero chemistry with each other, for a great director at his worst effort in all time. Robert De Niro must be the most inventive and insightful illiterate of all time. The performance of Jane Fonda is awkwardly drifting all over the map, since she obviously has nothing to do with this character, mainly because the character is written so badly. Such molasses would be too fast an adjective for the painful pace of this film. Although the goal of the film is an inspirational story of curing illiteracy, watching it is a real bummer. I give it 1 out of 10, really one of the worst 20 films for its budget level I've ever seen.
