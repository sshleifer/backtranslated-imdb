Some here have noted that this is the worst Elvis film ever made. Well, they are only partly right. For me, this is the worst movie ever! I have never seen anything so rude, offensive and vile against human nature, like this film. This embarrassment for the film industry, it’s not even that bad, it’s good. There is no such stupid fun, as in some other bad Elvis films, such as "Kembake". This one is so rotten to relive its pain. Clean trash. Native Americans should sue for their poor cliché and stereotypical attitudes here. In fact, perhaps ALL people should sue the crime and the disservice this film does to the whole species. Rating: F
