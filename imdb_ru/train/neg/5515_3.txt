A lot of good things can be said for this cartoon; the background is rich, lush, full of nice details in the art deco style. The animation conforms to the usual studio standards of the time, which are certainly higher than modern ones. However, I find it tedious for a number of reasons. <br /> <br /> Music: This is definitely not up to the usual Scott Bradley standards. Although he probably should be reminded of the “Great Gatsby” setting, he eventually becomes dreary, sleepy, boring and monotonous (repetitive and monotonous do not match, as evidenced by Beethoven’s 5th Symphony). Since most people (including me) tend to close their eyes when they yawn, a lot of the visual part of the cartoon will be missed by the average viewer. <br /> <br /> Storyline: I do not reveal secrets that are not yet in the plot - the country is good, the city is bad. This is a common theme in films, both animated and live, from this era. This is an inappropriate nostalgia for a non-existent rural idyll, which in our days is reflected in a similar nostalgia for “values” that have never existed.
