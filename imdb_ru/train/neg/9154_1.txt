. WORST. FILM. EVER. MADE. <br /> <br /> After watching this supposedly made for gay film, I suspect that someone gathered a half-blind neo-Nazi with a damaged brain and made him make the worst gay movie ever, all in some kind of deceptive attempt to attack gay -culture, I had to stop the movie and call a friend to come to me, so that I could have someone to laugh at when I stopped the movie due to shock, disbelief and indignation because of such nonsense. <br /> <br /> To top it off, a horrible script and acting game, an illogical and stupid plot, just a poorly made movie. A dog with a hand-held camera tied to the tail could plow better. <br /> <br /> Seriously, after reading a few positive reviews about the film, I suspect that the author should have half a dozen IMDb accounts. Anyone who says that this film can be viewed as something other than a joke, a liar or he is paid for it.
