The first couple of seasons I thought “The Apprentice” was a very exciting and exciting show. The combination of reality TV and a 16-week job interview was innovative, and the series’s producers were able to keep up-to-date and not too much of the show. <br /> <br /> New season 6 is nothing more than a big joke, and this has nothing to do with business - in general. In earlier seasons, they used to pay much more attention to business-related tasks - now the focus is on the meeting room, where participants have to do EVERYTHING to keep them on the show (this means lies, hooliganism, backstabs, etc. ). The meeting room may be interesting to watch, but this is entertainment at its lowest point — sometimes you wonder if you are watching the repetition of the old Jerry Springer episode. The tasks on the show, for the most part, are boring and mostly show companies that are stupid enough to pay NBC for advertising. And what's the deal with half the participants living in tents in season 6? It's just silly and has nothing to do with business in real life. <br /> <br /> This season I absolutely DO NOT respect any of the participants, they all seem like idiots to me. In earlier seasons, at least some of the participants had some honesty, now it seems that the participants would kill their own mother to keep them on the show. It also seems that Donald Trump's huge ego is getting more and more with each passing season, and, frankly, I don’t understand why someone with common sense would want to work for him. His rationality in the meeting room basically doesn’t make any sense at all, and sometimes it seems that he just likes to kill people because they are worth it. <br /> <br /> R.I.P The Apprentice. Please, for God's sake, remove the show from the air as soon as possible. Just a shame to watch. The apprentice was once a great TV show, but now it's just a big fat joke.
