I do not recommend this film because it is inaccurate and misleading, this story was supposed to be in the Algerian Berber territory, this one was filmed in the southern Tunisian desert (completely different culture, I know that I am from Tunisia and Algeria), Another shocking the character was her companion aunt's character, she speaks in a film with a very articulate French, academic French at the university level, while the character she plays had to be agitated, never leave her character’s mountain look, poet live like Bedouins with education in this context is impossible. The most shameful scene and disrespectful, especially for the inhabitants of the region, is the “femme repudiee” segment, which is a pure fiction of a writer / director, such things will never happen to Algerian society ever !!!
