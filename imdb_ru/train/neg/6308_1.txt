Full evaluation of the content of this film, since I am British, I did not know that during the Second World War there was segregation in the US Navy. Very bold attempt to bring this fact to the world. Nevertheless, the film is pitiful, there is no directing, the acting is wooden, and the script is just one cliche after another. I can honestly say that this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I sat and cringed from the very beginning to the very end because of the very bad way it was put together. It could be a great movie, the story for many of us outside the United States was new, unique and interesting. The sad fact is how it was connected. Unfortunately, such a true story, which could change people's attitudes, was spent on a low-budget, ill-directed film. I only hope that sometime in the future one of the major studios will take this topic and make it fair.
