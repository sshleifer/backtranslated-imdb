This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Let me repeat: this is the only worst film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There were all the signs of a bad movie: continuity mistakes, bad recording, bad play, bad performance, bad music. I thought there were a couple of moments in horror movies. First, he must be tense enough to scare you. This movie gets and f in this category. The second point is that when a character dies or something bad happens to him, we have to take care. This film got an F in that regard. <br /> <br /> The first story is that a woman is injured by wolves, for fear that it will happen to her. The following story, a guy from OCD dies due to negligence and talks with his dead friend. Oh, and then there is the horrible, nail-biting story of a bad roommate. C'mon, could you choose topics that would be a little more interesting and a little less common than loneliness in the house, preserving anal behavior and having a roommate? It turns out that all these stories, where hallucinations, virtual reality are induced by a doctor, who in turn uses it himself. Wow, stupid. <br /> <br /> Let me explain something, I like watching bad horror films and laughing at how bad they are. I could not do it with this. It was very painful to sit and watch. Do not watch this film under any circumstances. You will regret it.
