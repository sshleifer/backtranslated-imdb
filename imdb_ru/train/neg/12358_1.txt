The hero Demi Moore in the film was chosen for the SEAL because of her appearance. It was a bad start, and the film went from there. The plot was absolutely incredible. The desire to do this in a tough military unit is not enough. This film did not convince me of the physical ability of a woman to perform the required tasks. <br /> <br /> Trying to pretend that women and men are basically the same is an insult to everyone. Differences between the sexes - that's what makes life interesting.
