This collection really sucks! <br /> <br /> I rented it, thinking that I would really like a good fight. Man this sucks! Fast catchy cuts, an extremely annoying speaker and the fights themselves were heavily edited and cut (I think especially about Jet Li's wrestling fists of legend and Jackie Chan's wrestling drunken wizard 2). <Br /> <br /> And what's up with these street fighters fights ?! What is so "cool" about it? I saw more interesting battles on martial law! <br /> <br /> This is a stupid collection of cuts for stupid people. <br /> <br /> Never buy this movie! Don't encourage the people who made this shit to do more than that shit! <br /> <br /> Instead, go and buy films of which there were fights, and become battles in their invincible glory!
