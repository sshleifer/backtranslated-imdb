In the autobiographical tale of coming of age “Romulus, my father,” Eric Bana, known as “Munich,” plays an impoverished German émigré fighting to raise his son Raymond (Cody Smith-McPhee) in the countryside of the 1960s in Australia . The main obstacle to the stability and happiness of the family is his wife Christina (Franka Potente), who grossly violates her wedding vows, shamelessly mocking with other men. Despite her highly unconventional behavior, Romulus refuses to give her a divorce, masochistically torturing herself in the vain hope that she will return to him one day. Unfortunately, it is the kindhearted and good-natured Raymond who has to witness all this marital turmoil - and it is his memoirs that served as the basis for the film (Raymond Guyta later grew to become an author). <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that I admire “Romulus, my father” for what he is trying to do, I cannot honestly say that I liked it, because while the film has some good ones performances and serious intentions associated with this are simply not enough to counteract the harsh storyline and funeral rhythm that leave the audience as desperate and depressed as the people on the screen. A serious drama with a piece of life is one thing, but this steadily depressing pursuit of adultery, madness, and multiple suicides (not to mention suicide attempts) is something else.
