Please keep in mind: this film, albeit with a rather bad storyline, was one of the worst films I have seen ... EVER. Just remember that before you sit on the sofa to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> So officially, it starts with a party. Just an ordinary party, but there is some guy there. He's good at Kate ... if you know what I'm saying. Remember his face; it will help later. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Kate is going to find George Clooney (didn't I say that the plot was bad?) and so she picks up the phone. This is the London Underground in the middle of the night, but it's just dumb. Thus, the schedule says that the next and last train will arrive in 7 minutes. Now Kate, the stupid party girl, decides that she can take a nap in her spare 7 minutes. As a rule, she is late for the train and turns out to be locked in the London Underground. Alone. Well, almost ... <br /> <br /> So the film is just beginning. The blood, intestines, limbs, and even some parts of the body that I will not mention are cut, cut, and eventually amputated from the body. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a typical horror; pretty but fat girl in the plight of women and the sick, a strange psycho. Or, as the case may be, Creep. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™d say, try it if you participate in Saw, Hostel or Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but for the rest of us, Scream with out out Horror needs many thanks.
