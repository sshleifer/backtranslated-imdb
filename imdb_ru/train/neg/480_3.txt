2 stars for Kay Francis - she's great! And she did not deserve this terrible joke that Warner Bros. threw to her! <br /> <br /> The bilateral premise on which this film is based is ridiculous and incredible to the extreme. Kay is a wife and mother in a small town who wants something more: she wants to become an actress. When a major actor comes to town and invites Kay to his hotel to talk about the possibilities, Kay tells her husband that he is going to the movies. Hubby-mother intimidates her husband's ear, that Kay is not true, and he goes in search of her. He finds her with an actor in a hotel (they only say!), And he kills a guy who falls over the railing, lands his face in a pond (a lake?), And dies. Now here are two incredible assumptions on which the rest of the film is based: <br /> <br /> 1) the judge tells the jury that if it is determined that the person died * before * his head fell into the water, they must find husband guilty of first degree murder. (Whaaaaa ?????? I think that beating a guy in a fit of rage would mean inadvertently killing or killing 2, not killing FIRST DEGREE. Give me a break! But the plot demanded that he be found guilty of murder 1 so that he could be sent to a prison for life. Anyway. <br /> <br /> 2) her husband’s lawyer, after being convicted and sentenced, tells Kay that this is all her fault. He reasons like this: if she had not gone to the actor’s room, then her husband would not have to go after her, kill the guy and kill him. He tells her that she is guilty, not her husband, and she nods and agrees. What kind. . Hell?!?!?! The rest of the film is about how Kay is trying to achieve fame and money in order to free her husband from prison and correct what she did, first of all forcing him to kill the guy-actor. <br /> <br /> I can't even continue this review. The film was too painful. Four years ago, in the days preceding the codes, you would never see Kay play such a wimp! However, in the true fashion of Kay Francis, she tried her best to make us believe that this woman was a believable character. I am very grateful to her for trying to breathe life and trust in this ungrateful role. This character was far from Kay's pre-code roles and Kay Francis’s real surge. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this! There are much better cars Kay Francis out there! (From personal experience, I highly recommend Mary Stevens, MD and Jewel Robbery; Dr. Monica and One Way Passage are also good. I'm sure there are other great films by Kay, but I only mention those that I've seen and can recommend.)
