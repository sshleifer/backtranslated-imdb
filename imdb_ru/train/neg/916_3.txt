Lauren Bacall and Charles Boyer do not give the right chemistry here in this 1945 film. <br /> <br /> There is a good story about the Axis trying to mine coal for a future war. Unfortunately, this part of the story is not emphasized. Instead, we are dealing with a supposedly clumsy Boyer. By the way, Bacall is as British as Vladimir Putin. <br /> <br /> This actor's award goes to Oscar veteran Katina Paksino. As in the case of her unforgettable Pilar in 1943, Oscar winner “For Whom the Bell Tolls”, Paksinu again plays the Spanish revolutionary, but this time she is a double counterspy for the pro-Franco group. Here she is a rather angry character, especially when she throws a 14-year-old child out the window. She believed that Boyer had given the child important material to hide.
