I took this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie. But I had no idea what I'm getting into. <br /> <br /> I started the film, and soon I was plunged into a world of pain and visual torture. <br /> <br /> I finally know what kind of hell this is this movie. Forever. This film does not matter. He didn't even have a plot. In each scene, something happened, but there was no general explanation why something was happening. <br /> <br /> Instead of watching this film, I suggest you fill the nearest blender with oil and try to fill it with as many bullets as you can. You will see that the result will be much nicer than this movie. <br /> <br /> Don't even watch it. Do not even see how bad it is. I asked you. If you watch it, it means they win.
