When I saw this “documentary”, I was disappointed to see Serbian propaganda in action. Although Serbia and its nationalist policies are the main reason for the breakup of Yugoslavia, it is not mentioned in this “documentary film” filmed by Bogdanovic, whose name tells us that he is a Serb, and in his film he is far from objectivity. This is one of the many lies put forward by the Milosevic regime. All the rest are guilty, only the Serbs were right and the victims, although most of the war criminals convicted in The Hague are Serbs, although the Serbs - those who committed genocide against the Bosnians and attacked Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia - all independent countries recognized It could not be avoided the collapse of Yugoslavia, because the Serbs did not want to weaken the influence that their nationalism had on the federal Yugoslav government, therefore Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia were forced to become independent states in order to protect their interests. ests. If you are Interested in an objective documentary on the breakup of Yugoslavia, and the fact cited in the documentary is not the case. You should see “Yugoslavia: the death of a nation”, made by Discovery Channel and the BBC.
