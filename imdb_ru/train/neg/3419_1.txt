So, Chuck Norris somehow found a way to prepare a sequel. I have one question - why? Who read this script and said: “The sound is great! Original! ”This film is a belch that I would not spoil. Of course, this is a different story, following the traditions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the US Invasion, Walker, the Texas Ranger, Delta Force, etc. In which Chuck Norris is, of course, the only person who can unite America with some bad guys. He doesn't even need weapons in most cases. This is a dull patriotic jargon that freezes in your mind. A big surprise that the only one who will manage these Norris films is the son of Chuck Eric. Eric Norris mainly worked on all his father’s films and television shows. Doesn't it strike anyone as a sign that he has no director's talent? In the end, he leads the same people as before, in the same stories as before ... the only difference is the names of the characters. If this should make me patriotic and support the United States, then our country is in a much worse condition than I could have imagined. I hope it will be a nail in the current coffin of Chuck Norris.
