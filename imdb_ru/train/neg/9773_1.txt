When it was released, I thought it was one of the most profane films ever made. Nevertheless, thanks to Martin Scorsese and several other cinematographers like him, the plot films were worse in language than this ... but this is quite a brutal attack by ear. Hey, I can take a lot, but this is ridiculous. In the first six minutes alone, I heard half a dozen uses of the name of the Lord in vain, as well as a myriad of words. I wonder how many people left the theater, watching this in 1990? I could not be the only one. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, the actors included Jennifer Jason-Lee, Bert Young, Jerry Orbach and Ricky Lake. Since this film appeared, Stephen Lang seems to have improved his image, at least by playing in the Divine Stonewall, Gods and Generals, of Jackson. The role of Lang here is just the opposite: perhaps the worst cheesy person in the film, and the character who falls in love with a transvestite by the end of the movie <br /> <br /> Depressing, gloomy, semi-pornographic, repulsive which people used - even some liberal critics - in describing this story, which is even worse written in the novel. Of course, some of the most famous critics, all the extreme ones, highly appreciated the film. However, they were the only ones. Most critics were nasty, and almost all paying publics. It is incredible that someone could praise so much dirt and debris. <br /> <br /> Believe me: there are no good, cute characters in the whole film. This is a sneaky, sickly film: one of the worst in the “modern era”. That is, if you do not like to see cruel treatment of children, drug abuse, teen prostitutes, and so on - for two hours only atrocities and just evil people. No thanks.
