This film was ridiculously bad. A friend rented it from Netflix and made me watch it. There are so many missteps and stupidities that it’s impossible to even recognize the characters and the plot. How about this, for example ... <br /> <br /> Vermont Airport, surrounded by palm trees <br /> <br /> Ben’s wonderfully emerging shirt during a telephone conversation <br /> <br /> Luxurious office of a priest ... complete with folding table for card tables <br /> <br /> There is a decent story behind a very bad movie. But even if you look beyond the technical flaws, you will find terrible acts and casting. I was most tricked by the bright gay actors playing the role of a right-wing religious fanatic brother. His opening scene, sitting in his immaculate apartment, stroking his cat, was cheerful. <br /> <br /> I applaud the writer / director / producer / editor / star / provisions / actor-dentist / composer (and everything he did this turn) to actually receive the film as it spreads. If you have nothing to do, it can be a fun group film or even the basis of a drinking game, but you shouldn’t shoot it for a powerful story about homophobia and same-sex marriage.
