It was made in 2007, and computer graphics are bad for a film made in 1998. In one part of the movie there is a freeze-frame of a dinosaur, which actually looks good, but it just makes a very amateur work on CG material even worse. <br /> <br /> Scenario, acting, directing and everything else in this movie is just awful. This is as bad as if not worse than Raptor Island and 100 million BC ... pure nonsense! Again, as in other films, the only thing terrible in this film is that it was actually made and is now being broadcast on a sci-fi channel. <br /> <br /> I still can't figure out how they somehow make people who have some acting skills play in these films, and then somehow make them behave just as awful just like everyone else in the movie. <br /> <br /> For those of you who are not sure, itâ€™s obvious that another sarcasm poster in his review ... or he is one of those who worked on this film.
