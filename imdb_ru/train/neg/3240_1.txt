This is the first Guinea pig film from Japan, and in my opinion, this is the most painful film. Several guys tortured a girl for several days before killing her. And at this moment I will say that these films are NOT real! These are fake horror movies that try to be as realistic as possible. <br /> <br /> Scenes are terrible, but in many cases unreal. For example, when they kick a girl on the floor, we can clearly see how they kick and stomp the floor next to the girl! And how silly it looks! Sound effects are also unreal and have no meaning. Other scenes include the intestines of an animal thrown at a girl, a girl who for many hours is exposed to loud noises, tearing off nails, worms inflicted on wounds in the girl's body, eyes pierced and mutilated in horrible details, and the like. Very sick and mean film, in which there is nothing valuable or cinematically meaningful. This first entry is the sickest and most amateur guinea pig, although it is not as bloody as the next part, “Flowers of Flesh and Blood”, which is trying to be as shocking as possible. <br /> <br /> Guinea pig: Devil's Experiment, perhaps the most painful thing I have seen, and the closest thing that can be put out. This is still (of course) a fake (n / t) pf, the only difference from this “snuff film” is that in this film no one dies and does not really hurt. I can not recommend it to anyone, because it is so bad and disgusting. Those who consider this a great horror film do not understand anything in the movie and in its true meaning. I looked at it as a curiosity (as well as other parts of the series), and now I know how insignificant they are. They work only at the level of shock, and this is not a very valuable cinematic achievement. Devil's Experiment is perhaps the most painful film I have seen, and Mermaid in the Hatch (Guinea Pig 4) is perhaps the most disgusting film I have seen. So this is quite extreme in my book, but that's all they are.
