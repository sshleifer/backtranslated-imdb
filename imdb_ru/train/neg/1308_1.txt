What really appeals to me in this film (that is, what makes this film physically sick of me) is that someone actually paid for its creation. There is absolutely no point in the existence of this film. It's not scary, it does not provoke thoughts, it is not interesting, it is not good. This is a sleeping pill from cyanide. The DVD case compares it to Blair Whitch, Evil Dead and several other decent movies, which makes the director’s despair obvious. It is nothing like any other film ever made; it is much, much worse. Claims of an “extremely shocking ending that you will never forget” are equivalent to one tonne of horse smelly droppings. Please do not waste time viewing this garbage, because it can make you fruitless. The person who wrote this film should be removed from the list of members of the Writers Guild, and should never be removed. Because if he thought it was worth it to make a film, he probably has nothing to offer in the future. Zero stars. Let Grod will spare the soul of anyone who is not lucky to see it. I'm going to go vomit now.
