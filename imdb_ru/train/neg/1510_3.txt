The reasons to watch it get knocked down ... to err ... a tribute to the great film called Se7en: - It is on, while your channel is working, and there is nothing more. - Someone pays you for watching. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and insert a DVD for Se7en, rent it, download it to iTunes, or paste it into your Netflix replica and completely skip The Flock. A flock is the same story with a few changes. In addition, editing simply leads to Se7en and in fact ultimately takes you out of the story several times. Worst of all, probably flying over the shots from a deserted helicopter, with the sounds of people chatting on the radio, except that police helicopters do not fly in this. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: I call it blatant knock off. If you want to be nice, you can call it a tribute film, go on, but in any case, see Se7en.
