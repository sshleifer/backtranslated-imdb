I recently watched this movie on DVD, and I must say that I was not impressed. I know that prohibiting independent films is a taboo, but this film seemed devoid of entertainment. <br /> <br /> The premise was interesting, but its execution failed. I caught myself thinking, "Well, they are just beginning to understand that the story will begin soon." Before I knew it, the film was finished, and the story never began. I can't say that I found an acting game so impressive. That was pretty bad. Not a trilogy with a Star Wars prequel, but nevertheless a bad one. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what time it was running, I assume two hours (because this is a safe estimate). In any case, when the film was finished, I felt that I deserved some recognition for my willpower, which I showed, without stopping the film and not going halfway. <br /> <br /> Again, I was completely unimpressed, and in the end I got bored. I'm not one of those guys who need quick actions and explosions in the film, so don't start with me, because this is the reason why I donâ€™t like him.
