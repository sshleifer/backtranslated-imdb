Complete nonsense. The unfortunate manifestation of a hypocritical, toxic culture a decade ago. In this film, pedestrian regrets about slavery go hand in hand with colonialist overtones (annoying redhead, feeding Shaka's rice?) Forget the historical reality. Are most Western slaves not from West Africa? Is the American slaver easily capturing Shaku with a handful of men? Finally, David Hasslehoff could not be more unpleasant. One can only think how he would live in a miniseries? (Most likely pierced most likely). The mini-series was superb, and, unfortunately, DH had to get something unique and make it everyday. (I tend to think that he had a hand in creating this fiasco).
