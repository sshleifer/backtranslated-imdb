I am not one of those who think King is a great writer, his books distract attention for several hours and often have interesting prerequisites, however, in my opinion, they quickly fall apart if you seriously think about it <. br /> <br /> This film suffers from a fairly accurate retelling of King’s story. If you read the book, there are no surprises, no changes, no changes of scenes or characters. This is a film created by King fans for King fans. <br /> <br /> For the rest, there's nothing scary about the film, it's the horror of the “gypsy curse”, in which the curse is a curse. what many people want to become thinner. The last third has some serious structural problems, and a slightly forced ending seems to break the rules of this genre a little. <br /> <br /> There are worse ways to spend 90 minutes of your life, but you could also read the book, because there is nothing new here ... <br /> <br />
