I bought this video quite cheaply without rolling, thinking that the cover looked quite beautiful. And it was nice, but the film is rubbish. I can handle B-grade, sometimes I even enjoy good Bromp (for example, Surf Nazis Must Die is a classic example of how interesting the genre can be), but it was just soft and soft. Incredibly stupid scenes were broken too rarely by good healthy cheap porn and entertaining dream horror sequences. This film has very little to offer.
