This movie is just boring. <br /> <br /> He is trying to copy some of the effects borrowed from such a creative director as Jone in Amelie Poulain, but this is too much. The conversations are pretty bad, some of the worst I've ever heard, Guillaume Canet is not convincing (I almost never found him very convincing), his father plays very badly in the film, the story is stupid, the ending ... Stupid. <br /> <br /> I think I didnâ€™t really like the film since the Brotherhood of Wolves (the Brotherhood of Wolves) by Christophe Gans (and I watch / see about 80-100 films a year)), but at least in this film there was some kind of action and a lot of good actors. <br /> <br /> I never commented here (only evaluated), and when I saw the rating and comments, I thought that I needed to write something wrong. <br /> <br /> I think we will have no problems selling the DVD we offer: a good film in our (big) collection !!! <br /> <br /> I am open-minded (I watch SF, westerns, dramas, comedies, silence, horrors, fantasy ... movies!), but this film was so boring that I felt I lost an hour and a half.
