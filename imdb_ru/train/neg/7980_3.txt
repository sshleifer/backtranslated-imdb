This service comedy, for which Peter Marshall (brother Joan Drew and subsequently the permanent owner of Hollywood squares) and Tommy Noonan were promoted, because “the new Lewis and Martin” are just shy of horror: several random sights are inserted, everyone speaks quickly and nothing works perfectly - there is one scene in which Noonan throws grenades at officers and politicians in anger; they are about five feet apart, Noonan throws them between them, and the general reaction is that everyone shudders. <br /> <br /> In the midst of the horror that only Julie Newmar brings, there are several moments of brightness: Marshall and Noonan occasionally make double conversations and argue, and their time approaches the ideal - obviously, they were well-honed comedic couples . <br /> <br /> This is not enough to save this turkey, alas.
