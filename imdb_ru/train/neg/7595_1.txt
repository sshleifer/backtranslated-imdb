“Ask for the dust” looked intriguing from the trailer, and we especially like all the actors. Unfortunately, the film was not convincing enough to be considered dramatic, and it was not funny enough to be a comedy. It seemed that he himself was full, and no entertaining effect. After seventy minutes of waiting until this situation improves, my wife and I went out, appreciating no longer wasting time on such nonsense. It just wasn’t interesting, touching, funny, nor artistic. It appears that it was written, produced and directed by a high school child; Worse, it was such a shameful waste of extraordinarily talented actors, not to mention our time and money.
