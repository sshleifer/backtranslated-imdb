I know I'm outnumbered, but ... Uwe Boll is about as talented as a frog. Not even a toad; just a frog. He reminds one of hundreds of other mediocre hacks that make one useless crappy holiday after another. <br /> <br /> This movie? This is shit fest. Slater's talent is used only minimally, forcing him to believe that there are other things on his mind (for example, his unfortunate relationship). Raid behaves as if she had either forgotten her acting lessons, had been hit hard on the head and MADE forget her acting lessons, or has one of the worst directors in cinema history. I myself vote for the third option, although the other two are always possible. <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll never did anything that I would get even the slightest pleasure. Honestly, I am satisfied that he made this abomination. I was worried that Bloodrayne would compete with Underworld: Evolution for selling tickets. Now I’m sure Len Wiseman has nothing, and I don’t mean ANYTHING to worry about. <br /> <br /> This is a 1.0 / 10 rating for this dirty, tangled, crappy holiday, from ... <br /> Fiend:
