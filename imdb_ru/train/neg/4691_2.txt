This film explosion literally. This British film is made boring. <br /> <br /> What an exciting plot! The terrorist puts bombs on the train. How could the authors and producers of this git turn it into such a boring story? <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford, as an expert designed to defuse a bomb, receives terrible material for work. Naturally, as soon as he is called, his wife Ann Vernon is going to leave him. No wonder we never heard of Miss Vernon. After such a film, this would be enough to end her career. <br /> <br /> This old man who loved to train and interfere is our version of the 1953 senile dementia. It seemed to me very offensive to show this man even at the end.
