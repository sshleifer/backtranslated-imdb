This movie has some of the most amazing cars I've ever seen in a movie, and definitely the hottest women, but I must say that this is still one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Here is the plot, and if you read it with a slight twist, you also have an action. <br /> <br /> Start typing characters, a hot woman sings (obvious lip sync). A music agent or producer comes, thinks she is cool, asks her to race. She refuses, too many bad memories. The hero of Flash to war, who returned from the war, fights several times and becomes a hero of the film with such an attitude that he is the best. Drive a fast exotic car. Brother is chased, then dies. Hero to avenge death, cut off to get a weapon from a friend. (You have never seen this friend before or after, but it seems he really cares) Are you sure you want to do this; Yes; I mean, you really sure; Yes, give me a weapon; you are really sure; Yes; Well, I think, I can not dissuade you from this, be careful, I love you. <br /> <br /> Now he is going to blow up his uncleâ€™s house, who owned the car his brother drove. He finds a woman, decides to save her, She leaves, and he does not finish killing his uncle. Now there will be a race to finish the movie. Oh yeah, you need to add another scene with the arrival of bad people in order to beat people who really don't matter, but maybe this adds a little story. The race is not so exciting, of course, it ends with races in two cars, and one of them, which should win, ends unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> OK, I just saved you $ 7.00. You can send me all your money, because I had to give you the same pleasure as this movie. Don't get me wrong, the cars are awesome and Nadia is beautiful, but this is a really awful movie.
