This DVD seems to be aimed at someone who just puts it on and will play in an endless loop in the background. It is organized as a series of music videos about the Grand Canyon, featuring various pieces of Tangerine Dream music. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, TDâ€™s music is boring, and DVDs look pretty blurry and dull. DVD is too expensive for what it is.
