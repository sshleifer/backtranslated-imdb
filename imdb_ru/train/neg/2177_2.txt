The first noticeable problem in this awkwardly titled film is its casting. Ann Nelson plays the grandmother here. Three years later she starred in "Plane!" like a woman hanging by listening to Robert Hayes Pine for Julie Hagerty. I could not get this image out of my head. <br /> <br /> Matt Boston is 15 years old, he has problems. He has headaches. His mother had a nervous breakdown. His grandfather had a severe heart attack. The psychiatrist who smokes the chain decides to find out what the hell is going on in this family. At first she hypnotizes Grandma Nelson. Nelson tells a flashback story that fills the entire first half of the film. <br /> <br /> They bought an RV with their grandfathers, cheaply, and took him to all the tourist traps in desert California. The RV soon has its own mind, leaving the road and the like. Then big boulders begin to hurl themselves at him. An elderly couple, respectively, is afraid, but remains in the car to move around the plot. <br /> <br /> In the end, Grandpa has a heart attack after he gets stuck on the roof of an RV when he goes on another unplanned trip. <br /> <br /> Bostonâ€™s mom starts talking to some mummies of Native Americans she lies around the house. She considers herself the author and makes copious notes about musty carcasses. The psychiatrist reads detailed notes and uses his imagination to fill in the blanks. We see the mother turning slightly, but her mental breakdown occurs behind the scenes, very much like Gramps' heart attack. <br /> <br /> Finally, a patient with resistance, little Matt. Matt goes under the gun for hypnosis and tells his own story. He thinks mom is leaving (this was done in 1977). Apparently, mom makes the astral bodies of Native American mummies fly through the air. One of them hits Matt like a bee in the windshield, and Matt starts to act like a madman. <br /> <br /> A psychiatrist takes Grandma and Matt to the desert. Matt is now inexplicable in a wheelchair, and the trio confronts invisible (and unexplainable) forces. <br /> <br /> Floker does not make sense to construct a scene. One professional here involves RV, who is stuck in a salt flat in the desert. At a distance, the couple notices several boulders rolling toward the RV. This is a rather creepy little scene, which is eventually replayed. When the boulders start hurling themselves towards the car, the special effects become apparent. <br /> <br /> The scenes where the RV runs off the highway and then turns back on continue forever. The scene where the grandfather is trapped on the roof of the RV when he goes down the dirt road takes forever. Mom and mom talk goes on forever. Matt outside the body is experiencing forever. This movie lasts forever. <br /> <br /> I was tempted to press the fast forward button at least a dozen times. When the scenes dragged on, it was obvious that Flocker was retreating. Cut the fat here, and that would be in an hour. The last "explanation" that the spirits of mummies tried to kill close to Matt, never holds water. Did they live in an RV? The filmmaker never remembers that the spirits do not know how to kill, they never kill anyone! <br /> <br /> While I was thinking about Nelson in Plane! I remembered other films as well. , Anything to keep me awake during this. Boston, like a child, is terrible, he plays a fifteen-year-old, small, cute ten-year-old boy who has a clever funny line for all these adults who fall in love with themselves, loving him. <br /> <br /> In the end, Floker wrote and directed the mess. The title is just the beginning of this exercise, which makes the audience feel uneasy. It's not scary, and, like ghosts, you can still get away ... from this tape in the video store. <br /> <br /> This is unrated, contains physical abuse and easy profanity.
