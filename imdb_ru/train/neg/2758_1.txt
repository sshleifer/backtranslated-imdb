I give this movie 1 because there are no negative numbers in the IMDb rating system. this film was terrible. It was very bad, the story was poorly written, the action was incredible. I doubt that even the Salvation Army could fight as badly as the troops in this film. I will not even write storyline spoilers, because the film is not good enough for storyline spoilers. Writing comments to the story would be meaningless. If I compared this film, I would have to compare it with the “Kingdom of Fire”, however, although I didn’t like “The Reign of Fire”, this film was at least better than this one. <br /> <br /> Some people in the theater, remaining before the film was made halfway through. The only reason I didn’t do this was because I just didn’t think about it. I was hoping for a CGI festival and fought masterfully, but this did not happen. Martial arts lasted all 30 seconds, and it was because of the routine exercises performed during the flash scene, very disappointing. CGI was not well done. One scene comes to mind. During one of the early tank battles, troops open fire on ... nothing. Someone forgot to give a command to the animation guys in this film, so there were absolutely no bad guys on the street. I also think that the voice of the bad guy was voiced by Imotep's voice over from The Mummy movies. Has the same erratic echo continued? (Did someone have a fee here?) Since I mentioned the scene of the fight, I will say that this can be considered a spoiler, but only for purists, I suppose. <br /> <br /> Do not go watch it do not buy a DVD when it comes out. You have been warned.
