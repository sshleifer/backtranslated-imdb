this film was not absolutely cruel, but it was pretty bad. The acting was pretty good! Jeffrey Combs did a hell of a good job as a mad scientist, what is his specialty if you don’t know such things: D. Bill Forsyth ... well, I'm not quite sure why he was in this film. he is too good for this kind of thing, and his role is not completely demanding. I rented it on the basis of these two leads, and I was not really disappointed. I mean, damn it, this is a movie about half a man / half shark. These are not the people of Shakespeare. In addition to the plot, which is full of holes and bad dialogue, I would like to note that cinematography also left much to be desired. there were shots when they tried to look “cool”, but in the end it obscured the scene or just got out of hand. they also screwed up many times when they had a decent dialogue and disconnected prematurely before the person even managed to draw a line. it was pretty bad. but if you're a Geoffrey Combs fan, this one is worth checking out. He plays well and does his best with the character. forsythe is also nice, and any one of them is a woman. hell if i can remember her name though. The bottom line is that otherwise I would not waste your time.
