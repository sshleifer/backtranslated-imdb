First, I also expected another Hero - a fantastic work of art for the action genre. I have only seen parts of a stalking tiger, a hidden dragon, but I can imagine that it is better than HoFD. <br /> <br /> The main elements of Hero are in HoFD: magnificent landscapes, fascinating cinematography and sincere play (I mean, if you can't understand the words they say, without subtitles, but you don't care - this is a good game) <br /> <br /> What went wrong? What begins with political intrigue, turns into a love story. Worse, it’s a love triangle like a soap opera. You have three characters who, I think, fall in love with each other - for no good reason. This film is mainly falling apart after a prison break (I fell asleep for about forty minutes). It is almost as if they changed authors at this moment. The rest of the film is about how the character is "like the wind." Ik In addition, you really have to stretch your suspension of disbelief in order to believe in the action set by the pieces. This is not unique to this genre, but since the story is weak, you cannot wait for the action, and then when the battle begins, it really wasn’t so good. The beginning captures you, but then this movie just ends in gasoline.
