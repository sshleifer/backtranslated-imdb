“I went to the cinema to watch“ Beat Street ”/ it was not bad, it was something like“ neat ”,“ Krush Grove ”was a film that I didn’t mind / but when it came to“ Rappina ”, I drew a line. “Talk to your mother. <br /> <br /> Do you want me to stop? <br /> <br /> This is just a small example of a rhyme in the style of“ Stupa-fly ”demonstrated in this waste of film and permissions on location. This film is seriously disgusting (this is the 80s - just awful.) As the host, Mario Van Peebles is one of the actors. And as an actor, Mario Van Peebles is a real bodybuilder’s attorney. <br /> <br /> Anyone the film, which calls itself “Rappin", best of all demonstrates the highest standards of that genre of the time. So why did the 6-year-olds ride in the aisles, even in those days when the standards were as low as Webster? Because this rap is weak, so weak that even B.E.T. or Comedy Central touches it with a 10-foot gold rope chain. <br /> <br /> Blondie's “Delight” is poetry standing next to this piece of Dr. Suess in the hood. So don't be a dumbhead, avoid this movie! <br /> <br />
