I saw bad movies in my time, but it really takes cookies! Why was this movie made? There is simply nothing here. Please trust me, press the switch and destroy your copy of this movie. There is a plot ... it may take about 5 minutes to show on camera. This is a key issue, a story “based on a real story” (mmm ... whatever) cannot be continued for 80 minutes in any way. And so we have to sit for over an hour, watching people walk around. That's all! In the first half hour, absolutely nothing happens, except for someone going to the store ... and then three guys are walking in the woods. Perhaps this time could be spent on character development ... but no. And therefore there is absolutely no connection with people on the screen, and therefore, when they start shooting, we didn’t care! In fact, I ended up vouching for the villain to end the film! On top of that, the camera work is really awful! This director / editor / writer / producer of T. West is rubbish. I hate hitting a guy, but actually his job is his pants! These boring closeups continuously, and then a long single goes after people when they go - I'm sure he thinks he's smart, but the results are so boring that I just wanted to stop the movie and cut my wrists! How this man was attracted to the filming of the next film about the fever, I have no time for that. In conclusion, the acting is also terrible, as far as the film is concerned. Keep your sanity, stay away from this pile of total excrement!
