Anyone who went on strike in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s must have seen one or two films from American International Pictures, a distributor that looked like the giant Cannon Films of the 1980s. Everywhere, wherever the movie lovers are, AIP is always ready to give the latest titles in fashion - in the 50s horror films appeared, such as “Voodoo Woman” and “The Undead”; in the 60s there were Frankie Avalon-Annette Funichello’s beach comedies and biker films such as Glory of the Thunder; and in the 70s, AIP produced garbage at the grindhouse level, for example, “Cannibal Girls” and “Sugar Hill”. <br /> <br /> “Dillinger”, released in 1973, is one of the most high-profile AIP projects, capturing the true spirit of a film; it is one of those uneven, excessive films that could be cursed by the thirst of the masses for entertainment, skill and common sense. In general, “Dillinger” is typical for its era: entertaining and worth a couple of hours, but certainly not memorable. Heavy in action and short in both acting and historical fact, screenwriter / director John Milius (“Magnum Force”) worked pretty hard on “Dillinger”, but certainly left room for improvement in his vast career. <br /> <br /> The 109-minute “Dillinger,” an epic for AIP, follows the instructions of the FBI chief in the Midwest, Melvin Purvis, played by Oscar-winning Ben Johnson. Purvis was an investigator who attempted to take revenge on four FBI agents killed in an ambush in Kansas City in 1933, which helped gangster Frank Nash to escape justice. In general, these were the people who allegedly planned this breakthrough, including expert banker John Dillinger (Warren Oates), Pretty Boy Floyd (Steve Kanali) and psychopath Baby Face Nelson (Richard Dreyfus). In the end, Dillinger joined forces with Floyd and Nelson, taking Homer Van Meter (Harry Dean Stanton) and Harry Pierpont (Jeffrey Lewis) with him. He also contacted Billy Fréchette (Michelle Phillips), a prostitute of French and Indian origin. Taking place over the course of several months in 1933–4, Dillinger is basically a chase film, Purvis' entourage hopes to escape and kill people wanted by J. Edgar Hoover. <br /> <br /> “Dillinger” has a documentary sense of listing dates and places, while Johnson delivers a free story like Purvis. Milius maintains the honest look of the Depression using genuine fashion, cars, weapons and buildings; he also scatters black and white photographs and video materials about gangster shootouts. The film is never boring, it moves at a fast, albeit random, pace. The action scene is Dillinger's forte edited by Fred Feitshans Jr. in his last professional work. Thousands of empty cartridges were used to create this film, not to mention the pounds of explosives. This film, of course, is not for squeamish people who are shot and die everywhere. Violence, although gratuitous, brings some insight into the mayhem that organized crime has put on American life. <br /> <br /> However, this film never goes beyond its exploitative status, since there is simply no necessary script. John Milius, somewhat overrated as a director, pays too much attention to action. The action scenes (mostly bloody skirmishes) are impressive and comparable to any major crime films of his era, including Bonnie and Clyde in 1967. But we just don’t learn much about Dillinger and his gang members as people; The vital relationships that develop between Dillinger and Fréchette are almost unaffected: a couple meets at the bar during one scene and jumps like lovers in just ten minutes. Melvin Purvis also seems to burst into the storyline and out of it, becoming an outstanding figure only when Milius needs to prevent the film from falling apart. Too often, heroes are shot in a film when its characters can be studied in detail. <br /> <br /> In addition, the main crime of the film is the lack of knowledge of historical facts. Although many say that “Dillinger” is just a film, it is films like this that create fables and make them permanent. Those who know the history of the gangsters will note that John Dillinger was not the last of his ringside to die, as Milius’s script and documentary style of the film lead us to believe. In fact, Dillinger died earlier than Baby Nelson and Homer Van Meter; It is said that on the night of his death he did not have a pistol, and he did not have Billy Fréchette in his arms. Although these inaccuracies can lead to high drama, there is no reason why Milius could not stay with the facts and write a magnificent story around them. <br /> <br /> Warren Oates as Dillinger is pretty good, although he sometimes looks unconvincing. Oates is humorous and well portrays how Dillinger became absorbed in his big image in the American press; however, we never feel the threat he referred to during his lifetime. Ben Johnson gives Purvis a bit of life, suave, but rather flat. Michelle Phillips evokes emotions in character Billy Fréchette, and it’s a pity that Milius’s script didn’t affect her relationship with Dillinger. We will never know what attracted her to the cold-blooded killer, except for the stereotype about a calm girl who attracts men of danger. The supporting roles with Kanali, Dreyfuss, Stanton, Lewis and the briefly appearing Cloris Lichman are acceptable for such talent. <br /> <br /> “Dillinger” is doomed to be sold in a retail shopping cart, this is where I got the MGM DVD release for $ 4.99. The film is beautifully presented in widescreen mode (mandatory for movies) with subtitles in French and Spanish. Dillinger's theatrical trailer is shipped separately. Much forgotten, with the exception of gangster movie fans and driving enthusiasts, the film doesn’t really require anything else as additional material. For fans of the genre, definitely worth checking out. <br /> <br /> ** of 4 <br /> <br /> Roving Reviewer - www.geocities.com/paul_johnr
