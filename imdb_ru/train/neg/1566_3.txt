For a knowledgeable Beatles fan, the main value in this film is to just sit back and identify flaws, inaccuracies, combined events, missed events, wildly exaggerated events, missed people, timeline errors, quotes about incorrect attributes, improper clothing, exit songs (shame on shame) wrong tools and other blunders that I just can't think of right now. Disadvantages appear quickly and violently, so you have to be on your feet. <br /> <br /> I didn’t give this “1” first of all because it was shot in “Liverpool” and the actors (the Rain group) give all their strength (the character of Lennon is trustworthy and does a good job) . In addition, the song "Cry for a Shadow" once sounded, and it means something. <br /> <br /> So, look at it for fun, but please do not take it as historically accurate.
