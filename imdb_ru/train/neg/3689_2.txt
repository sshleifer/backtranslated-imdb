The main aspect of Superstar films in its later stages was frequency, the lacuna between one film and the next. Being a recognized star of South Indian cinema, the feedback he received before Baba was great. <br /> <br /> Starting from Nattukku Oru Nallavan (1991), the number of films in which he starred in Tamil as a mass hero for 11 years was only 11 exactly 1 per year. It was all a great hit. He had an image that many thought could not be easily refuted. <br /> <br /> But after Padayapp (1999), he fell into a state of hibernation. His fans around the world, especially in South India, were ready to watch any film with their superstar in action. So, the Tamil film industry decided to come with Baba. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers thought that the fans would take everything they showed with Superstar. But it clearly did not work in this film. As usual, the hype in the media and the expectations of the fans were beyond the limits. <br /> <br /> The image of Radzhinikanta was completely damaged. The fans are crazy. The movie collection does not match the expected level. The reputation of great people went down. <br /> <br /> The only positive moment of this film was the songs of A.R. Rehman. It is known that Rehman composed good music for some of the worst films, such as “Taj Mahal”, “Kadal Virus”, “Ally Arjuna”, “Paarthal Paravasam”, “Star”, “En Swaza Katra”, “Vandicholai Chinnarasu”, etc. D. Well, I never thought this film would join this league. > <br /> You will feel very depressed, not because the film was bad, but because the image of the superstar has deteriorated. It took him five full years to fully return him with two films “Chandramuhi” and “Shivaji” and to return to the fans what they are really looking for in the movie superstars.
