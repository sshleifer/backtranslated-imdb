This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I really can't remember when I saw the worst movie. I thought it would be about an accident investigation. Actually it was a soap opera, and a bad one. They outplayed the "conflict" card to the extreme. The first hour or so seems like a scream, with the addition of some incredible scenes. <br /> <br /> * Possible spoiler * <br /> <br /> Approximately 40-minute “memorial” scene with the necessary black umbrellas and rain) so that the fake victims of the accident were lame, and I thought it was never will not end. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs, unless you enjoy “conflict”. <br /> <br />
