I still shudder at the thought of ever seeing this movie again. <br /> <br /> I saw action movies, I even liked quite a few of them, but this one goes beyond. <br /> <br /> The main role is played not only by the worst male actor (Sly Stallone), but also the plot of the film is so stupid from the very beginning (why not rob money while the plane is on the ground, damn it, much easier) that a person who has an IQ less than his number to believe it. <br /> <br /> In addition, the plot has no real turns, a three-year-old child could guess what will happen next. This is a set of clich√©s (an action movie genre), in which Sly plays even worse than his other films (he was even better in Rambo III, if you watch this film as a comedy, not an action movie). Now there is an actor who cannot act A) surprised B) sad C) anything other than his main face. <br /> <br /> I would like to point out that there are two factors in this film that some people might like. EXPLOSIONS are outstanding, but then ... better seen on July 4th. LANDSCAPES are great, but then ... there are documentaries about the Alps and the Himalayas, so you can see the sights better and not waste time on this film. <br /> <br /> Instead, watch another movie, there are hundreds, even thousands of the best action movies.
