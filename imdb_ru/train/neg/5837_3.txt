I can not say that I really liked this movie. He has some funny moments, but he doesn’t seem to be able to decide whether it is a comedy or a drama. light in tone is drama, and there are few amusing moments, and they are far from each other. It also does not make much sense. It seems that this is happening without any reason. And it is also extremely confusing. when they walked. if they just spent a little time explaining things, this could be a better movie. I would say that the end was anti-climatic, but it would mean that the rest of the film actually accumulated to something that was not there. it just sorts the ends, and that's it. It didn’t seem boring to me, really, but, as I said, there’s simply no point. and weak 3/10
