I think that's almost all I need to say. I feel obligated to explain my actions, though. In principle, I have never seen such an artistic production, and I mean it in every sense of the word. Despite the fact that the physical work of the camera, working with a microphone on the boom and other technical aspects of this film are ridiculous, unfortunately, these are not the only areas. <br /> <br /> Unlike some classic independent films that have been preserved by their scripts, a great feature and plot of this is, unfortunately, a terrible script, a terrible acting game and, worst of all, horrible annoying characters. <br /> <br /> It is a crime that for every independent film that is distributed, such as Haiku Tunnel, there are 101 other indie films. that he died a quiet death. I do not know who the Kornblut brothers know at Sony, but this may be my only explanation of how this amateur family production has spread. I am completely confused as to why they brought it up. <br /> <br /> The ONLY part of this film that stands up to any intrigue is its title. However, the reason for this is even disappointment. I hope this review will save a few people who might be intrigued by this movie title to watch it. I saw a lot of movies in my time, and I really forgive when in the movies, but that was too much. I will never forget the “tunnel” because he marked an important moment in my life in the cinema. Shame, this is such a low point. <br /> <br />
