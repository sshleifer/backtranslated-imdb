This film is so bad that it is good - in an unintentionally funny way. I couldn't stop watching this, I was laughing so hard! It's like a parody of a romantic thriller, only this is not a parody. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul plays Emily Wendell, the wife of an oppressed preacher, who falls deeply in love with Luke (Cory Sevier), a cunning and mysterious vagabond, who, as we will know, ended up in prison; The only thing Sevier is to blame is in a bad game! Keep in mind, he is not worse than other actors. You understand that the actors have no idea that they are in a really awful movie; they play straight. Everything in the film is bad: acting, script, love scenes, tempo, plot turns, the choice of music. Climate scenes are ridiculous - first a shootout in the church, then the last words of Luke Emily - I howled with laughter. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Luke did a lot of weightlifting and crunches in prison, and we saw a lot of his naked torsos. This is probably the highlight of the film.
