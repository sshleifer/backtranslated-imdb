Awful, terrible show! Why Comedy Central decided to repeat the old episodes of this program, I do not know. It really sucks! I, of course, talking about the seasons after the first two. The first two seasons were golden, and if I spoke exclusively about these seasons, this show would get eight out of ten stars. None of the comedians appearing after the first two seasons that were not part of the original cast are good. They were and are terrible. Comedy is not funny at all. ALL !!! <br /> <br /> The original cast was full of very talented comedians such as Artie Lange, Phil Lamarr and Mary Shorr (or whatever her name is), and they all should get the best offers after they left MAD TV. This show is heavily overrated and less worthy of your time on the channel than Saturday Night Live, another terrible show. Get off Saturday night and have fun, and leave MAD TV to dry and die, as it deserves.
