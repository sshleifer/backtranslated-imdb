I saw this movie and another. Trinity is my name, and I think this one is worse than the first. I have no idea why they even made another film. It was stupid and pointless to regret that I have everything. I watched them several times, and it still makes me turn it off for 5 minutes at the movies. I like movies with Terence Hill, and I like Bad Spencer, but this movie just drove me to the wall. If he had a different storyline, or at least more plot and more comedy, it could have been more fun and worth the $ 5 I spent on buying all the films. But you make mistakes, so I would say, save your money and do not forgive this film or those that go with it, believe me in this.
