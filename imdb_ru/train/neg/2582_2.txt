Just finished watching American Pie: Beta House, and I must say that it was such a pile of garbage. The first 3 American pies were fun, the last 3 were jokes and should not be called “American Pie”. <br /> <br /> As you understand from the name of the film “Beta House”, it’s about fraternity, first-year students, girls and, the most original of them all, falling in love. Of course, the guy who has to do with the chicks is Stifler, who, together with his friends, is trying to accomplish another seemingly impossible task. It was unreal and super fake. This is really very predictable, and the plot is very weak. Both sides of the college are fighting to see who gets it all (something like this). Summing up: a terrible game + a boring scenario + a misuse of the American Pie franchise = a waste of time! This film is unbearable. I give it to two out of ten, although most of them were lame, there were many naked and beautiful girls, like 2 funny scenes :)
