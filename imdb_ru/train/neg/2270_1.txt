The only thing that kept me from vomiting after watching this movie is that they are just actors, not a strange show that usually appears on a television show. This is also the main reason that fans of television shows do not like the film, but not the only reason. This film has the same entertainment value as getting the root canal. It comes close to the bottomless depths of making bad films, and then it gets worse. I will not waste your time describing this film in more detail; Suffice it to say that I feel sorry for the poor people who were supposed to suffer, watching this c ** p for the first time.
