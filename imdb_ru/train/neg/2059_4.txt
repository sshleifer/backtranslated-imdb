The call girl witnesses the murder and becomes the next target of the killer. Directed by Brian De Palma is really pretentious: his camera is spinning in the corners of the museum (after a long stay over the monkey picture), it is divided into a split screen for artistic purposes, it practically gives its plot with a sequence (again in a split screen), where two characters simultaneously watch a TV program about transsexuals and arrange their (first) final during a thunderstorm rain. "Dressed To Kill" tires, primarily because he asks us to swallow so much and does not give anything substantial. Most of the acting skills (with the exception of young Keith Gordon) are mediocre, and the (second) finale is plagiarized by De Palma's own “Carrie”, not to mention “Psycho”. Explaining dirty deeds is like Hitchcock’s deception, not a homage. Stylish and cold, the end results are clearly unfinished. ** from ****
