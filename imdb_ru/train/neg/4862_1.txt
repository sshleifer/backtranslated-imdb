This show is one of the worst shows of all time! absolutely no original jokes, and they are always a year late. as in 2009, they will finally say something about Michael Vick’s air battles. all the cast members are people who wanted to be in SNL, but had to go to the lowest of the insane TV. This is an hour of crazy magazine jokes that you don’t tell funny, terrible John Stewart, who wants bees, tells me if you have any problems, tell me that I like to hear the opinion of 3 people watching this show. The family guy put it well: “Osama bin Laden was hiding in one place where no one was watching, the actors were crazy television. There is a reason why nobody watches the show.
