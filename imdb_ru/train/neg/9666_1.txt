Having seen “The Triumph of the Will”, I can only say that this film is terrible, even if compared with the historically low “standards” of that time. Naturally, all this is completely fabricated and detrimental. This can be expected from the German propaganda of the 1930s. Unfortunately, the quality of the presentation itself is careless and cheap. It is also so blatantly ridiculous that even the modern Germans must have left the theater, holding their noses. In the genre, known for its basic appeal, lack of originality and inappropriate folly, this film is not even considered “bad.” This would have to improve significantly to achieve this status!
