Absolutely one of the worst movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Low production value, terrible plot idea, bad script, sloppy play ... and I can't even think of an adjective suitable for describing how poor Joan River manages. I know that in hell there is a special place for the people who financed this film; just below the level reserved for genocidal maniacs raping children. <br /> <br /> This movie is a train wreck. <br /> <br /> (Awful) x (infinity) = Rabbit check. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br /> This is so bad, not even funny how bad it is.
