I love special effects and am witnessing new technologies that make science fiction real. The special effects of this movie are very good. I have seen much of this film since it was broadcast on HBO over the past few months. I have to admit, I CAN skip a few scenes, but I’m usually attracted to movies, and I’ve seen some scenes more than once. But every time I see a “Hollow Man,” I feel depressed, almost like a “film noir.” I'm not sure why; I may not want Kevin Bacon to be evil, and there is disappointment in it. But I think this is just evidence of HOW ruthlessly he becomes evil. Despite this, I can recommend this film for excitement (although some parts move slowly), but I do NOT recommend for children under 14 years old (perhaps 12 if they are mature).
