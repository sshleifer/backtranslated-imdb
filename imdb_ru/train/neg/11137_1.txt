All the naked women in the world could not keep me from pressing the “Stop” button for a third of the way through this terrible garbage. With a ridiculous game, the same horrible script plus a bad CGI FX to match; This film insults the werewolf genre. It must be serious, which in itself would be funny if this film could go to such an extent that it became a bad joke. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films where people behind the camera are obviously competent, but too lazy to do something even a quarter decent. Avoid at all costs and instead watch one of the classic werewolf movies. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10!
