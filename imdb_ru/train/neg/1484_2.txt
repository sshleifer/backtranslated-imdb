Please do not rent or even think about buying this movie. they don't even have the option of renting it in a red box, which will cost you $ 1, and I think it costs less than that. The main reason I rented this movie was because Jenna Jameson was in the film, between 2-5 minutes, I would say that there were hot chicks and some nudity in the movie, but you could also buy another horror movie d, who is the same with nobody you know. Ginger Lynn has more time in this film than Jenna, and sheâ€™s not even on the cover of the film or by name. time. this film is a big disappointment and such a huge waste of time.
