The film had a lot of potential, unfortunately it fell apart due to a weak / implausible storyline, incorrect broadcasting and a general lack of content / content. One of the obvious flaws was that Sean Connery, who played an Arab man, did not know how to pronounce his own Arabic name! This may seem like a minor flaw, but it indicates a seeming lack of effort in drawing attention to the details. The quality of acting was significantly below average. <br /> <br /> The lonely saving grace of the film was the turn of the plot at the very end; and a french song (I don't remember the name). Overall, it was a pretty bad film, in which Sean Connery was clearly mistaken.
