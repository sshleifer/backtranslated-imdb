Actual philanthropic gesture of actress Ruth Roman, designed to help entertain the troops arriving and departing to participate in the Korean War at an air base not far from San Francisco, marked the beginning of this stellar greeting of Warner Bros. for star and patriotism. Many celebrities appear at a party, while a romance between lover and hate develops between a budding star and a sickly green and skinny corporal of the Air Force (Ron Hagerty, who seems to be delivering newspapers from his bike). It seems that the corporal has deceived the actress, forcing her to think that he is going to fight when he is actually part of the crew of the aircraft carrier flying to Honolulu and back (you might think that she would be happy that he kept out of evil, but instead of this, it acts just like most children's women in the films of the 1950s). Doris Day lasts the first thirty minutes or so, and her distinct laughter and brave song numbers are the most pleasant. The novel is also here, it looks charming, while James Cagney makes fun of his character on the screen, and Gordon McRae sings in his beautiful baritone. Jane Wyman also sings in the hospital bed with leader Doris Day, forcing him to think: "Have they run out of sets?" For undemanding viewers, an interesting memory of a different time and place. Nevertheless, low production and just adequate technical aspects make Starlift a secondary one. * 1/2 of ****
