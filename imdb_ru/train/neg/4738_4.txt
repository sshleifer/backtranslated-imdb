I really enjoyed watching the original Azumi with its mix of lively manga, exciting storyline, awesome soundtrack, directing (Kitamura Rakes!), Editing, not to mention the beautiful Aya Ueto, who performed the role perfectly. So I was looking forward to seeing Azumi 2, but when I finally saw it, I felt that I won the lottery and lost the ticket :( Azumi 2 starts from where Azumi stopped, but this is absolutely 2 different films. Much slower , the action is not so exciting and well-delivered, and character development is not very big. Obviously, it was the same guy responsible for further reducing the value of the TOHO monster franchise (if it is possible!) I agree with some other past reviewers who say, that it was a lost opportunity If only Ryuhei Kitamura continued this part, there are, however, some beautiful Japanese forest landscapes that can be watched while the slow action unfolds, and we get too briefly acquainted with a few characters that are quickly killed. special trouble. Fighting a spider-boy (straight from the Monkey episode!) in the bamboo forest was for one. At the memorable battle scene. When in Azumi 1 we had a dramatic battle scene with the effects of a barrel-shaped camera, Azumi 2 brought us a cape of Azumi Cape !! Azumiâ€™s rampage at the end was unconvincing, but Aya still does a good job. She looks great on a cape ... but where did she get it from? I don't think I will watch it again and again! ...what a pity.
