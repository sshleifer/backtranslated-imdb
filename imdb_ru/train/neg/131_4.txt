So where are the cannibals? Those who are intrigued by the name and “real cannibal” of the attractiveness of this film will be disappointed. Instead, we are shown a strange man and his re-visit to the village of Papua New Guinea, full of natives, one of whom was his lover a few decades ago. The man, Tobias Schneebaum, is a New York Jew when they come in, and somehow it is intertwined with a documentary film, as he appears in his tongue in several scenes. <br /> <br /> There are no real cannibals here: only stories transmitted by some of the natives and Tobias himself. Not all together a bad movie. Very interesting and excellent cinematography. Schneebaum remains very pretty everywhere and gives us a breathtaking view of life that is as far from Western Civilization as possible. <br /> <br /> This is not exactly what she says on the cover and in the plot. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 children.
