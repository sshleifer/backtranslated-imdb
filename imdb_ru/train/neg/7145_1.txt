Obviously, Hollywood just gives out money to anyone who has a camera and the ability to talk. This movie was damn bad. The casting was terrible, the acting was inexpressible, and the story was filled with holes. Scenario? who needs a script? I was surprised that the film was not as vulgar as I thought, but I received enough T & A personnel to live me for a lifetime. The film was like an audition for a 19-year-old street racer with ADD (who decided to buy a car instead of going to college) telling a story. Being so poorly written, I thought that the two brothers in the film were lovers first. The scenes on the hippodrome along with the main actress in the film made me think of Herbie: fully loaded. This is the film Grindhaus modeled after ... only the authors thought they were serious.
