I really tried to love this movie. Watching this, all I can think of is: "This guy gives me goosebumps, I would get a restraining order." This also causes CODEPENDENCE in capital letters. Was it really a conversation before making the film? “Let's make a film in which two chronically depressed, socially inept people enter into relationships that deepen their isolation and cause them to complain about how bad their lives are!” From what I've seen in life, is that the last what we find attractive from a potential partner is constant self-pity. <br /> <br /> The mood of the film is clearly the 80s; pensive and slow. Don't get me wrong, the film has its moments, there are very few of them.
