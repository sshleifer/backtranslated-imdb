This film was supposed to be a blockbuster, and this is true. This is a type of film that is made to eat popcorn and watch gorgeous graphics. With this in mind, the film provides perhaps not as good as ultra bright Iron Man, but good enough. Beyond the effects of chewing popcorn and special effects, the film falls off a cliff faster than Wil E. Coyote. <br /> <br /> Many viewers, including me, will complain about how most of the characters have been seriously changed, but this only makes the film a bad adaptation, not a bad movie. This film is unsatisfactory for other reasons. The creators focused more on making it attractive to the eyes than to the mind. Characters who have been waiting and promoting for so long turn into cameos with 4 scenes. The main characters of Wolverine, Victor Creed (they never called the Sabers in the film) and Colonel Stryker are well developed. I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of Lieb Shrieber. The remaining characters are relegated to the background in order to make room for all important eye candies. Wolverine's character fully develops in 30 minutes, as did Sabretooth, although Victor does present some surprises at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> “The Last Boss” of the film is a perverse and perverse adaptation of the original character and hardly gets any development to show why it is what it is. The filmmakers obviously felt that all they really needed to do was create a bad character who could do everything he wanted and hit the name of a popular character. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing ...
