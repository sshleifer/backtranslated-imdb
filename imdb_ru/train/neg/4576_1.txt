At first glance, this documentary / fiction / caricature is quite interesting and makes you think. Of course, when something provokes thought, it can be investigated. The reality is that this film combines metaphysics with hints and unsubstantiated conclusions. The connection between "science and spirituality ..." between science and spirituality, in fact, is not at all rooted in science. The Transcendental Meditation study mentioned in the film claims that group meditation can reduce the crime rate in a given area, in this case in Washington DC. In fact, the crime rate committed by the HRA (murder, rape and assault) was about 30% higher in 1993 than the average crime rate from 1988 to 1992. During the study there was absolutely no decrease in the homicide rate In fact, every statement that connects metaphysics with science can be refuted and refuted. <br /> <br /> My conclusion from this information is that this film is either an unsuccessful attempt to impress people or a joke. In any case, I suggest you do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a long multi-faceted film about science that can trigger thoughts, you can consider Mindwalk (1990).
