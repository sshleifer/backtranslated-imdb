Let me start by saying that I will try not to put too many spoilers on it. I usually enjoy Robin Williams films, but this stone was not one of them. This was announced as an alarming thriller. The night listener was completely different. To be blunt, on the opening day of the theater there were 6 people, 2 of them came out, for good reason. The film was, in my opinion, poorly written and directed. The game was fine, but again, there was nothing to work with. The film is about a narrator who reads a good book of a dying child. However, * insert creepy here * no one can verify the existence of children. So Williams goes to Wisconsin to try and find the author, but all he gets is a headache and excuses from the boys' caretaker. That's all. You wait about an hour and a half, and the film ends. He had so much thrill and chill as a dentistâ€™s office. Homosexual overtones, or overtones, actually had nothing to do with the story, and there was a bit of profanity in the film, but it seemed to be added for no reason and had no meaning. In conclusion, I really can't write a decent review of this film, because there was nothing in it, it was as exciting as watching how the paint dries. I gave him 2 because the game for what it was worth was fine, and it was not directed by Uwe Boll.
