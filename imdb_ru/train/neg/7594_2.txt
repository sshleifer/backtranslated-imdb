Given the story of the director of this film, it’s hard to believe that it was a terribly bad movie. I was at the European premiere last night, and there was one of the executive producers. He still had to watch a movie, and he was waiting for a surprise. I did not read the book on which it is based, and I don’t know whether it is appreciated or appreciated, but I read Captain Correlli’s Mandolin and, considering how poorly it was adapted for the screen and how bad this film is, I can only assume that something similar happened here. The game wasn't bad, although there were far too many brows from Farrell. Honestly, I can't believe how little I cared about any character in this movie. Situations are played out on the screen in an empty sequence of non-existence. Part of Donald Sutherland consists of several scenes where he opens the door, says something and closes it again. I kept looking at my watch when I didn't cling to the dialogue on the screen. I never went to the movies, but I was tempted to start during this. I gave this film a rating of "2" for reasons that seem terribly petty to me, but this is the best thing I can say about this film. Firstly, I really liked the scene of a too short earthquake, and secondly, Salma Hayek was exposed and looked beautiful. I can say some other positive about this movie. Do not ask dust, it can not speak!
