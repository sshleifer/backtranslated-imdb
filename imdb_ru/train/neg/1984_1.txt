Absolute steaming pile of cow dung. It seems incredible to me that this film was shot. Hip-hop and old westerns just don't mix. What target audience did these people think about when planning this train wreck? <br /> <br /> Not only is the concept and plot of the joke, but the acting is terrible and the fact that some decent actors were even in this nightmare movie makes their whole career a laughing stock. A chicken of ignorance should never be forgiven, and she is deprived of any remaining dignity she had. After reading the first ten pages of the dialogue, she had to ask which of her friends were playing this joking joke. After some research, I found a list of other actors who starred in this film: Jada Pinkett-Smith, Denzel Washington, Brandy, Monique, Kim Kardasyan, Jenna Jameson, Oprah, and finally Marge Simpson. <br /> <br /> Simply put, I would rather watch an empty TV than watch this movie again.
