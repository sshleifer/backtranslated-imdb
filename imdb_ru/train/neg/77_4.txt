I saw this film opening on weekends in Australia, awaiting with the excellent line-up of Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush, that the final story about Ned Kelly will unfold before me. Unfortunately, despite the starring role of Heath Ledger, the plot was very subtle ... which does not inspire me to read "Our Sun." There were other advantages, in particular, support from Edgerton, a confident direction from Jordan (confirming his talent on the show and at Buffalo Soldiers), and production design, which gave the Australian bush a sense of Irish immigrants of the early 19th century, have seen it. But I can't help but feel that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of the Australian folk hero (or was he?) ... What I suspect is a concession to Hollywood and the sale of a painting in the USA. Oh well, at least Jordan and the producers didn’t agree to lose their beards just for the pleasure of Universal ... <br /> <br /> I think I’ll just have to be content with Peter Carey Gang’s excellent "Kelly Secret Story". 4/10
