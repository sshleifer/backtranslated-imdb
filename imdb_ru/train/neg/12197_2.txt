“Animal Wars” is a show that is spun, overpriced and overvalued. Let's meet the heroes of this nasty show, the creators of which must have been on acid to try to arrange such a show. <br /> <br /> Cheetor - Seriously, they should have a censor bar for this guy. Why he does not frighten the audience with the same voice as the baby Tez? (at least Razzoff from Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is voiced by Slip & Slide) Action Blast - If you want a crap series, get a G4 Tranceformers Cybertron - a show that should go to the toilet. Good Job Creators (sarcasm) Show that it is mentally retarded and boring (at least Super Mario games are better) This show had many followers who said they returned it, but I think it was canceled for his own good .
