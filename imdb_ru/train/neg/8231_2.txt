MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ... BUT DOUBT, THIS MAY BE RECEIVED RECEIVED! This film is trying to be better than most films like the Blair Witch movie ... it doesn't work ... it just looks and feels like someone has a cheap video camera, van and decided to make a movie. The story has no explanation, the protagonist is not given any real motivation (and he looks like a lesbian in a power suit compared to five girls), and there is no violence about which you can talk ... only the sounds of scream and crunch. The whole film takes place in a van, which means that decent landscapes are out of the question. Five girls really do their best with what they have been given, but overall they look like pretty awful actresses ... although it’s hard to judge with the material, can they really ... they spend ALL the movie screaming, screaming and whimpering. .. so hard that half the time it’s hard to make out what was said, and the cameras are so bad that it’s really hard to say who said it. This video depicts a violent torture film, but in reality it’s just five girls in a van, screaming in horror ... which literally sums up the whole movie ... we then come to an end after what seems like 5 hours of constant shouts and all five girls are still alive ... with one minus finger. The only thumb (get this ... finger .... LOL) for poor actresses who tried their best and probably lost their voice (and their pride) after making this terrible movie. Do not judge this by the poster .... you are very let down.
