John Goodman's program was pretty awful, but this thing just stinks. The only thing in this mess that made me smile was the recognition of Patrick Starfish as Frost. The story is hopeless, written by someone who distorted memories of rebellion in childhood, but over the years has never acquired an adult sense of perspective. Paranoia rules the dark world in which these characters live. Everyone is unpleasant and for no reason. The plot is predictable, but the show moves from one inexplicable, unrelated scene to another in such a meaningless way that it is not interesting to watch. The worst thing is that none of the film crew has ever seen snow!
