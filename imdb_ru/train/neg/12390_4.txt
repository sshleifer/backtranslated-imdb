After a version of this film with tight censorship was watched on television several years ago, I was curious to see the unedited version. I was surprised that it was more believable and acted well than I remembered, but one thing really stood out. I think that other reviewers also mentioned this, namely, what is the character and motivation of the character Chris Sarandon? Did he rape other victims before? Is he completely psychosis or “average” sociopath? How did he expect to avoid attacking a younger sister? Is this character credible at all, or is it just a matter of need for additional information? Almost at the same time, he seems awkwardly believable and too crazy to actually hold a teaching job that puts him in contact with young vulnerable girls. This seems to be the biggest complaint of the audience in general. This has nothing to do with his game, which is appallingly convincing. The film occupies a difficult position between explicit exploitation and a serious approach to the subject, without going into any of the modes. Not the worst movie ever made, but not so good.
