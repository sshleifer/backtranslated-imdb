... but this, of course, not without reason. Already writer-director Preston Sturges is experimenting with unusual cinematic effects, telling his stories, creating widely drawn, but distinctive characters and situations, and writing intelligent and sometimes surprisingly wise and compassionate dialogues. (Itâ€™s not surprising that the Coen brothers' next film will be a tribute to Sturges.) <br /> <br /> The main problem is that the plot is not yet complete; it is devoid of surprise, unexpected plot twists and sudden changes in state that make viewers guess. The coffee slogan is a lousy thing on which to hang a plot, and the ending is quite predictable. Frank Capra copes with such things much better. <br /> <br /> If you are new to Preston Sturges, first check out Eve Lady, Sullivan's Journey or The Miracle of the Morgan Creek. If you have already seen it, then go and see it.
