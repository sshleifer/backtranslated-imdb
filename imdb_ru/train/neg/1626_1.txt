This film has recently appeared on local television in South Africa, and I thought Iâ€™d warn you even those who like to watch bad B films (which I do) are not even funny. The plot concerns a couple visiting a house in the country. Some strangers appear and ... The problem is that most of the film, filmed in the early seventies, consists of extremely wide frames, going in real time and terribly slow from A to B. in the extreme case and the expected payment of blood and blood is simply never not happening. I'm really curious - how many people really watched it from start to finish?
