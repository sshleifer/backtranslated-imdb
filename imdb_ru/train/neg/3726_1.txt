I was forced to watch the entire series of films as a child, and I was told that they were REAL! Talk about child abuse. I would be less afraid of Dracula or Frankenstein. This series is good only for people who believe in this absurdity and want to instill faith in their children in the same thing. In addition to the obvious problems associated with brainwashing and ideological processing, there is also a bad game, bad writing and bad “special effects”. They are just horrible, horrible movies. Yes, it is plausible (and terrifying) for a child, but I cannot imagine how an adult buys this shallot. Although, I must say, I would be interested to see them today as an adult. They might have a certain midnight / cult movie feeling to them.
