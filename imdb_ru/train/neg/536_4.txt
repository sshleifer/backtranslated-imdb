The story of a woman (Ann) on her death bed, her two daughters (Nina and Constance) and her thoughts about her past. Memories relate to the weekend when young Ann is at the wedding of her friend Leela. At the wedding, she meets Harris, who will influence her for the rest of her life. Through all the highs and lows of her professional and family life, she remembers him as her true love. Her daughter Constance is older, more “responsible”, a mother of two children, and she has everything together. Nina jumps from guy to guy and from work to work and is not sure about her life direction. <br /> <br /> First of all, good. The details of the period in the film are great. Dresses, hairstyles, cars, houses, etc. Really put you in another time and place. And the film has a very high-quality game. Vanessa Redgrave is pretty good at portraying the main character and her fragile mental state when her life comes to an end. Claire Danes is beautiful and copes well with the role of the protagonist in her youth (and she is an outstanding singer). Hugh Dancy brought a lot of life to Brother Laila’s character Buddy. <br /> <br /> Now about the bad, which, unfortunately, everything else. Things are constantly destroying history as it unfolds for us. The chemistry between young Ann and Buddy is great. They are having fun and dancing. Then ... you must believe that he really does not love him more than his friend, and that his longing only annoys her. And I thought that all this “he can be gay” was completely unexpected and did not serve the purpose. <br /> <br /> Then we have Harris. The character is wooden and creepy. If it was a different genre, you would know that Harris was a serial killer from the start. It's incredibly hard to think that all these girls loved him like that (but they portray other guys as rather stupid to try to help him). <br /> <br /> And the biggest problem of all. Why don't Ann and Harris get together? They fall in love with each other. They had this wonderful night of sex in the shack of an old dirty gardener, they came home to find out about the tragic end of Buddy, and then ... <br /> <br /> Nothing. <br /> <br /> They meet After a few years I look at each other foggy, and I wonder why. WHAT FOR? The film does not make it clear why they were forced to marry other people, and it was difficult for me to feel sorry for them. <br /> <br /> Part of the story in the present is pretty boring. Cliche is a good daughter and cliché is a bad daughter. Nina is changing as the film progresses, but I don't know why. I'm not sure that convinces her to change her life. There is a "touching" scene where daughters are joined, which coincides with old Ann, who dreams that she should chase a butterfly. This is really lame and confusing. <br /> <br /> “There are no mistakes here,” says Ann. The statement is not true with the story. And it does not sound believable after watching the film and wanting them not to waste the talent of such good actors.
