Sitting down to watch the Bachelor's 14th season (“On the Wings of Love”), I knew that an “interesting” time awaited me. I in passing watched several Bach previous seasons; watch an episode or two and skip the next three or so. I believe that a bachelor is often attractive and intriguing, although his qualities and morals are often lacking. <br /> <br /> “On the Wings of Love” tells in detail about the journey of Jake, a 31-year-old commercial pilot from Dallas. In Texas, to find true love, the same true love that can be found in the TV series of dating in a reality show. Jake meets 25 beautiful girls from all over the country. He begins to recognize them a little, but this is mostly superficial; how well can you meet someone in a few minutes? Jake tries to convey his true intentions from the very beginning, at least to the audience. He noted that he does not just want love or a good time, but wants a groom or bride. We can only assume that he clarified this and women in competitions. If so, this may to some extent explain some of the actions of women. Women are super competitive. Although they don’t even know Jake yet, they still benefit, no matter how much it costs. <br /> <br /> Women were not only competitive, but also confident and dexterous. Threats, stabs in the back and warnings "Watch out!" all show that these women were not there either. Jake noted that he is not just looking for sex appeal, but looking for a "connection." However, the girls did their best to surprise Jake with sex appeal. Did they arrive at the mansion in scanty dresses ?? either short or short. <br /> <br /> While some girls seemed to maintain a sense of propriety, others missed the note altogether. One girl, Chenny, noted that Jake was a “nice guy” for whom she could be a “naughty girl.” She further said that Jake could land on her "runway at any time." She did not like other girls because of her provocative statement, which showed how they perceive these situations. <br /> <br /> So reality shows can't be so bad, can they? In addition to the obvious problem of sexual desire, there are other problems that darken this seemingly innocuous show. This is the right way to find a future assistant; fight for someone's attention, exposing yourself in extreme proportions? Unfortunately, however, this is exactly what America has reduced the number of dates to the present: pleasure and sex without commitment and a little happiness on the side. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the premature emotional attachment that many girls are associated with. Sami Jake In particular, some girls were too attached. One girl said: “If I don’t get the first impression, it will kill me!” As mentioned earlier, they don’t even know him yet, and she was talking about a particular rose, and not about one of the 15 roses that had to be excluded. <br /> <br /> Michel, in particular, seems to have some problems with attachment to Jake. Other girls also noticed this. After one particular outburst, Michelle Wien stated that Michelle had a "mental breakdown, and we were here for just an hour." Michelle got the last rose of the evening on the first show ?? narrowly missing elimination ?? and was extremely emotional about it. Other girls thought it was ridiculous. Another girl also cried, but because she was expelled. <br /> <br /> It started with Survivor, and from there it just took off ?? reality show. This shows our entertainment interests as countries; if we had not watched the show and did not give them good grades, the networks would not have continued to launch them. The only logical conclusion that can be made is that America has hooked enough. One thing is clear: America (as a whole) loves reality shows and related attributes. <br /> <br /> The question arises: why do we even like reality shows? What about this attracts us to this? Is it because we see similarities with our own lives, or because we want to be sure that we are more stable and less pitiful than others? Whatever attracts us to this, we must be careful with the media and entertainment that we allow to fill our minds. I'm not saying that all reality shows are bad; However, I say that we must evaluate each of them. <br /> <br /> Episodes used for criticism: Premiere Season and Episode 2.
