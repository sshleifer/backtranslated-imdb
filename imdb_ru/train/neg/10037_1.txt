I never thought that the standard of Yashraj films would ever deteriorate to such an extent! The film has a meaningless storyline that does not arouse interest. <br /> <br /> Saif beat. Karina has improved her figure, but in any case she is not a very good actress. Akshay is good. Anil is also good. Let me say that the role was not good. <br /> <br /> Most of the cheapness is full. I wonder if this should be the “comedic part” of the film? That the last few films were a flop, does that mean that Yasraj films should be such garbage? It has a history of so many good films. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was completely disappointed with the film.
