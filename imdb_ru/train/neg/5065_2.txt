This movie is just bad. Weak history, poor direction and acting skills are below average. What really irritated me was blatant advertising - constantly - for a well-known Internet provider. Obviously, some scenes are written for advertising. This film is a slap in the face to anyone who paid money for it. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this, itâ€™s not worth your time.
