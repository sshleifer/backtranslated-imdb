My God, I can't believe that I wasted my time watching this movie. I just watched because I'm so in love with Jordan Ladd. But watching this movie almost pushed me away from her. This is absolutely terrible! I could watch Survivor Series 93 on this. <br /> <br /> The main character in this was so soft and versatile. I would be glad if the great Mistuharu Misawa Tiger led his ass through a glass window. I was angry every time he said "lake" and "house". I would kick his ass. <br /> <br /> Jordan Ladd, on the other hand, was just great. A real angel. But she couldn't even save this joke of the movie. Unfortunately, she could not even act as if she had lost her mind when she was taking this truth drug. It looked funny. <br /> <br /> I also liked how Jordan accidentally spilled yogurt on it. It reminded me of a time when ... never mind. <br /> <br /> Anyway, watch this movie because of its awfulness.
