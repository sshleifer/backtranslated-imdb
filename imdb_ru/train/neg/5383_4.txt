I think I should start by saying that almost any work style can be interesting in parts. The true test is whether it is good from beginning to end, and that is why I gave a similar name for this review. Most of us would agree — even those like me who like to read a lot of blogs — that blogs can't compare to writing a good novel for a number of reasons. Similarly, FEM cannot compare to good filmmaking for a number of reasons, and I actually believe that this is a bad example of independent filmography. From start to finish, FEM feels like a folded video blog. (Hell, even MySpace gets a little pimping.) If I wanted to see the hour of a lonely girl, 15 I wouldn't ... I would go see it. FEM, although certainly dirtier than the chewing gum atmosphere of the aforementioned media, is so personal that there is no interesting story. It is like watching the daily routine of life, which, I think the majority will agree, is very boring. And yet, the creators of FEM want us to applaud them, their very postmodern film about making a film. Bring a yawn. <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm leaving, not caring about any of this. I am shocked that I’m really interested in taking the time to write this review. The point is not that FEM is completely bad, because it is not; I have a few moments when I start to smile or think that maybe it’s just possible that something interesting is going to happen. Rather, it's just plain ... mediocre. I feel so indifferent to this that it almost corresponds to an oxymoron: passionate indifference. <br /> <br /> I hope that the creators / "actors" in the film have lost their debt from their efforts. They will probably need it when one of them leaves and leaves with life. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you have time to waste time and nothing special you want to do; otherwise, miss it, and don't worry that you missed some great, undiscovered talent. You really haven't.
