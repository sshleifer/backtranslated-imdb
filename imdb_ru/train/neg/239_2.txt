I will not say that this film was bad, but also bad. I was expecting something good, but I think Hum Aapke Hain Kaun was much better than that. It was completely old fashioned. At each stage of this film, I was hoping for some kind of turn, and what would I get? The girl is burned and conquers the love of her aunt. <br /> <br /> Even though they are engaged, they must receive permission for every small movement they make. They are so damn shy even after so many meetings. I expected the aunt to be much more brutal than that. All she did was an insane stall. <br /> <br /> Hey, we have children too, but we donâ€™t watch them and we always have tears in our eyes. This film is a dream. A happy family, one cruel woman, good relatives and a man who loves her to death. In HAHK, Anupam Kher was the father of a poor bride, and now the opposite is true. And I somehow knew that Manish Bel will be in this film. Anyway, I believe that I wasted my time. I give it 2/10.
