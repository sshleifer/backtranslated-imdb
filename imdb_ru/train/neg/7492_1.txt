Obviously, most viewers do not know anything about the history of Europe, including Germany, Hungary and the whole of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as the era of Hitler and Stalin. Nuremberg (and many forgotten lawsuits across Europe) was the revenge and injustice of the victors. Why do you think there were no American, British, French or Soviet defendants after World War II? There were no American, British, and so on. D. War crimes? There was neither Hiroshima, nor Nagasaki, nor Tokyo, nor Dresden, nor Hamburg, nor Berlin, nor Katyn, and so on? The Germans also had war crimes, but in Nuremberg justice was not a real consideration. The main thing was: Vae Victis! Germany must die! (It was also the name of the book in America, 1941.) <br /> <br /> This film is a terrible, shameful American brainwashing tool, full of mistakes, lies, propaganda, prejudice and injustice. And above all: complete hypocrisy. But no wonder ... Why wasnâ€™t the Nuremberg process itself sufficient? This movie is a nightmare. Total darkness after 60 years! This darkness (and hate, and narcissism, and lack of self-criticism) is the real cause of the massacres in Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Serbia, Iraq, and so on. And there are no American war criminals ... Bravo, America! Very clever. Even Stalin would envy this ...
