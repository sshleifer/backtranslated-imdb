My friend gave me this movie. My friend is now in the hospital, where a team of doctors is trying to surgically remove the DVD case from his shit. <br /> <br /> I was excited about the prospects of another Michael Chabon film. After all his novels brought me a lot of pleasure, and the previous scenarios were great, but damn it, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, the people who starred in the casting were probably asleep. I imagine that the castings went like this. "Tell me, do you like fish?" "Yes, I really love fish." “Wonderful, you're hired. Have some money. ” <br /> <br /> What's the script here. I read Shabon, who, I hope, went blind before I saw this piece of dong, and this has nothing to do with his novel. I'm not quite sure why it annoyed me the way it was, but it may have something to do with the fact that listening to a 90-year-old drunk duck hunter with speech disorders with dysfunction of the right cranial lobe would be a pleasure compared to one line spat out these children from the model of the 2nd degree. <br /> <br /> This is a real line from the movie; “If you tell me something that you never told anyone out loud, then this moment becomes unique!” Unique? Does it? It's true? Of course, you have not reached. Please pass me Imodium. I will have a whole strip. <br /> <br /> Direction ... good. I have nothing. Perhaps Rawson Marshall Thurber had just received a message that his grandmother had exploded or something like that. Stick directing comedies. Do not stick to direct commercials. <br /> <br /> This film is so terrible that it made me beat my head against the wall so much that it brought me back to the stone age. I give him 2 stars because I don't want to be the guy who watched the 1-star movie.
