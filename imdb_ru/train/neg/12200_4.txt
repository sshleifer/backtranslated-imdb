Usually, any film with Sylvester Stallone, as a rule, sucks. Rambo: First blood, part II, is no exception. The only films in which Sylvester Stallone was good were “Rocky” and “First Blood”. This film is extremely unrealistic and boring. He has an action, but not a very good action. I did not like to watch it, and I will never watch it again. No wonder why he won the Razzie Prize for the worst picture. I would give it a 3/10, the only reason why he got 3 was that he had some good action, but not good enough.
