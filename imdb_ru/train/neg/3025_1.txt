this film is really bad ....... no, I mean really very bad. Tony Scott is a terrible director. Of all the films that he made, I like only the enemies of the state, except that he is one of the worst directors of all time. What shocked me the most is the fact that Richard Kelly (director Donnie Darko) made the script for this. Now Richard Kelly is a genius in my eyes, but participation in this gives hope that he has learned his lesson. <br /> <br /> Now I like the new roles of Mickey Rourke, but I donâ€™t even like him in this because of the terrible story and appearance. don't get me wrong, I still love Mickey Rourke, but he did several accidents at one time, and this is one of them. I do not know what to say about Keira Knight, I think she is too overrated. I just can't feel her in the movies. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is bad. that's all ....... 1/10 ....... j.d Seaton
