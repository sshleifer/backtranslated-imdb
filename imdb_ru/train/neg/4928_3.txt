This romantic adventure must have seemed shockingly disruptive in its time. A wealthy upper class Englishwoman makes plans, builds stories and manipulates everyone around her for her own satisfaction. She uses her privileged position to engage in covert activities of a clearly antisocial nature. There is a clever change in the role of sex, because its actions prove that it is more impudent and dashing than most male characters. But, of course, there is a tall, dark and beautiful stranger who watches love interest, and this wicked lady does not lag behind when she meets the right man. <br /> <br /> Weak weakness and gullibility of any other character makes the plot unconvincing to the extreme, but those who crave romance will not notice it.
