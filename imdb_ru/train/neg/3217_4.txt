Late train Wrong phone number. Extra cup of coffee. What happens to others when you make a seemingly innocuous decision? Most people do not think about it, because they are absorbed in their own thoughts and actions. <br /> <br /> “Accident” tells the story of relationships and cause-and-effect relationships of the mundane, as this refers to the group of normal Parisian people. It has all the components of what can be said about the modern theater, with a complete set of dysfunctional and disappointed people. <br /> <br /> There is a betraying husband, an illegal, a classic slacker, a pickpocket, a crazy grandmother, an annoying girlfriend, a selfish roommate and a homeless person. Audrey Tautou serves as the former protagonist (in the sense that she’s on camera as much as anyone else, opens and closes the film) and as a normal girl who simply cannot find the right rhythm in her life. <br /> She learns at the beginning of her day from a stranger on a train that holds her horoscope for her. What happens to her during the day, tell different characters. Prediction comes true? The concept is good, but storytelling is unconvincing. Links from one event to another are weak. In 15 seconds of a commercial about Liberty Mutual insurance, it is better to tell stories where one person sees a good deed and transfers it to another than in two hours of happiness. <br /> <br /> If you like Audrey Toth, then of course you can donate time for this film, but you end it dissatisfied and wonder what the same story line could be if it were processed better producer and director.
