I just didnâ€™t like this movie. But then I loved the baby Pig in the City, and I was spoiled by films about animals that are exceptionally well made in every way. Animals were not cute. They were all annoying, especially Chris Rock's guinea pig, but what I could expect was Chris Rock. It seems I smiled once or twice on a couple of lovely lines, but that's all.
