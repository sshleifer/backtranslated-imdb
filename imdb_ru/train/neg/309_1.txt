Hey. I'm Paul Raddick, supposedly a WTAF panic attack, Channel 29 in Philadelphia. Let me tell you about this terrible film that marked the beginning of Adam Sandler’s career, but was soon digitized. <br /> <br /> Going Overboard is a novice comedian, played by Sandler, who takes a job on a cruise ship. and fails ... or so I thought. Sandler meets children who like The Story of the World, Part 1 and Rebound. The babies were supposed to be engaged, but, in fact, they were executed by Sawtooth, the most vile cannibal the world had ever known. Adam Sandler felt bad in “Overboard”, but better in “Big Daddy”, Billy Madison and his beloved Jen Leone “50 first dates”. Dude, Drew Barrymore was one hot chick. Spanglish is red-hot to the brim, not crouching behind Dooley! End of file
