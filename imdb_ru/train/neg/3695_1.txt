Not the best acting film. The director focused on the projected acting glory, and not on good entertainers. Maybe the hero himself, his family and his sincere fans can enjoy it. But definitely not worth it for a neutral audience. The sequence of the fight - a complete comedy. The music is average. This film was the biggest failure for the actor. Despite the hype created over the film, the film failed miserably. Do not even think to watch this movement, even if you want to kill time. Instead, you can watch a cartoon. A good movie lover can't digest that shit in 2 1/2 hours.
