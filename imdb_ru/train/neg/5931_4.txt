This film was supposed to be just 10 minutes. I mean, there’s really only 10 minutes of viewing content in this piece (I don’t even dare to call it a movie). The opening credits of the film were somehow promising. As the movie begins with a short comment from the person himself, you really rub your hands and follow the news about Cohen's life. Well, Nick Cave copes well with one of Cohen's famous songs. The length of Cave's speech makes you want to see Cohen even more, whose wit and well-spoken words have already tickled your imagination. But as it turns out, Cave’s performance is only the beginning of long super boring speeches by literally groups of people who don’t even have the minimum appeal to keep you in their places. I mean, what does the director really think? Five-minute close-up shots. I want to be singers at a fake concert in Australia !!! What the cinematographer really thinks is to insult the audience by adding “fake applause” to these endless dirty actions. The film is a wonderful torture that shows you very little of what you came to see. There is no record of Cohen's past. In fact, with the exception of a few photos of his early days as a singer / poet, there is absolutely nothing here! If you add up all the minutes Cohen says, it may not even reach 10 minutes. But these 10 minutes are painfully presented gradually between catastrophic camera work, which captures some of the most unattractive people screaming Cohen's lyrics. If you have ever decided to waste your money on this film, do not do it! just throw it in the trash and at least save your time.
