First of all, to give you an idea of ​​my taste in films ... <br /> <br /> Comedy 2007 I liked: Superbad, Knocked Up, Hot Fuzz, Blades Of Glory <br /> <br /> Comedy in 2007 I hated: Evan Almighty, Solomon Brothers, Good Luck, Chuck. <br /> <br /> I had to follow my first instinct and turn off the Hot Rod after I reached the 20 minutes mark. By that time, I knew that this film would not make me laugh even once. The script is absolutely cruel - I have no idea how this monster managed to crack 6 on IMDb. Anyone over 10 who likes this should be mentally handicapped in some way. <br /> <br /> With Will Farrell this comes close to nothing, and it’s clear that Andy Samberg cannot carry anything longer than a 5-10 minute sketch on YouTube or SNL. I don’t know how they made Ian McShane and Isla Fisher make this film ... they must have been loaned or something like that. I came, knowing that it would be a stupid movie, but I thought it would be at least ridiculous. I did not grin. <br /> <br /> I usually do not comment on IMDb movies, but it was so terrible that I just had to warn people. This is only the 4th film that I saw, and I felt obliged to rate 1/10.
