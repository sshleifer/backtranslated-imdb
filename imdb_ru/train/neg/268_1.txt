1 Why can everyone perfectly understand each other without devices such as universal translators or microbe translators? Did the creators of this show realize that people who were taken from different corners of the earth at different times (Attilla’s Huns were not contemporary with the ancient Hellenistic culture, and the Vikings were not contemporary with the builders of the pyramids) spoke different languages? and will never be able to develop a language so similar to modern English (with the exception of declensions that they “do not use”) that were influenced by Latin, ancient Greek, Danish and French? <br /> <br /> 2 Cultural differences cannot be overcome so easily, trust must be won, but wherever the team goes, they are welcomed without any suspicion and begin to command people as if they are their designated leaders. Of course, real fans will comment that they are perceived as gods. The people they meet must be shocked by their technology and accuse them of witchcraft, etc. <br /> <br /> 3 Historical reference: no. Visually, it may vaguely remind you of Greek or Viking culture, but anyone can get dressed in a tablecloth or run to the local costume rental for a plastic helmet with horns and say that you look like a part. The theater group of a small town probably has the best requisites. <br /> <br /> 4 Bored! Another lame production in Kanuka, which for inexplicable reasons lasted ten long years. As children's shows show, he could get a rating, but anyone who knows a little about human behavior and language could not even watch the first twelve episodes of the first season, as I just did. I really wanted to believe that I had found a decent science fiction show, otherwise I would have closed it and cleaned my computer from this shelter in the first five minutes!
