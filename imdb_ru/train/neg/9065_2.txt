About halfway through, I realized that these characters were indifferent to me; However, I still looked a bit more. Unfortunately, I came back the next day and finished. I shouldn't have bothered. <br /> <br /> If you know * anything * about the film in advance, you know that the main character will be a plane crash survivor - and the title gives you a pretty good idea of ​​what happens next - he will call and call this people! It was almost as bad as Snake on a Plane (another bad movie with a plane crash). <br /> <br /> I understand that this is an old film, and the style of play in those days was much less naturalistic than today. But even by these standards, acting was embarrassing. These were not characters, but stereotypes. I suspect that this film was primarily an attempt by Bette Davis to help her husband's career (Gary Merrill). But to no avail - I saw that oaks show more sincere emotions than he. <br /> <br /> Davis playing a happy cripple (that is, an ugly role) was probably considered a harsh and bold career move. It was not that just boring. She was kind of Tiny Tim in the film, forcing Trask (Merrill's character) to see the truth about love and forgiveness (although she was less attractive than Tiny Tim), quietly distributing wisdom about life and relationships without a hint that her beloved husband had just died. <br /> <br /> The last scene, when Trask calls his wife back to Iowa to be reconciled, was so affected and over-disassembled at both ends of the telephone line that I almost cringed. I had to remind myself that these people were actually paid for what they did in this film. <br /> <br /> I noticed that many people like this movie. If you found it inspiring, that's great. But honestly, I just found it bad. There are many old films from the Golden Age of Hollywood that were much better written and played.
