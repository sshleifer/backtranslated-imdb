This movie is all flash and without a soul. Actors attach great importance to numbers, but these figures are often not related to the film and resemble individual music videos. And no effort was made to make the rooms sound as if they were happening right in front of you, each one sounds as if they come from the studio, essentially sucking the whole life out of the songs. Behind the scenes, all the performances were boring and unrealized, especially Hudson, who, in essence, plays the same evil, “strong” (she is stubborn and selfish) black woman we have seen before. There was neither depth nor other female characters in her character. Although I think the film wants us to believe that the heroine Hudson faces difficulties because of her weight, in fact it is her own refusal to do what is best for the team that gives her trouble, making the end of the film completely meaningless. The Hudson Academy Award is a joke, there was no excuse. When she sang, she expressed emotions (although it was often inappropriate, but it was the author’s / director’s mistake), but when she just played, she didn’t do anything to flesh out the already signed character. Eddie Murphy's character is the only one that has an arc, and he did a great job, but is still not worthy of an Oscar. The only actor who really brought something into play was Danny Glover, who took a small, relatively unimportant character and made something real out of it. There is nothing here for which one could plunge, neither drama, nor heart, nor even laughter. The arrangement of musical numbers was so bad that at times it seemed that the film almost laughs at musicals; the number, when Hudson argues with other girls, is so prolonged if it could reach a parody of a family guy. The film has no idea what it is about, and the last few minutes have hurt me. This is a big, boring waste of time, and in fact this is the worst film I saw in 2006, and nothing really was stellar last year from the very beginning.
