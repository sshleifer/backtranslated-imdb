Wow, man, this was definitely one of the worst films I've seen all summer. Of course, it was on Sci Fi, and I watch Sci Fi a little, but, man, Iâ€™ll tell you about the thinnest plot and two-dimensional characters to the maximum. <br /> <br /> The characters were stereotypical and overdone, the plot and setting were incredible, the vampires were less frightening, more funny looking, the blood was not needed, the special effects were terrible, and the end? Well, the only thing that was unpredictable in the final was when suddenly the girl became a lesbian and started doing it with a female vampire, which, by the way, is not so hot, considering that it happens for about three seconds, during which you are closer to "What the hell is?" then "Man, this is hot." If it ever appears in replays, God forbid, DO NOT LOOK.
