This should be one of the worst fillers I've ever seen, and I have seen a few. He is slow, boring, amateurish - not even conforming to his own simplified reading of the plot. Actors do not act. I cannot blame them â€” they were given a scenario of such complete banality; all they can do is to go through them with pain behind the eyes, which has nothing to do with the evil that happens in Summersail. <br /> <br /> In this film there is not a single moment that rings true, neither an honest line, not a single moment when a person moves. The character of Nicolas Cage is so poorly drawn that he does not feel the slightest compassion for him through all his adversities. I have no doubt that I saw a suffering man there, but it was Nicholas Cage, fully aware of the fact that he was in the worst movie in his entire career.
