Collusion The course is even worse than the typical movie of the week "evil white male corporate capitalist". This film is less pleasant than toothache. Jay Leno can act. He is good at his misunderstood debut film Silver Bears, in which he gives an idea consisting of the demands of his character. This film is so bad character Leno, a sanctimonious jester, less annoying than Moritaâ€™s character, a sanctimonious fool.
