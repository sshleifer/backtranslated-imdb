Now is it not? Taking into account all the good work done by Danzel, Clive and Jodie, the film never turned into something more than just a horrible movie imitator. Yes, a couple of jokes, there are absolutely no unpredictable turns, to be honest, there are only unpredictable moments, because the director and editor made some silly mistakes, for them it is a shame and a waste of time for us. If someone can tell me why on earth they dug a hole inside this safe, who the hell is the Rebbe, and how the hell did they find out that the diamonds were in a particular chamber, it could just make my day, but it seems that Spike asks us to take too many things in this film for granted and not to raise our eyebrows when something looks stupid ... it's just another film on a studio contract to relax and enjoy ...
