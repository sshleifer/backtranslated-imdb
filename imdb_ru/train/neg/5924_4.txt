Diana Muldaur appears on Star Trek a second time, but this time as another character. No one aboard seems to notice - perhaps it was hair. Despite this, this time she is not a container for God (see previous episode), but a very famous woman with magical abilities that allow her to communicate and see Meduzana without going crazy (the standard human response). Unfortunately, the person who loves her most is a few cards smaller than a full deck, and he is trying to kill Ambassador Medusa (who, oddly enough, lives in a small box is a lousy way to travel). And, unfortunately, Muldair is not so well shook. What happens next looks pretty silly, and by the time the episode ended, when I first saw it, I felt a lot of relief. Watching all the people on board go against the Maldavr was pretty silly, and Spock's game, when he went insane for a while, was quite polite. Do yourself a favor - if you have not seen the show before, choose another episode.
