Let me briefly tell you about the movie: a rotten, rude child named Max stumbles upon a radio that has Kazaam: a rap genie. Like all genies, he fulfills 3 wishes, but, being good-natured, also helps Max in his personal life, as he has to deal with hooligans and his father, involved in organized crime. During all this, Kazaam knocks from time to time (also demonstrating Shak's dark wack skills). <br /> <br /> This film proves what we all know: athletes must play sports. I admit that he never looked like an Oscar-worthy film, but EVERYTHING about this film waste is terrible. The characters are either unattractive or stupid, the plot is not even worth mentioning, the dialogue is a joke, and Shaq is only a quarter of the problem. Hell, even if Denzel Washington played Kazaam, this movie would still be a joke. I know that the film attracted everyone because Shaq was so big (without puns) at the time. I honestly can not think of a single positive word about this waste of time. Shaq had to spend the time spent making this film to make free throws.
