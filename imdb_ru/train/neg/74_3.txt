They designed this film as a kind of fantasy “The Man from the Snowy River” meets Buch Cassidy and the child Sundance, and for the romantic touch of Ned and Joe can play with high-class talent, the bored young wives of rich older men. Well, there are many myths about Ned Kelly, but there are also many well-documented facts that still leave room for artistic creation in creating good historical drama. I mean, this is not a story about Robin Hood, not legends about Arthur, not Beowulf, not one whose life is so shrouded in mists of many centuries past that any re-creation of their life and times is 99% of guesswork. It's only a couple of lives back. My grandparents were already at school age when Ned was hanged. <br /> <br /> So stupid that I imagine that this film is a serious attempt to tell the story of Kelly. Recently, after reading Peter Cary's excellent novel The True Story of the Kelly Gang, I was looking forward to it in the same vein. But no, the fact is that Kelly of the 1970s, which Mick Jagger mocked the film, was probably much closer to reality, and the best film in general, which does not say much. <br /> <br /> Glad it cost me only two dollars to rent a DVD! I'll give him 3/10, and that's just because some of the good shots of the Australian bush make me feel generous.
