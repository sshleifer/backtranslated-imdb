As for the HEIST films, this film is rather weak. Continuity is pretty disgusting, not enough character continuity to really feel that you understand any of the characters. Peter Falk is great, and he is one of the reasons worth seeing. Falk has great features, such as “he will be back soon, he will go buy some sagas” or something like that ... there are some good scenes, although they are completely connected with the efforts of the actors. Direction, script, and editing are pretty lousy.
