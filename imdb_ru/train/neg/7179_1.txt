No matter how well he understands his “message” - this film - a terribly made train wreck - a terrible acting game, poor cinematography - I don't know why Carr agreed to try to remove his stutter - he was lousy in that. You watch the statistics on the DVD, and the way he has the camera follows him — he just absorbs it — he likes being in the spotlight. He is a bad actor - he reminds me of another arrogant director - Eric Schaffer. Approximately the way Carr showed this film in the urban youth centers and churches of New Age — where the damaged people, looking for reinforcements and attention, themselves chatted about how the film touched them and perhaps it was so — but the film itself He is intermittent, predictable and juicy.
