This should be the coolest TV show on the air. This is probably the salvation for Jim Belushi and all his bad films. His brother sucked all the talent, he is the younger brother. I hope this show is canceled, and they never talk about it, except in negative use. Jim has to resign or something. Please release them from the air. If I'm joking here from this show, I will throw up and wash my eyes with a toothbrush. It is better to be taken away from the devil himself than to watch this piece of programming for half an hour. I still do not understand why the show is still on the air and running. Deep down, we all know that we want to shoot TV screens when we see Jim's face. In conclusion, no more, please.
