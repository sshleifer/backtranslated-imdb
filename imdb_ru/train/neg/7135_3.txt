I'm sorry to say that, in my opinion, there really is no way Enzo could really keep up with the Saleen S7 Twin Turbo. The advantage of the S7 in weight would be too great. The S7 has a power-to-weight ratio of 3.93 lbs / hp, while the Enzo has 4.61 lbs / hp. The low end of the S7s is also much better. Sorry Ferrari fans, but Saleen does so much better. <br /> <br /> As for the other parts of this film, I just have to say that it is so low-quality that it can be pathetic. The story is too weak. The action of this lemon is worse than day soap. <br /> <br /> I can say that, since this is a treatise on negative psychology, it is a kind of gem. This film is nothing but an explicit definition of what narcissism and sociopathy are. The fact is that these rich punks take off their stones, showing only traces of feigned remorse for all innocent road users, whom they also cause injury or death. <br /> <br /> I can't give the movie “1 Star” a rating because it didn’t make me actually leave the theater. I also think that having an amazingly beautiful brunette with deadly blue eyes as the leading girl will save her from complete horror ... although her singing will not put her on the cover of "Variety" in any way. <br /> ps: the guy who plays Jason, this is sooooo, the James Vanderbick version of the alien.
