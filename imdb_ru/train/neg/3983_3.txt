Irene Dunne ended her outstanding career in this film. She had to go out with a bang, being the class actress she was, not in this unforgettable, almost unknown film. <br /> <br /> This light comedy is fine, but nothing special. The first half of this is much better, as it becomes rather silly in the second half. Perhaps Irene will see the handwriting on the wall and leave. Even her high voice became a bit annoying here. Rumor has it that she was not happy with this film. You can understand why. <br /> <br /> The story reminded me of a television comedy from the 1950s. Speaking about this, I thought that David Nelson from the Ozzy and Harriet series was filmed in this film, but it turned out to be a very young Richard Crenna. He looked and sounded just like Nelson. <br /> <br /> In general, so-so, at best, and the final is not up to par for a great actress.
