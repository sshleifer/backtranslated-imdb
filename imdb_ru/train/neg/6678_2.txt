This is a copy of the classic 1948 Doris Day novel Romance on the High Seas. <br /> <br /> The storyline is more or less the same, but modern. Govinda plays a witty guy who replaces her husband on a trip. For now, Rani plays a friend's college wife who provides her the same service. They are supposedly trying to catch each other, while the actual husband and wife are trying to stumble in Bombay. <br /> <br /> On a trip, Govinda takes another girl for his wife Sanjiva and spies on her, falling in love with her. the delightful rani. <br /> <br /> The lever plays the dual role of father and son, both lawyers specializing in the divorce proceedings. They fight each other for the sake of a warring couple. <br /> <br /> This is a bad attempt to copy the original classics, and the songs are very terrible. A comedy slap in the face and not make laugh too much.
