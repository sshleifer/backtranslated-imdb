The cover on the DVD and the disc is uncontrolled awesome, do you think they made a sweet film of twisted black metal, which is still a really great idea, but the actors of this film are the worst, then Ben's performance in Pearl Harbor, porn-x have best quality and best actors. I was going to buy a DVD, but, fortunately, I first rented it, the plot and the script are terrible too, it seems nothing works, so the film really never makes sense. Bad attempts to scare you, using scenes of memories, are worse than those used in the TV shows of the 80s, and in the end you do not want to beat your head against the wall of your house.
