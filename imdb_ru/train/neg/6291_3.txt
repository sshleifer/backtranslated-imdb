Now I recently had the pleasure of watching a funny comedy from the Bachelor Party, one of my new favorite comedies, laughed until it hurt movie types. So I, naturally, wanted to see the sequel, hoping that it would be the same laugh, but instead Bachelor Party 2: The Last Temptation was made by a generation of American pies, where it tastes bad and wins a hole in the first film. Yes, in the first film there is nudity, but it is not shown in every scene. In addition, the plot is exactly the same from the first time, this is not always a complaint with me, but it could have been a little more original. The only thing I'm glad is that in this film, at least, there are no old actors from the original, because that would be stupid or really stupid. <br /> <br /> Ron and Melinda are engaged, only after 2 months of dating, everything is against. Melinda has a rich family, but they are very pleased with Ron, and Melinda's brother Todd is afraid that Ron will take him to work. So they went to a bachelor party for the weekend in Miami, and Todd would make sure he captured Ron in a picture that would make Melinda change his mind about marriage. <br /> <br /> Bachelor Party 2: The Last Temptation has a couple of laughter here and there, but in general is not able to give what the first film has achieved. These guys, Ron's friends, were more unpleasant than cute, except for Seth, he was pretty funny. The only nice characters, except for Set, are Ron and Melinda, all the rest more or less get on your nerves. Want to watch this movie? Just watch Girls Gone Wild, it's the same, just don't try to pretend it's a movie. Stick to the original Bachelor party, this film will make you cry with laughter. <br /> <br /> 3/10
