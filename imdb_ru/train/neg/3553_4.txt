Incubus is a combination of good (interesting murder mystery), bad (cut off script, careless resolution, poorly performed attack scenes) and strange (strong incestuous overtone, strangely sleepy and tough John Cassavetes performance - was that really what the character was " crazy "?). Not as offensive as expected, but not particularly successful. (* 1/2)
