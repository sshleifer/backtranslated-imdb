This film is similar to the thousands of cat and mouse films that preceded it. (The following may look like a spoiler, but in fact it just describes a large class of films.) There is a passionate, wise protagonist, his stupid, but well-intentioned friend with his unsuccessful attempts at humorous comments, initially hostile but soon stifled a gorgeous lady who causes an inevitable "unlikely" love story, loved ones taken hostage, and, of course, an unwary evil opponent with their cruel minions. Everyone has already seen tons of these films, and “The Treasure of the Nation” looks like any of them, with only slightly modified packaging. Every turn of the story was easily predictable (and I can assure you that I am not the sharpest tool in the barn). I am very tired to feel deceived after leaving the theater from a Hollywood film, and if you have ever felt this too, listen to my warning; stay away from this movie.
