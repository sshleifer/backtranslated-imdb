The acting was weak, but terrified, I can live with it if the story is good. It was not The original event was an awkward and obvious trick to use the adoration of most people by the children. Good. Fast forward to the “place outside the city” where they will be emotionally restored. I like the revelation of ghosts. Well, cool - it will be a supernatural horror story, with rotting, partly in our world, partly in ... anywhere. Then the action begins to pull like a three-headed dog in a stream of cats and birds. Is there an evil force trying to attack them directly? Is there evil power trying to attack them indirectly - forcing people to do terrible things that they really do not do? Oh, wait, no, maybe the whole REGION is a kind of psycho-echo chamber in which a vague dissonance can turn into murder? Well, wait - maybe it's just one little mentally tangled boy in the style of "Delbert" who misses his mommy and has fun like K-Tel Norman Bates? Oh, yes - extra points: the only black character, it seems, is the grandson of the porter "Our Gang". The actor plays it as straight as he can, given the rough dialogue, but in fact his goal is to say: “Everything is ready, get you, boss!” At least they wrote him smart enough for GTF cleaned up there. The beat with the little girl who was silenced and moved away was definitely creepy, just like a chick in the shower. These are just two of several really tasty tidbits in this film. The problem is that they combine in disharmonious relationships, for example, a slice of steak, a piece of chocolate and a slice of Gummi bear. Everybody's great on his own, but confused? Bleah! Such a potential. Wasted.
