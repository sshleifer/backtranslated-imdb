This film is so, so terrible, that the angels lose their wings. Shaq tried to do other crossovers, for example, his work in “Shaq-Fu” for NES and his many intolerable rap albums, and later an epic performance of the awful filmmaking that is Steel. <br /> <br /> No good can be said about this movie. I have seen it many times when I was very young, but I must have been an idiot then, because this film takes everything pleasant in the films and tears it apart. It's fun to mock. I saw it on the Disney channel some time ago and spent a few minutes doing it. Although after the thrill began, you are still stunned by his horror. <br /> <br /> If you see him on TV, try the following: when watching a movie, consider removing from it all the scenes in which Shaq uses his gin magic abilities. If you do, it will be like a film about a pedophile chasing a child and knocking to seduce him. This is quite funny and disturbing. <br /> <br /> A terrible example of a movie. Not if you don't want to laugh at it, watch this movie.
