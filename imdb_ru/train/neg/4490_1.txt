The man expected that the film was shot with approx. A budget of $ 300,000,000 should at least entertain you for the time you actually spend in a movie theater watching a movie. Matrix Reloaded proves that this assumption is wrong. <br /> <br /> The Matrix worked better, despite the presence of obvious gaps in the logic of history. At least, no one could explain to me why beating a bot (it’s an agent) in a simulation (aka martix) could somehow damage a responsible computer program ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Wachowski brothers they did everything right, this “beating of the agent”, the main thing in “The Matrix: Reboot”: this is o-frame. These battle scenes can be worked out enough (or even cool) in 5 seconds. the trailer, but lingering for several minutes, apparently forged, poorly set and repeated over and over, is nothing more than boring. Despite the vision of the promised tricks, there is nothing but a simple poor-quality, unimaginable beating, which we have already seen (or better not), for example. Van Damme "movies." The difference in post-production (air is 5 times faster, the camera floats a lot and hangs on certain scenes, and this repeats for at least 5 minutes) does not help here, all this has nothing to do with the very meaning of "martial arts". In addition to these "fights", all the actors refuse to do what they are paid for: acting. <br /> <br /> What happened besides the fight scenes? Little, except for the Hollywood routine. This very multicultural group of hippies who suck at the Waterworld is being processed as a citizen of Zion (the last city on earth), and they start dancing on Morpheus’s orders, because this is a good opportunity to show a lot of barely covered boobs and butts. A very popular cliché of French frogs speaking to this blunt accent “je ne sais quoi”, which wastes its fortune because of “liason d'amour”. After this (and undesirablely funny), there is a struggle between Neo and the sinister followers of the "frog", as it happens in Erroy Flynn, an enterieur-like, fortunately, with many melee weapons for decoration. For Neo, who is posing with a frost, just add 2 ladders and a lot of statues (to be destroyed, thrown at evil guys and the like), and you will get 5 more meaningless, boring mines. this junk. <br /> <br /> What to expect? Normal hell merchandising. And the "revolutions" that will occur or not - of course, without me.
