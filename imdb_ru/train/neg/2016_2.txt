***** Warning: may contain SPOILERS ********* My huge problem with this film is how selfish and selfish the woman is the adulterer !! After one night with a mucous psycho she is pursued by him. He constantly calls her, threatens her, and even sends a video of their joint night. He is VERY crazy and very dangerous. The problem is that she only thinks that he is dangerous for her (and reveals her secret). Not for a second did it occur to her to care for her husband! She even thought for a moment that he might be in danger from this psychotic? As soon as she understood how psychic he was, she had to warn her husband, whatever the consequences. Maybe then there would be no film, but in fact it was not, so what's the difference?
