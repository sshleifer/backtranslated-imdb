The Japanese sense of rhythm, editing, and music should be different from the taste of Americans, but surely this film could have been a lot more with a bit more post-production. <br /> <br /> Someone in Hollywood should make this film, and I think it will be a great success. The story is interesting and terrible. There is something about the outskirts of the city, sand police, earthquakes, sanatoriums and the mysterious salt water killings, which are enough to be charming. However, this story should make little sense and perhaps be about 40 minutes shorter. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the “sixth sense” effect was in full force in this film, and it was obvious from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> In its current form, only boring Japanese movie lovers should watch this boring movie.
