I just went through one episode (Crouch End). The dialogue was raised and adequately lowered. The game was tragic. Aion Bailey, despite all his attempts to be dramatic, remains mostly without expression. His eyebrows hint at the recent Botox treatment. Claire Forlani could just as easily play a girl in distress in a silent film. The characters were caricatures, each of which played its own stereotypical cog on the plot, mostly a random, wandering plot. Cheesy special effects can be justified, given the budget of the mini-series. But attempts to create uncertainty and surprise through distracting cinema have added to stealth. I have a feeling that the ending should have been witty and amazing, but it was unconvincing and had little to do with the rest of the story. If I had to compare its overall quality with something else, I would put this episode of “Nightmares and Dreams” along with “Hercules” on NBC.
