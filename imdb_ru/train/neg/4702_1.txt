I hate this movie. I hate the show. I hate almost everything about it. it is so annoying and stupid. everyone says that nat and alex wolff are heroes in the music world, and that they are going to make it big. What types of drugs do you take ??? !!!?!?!?!?! nat and alex will eventually become either strollers or like Jane Hudson from “What happened to Baby Jane?”. I was able to pass only 20 minutes, only 30 seconds of the show, and I managed to survive for about half an hour of the “Battle of the Groups”. How someone can cheer on these guys in the audience at the Kid's Choice Awards, I have no idea. A few days before the premiere of the film about Nick, most of the young actress-actors about Nick (Jamie Spears, Emma Roberts, Lindsay Shaw, etc.) appeared in advertisements that are affected by mentally retarded children about how cool Nat and Alex Wolf are. firstly, they did not deceive me, and secondly, nat and alex probably either pumped them up or paid them a lot of money to say it and sound convincing, because I don’t understand how someone could find This show / movie is entertaining. the music is simply awful singing Nata sounds like a sick, dying elk on a crack. Alex is the most annoying movie / TV show character. he is not funny, he is annoying, he is really strange, and he thinks that he is hot and knows everything about girls. This guy is lucky if he ever manages to meet. You know that this show is fake, when you learn that some of the characters (in real life) do not even exist !! Jesse's character actually plays Nat and cousin Alex Draser (they must have had some budget problems). Their father is not alone, he is married to Polly Draper, but she does not appear in the series, so it seems that Wolf does not have a mother. Rosaline does not exist either. Her name is Ellie DiMeko. I will tell you that the Nude Brothers will be in deep shock when their “fans” know that all this is organized. 0/10
