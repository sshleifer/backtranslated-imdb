Salvage is the worst horror movie I've ever seen. There is nothing terrible about it. It does not deserve to be in the genre so well. First of all, I don’t understand how many people might think that this piece of shit is such a wonderful movie. If I had written something as boring and utterly ridiculous as this, I would have laughed and was too embarrassed to expose others to stupidity. Second: the acting is terrible, and the leading actress is painfully ugly. Third: the story sucks, it was used before, and the excuse that this is a cheap film is not an excuse. Read the summer presentation on the back of the case, it reveals the whole story. I do not recommend you watch this movie if you don’t have 80 minutes to waste time on something that makes you regret having watched it. I feel really bad about these scammers and the irony of their name. Greetings to Anthony Perkins !!!!!!!!!
