I really do not leave comments, but wanted to make sure to warn people of this film. This is an unfinished student film without any expiatory traits. At the technical level, it is completely amateur - constant, unintended changes of jumps in scenes, wild dubbing, etc. The plot is completely stripped, the structure is ridiculous, and the actions are confusing. I don't want to be too harsh: I made my share of student films, and they were all terrible, but there is no reason for this film to appear in a world where innocent fans will have to see it. /> <br /> The safe assumption is that - like the actors - the positive reviews are directors, friends and family.
