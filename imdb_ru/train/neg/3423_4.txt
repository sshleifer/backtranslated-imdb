This is the typical soft sex joke of the 70s in the Russ Meyer genre, although perhaps less outlandish than some of Meyer’s works. This film has higher "production values" than many of his contemporaries, which implies a larger budget. This is the plot, spelling and action right from Zone B, though. Recently, this film has become the basis of B movie channels (such as “Drive In Classics”) in the universe of 500 channels. If you are tuned to a soft core, it’s as good as everything else in the B range. Don't expect Polanski, though, Sarno is just Sarno. No more, no less. Presentation of Jennifer Wells in the role of "mother", perhaps the best of the cast. It is not surprising that none of the actors in the film gained great fame. Confessions of a young American housewife are by no means the worst example of this kind. It is watchable if this is your movie type. 30 years ago it would be an avant-garde and risky film. On these days and in prime time, you can see more or less similar things on the Showtime / HBO series.
