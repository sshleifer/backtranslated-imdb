I wrote here a few notes about FIRST POWER, about the satanic serial killer of yuppie in 1990, Lou Lambada Diamond Phillips, the infernal festival yuppi ... <br /> <br /> 1) Lou Diamond Phillips was recently charged with beating his wife and may serve time in prison. I only hope that he will manage to find stylish Armani prison clothes: one of the guilty pleasures of this film is to see his police detective dressed in designer coats for $ 4,500, designer silk suit for $ 7,300 and see him in Los Angeles for $ 3,500 month. bachelor pillow with interior design from Mies Van Der Roeh. <br /> <br /> 2) The leading lady Tracy Phillips has gorgeous porcelain skin, loose red hair that always looks stylish, even when it is muscular, and amazing high-lit breasts in the second half of the film is an author’s silk pullover, which Unfortunately, it remains in place over her torso, even when she was preparing to be sacrificed to Satan. At least in the 1970s, our demonic killers stripped their victims before ending them, although there is something that can be said to leave a little imagination. By the last 10 minutes of the film, I could only think about what her breasts would look like. <br /> <br /> 3) Professional psychics living in Los Angeles can afford $ 4 million apartments on Mallholland Drive overlooking Los Angeles with a goal that will make Brad Pitt decide that he is rough. In fact, the condominium used in this film looks exactly like the one we saw in the David Lynch film MULLHOLLAND DR. Which, at least, made sense to make it the residence of a successful film director. The only Professional Psychics I encountered outside of this film are currently all serving prison sentences for fraud. <br /> <br /> 4) I forgot his name, but the villain in this film is wonderful, and his "How are you" ', Buddy Boy? "the line could have been a better missed phrase of the film, since" THANK YOU FOR RIDING, LADY !! "from CREEPSHOW 2. <br /> <br /> 5) Under big cities there are huge vats of boiling acid that explode into huge fiery balls, if someone throws a Zippo lighter at them, so all large public water supply plants have no signs of smoking on them, although the idea of ​​smoking around the water is dangerous, of course, ridiculous. And since Zippo lighters need to be filled manually with lighter fluid, which can often flow and be absorbed by one Well, the idea of ​​wearing them in the pocket of your Gucci silk suit for $ 7300 seems much more dangerous to me. <Br /> <br /> 6) The tricks in this film are at least impressive, and one of the fun things about viewing is to be yourself, that you do not watch special computer special effects, but simply stuntmen who risk their lives and health to contribute to the film, which received an almost universal BOMB rating from critics when it is released. <br /> <br /> 7) The film’s Satanists always surprise me: here’s the guy who accepted the Luciferian stake for power, and yet instead of using it to do something useful, for example, by making yourself rich or forcing fashion designers to have free-form sex with him, instead he owns handbags and makes them levitate outside of people's apartments. By the way, about a guy who is indestructible, able to fly and able to put his being in the bodies of other people - and yet he commits the star Lou Diamond Phillips with the usual fist fight in the conclusion of the film, but it doesn’t make sense to populate Arnold Schwarznegar or Apollo Cred to won. <br /> <br /> And so on and on ... To look in the company of wise friends who drink beer. You will have fun until you firmly refuse to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> 4/10
