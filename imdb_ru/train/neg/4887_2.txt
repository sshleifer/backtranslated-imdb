The first movie is pretty good. This is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Recycles a lot of material (including opening credits and final title) from the movie "Criminally Insane". New footage shot on video, really look bad. Scenes lack proper lighting, the sound is sometimes barely audible, there are even video glitches, such as image twisting, etc. <br /> <br /> Like all bad sequels, basically it just repeats the story of the first. Ethel kills everyone who shares her living space, often for reasons related to the fact that they prevent her from getting the food she wants. <br /> <br /> At least, this is only an additional DVD movie for the first one, which also includes the same directorial film “Black Wedding of Satan”. It is a pity that this does not apply to the films "Nurse of Death."
