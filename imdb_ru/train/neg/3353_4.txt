A pretty bad movie doesn't offer anything new. The usual squeaks and groans are trying to make up for a confusing, but subtle story. Acting hardly above the pitiful. Why Liam Neeson subscribed to this can only be guessed at. Owen Wilson really turns into one of the worst performances in recent horror film history. Catherine Zeta-Jones is interesting to watch, and much more, although Lily Tayor did a job above average. The special effects were quite memorable, and the house itself was exciting and stunningly beautiful. However, they cannot make up for a bad acting and plot line, which seems to be folded at the last minute. Do not worry
