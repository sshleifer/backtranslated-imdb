A group of friends meets face to face with a family of disgusting cannibals during a campaign in the beautiful German countryside. <br /> <br /> The concept of a mutant family-cannibal is almost as old as the hills inhabited by inbred freaks. they often call home, so any director who is trying to breathe new life into the genre must come up with something damn special to make an impression. With the help of Barricade, Timo Rose is trying to give a well-worn routine to the Teutonic turn, transferring the action to the Black Forest and giving him a German low-budget spray treatment. The result is a very bloody, but completely unoriginal effort, which is made almost imperceptible thanks to some terrible directorial decisions, in particular, the continuous use of fancy filters and annoying editing methods. <br /> <br /> Timo Rose didnâ€™t dare to use every cheeky trick that his editing software offered him, then the Barricade could be a pretty interesting blood game: his inexperienced cast made it up pretty well; bloody effects - respectively, abdominal agitation; and there is one or two fears and even some well thought out scary moments. All of this, however, has been completely destroyed by the terrible cinematography, the volatile editing and the overwhelming flow of visual tricks used to make the film look distressed, which is so inexplicably popular with modern filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I give the Barricade 3 out of 10 exclusively for outlandish blood, which includes an elegant scene in which a guy is forced to drink acid, a lot of unpleasant wounds caused by various sharp objects, and a pretty decent damage to the shotgun.
