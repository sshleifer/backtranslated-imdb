I have seen this film several times at various short festivals, and I always get the impression that I have seen the trailer for the film! <br /> <br /> For school, the film is very well made and directed, but the story ... well, you need something else to become a big and interesting film. The character named Tim Watcher needed a deep approach. This is what is missing in some Portuguese short films - the script is always superficial. <br /> <br /> But still ... I liked this movie ... <br /> <br /> Parabens! (congratulations!)
