At first I was convinced that it was a television film that did not deserve prime time. But after a few minutes of dumbfounded trembling, I realized that in super-stunts and acting films there is at least a comic value. This film would get 1 if my wife and I did not laugh as much as we watched him with surprise, that the actors could keep their character calm. It was like a less funny spy version of The Big Hit (I laughed so much that I actually bought the Big Hit DVD) with an even worse acting game. We were disappointed that Nick decided to marry Elena, and not Jim, after all the hugs and fives. A few rums and cokes will definitely make it easier to get down
