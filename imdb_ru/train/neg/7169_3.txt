This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. However, the little slave, Alice and Jared Harris, imitating Christopher Walken, makes this movie interesting. Alice's smoking, drunkenness, and strange way of appearing when her name is strange and interesting. I have to applaud Jared for his imitation of Christopher Walken and Christopher Walken for allowing him to be in the movies.
