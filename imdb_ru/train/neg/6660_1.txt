Seriously, the fact that this show is so popular is simply amazing. This show is not funny, not clever, not original, but just a steaming pile of crap. Let me start with the characters. All characters are one-dimensional morons with loud, exaggerated voices that just sound like nails on the board. The voice acting could be better. Then there is the animation. MY GOD, it only hurts me to look at that. Everything is too flat, too spicy, too bright and too covered in candy. Then there is humor or lack of it. This is completely idiotic! They just take the B-rank jokes that are not even so funny, and then repeat them to death. They also add some meaningless little humor that makes me sick. And finally, the last and last, music. It is just annoying. It seems that he was compiled on the computer of the child and does not cause any emotions. I wish there was a score below 1, really. This show seriously needs to be canceled. This is a show that I try to avoid like the plague. Whenever I hear a song, I turn off the TV immediately. If you have never watched this show, then do not. Watch quality programs such as The Simpsons or Futurama.
