It was probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life !! It was stupid that there was no plot, and the special effects were ridiculous !! And I have never seen such a bad game in my life! The only good part about the movie is all the hot guys (especially Drew Fuller). I do not know what these people were thinking when they made this film !! I didnâ€™t even want to end it all, because you were in that moment of the movie where all the guys in bed are touching themselves. I mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted girl porn! I would advise everyone who heard about this film and wanted to watch it, just forget about it and find another movie to watch! I was very disappointed !! The whole film, in my opinion, was a waste of time.
