This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Worse than the most disgusting American dross; worse Glitter - Mariah Carey in the American dross for the most part. I can only imagine that the writer and producer took a lot of recreational pharmaceuticals, and when discussing the plot I really thought it was a good idea. is not. This is disgusting garbage from the very depths of Satan himself (who would probably have written the best script if he paid attention to it). Robert Jones as Exce Producer, spending our taxpayers' money (lottery money) on this nonsense, should be responsible. Who on earth thought it would be a good idea to remake Deathline ??? I ask you - the camp under the tree, the Death Line ... "Remember the doors" is a classic of a really bad British film, we really do not need a reminder. And we, of course, do not need a bad, second-rate, poorly composed script, poorly developed and poorly similar garbage. All this from a British financial agency that brought us Sex Lives of the Potato Men ... I calm my business. <br /> <br /> Don't pay ANY money to see this. This is absolute and complete nonsense - the only grace for the producers is that they got a lot of money ... our money ... for making it. They must bow their heads in shame. <br /> <br /> I am amazed at the low and low standard of this film. It seems to me that our national cinema support agency really thought it was worth supporting. The British film industry has no hope while the idiots are leading the show. Harvey Vinstein, where are you? Come back, we forgive you !!!
