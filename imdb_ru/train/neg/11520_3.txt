I didnâ€™t like this movie at all. First, I just found it rude and vulgar, for no reason. I also felt that he was misogynist (against women). In addition, the film is really not about anything, and I did not find any of the characters cute. in fact, it seems there is no point in all this. maybe I am missing something, but for me this film is a waste of time when I could do something more productive and enjoyable. For example, use my face as a cushion for pins. There are James Garner, as well as C. Thomas Howell, Shirley Jones and James Cromwell. Everything here is in vain, and I am sure it was a low point in each of their respective careers. Jenny Harrison (from Three's later years) is also in the film, and it's nice to see her not ditsy. But beyond that, she can 'above the average mediocre scenario. For me, the Tank - 3/10
