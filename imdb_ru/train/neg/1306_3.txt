(aka: DEMONS III) <br /> <br /> Made for Italian television, although filmed in English and has never been a continuation of earlier DEMONS films. He was supposed to be called simply “Ogre,” as directed by director Lamberto Bava. <br /> <br /> American family rents an Italian villa for the summer. A woman (Virginia Bryant) constantly dreams that, as a little girl, she goes down to the old wine cellar of this villa and comes across a cocoon-like structure hanging from the ceiling. It glows and is covered in cobwebs and has legs of a spider or insect hanging from it. Green paint drips from it. <br /> <br /> Of course, the husband does not believe in it. Willa is just old, she squeaks and makes strange sounds in the middle of the night, and she should just ignore her. <br /> <br /> But then OGRE itself appears in something like a 16th century suit, with what it looks like a wolf’s head is attached to it, and is attracted by the smell of orchids. <br /> <br /> Films are not so bad, and at least the dialogue is half intelligent without the ridiculous clumsy phrases that dubbing will bring, There is no real blood except skeletons rotting in the basement pond that really looks like the bottom of the modern pool. OGRE itself just disappears after being hit by a Cherokee family jeep. <br /> <br /> The copy of the Shriek DVD I watched was faulty because the image turned black for about half an hour in the film for a few seconds, and I hope Shrik has fixed it since then. Additionally include a short interview with Lamberto Bava, where he explains that this is not a sequel, and so on. D. And so on. And also some trailers for other Shriek DVD releases. These are pretty standard stuff. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 <br /> <br />
