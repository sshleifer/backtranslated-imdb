I loved the Batman series and was looking forward to it. But they tried to do too much. <br /> <br /> Why did they have the story of Adam West and Burt Ward trying to find a Batmobile, I could not afford. I do not want to beat out Burt or Adam for the way they look now ... It has been 35 years since they appeared in Batman and Robin, but seeing them dressed in full dress and fighting with the bad guys was pretty sad. I would prefer that the former stars just make a comment. The Batmobile story was stupid. <br /> <br /> As for the memories of the film, I think it was too short and too big. It was just a quick overview, in my opinion. I would like more background. They showed Penguin and Joker for about a minute to tell the same thing that I already knew. Joker had a mustache under his makeup, and the penguin had to smoke, even though he hated him and was a former smoker. It was on those 2. <br /> <br /> I would like to read the book. I am sure there is more to this than that. For example, why were there 2 Riddlers or 3 Catwoman's or 3 Mister Freezes. Where was Commissioner Gordon, Chef Ogara, Alfred, Mr. Freese, King Tut, etc. The list goes on. As I said, even those who were in this were hardly in it. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing. And really trite.
