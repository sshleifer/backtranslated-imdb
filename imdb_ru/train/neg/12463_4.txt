OK, Hollywood is not liberal. <br /> <br /> Obviously, I am lying because it is. I am a conservative, but the policy that I leave out of my opinion about the film. This film was anti-Bush, anti-Middle East, anti-big oil propaganda, but this is not why it was bad. <br /> <br /> First, I will pay tribute to where the merit. I saw this film at the premiere, because I like such films, and I am a political scientist specializing in collages. The cinematography was excellent, and as far as I could tell, the acting was very good. <br /> <br /> However, the plot could not be deciphered. I was tested and I have an IQ of 138, but no matter how hard I tried, I could not put together the plot line of the film and what characters where did it. <br /> <br /> History and scene The sequence was completely incoherent and poorly organized. <br /> <br /> Unless this is one of those films that need to be watched many times to get the full depth of the plot, which is quite possible, I don’t have an exact idea of ​​what is going on. <br /> <br /> It makes sense, because if you want to put forward a political argument and not get any criticism, make your argument impossible for criticism! If you cannot dazzle them with glitter, confuse them with Bull C.
