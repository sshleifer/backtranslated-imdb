ba ba ba boring ...... this is next to the battlefield the earth in sci-fi nap. Jeanne Francis (aka Laura General Hospital) plays a small role as a reporter and in itself should tell you that this film must be bad .... there is Ben Kingsley (the actor who won the Academy Award) in this bitch other worthy actors. You have to wonder what made them decide to make this terrible movie. Music rises and falls abruptly, as if it were a big dramatic story. Even if you pay attention to the plot can not be traced. The effects are also mediocre and seem really outdated. All the actors speak in a monotonous voice and have no realism in their dialogue. I could go on and on telling how this is a bad movie. At least with Battlefield Earth it's so bad, it's funny, but it's just good. Avoid if you do not want to sleep.
