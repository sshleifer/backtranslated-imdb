I was extremely disappointed with this film. I read some other reviews here and expected much higher. I expected a drama with a more intensive development of character. But this never happens in a movie. Daniel-Day Lewis is a good actor, but not as good as some reviewers would have us believe. I thought he repeated the same set of 4 or 5 movements in the film. I would rate his performance 6 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Acting: 6 out of 10 Direction - 5 out of 10. Worst-case scenario: 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I removed the movie from my DVR for 70 minutes to the cinema. Much better movies than this ...
