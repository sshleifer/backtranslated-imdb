After the excellent AANKHEN (2002), which was a remake of the Gujarati play, he comes with WAQT, which is also similar to the stage performance <br /> <br /> In the stage performances we have characters shouting, and here too it plays the same br /> <br /> The first half shows that Amitabh almost makes fun of 40-year-old Akshay Kumar, who behaves too funny as a little nerd <br /> <br /> There is a good message in the film about do not spoil your son, but unfortunately, the way Amitabh wants to make Akka in charge is absolutely fake. <br /> <br /> Even his reason to hide his illness, his escape from the hospital and Akka's melodramatic speech put off <br /> <br /> Some emotions touch you, but most are too excessive <br /> <br /> Comedy Rajpala is very funny, but too tight in the second half <br /> <br /> Directed by Vipul Shah is too exaggerated, although some scenes are good good <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Amitabh overzealous in the first half, but excellent in emotional scenes . Akshay Kumar does a good job with his role too, but in some too tiny the py scenes look uncomfortable. His chemistry with Bachchan is incomparable. Rajpal - the main point, he makes you laugh, not overdo it, but simply by his presence, his stupid behavior and unfazed humor. He is a riot. Boman is good in some comic parts, but too loud in places, the heroine Priyanka so there's nothing to be done, this is her last movie with Akka, so far Shefali is awesome, although she looks too young for Bachchan
