Spoilers, I think. <br /> <br /> Absolutely absurd logic of the ending destroys the entire movie. I just could not accept this. What's wrong with Mark Wahlberg’s character? If I were suddenly broken on a planet full of talking monkeys, I would have said: “AAAAAAAAAAH! But he's all like "talking monkeys, ok. Next?" It's pretty exhausted, I would say. He has to deal with even stranger things on a regular basis. Also, this is Rick Baker's best work. This film is a true testament to how far we have come in the field of monkey makeup. 3/10.
