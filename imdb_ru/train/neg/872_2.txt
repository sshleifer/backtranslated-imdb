First of all, I expected that “Caged Heat” would be in the same spirit as “Ilsa, The Wicked Warden”. Boy, I was wrong! The film of the 70s is by no means exploitation, “The Chicks in the Chains” or “The Women in Prison”. Of course, the conspiracy consists of a group of women in prison who wear street clothes, by the way (quite funny), but ANYTHING does not happen. <br /> <br /> There is no strong rivalry, no one is trying to seduce a warden or a doctor to try to escape, and the prisoners are not dismantled. There are 2 shower scenes, which, I suspect, are just reworked shots, but the fights do not flare up / are not tempting anyone here - nowhere in this regard! In addition to the lack of plot, inconclusive, unsympathetic and flat characters, a couple of prisoners who manage to escape, really returning to prison to “release” their cellmates ?? !! <br /> <br /> PUH-LEASE, the film was supposed to end up as the fugitives flew into the sunset ... unlike the continuation of this mess! <br /> <br /> I feel cheated.
