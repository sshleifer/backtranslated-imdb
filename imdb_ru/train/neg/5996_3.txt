Thunderbirds (2004) <br /> <br /> Director: Jonathan Fraix <br /> <br /> Cast: Bill Paxton, Ben Kingsley, Brady Corbet <br /> <br /> 5 ?? four ?? 3? ? 2 ?? one! Thunderstorm birds are coming! <br /> <br /> And so began "Thunderbird", my favorite in childhood. When I heard that they were going to make a film about Thunderbirds, I was delighted. I couldn't wait to see how Thunderbird 2 roars to save people, while Thunderbird 4 plunges in, you understand. I just could not wait. Then came August 2004, when the film was finally released. Critics have arranged this, but I still wanted to go. In the end, while the heart was in one place, that was all that mattered to me. So I sat in the theater, the only teenager in the crowd of 50 people, the rest were thirty and up to ten. Quite possibly the most awkward theatrical experience I've ever had ?? <br /> <br /> The film (which should be a prequel) is dedicated to Alan Tracy (Brady Corbet), the youngest of the Tracy family. He spends his days wanting him to save people, like his entire family, but he is too young. One day, he finally gets his chance when Hood (Ben Kingsley) lures the rest of his family to Thunderbird 5 (space station). This suggests that he will have to outwit Good's minions and save his family in time before Hood can steal all the money from the Bank of England. <br /> <br /> Believe me, the plot sounds like a regular episode of “Thundering Birds”. when you read it on paper. As soon as it hits the movie, what a mess we have in our hands. First, the film was intended for children, just like the original show. Nevertheless, Jerry Anderson treated us like adults and gave us stories that were sufficiently advanced for children's programs. This, on the other hand, fades the plot as he tries to make himself a robbery of the Spy Kids franchise. The final product is a movie that tries to please the fans of the Thunderbirds series and children, but is completely absent. Loud jokes, cartoony sounds and silly antics that no one finds funny around this movie, and I'm sure Jonathan Freyks wants him to never shoot it. <br /> <br /> In general, everything gave a solid performance, given the scenario that they all gave. Ben Kingsley was exceptional as Hood, playing the role very well. My only complaint about the characters is the minions of the Hood, who are reduced to the remains of the old cartoon Looney Tunes, which clumsily tell how children, oddly enough, take them with ease. <br /> <br /> What's strange about this film is that while I was watching a movie, I had fun. But as soon as the light went out, I realized that the film was pretty bad, I got $ 8 lighter, and two hours of my time had passed. Guilty pleasure? May be. However, Thunderbirds is an unforgettable mess. Instead of going further, I need to recommend that you stay away from this movie. If the rest of the film looked like the first ten minutes, it would be an incredible film worthy of the name Thunderbirds. However, we get a movie in which only die-hard Thunderbirds fans (if you want to see how childhood is torn into pieces) or extremely bored, you have to worry about it. <br /> <br /> My rating for Thunderbirds is 1 ½ stars.
