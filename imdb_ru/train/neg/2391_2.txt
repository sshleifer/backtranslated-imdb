I love movies. I love independent efforts and large studio productions. I love movies with stars, and I love those that show unknowns. I love dramas, comedies, action films, fantasy, riddles, westerns, any genres, except horror. I love foreign films, also in English. I love good films and even bad ones, because almost no film can entertain or entertain at any level. Except for "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues." <br /> <br /> When I attended the Cowgirls night demonstration, I joined an audience of about 10 people. Less than halfway to her, I was left alone. Soon even I could not tolerate the disturbing confusion unfolding before my eyes, and I also left. To date, "Shepherd" remain the only film from which I have ever left. <br /> <br /> I don’t really know how to describe this incoherent, senseless, dirty, meaningless film or how to adequately convey it. no redemption value. Suffice to say that he is considered one of the worst major films of all time, ridiculous and unforgivable at all levels. He tries to be smart, but his concept of feminism seems hopelessly anachronistic. He tries to be funny, but his humor is rude and bad. This is one of the few films that manages to defile your own spirit, portraying the main characters in such a disgusting way that you rebel against them and their values. If you want to watch a movie, see “Waterworld”, “Ishtar”, anything other than that. With the exception of the new "Alexander". If you choose between this and this, read the book instead.
