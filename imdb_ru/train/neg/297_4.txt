By the way, this film is intriguing, but it is hardly original. In 1998, in the film with the participation of Talia Shir called "The Mistress" was almost the same story, but with younger characters. <br /> <br /> The story is that Amanda Lear had a bad life, an abusive father, an anxious doctor, psychiatric shelters, etc. She is finally released from the happy home under the guidance of her perverted doctor ... whom she anally insults and kills the poor guy. (now it was original) The doctor financed the mansion for her, before she killed him and buried the sucker in the backyard. After moving, she falls in love with a dog named Richard, who is simply married to a blues singer. If you have seen the "Hostess", then you know everything else, she is killing or trying to kill anyone who stands between her and Richard (including roadsters). <br /> <br /> Most of the ideas came from a previous film, the same idiotic sidekick who pokes his nose, the same spying on a guy with a bowl of popcorn, the same flying bodyguard. There was some original stuff in it, the beer bottle thing was cruel. The highlight of the film was Amanda's beautiful breasts in a hot scene. In a sense, it is robbery, but not a waste of time. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
