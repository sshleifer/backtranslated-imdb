This is actually a pretty bad movie. The ideology is not as perverted as in the films that Collins made later. However, my main concerns about the film are that it is implausible and frankly boring for a long time. The very concept of a former SAS employee joining terrorists for no particular reason is not very convincing, and you can't help but wonder why a group of highly organized terrorists (who later become rather ignorant) fall for this. The film begins with a rather powerful scene, but then wanders for quite a while, approaching the great finale. In general, I think, “Who dares to win”, it was an interesting 45-minute episode of “Professionals”, but there is no feature film in this story. Although at the time this film was quite successful, he marked the beginning of the death of Collins’s career, who in the eighties made mostly cheap and dubious films about soldiers of fortune or the army. It is a pity, because he is in fact a rather versatile actor, but at the end of the day, Martin Shaw chose his roles more thoroughly and has a career that is still successful.
