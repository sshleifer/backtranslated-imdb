Obviously, many people really like it, but I found this infantile and rather offensive cod, saved from oblivion by Jane Russell and several unforgettable musical numbers, especially a newcomer (but later a noticeable fall of the invention). which is not so stupid, but it will just come stupid. Russell cannot convince when he claims that he has never been to the gymnasium, but otherwise he is quite remarkable. Men are strikingly uninteresting, as is the plot. Not at all brutal, but so heterogeneous that, if this is a classic, God will help us all.
