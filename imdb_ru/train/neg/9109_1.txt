The first “Ill intent”, the original, is my favorite movie of all time. It was an absolute masterpiece. So how could they make the sequel so blatantly bad. Sarah Michelle Gellar was perfect in the first film. In this, Amy Adams sucks. She's terrible. And couldn't they find a chick that really looked like Sarah Michelle Gellar? At least the same hair color !!! I mean come on. Robin Dunn is not as bad as Adams, but he is absolutely terrible compared to Ryan Philip. Sebastian in the first film is cunning, deceptive and much angrier than Sebastian in the prequel. And what happened to the storyline. Basically it looks like this ... <br /> <br /> 1- Sebastian has a bad reputation in his first school, so the film says, although it does not say anything about him, his life on dates and how he was with girl 2 - Sebastian moves to New York and just suddenly decides that he is going to turn around. He “falls in love” with Daniel (may I remind you that in the original Sarah Michelle Giller says a quotation: “You broke up with the FIRST MAN you have ever loved because I said how he could fall in love with a prequel”? ??) And he is all cute and charming, and everything is a "good man" when he refuses to have sex with the chick that his father did. <br /> <br /> 3- He makes a full 180 and ends up in a troika at the end of the film, and then seduces Cherry. <br /> <br /> I mean, this is terrible. And I loved the first one so much. I haven't even seen the third one yet. I hope this is better than this prequel.
