*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Do all teenage slashers suffer from drought originality? It looks awful. First of all, this is a noble premise that could be well used. Rejected by a young nerd who grows up, stalks and kills all the girls who fucking tormented him when he was in high school? I can not say that you had nothing to work with. But this film goes through the same movements as all other recent slashers. Everything from counting to the corners of the camera allows us to accurately predict when a false alarm will come, and exactly when the killer will strike. We already know the pattern. These stupid slasher films are more and more expanding the boundaries of trust with each passing minute. Let me ask you something: who in his right mind is going to surprise his friend in the dark, dreary morgue in the middle of the night and just surprise her out of the blue while she is alone and surrounded by corpses? Does it even make any sense? <br /> <br /> "Valentine" only occasionally innovative. One good shot involves killing character Denise Richards. She gets trapped inside the pool, and the killer pokes a chainsaw at her. There are a few good songs on the soundtrack, including one great Orgy track. The music video is contained in the special features section on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Even acting is mediocre at best. The actors all sleep in their roles. Of course, David Boreanaz is often stoic, even in his portrayal as the title character on Angel. However, Denise Richards is a wonderful actress, and she maintains her stone face throughout the film. <br /> <br /> “Valentina” is the same as you expect: pretentious, implausible, forgotten, crappy and without good fear. Don't even worry. <br /> <br /> My account: 4 (out of 10)
