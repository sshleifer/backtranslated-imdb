This movie was terrible. The plot sucks, the acting was bad, the editing was inept, and this film makes me stick my eyes out. I wish I had the time I spent on watching this movie. The balloon scene was stupid, the Mormons are really old jokes, the soundtrack sucks, I didn’t see any chemistry between the two leading commercials, it’s full of stereotypes, the stupid local cameo of “celebrity” ... Del was the most noted as i want .. "computer idiot. Worst of all, these actors had to play themselves on the spiritual side, and even they screwed up. This film will help create a long line of vague efforts to spread LDS’s beliefs in Hollywood. I.E. RM, Church Ball, etc. And so on. D. I would refuse to watch this movie and instead hit my head into a brick wall. You will be more fun than watch this bad excuse for the show.
