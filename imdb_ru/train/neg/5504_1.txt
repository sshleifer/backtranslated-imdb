I can not understand why this film was shot. <br /> <br /> Why does Hollywood have to continue releasing one horrific update of a classic movie after another? (Examples: Mister Magu, The Avengers are terrible!) <br /> <br /> Christopher Lloyd, whom I usually enjoy, was so terribly wrong in this role. His manic image of our beloved "Uncle Martin" is so inexpressibly unpleasant that he is almost a criminal. His ranting, groans, grimaces and histrionics do not give us any reason to take care of our character, except for some one-dimensional cartoon character. <br /> <br /> The director must have thought that fast movements, screaming dialogue and “one-off” The farce had some similarities with comedy. Obviously, he told EVERY ACTOR to behave as if they had red ants in their pants. <br /> <br /> The error should be related to an irresponsible script. I think the author used “This is Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World” as an example of a wonderful comedy script. No matter how manic this 1963 classic may be, it far surpasses that loud sound - in fact - suddenly it looks pretty good compared to it. <br /> <br /> What's the saddest thing about this film is that it was obviously written to appeal to young children. I'm just not sure for whose children this was done. Of course, there is not a self-respecting child with a card that I know! <br /> <br /> If they were to remake “My Favorite Martian”, then why didn't they add some kind of eternal charm to the original classics? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, IMDB.com cannot take into account the “zero” rating for its readers; this is the only rating that comes to mind when describing this parody. <br /> <br /> One good thing came out of this film, the actors and the film crew were paid - I think.
