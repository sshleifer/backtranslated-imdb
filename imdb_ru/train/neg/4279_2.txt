I found a DVD that says “I Dream About Gini” in a $ 1 tray at Wal-Mart. When I saw that it was “the story of Stephen Foster,” being a musician and music teacher, I had to see it. I had no idea what year it was done, because it wasn’t said on the cover, only that it was a remake of the 1939 River Sueany. The image of the composer Bill Shirley is sometimes painful, sometimes funny. The man has NO testosterone and he is a wimp all over! I find it hard to believe that Stephen Foster thought that music publishers did him a favor by publishing his songs ... without paying him for them! In addition to this ridiculous concept, there is a nearly 20-minute segment of Ray Middleton and his black "Christy Minstrel," performing songs by Stephen Foster, which were difficult to observe, if not more. I can not believe that someone will consider this film suitable for resurrection in our time. This confusion should be forgotten. Fortunately, Stephen Foster's songs will NEVER be forgotten ... besides, the image of Ailie Christie in the role of Gini was certainly the highest point in this lowest point of Hollywood history.
