I was waiting for this movie to play in the big wait. Assuming that it will be more accurately depicted as the movie "Christmas Box", based on the book by Richard Paul Evans. I sent a lot of emails to friends and relatives asking to watch this show, hoping that they would better understand a little of my “new” life. After watching this movie, I was very disappointed. As a mother who lost her only child in November 2003 and REALLY knowing the pain, I hoped that this film shed light on parents who “think” that they understand the grief that the parent who lost the child is going through. This film was very frivolous, and the stupidity of Diane Keaton was a slap in the face to the parents who had buried the child. It was VERY unreal from start to finish. After the movie, I had several calls, each of which sounded the same: “It was so inappropriate and created the impression that in a short time you were back on the road and listening to songs on the radio, and life is returning.” What a bunch of bull! It is clear that the director and Keaton never lost a child, because none of them would have made the film so unsuitable. I think this is Hollywood.
