This film is really nothing but, admittedly, a well-thought-out series of intense episodes accentuated by the inevitable â€œGocha! at the end of each. In fact, there is no development of characters and a real story about which you can talk. There are only the most skeletal motifs for the characters to do something, while they are dragged along to their inevitable deaths. This is just an excuse to show a creepy ghostly child (who seems to have confused some of the family cat in his ectoplasm) and his ghost mom (with long black hair hanging on her face, like "The Ring") down a bunch of cardboard clippings, two-dimensional excuses for human characters. <br /> <br /> This English version of The Grudge is the equivalent of cinematic junk food; satisfying for a moment, but not quite what you should live on. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
