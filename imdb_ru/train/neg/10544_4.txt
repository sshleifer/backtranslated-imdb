When the memory of childhood tells you that it was a scary film; it is touch and go, should you return to it. In any case, I remembered the terrible scene with the participation of the homeless and tough villain performed by Jeff Kober. <br /> <br /> “The First Force” is not a very good film, unfortunately. It is full of these copies of policemen and a very meager scenario with holes through which a truck could pass (along with countless convenient “turns” that help the story to evolve). Lou Diamond Phillips is an arrogant bad cop who sends the serial killer of villain Kober to the gas chamber, only to find out that he was a minion of Satan himself and now has the power of resurrection and the ability to possess every weak-minded person he encounters. The mix is ​​a very poorly realized psychic who helps with the case. <br /> <br /> Ahhh, it's rubbish. But enjoyable as such, especially if you still have fond memories of it. It scared me as a kid, and this homeless scene is still pretty good. As for any logic here; Forget about it, almost every script is added for good measure, and in the end you will get something in between Stephen Seagal's fighter and the demonic click of the 70s. And who the hell thought it would be nice to play the role of Lou Diamond Phillips here? It goes without saying that he is not at all convincing, but he is trying his best, and I have never had any problems with the guy that many reviewers seem to have here. As for Tracy Griffith as a psychic, the less said the better. But Kober is pretty good as a killer; always liked this actor. <br /> <br /> The “first force” may be exactly what the doctor prescribed after a hard day’s work, and a “brain outage” is necessary. Beer is likely to improve your viewing experience, and I will definitely experience it the next time I show this movie. Generally; not a good click, but somewhat unpleasant pleasure for nostalgic fans who were easily scared like children. "See you, buddy"!
