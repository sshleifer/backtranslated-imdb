I would like to say that, unlike many people who did not like this film and found it impossible to understand, I was fully able to understand it for what it is. Very incoherent plot line attempt. <br /> <br /> I don’t like to throw this word, but in this case it fits very well. First, the director presents the material as extremely “arrogant” and, even worse, extremely incoherent. It is inconsistent in that it presents the material in a randomly shifted order, forcing us to think that the director was too drunk to remember which scenes appear first, and is arrogant that after 2 hours they are waiting for us, the viewer, to BE SORRY before end about it. <br /> <br /> I respect the surreal cinema for what it is. (creating a story around a more than real world that is not related to real life) But there is nothing surreal about putting history in ordinary modern time and in the modern situation on earth, which, most importantly, is not capable of attracting an audience but, apart from Moreover, a merely displaced series of events that are barely connected with each other. The most accurate way to describe the experience of watching this movie is to watch the story; perhaps even a very GOOD story, since it was based on a book, but disappointed that the camera does not seem to capture the necessary moments and tie together any means of coherence. <br /> <br /> Let's compare the stylistic movie. Compare with this “Gaufar Noe” “Seul contre tous”. He gave us a coherent, extremely attractive and intellectually deep story. This film does not offer intellectual study, and although it is very stylistic in its fragmented presentation, the director ultimately abandoned the basic art of good narration, and all we have left is a mess of events that are barely connected with each other. <br /> <br /> Yes, you can actually sort things out .... at a POINT. But, as I said earlier, the viewer will reach the stage when they simply say: “Who cares.” It’s like looking at a boring mundane story about a person going to the supermarket and buying products in a necronological order. Even with murders, this is completely uninteresting and uninteresting. Too many people these days will appreciate what they can’t understand or comprehend simply because of fear of looking stupid, and in all respects this film WILL TRY to make the viewer look stupid. <br /> <br /> If you have too much time, then please watch this movie, taking into account what I said about it. This is a story based on a book that could be presented in a MUCH more efficient way, and this is my main argument.
