There are not enough films on the topic of gays, and not enough films about the "way out". Each is a welcome addition to the genre. Although the production figures are high (the film “looks” good, Mathias Freihof (Philip) looks SO good in a pair of jeans), this is bad. This is a historical article: gay life under the repressive regime (East Berlin, 1989) - a life that is 40 years behind the West. In a sense, we see our own history; what it would be like for gays in the 40s and 50s (this often reminded me of “The last exit to Brooklyn: a book, not a movie”). Ingmar Bergman lineup. This is so casually edited, I wonder if the director just didn't accidentally hack. Yes, it is a miracle that it was filmed and released before the Wall collapsed, and yes, life behind the Curtain was hard for gays. A good director could show all this, not shocked the audience. A good director would make me mark this film as one of the best films coming out, and not as a blunder.
