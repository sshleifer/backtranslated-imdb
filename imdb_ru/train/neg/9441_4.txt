was this movie banned in england? What for? Tom Savini, George Romero, Dario Argento, Lucio Fulci and others have done much worse and have continued to do it since then ... <br /> <br /> This film has all the basic elements of the horror of the 70s or early 80s film. beautiful girls (by the way, they can't act to save their lives), a terrible thunderstorm with torrential rain, a spit, a crazy brother roaming the family estate, and really a damn good turn in the end, but banned? seriously. when the English Parliament banned the film, the Italians probably laughed at their collective asses about what the British and the brave were actually backwards. <br /> <br /> It may have been two minutes of total screen time devoted to violence and blood (which was greatly underestimated). There was nudity, but no sex, although allusions to sex were made, obviously. but absolutely nothing worth banning. <br /> <br /> I would like to see what could have been done if the directors had a decent budget for the work. the film is interesting, but the lack of image and sound quality deprive the final result. <br /> <br /> banned ... what a joke ...
