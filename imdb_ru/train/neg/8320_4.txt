After watching Awake, I came to the conclusion that director and screenwriter Joby Harold made Awake with the intention of making fun of the audience, because in a simple film there are a lot of ridiculous elements. In Awakening, there are a lot of holes in the plot and completely absurd and ridiculous elements (for example, the hospital form, which is used by the spirit of the main character ... did the doctorâ€™s ghost leave him in the floor?). The concept of this film is a little brilliant, but all the holes in the plot and absurd things make this stupid and crappy film. With the exception of the great Lena Olin, all the actors have bad performances. Hayden Christensen has zero expressions, and the same applies to Jessica Alba. Role. Awaken the mockery of the viewer. It is so funny and full of absurd things that it is impossible to take it seriously. My recommendation: skip this crappy movie.
