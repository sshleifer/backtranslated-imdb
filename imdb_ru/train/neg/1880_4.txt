Despite the fact that I am a big fan of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers films, it was only 6 years ago that I first saw Follow the Fleet. I knew all the songs from the old Astaire / Rogers record (yes, vinyl), but I didn't know anything about the plot. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, although the songs are catchy, and the character Ginger Rogers is cute and funny, you just canâ€™t like Bake Baker. Trying to catch up with his old partner, he constantly sabotages her career. His character does not have the usual humor and character of other Astaire characters in the films. <br /> <br /> Worth watching the songs and Ginger Rogers magnificent solo program.
