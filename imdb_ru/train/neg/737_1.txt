WOW! <br /> <br /> I was just given this film from my friend, who bought it for 1.98 at Walmart, and he felt he was taken away! It's boring, most of the scenes are shot in front of a green screen, the action is somewhat improvised, as if they don't have a script. Martians are CGIs that look like they were made by a newcomer, or a movie made by fans. I can not stress how bad this DVD really is! <br /> <br /> Example: in one of the scenes, the Martians tormented a local captive. She moves from a woman in front of a green screen to a computer copy of this woman. The changes are completely noticeable, and when they kill her, you can see that this is a computer figure, similar to something from the game of the 1990s! <br /> <br /> If at all possible, avoid a movie like the plague! You can download two trailers from their site and see how awful it is!
