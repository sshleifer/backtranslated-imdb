There are some good things about the movie. Music and cinema are great. Alex Wilson is hot and gives a great performance. Ryan Bower is also hot. The production was very fortunate that they played its role, because they really give the film production value. Johnny Vincent (Sean) and many of the boys in the movie who don't speak are cute too. Why is the actress who plays Amy not listed in the credits? Brandon Alexander plays a great comedic role in the role of Pinkar. <br /> <br /> Worst of all in the film is probably the star, James Townsend. He cannot act. He is also very skinny, not at all pleasant to look at him. His hands are like spaghetti. It's disgusting. They have no muscle tone at all. It is not surprising that he has to shoot his own film and star in it. No one else will throw him in anything. <br /> <br /> James Townsend cannot be as believable as the one who would even have a girlfriend, because he behaves so much fun. They had to play someone else in the role of leader if they wanted, which is better for the film. Again, maybe he just wants to use this film as a vehicle to start a career in the soft core of porn, certainly not real, acting, because he would take some acting lessons. In addition, anyone who makes porn is blacklisted in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The funny thing about the movie is probably casting a tan skinned Latina like mother Devon. Sonya Fisher is not at all like an actress. In general, this film is a soft core of porn and no better than what you would see on Skinemax. I think even Alex Wilson, probably the best thing in this film, is embarrassed by this and does not want to be associated with it. On his IMDb page, there is not a single photo and nothing else on the list, so Alex Wilson is probably a one-time stage name. Also, I recently ran into him in West Hollywood, and when I mentioned this film, he just turned and left. I understand. If I worked on this film, I would be embarrassed and would not want to get involved with it.
