I study in 11th grade at my school. In my class of Current World Affairs, a child from my class had this video, and he offered to watch it. So we did. I firmly believe that we went to the moon because my father works at NASA. Although I think this film is the biggest nonsense I've ever watched, the guy who created it has some serious balls. First of all, he had to show JFK that he was shot? And how dare he use all these biblical quotes. The only good thing about this film is the incendiary debate, which is good because in my class we have a weekly debate. This movie did not change anything. I think that he and Michael Moore should work together and make another film. The next Michael Moore film could be called "The Funny Thing That Happened on September 11th" or "The Funny Thing That Happened on the Way to the White House."
