Oh my God. I was so disappointed that this film was just a robbery of a Japanese ring. Well, I think the US also made its own version, but at least it was a direct remake. So sad. I really enjoy watching Filipino movies, and I know that great things can come from such a small country, so I can't believe that this was going to happen. Claudine and Chris are such big names, surprised that they will be associated with plagiarism. Any budding filmmakers in the Philippines: you don't need to go down so low to make money. There are many movie lovers who watch Filipino movies and enjoy them!
