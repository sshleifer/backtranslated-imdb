Hands down is the worst movie I've ever seen. I thought nothing would overthrow Last Action Hero, but thatâ€™s easy. The film is about three lonely guys who meet on Sundays to discuss their sexual antics from the weekend. The fourth guy - who is married and - who used to be part of a group, appears and talks about what he and his wife are doing. Nothing works in this movie. The jokes are not funny, but they are repeated throughout the film. The big kicker at the end of the movie is funny. Avoid at all costs.
