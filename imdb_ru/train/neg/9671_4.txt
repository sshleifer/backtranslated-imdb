Perhaps I would give a 6 or 7 on this campaign film, because it shows when and how the propaganda film becomes successful. If there are people who watch this play and think that “well, then the Jews must have done something to treat them the way they were treated in World War II,” then the film is very cleverly made to hide “why” and “how”, as well as correctly mix and false observations about how people live. What else can a propaganda film be directed to? For example, the part in which the American film about the Rothschild family is included is used very astutely. The question of why a Jew hides his wealth from an officer is never asked. No one mentions the tax system in these social strata. <br /> <br /> In addition, the level of excitement (or level of disgust) in a film increases slowly, and the end of the film that is appropriate for the decision is suitable for the purpose and necessity of propaganda. The audience with joy and gratitude will go to the coming times ... well done. <br /> <br /> The film has a kind of simplicity that affects the most basic emotional representations of the audience. The film today is a kind of story, so you really don't need to fuss about it much. However, in this simplicity of the words of ethnic degradation, a careful observer can find a relationship to contemporary cultural hatred, violence, decivilization, as well as integration issues. In general, small garbage.
