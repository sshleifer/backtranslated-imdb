IMMORTICIZER was interesting. This, of course, did not kill me for an hour and a half, but I was not impressed either. A group of children were abducted in the alley by mutant muscular muscles (in a scene with the least convincing cinematic impact sound effect in a movie theater) and taken to a luxurious house in the suburbs. Here, Dr. Devine and his team transplant the brain to their wealthy elderly patients so that they have young bodies again. Hey, it was quietly redone with a big budget a few years later like FREEJACK! Who knew that when you transplant the brain of an old person into another body, his new voice will sound exactly like his old voice? With all this talk about the pineal glands and the use of glowing green serum, you can almost see the visions from BEYOND and RE-ANIMATOR dancing in the heads of the producers. But the production literally does not have the courage to implement it. I never understood why, when someone shoots a horror film with a low budget, they donâ€™t fill it to the brim with blood. Acting is equally awful, the only good performance came from Clark Lindsley as an assistant to Dr. Price. He has a pleasant evil laugh. The only thing that should be noted in IMMORTALIZER is that many older people do their own stunts. Seriously, most of the cast takes some serious blows to old people.
