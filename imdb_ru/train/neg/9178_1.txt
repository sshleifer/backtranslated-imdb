The idea of ​​calling "The House of the Dead" the worst movie of all time is that it really isn't. There are worse movies out there. I watch a lot of Hong Kong ninja films, which are mainly the result of an unfinished Japanese police drama, which at the end is a videotape of a ninja inserted to create something that could technically be called a “movie”. Dead is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in cinemas. Going halfway, I actually felt a little dumber because I missed 45 minutes of this piece of garbage.
