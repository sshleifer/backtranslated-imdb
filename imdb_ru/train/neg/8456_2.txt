I started watching this movie with my girlfriend. And after 5 minutes I was left alone. <br /> <br /> I managed to stay until the end. It was a painful experience. <br /> <br /> I liked Gene Hughes Anglad, but I think he needed to eat like us, and so he agreed to play in this film. <br /> <br /> There are only 5 characters here, and the rest can be called “art” or something that I could not express, but which I did not understand at all. <br /> <br /> The only worst film I've ever seen was a crash, but now I’m sure I have enough experience to watch it again successfully. <br /> <br /> Good luck! ; ABOUT)
