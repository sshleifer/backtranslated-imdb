If I knew that this film was shot in Dogme 95’s annoying and troubling style, I would never have shot it. However, I took the dramamine from motion sickness and gave him an injection. I lasted very, very, very long forty minutes before giving up. It's just boring, pretentious chatter. <br /> <br /> The last French film I saw was Romance, and it was also rather gloomy, but at least the camera was steady and did not exhale the characters' necks. time. I'm bewildered by the continued popularity of Dogme 95 abroad - in America it starts around the same time as the next major outbreak of leprosy. (This is called Dogme 95, because it’s an average number of times when actors poke a camera in their eyes.) <br /> <br />
