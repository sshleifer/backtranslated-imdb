Well, I can once and for all put an end to the question: "What is the worst movie ever made ... ever?" Of course, there are a lot of cool bad movies, but this one takes the cake as if he takes himself very seriously. <br /> <br /> This is a Romanian film telling about how far Romania should go to catch with Bollywood. It also shows how completely Steven Seagal is completely devoid of intelligence and talent. This film is so bad that you literally feel offended after watching, and you need to sit in the corner of the shower and cry, knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again. <br /> <br /> He was only released on video (I can't imagine why), and I suspect that the workers who were supposed to make a DVD had to wear protective gear and receive regular advice.
