Look, I liked the movie The Right Lead, but it was terribly bad. The kind of bad that makes you want you to return this time into your life, the kind of bad that makes you think “what on earth they think to shoot it in the first place,” the kind of bad that makes you want you 50 more minutes when you went into the kitchen to have a snack during the movie. This is bad, because of which the leprosy looks funny, bad, because of which you think you want to rent the movie Poly Shore ... Seriously, I can't explain how terrible it was. <br /> <br /> Having said that ... there were a few funny laughs, but they are all MUCH funnier than the presenter. Of course, they tried to make it interesting and interesting, but the whole story, which was left outside of the "Lead", which made it here, was really excluded for a good reason ... it was not even a little good. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor (or in the US, a favor), and don’t watch this DVD ... it will cast a shadow on a good movie like Anchorman, and you don’t want to do that. <br /> <br /> Okay ... I'm fine now.
