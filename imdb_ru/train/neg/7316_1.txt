When I watched the preview for this film, I didn’t expect to start with something more - about a second-rate horror movie for teenagers. But wow, this movie was just awful. And it is generous. <br /> <br /> First, the casting of the film was terrible. You do not feel sympathy (or, for that matter, any painful feeling) for the characters. The acting was so terrible that I just waited and hoped that the terrible thing would end. <br /> <br /> Secondly, there are moments in the film that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot. Can someone please explain to me why the girl-like boy starts screaming "BLINTHS !!!" on top of his lungs when he enters Jackie Chan's movements, which I have never seen before, and bites the guy who has the virus even more? Why does the father of the child start to get angry at the guy infected with the virus and go on a head hunt to find him? I had such confusion and total disbelief that I literally said out loud: “Where the hell did this happen?” <br /> <br /> I just could not believe what I had seen. I really thought I had seen some bad movies, but I must say that Cabin Fever surpasses them all. This film made me want to vomit, and then vomit again. Then break my brains. <br /> <br /> Please save an hour and a half and do something more productive. Observing grass growth is probably the right alternative.
