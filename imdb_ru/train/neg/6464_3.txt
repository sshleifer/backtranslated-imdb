Watching Marlene Brando on the screen is the same as watching a master carpenter cutting complex details into a piece of mahogany. Brando acting is the only thing that makes this movie watchable. The plot is meaningless and funny (not comic). Other famous actors seem to be making desperate attempts to give the characters they portray a little bit of humanity ... these characters have wet cardboard humanity. Everything about the technical side of this film is either mediocre or just awful. The director with impunity throws stills and slow frames. Random music is cartoonish and destroys any hint of dramatic effect. This is not what I'm really looking for in the movies, but even the wardrobe was far away. The Honorable Brando could not escape from the terrible rags in which he decorated it. I heard this movie called “David Lynch Esquire” and “disrespectfully funny” ... this is neither one nor the other. The films of David Lynch are evil creative - this film was in no way creative. And do not confuse disrespect with stupidity.
