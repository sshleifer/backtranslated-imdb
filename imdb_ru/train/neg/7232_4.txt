I really liked Bilal's graphic novel when it came out, and I was amazed to see the trailer for this film, and even more so when I discovered that Bilal had shot it himself. The film, however, was a major disappointment. Visual effects are not at all like the rich and sandy texture of original works of art, and the story is poorly told. Bilal seems to have decided to focus on the more esoteric aspects of the graphic novel, and he, too, did not do very well with this. <br /> <br /> The nicest part of the original graphic novel was the relationship of friendship and hate between Nicopol and Horus. They both were not at the right time and in the right place, due to circumstances. Most of all, they were fun and enjoyable. This is not the case. Nikopol has no visible personality, and Chorus is a pompous jerk who just wants to be laid down. Although the film is in French, Horus doesn't have to be! <br /> <br /> We all saw films that we liked, but for some reason I do not recommend it to everyone. I would not recommend Immortel to anyone, unless, as a warning, do not overdo it with your talent and resources. Bilal is a master narrator, but obviously not a master of all visual environments.
