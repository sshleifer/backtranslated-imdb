I watched this movie last night, and even after a few bottles of beer, the only giggle that film knocked out of me was when I realized that I was actually watching it. In short, it is not funny. Unfunny. I fully believe the little things about how Jack Black apologizes for making this garbage. I can’t believe that Barry Levinson didn’t just drop this script when he read the first page. Moreover, I can not believe that I watched it for more than ten minutes. <br /> <br /> I gave it 3 out of 10 *, because I like to see Christopher Walken making horrible payroll movies. In addition, the horse "Corky", just existing as a character in this film, is actually quite ridiculous.
