I'm glad that the guys from IMDb were able to decipher what genre this film belongs to. I had a suspicion that he was trying to be a comedy, but since it seems that she wants to be a dark and solemn melodrama, I was not sure. For a comedy, this is surprisingly devoid of even the slightest beginnings in the field of humor - right up to the ridiculous “twisting” of the ending, which confirms what a really waste of time on the whole movie. It is difficult to describe how amateur HAZING really is. Has anyone involved in this film ever had an idea of ​​what was supposed to do? Actually worth a look so you can look at the screen in rude bewilderment about how terrible it is.
