So, Steve Irwin. You have to admire a man who is not only ready to throw himself into the river, which is clearly full of crocodiles, snakes, lizards, tons of poop from the aforementioned reptiles and mud not only daily, but also with enthusiasm. He could never make me want to do this, but he managed to get his wife closer. <br /> <br /> This film does not fall into my parallel universe film category - films for people who have just had their teeth drilled, they have a migraine, or they have no film experience and therefore like silent mediocrity (in presently well populated by Disney movies). It is too noisy. Well, Steve is too noisy. He is just so happy all the time, and cuts through a teenager whom I never notice (now I hear it: “this film was so stupid”) or tylenol with codeine. I would say that his enthusiasm has infected, but if that were the case, I would have a room full of snakes, but this has not happened yet. I agreed that they are beautiful, but I still do not intend to caress them. <br /> <br /> The plot was really predictable. The bad guys were so bad that for a minute it seemed to me that I was shopping in a consumer electronic supermarket. But the film was filled with animals, and Steve and Terry, so I watched it. This conspiracy (if you can call it that) was indeed a greater reason for throwing another crocodile into the truck. My expectations were low and remained so. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that there would be a sequel in which Steve and Terry (after working on acting skills) would make a film with a real story and also animals with fur. I still can not believe that we will no longer see Steve. I hope that Terry and the children will continue to participate in the Australian Zoo and the Discovery Channel, at least. I can’t imagine to see a crocodile unless some member of the Irvine family tells me how wonderful he is. Crikey!
