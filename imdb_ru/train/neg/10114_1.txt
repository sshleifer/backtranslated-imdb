This is one of the worst films ever. I love cheese movies, but this is just awful. Where are the images in the film that are on the box? I think more money was spent on the illustrations of the DVD box than on the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Why does the company release a DVD that is so deceptive? I feel like such an idiot when I make this film based solely on the box. As much as I was researching IMDb, I had to do a little research and make a list before visiting my local video rental store. I have no one to blame but myself. I want my time and money back. <br /> <br /> DO NOT LOOK IN THIS MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Even if curiosity motivates you, put cocktail umbrellas into your eyes instead. It will be much nicer. You have been warned!
