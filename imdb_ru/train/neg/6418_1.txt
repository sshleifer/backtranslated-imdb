Let me start by not being a horror movie fan. I never watch them. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you about my experience ... <br /> <br /> The only reason I watched this movie was that my girlfriend and her friends wanted to watch it again Happy legs. <br /> <br /> ... I have never seen Happy Feet, but am sure it is better than this ... film? In any case, we did not expect that it would be good ... we just went to laugh about it. Cool with me ... I have a problem with the destruction of the film for other people in the theater, but since it was just other couples speaking and understanding, it didn't matter. <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes 2 other people left to get into Borat, a film that I would love to watch again about this. The film was not scary and not stupid, so it would be funny ... it was just boring. It was not terrible, as in “Baby Genuises”, it was terrible, as ... not at all entertaining. Avoid. <br /> <br /> Now I’m not an expert, but it seems the problem of the horror industry these days is that you may have horror from PG-13, which is boring and not terrible, or you can have an R horrible movie horror, which is either too bloody, or disgusting for people. <br /> <br /> You need PG-13 horror, which sucks, but is it funny? See "Grudge." Avoid this movie like the plague ... because it can literally tire you to death. <br /> <br /> 0/10
