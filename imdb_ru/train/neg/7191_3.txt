Saw it last night at the midnight helmet of the Monde Film Festival in Montreal. What a disappointment. This film is clearly overrated by IMDb fans. The game was the only one, but regular. The direction did not bring anything new or interesting. The plot is significantly absent: the film tells about these college graduates and the game in which they play practical jokes (7eventy 5ive). And besides, you can predict the end of the film in the first five minutes. If you like practical jokes and a slasher with an ax that makes you jump only once or twice during the whole movie, you might like it. If you don't, this movie is not worth it.
