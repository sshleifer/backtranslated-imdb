This film was not made by Who fans. Most of the great moments that fans are eagerly awaiting for Tommy’s half-hour medley are just skipped or misty: at Christmas they did not show Daltrey shouts after the line “Tommy doesn’t know what day it is ...”, they showed almost Pinball Wizard, there were extra shots of the crowd in the best moments of Go to the Mirror, and worst of all, in the second half of We We Not Gonna Take It (listening to you), they took almost every shot of Pete's sparkling guitar chords from us. back of the group. It's about It’s a frustrating film, and it doesn’t deliver the goods. I don’t know if director Murray Lerner is just a “Who” fan or, worse, for him, at least if he is a “Who” fan, and that's all to give him eight cameras. To his credit, there are a few rare numbers in front of Tommy, as well as a few favorites who were very good at shooting, and sometimes editing is brilliant. This may be enough to please some viewers if you don’t expect Tommy. The sound was generally mediocre in the broadcast, which I watched from DirecTV; This may differ on video or DVD.
