This film may seem scary in commercials, but the real film caused vomiting. It is below average (even lower) and has no plot. I mean, every house can make you feel scared and confident, a dead Japanese woman will scare you, but so what? Make a movie that will appeal to viewers, and not just show images of scared people and hair (dead Japanese). Can you say "terrible robbery of Samara"? Don't get me started with a "dead baby." Not even scary! So what? He has a cat, and he can imitate her, damn big deal! Just bury the poor zombies and save a few lives that could hurt the Malice! 1/10! Ugh! >. <
