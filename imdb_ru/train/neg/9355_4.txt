I was only recently able to catch up with Marilyn Miller’s films, since they didn’t show on the British TCM. Over the years I was very intrigued, because it was one of the superstars of the 20s. Some stars of this era, such as Jolson, magic still shines through, but, alas, not for Miller. Her dances seem awkward and poorly set, her singing is somewhat limited, and as an actress she makes Ruby Keeler look like Hepburn. This film, because the audience is tired of musicals, almost all musical numbers have been removed. So we are left with the comedy of that period with a little real appeal. She was paid 500,000 dollars for it! So I have only two conclusions. Either she was poorly served by the cinema, or she had no talent at all. I think the truth is closer to the end than to the first.
