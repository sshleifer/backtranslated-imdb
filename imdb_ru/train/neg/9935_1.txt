This completely amazes me why Godard is so seriously taken - and “One Plus One” is an excellent example of his incompetence as a director and “intellectual” polemicist. It is hard to believe that Godard really believed all this Marxist and Maoist Kant. Anyone with a half brain could deal with the bankruptcy of these "isms" and how many people they destroyed and continue to destroy, even when Godard made his films, supporting them. As a director, ask yourself: would you have boring voice overs, reading tedious political diatribes in front of your audience, and then, when you couldn’t think of anything else to do, put another voice over on the first voice over your listeners after the first 100 words anyway? Well done, Jean-Luc! As for Godard, who insisted on making a movie with the Rolling Stones: of course he did; is not it? It was the only guarantee that such meaningless garbage was noticed in the first place: the genius of Stones, eclipsing the incompetent and talkative political idiot, released with a camera. The scene in the bookstore was not worthy of even the worst additional theater, and was an insult to the intelligence of even the small children who used to play it — as could be easily seen. Satisfaction, allowing friendly critics to argue that all this unsophisticated nonsense was a satire for mass filmmaking, is no more than a safe way out to offer those who clearly see the poverty of Godard's intellect and arrogant contempt for their audience. It's funny that Godard’s once great friend, Nuit Americain Truffaut, made the best film about making films, and Godard did the worst with Le Mepris! By the way, Godard did not choose the path of sympathy for the devil in the Stones. It’s just the track they’ve been working on when the “film” began filming at Barnes Olympic Studios.
