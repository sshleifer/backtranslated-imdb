This film is advertised as a smart romantic comedy. This is not clever or romantic, and it is definitely not an effective comedy. The fate of the well-meaning, but still pitiful character, "Tom", ranges from one extremely unpleasant disaster to another. The only saving graces are Tony Collett’s competent performance and the frequency with which we can see Paltrow’s pleasant face. In general, should be avoided!
