Wow, what can I say. I like movies with shit, and I struggle to watch a trivial action movie, but in Snake Eater I would prefer to drive a nail into my hole while my grandmother gave me a lap dance. Lorenzo Lamas is perhaps more like Lorenzo Lameass, this guy has as many acting skills as Bill Clinton. It has everything to make a really bad movie even worse. Crazy mountain peaks yep! unnecessary tits shot (with a real strange scar) Yes! crappy soundtrack yep! I would like to give the film 10 stars, but 1 is as low as before. Seriously, I think someone made a joke on me when I saw this, it can not be real ...... worse, there IS 2 MORE FAMILY SERIES SERWS! ...... guess its demand.
