In Egyptian films there are many films with a high level of drama, romance, comedy or action movie, even sports ... "Ziab la Ta'Kohl AL lam" was banned in Egypt because it contains nudity (full frontal female nudity) and this kind of nudity is forbidden in Egyptian films .. When I watched these films, I felt like ... The story of a fool ... Naked actress ... Bad action .. Some horrors and horrible colors .. Dear friend ... If you want see the great Egyptian film ... Simply: stay away from the form "Ziab la Ta'Kohl AL lam" .. There are great films in Egypt ... We have great actors who have won global victories, such as: Omar El Sheriff or Hamel Rateb .. We have great directors, such as "Youssef Sahin", so trust me, Pall. You do not need to watch this movie ..
