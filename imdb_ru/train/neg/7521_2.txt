I probably trust more than I deserve, because it's Halloween, I was just on Nott's Scary Farm and I was in the mood to watch a really stupid Halloween movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, and it only costs me one dollar. <br /> <br /> I usually go through a film like this to get to the “good things”, but I resisted the impulse here, and I'm still not sure why. From the first frame it was obvious that this is not a “real” movie, not even a B-movie. It's more in the category of “terrible” DeCoteau films, such as Brotherhood, which are shot on about 50 cents video (in fact, I was half afraid that at any moment one of his muscular college guys would shake himself, rubbing himself) in shorts or something) There were no shots (too expensive to make several camera settings) and flat lighting, but ... it is difficult to determine. There is something refreshing about watching a filmmaker shoot a semi-decent film without money. The fact that he does even semi-decent work is commendable, and this film has its merits - the acting is not bad, the photo is pretty good (if it is too bright to be scary), there are some surprises, and all this somehow .. . differently. <br /> <br /> A bunch of college students (for some unknown reason) are stuck in a warehouse where they decorate a haunted house. An eerie old man gives them a satanic book, and they accidentally summon the powers of hell. This leads to the fact that costumed people in a haunted house become who they were invented, and cause a lot of chaos and human suffering. Along the way, we encounter a strangely complex and thoughtful story about lesbian relationships - it is interesting that this couple seems to be the most versatile in the film. Yes, there is a sex scene, but it is not obscene - or at least no more than you could find in any legal lesbian movie that shows they have sex. For a horror film, it is rather unusual to spend time and effort to do this without resorting to cheap exploitation. <br /> <br /> Another thing that interested me was that she was clearly trying to imitate “stupid children having sex and being killed” in the spirit of the slashers of the 80s. It is difficult to accept, because such films already exist, the genre was made to death. I'm not sure if it’s good or bad that these directors just tried to make another entry in this genre, without irony, as if it was still a LIVE genre, but I appreciated this attempt. <br /> <br /> Which is why I sat through it; Sometimes you just want to watch a thoughtless, budgetless horror movie "And for Effort." There really were too many ready-made things, there was not enough blood, endless plot holes, dead ends and cliches, but unfortunately, there was not enough general feeling from the film, which simply did not have enough money to become a film that the producers intended ... but at least the haunted house scenes were pretty cool. I would pay to go to this haunted house if it existed, and did not mind paying a dollar to see it on DVD, even if I never watch it again. <br /> <br /> Yes, and ** possible spoiler **, but it was a big, short thing with a vampire girl in a coffin: “I used to have claustrophobia. But I have changed. ” Haha, good.
