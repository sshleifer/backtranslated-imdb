I happened to love this show along with millions of others. So I tuned in to this film, thinking that if it’s not good, it can be at least a little dazzling and fun. <br /> <br /> WRONG! I was just wondering, after all, were Charlie's Angels so boring? I don't seem to remember it as such. But this film, no matter how bad, is not very similar to the excitement of that time and the show. I saw it all, despite the negatives, it was not impossible to see. But it was very soft, and I don’t blame the performers at all, especially the women who played the angels, because they really looked like them. The film just wasn't so interesting. He tried to make each angel a "character." (One angel is angry, one is “good girl”, one is for husband ...), all the characters are depicted with one main characteristic that defines them, and with a small depth that goes beyond stereotypes. The excitement of the show was absent, and the dialogue was .... dialogue. That's all. <br /> <br /> Not terrible. Not the worst of tv movies. But overlooked.
