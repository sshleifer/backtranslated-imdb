De Niro is a master ... one of my favorites. And I love GOOD sports films {not so much in baseball, but hey, his sports films, right? I expected much more for this movie. It seems that everything starts well: DeNiro is what I expected, Snipes (whom I donâ€™t really like) is very good as a spoiled star. The role of Barkin, for me, was fine. She is a good actress, but seemed out of place in this role. They always seemed to me to be in a hurry, and then it stretches in some places a little. It just seemed to me that it was so uneven! Given the cast and plot, it could have been much better. I rated it as '4' and I was generous ~ I am hard with numbers!
