Being a fan of raw horror films, I saw it in my video store and thought I would try. Now that I have seen this, I desire no living soul on this planet. I get movies for rent for free, and I feel that I have not received my money. I saw some bad horror cheese films in my time, hell, I'm a fan of them, but it was just an insult.
