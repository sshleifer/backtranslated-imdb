I am a lover of a good novel, but this one is considered neither good nor novel. I was put in a plot before the loans were completed. With such a bad dialogue, the development of the plot and character, I propose to spend half an hour not to waste time. I had to rush and rent Serendipity for a third time so that I could get rid of the unpleasant taste of this mouth.
