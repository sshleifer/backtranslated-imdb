Very rarely do I give less enthusiastic reviews of a show or movie that I don’t like on IMDb, but the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is just awful, it's awful. <br /> <br /> I wouldn’t mind if it were I think that the animated series would be better, but, like a live show, it typifies the terms cheesy and obscene. Of which Power Rangers. Five multicolored spandex teens fight evil using their martial arts skills. The costumes are terrible - they look like something that athletes in athletics and gymnasts will wear. The acting is terrible, and the choreography of the battle is so shockingly bad and inappropriate that it makes Jean-Claude Van Damme look as good as Bruce Lee, which is an understatement in itself. In fact, they look like they are jumping and dancing; as if it was some version of The Nutcracker, or they did ballet rather than fight. In addition, there are several cartoons in which martial arts are widely represented, and yet it is made in a fun, but not in such a stupid way that makes him look stupid. <br /> <br /> Children show or not, it is so lame and on the verge of absurdity. And although this version is installed in America, you might think that, while watching some episodes of battles, they were shot not in the US, but in Japan; thus, several "fake" fights and videos were borrowed from the Japanese version, only for comparison with the American version. <br /> <br /> If you like this type of thing, then stick with Sentai, the Japanese equivalent.
