“Dahmer” is an interesting film, although I would not use “horror” or “thriller”. This is rather a secondary study of character, which seems strangely sympathetic to the killer. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Renner portrays the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, who drugged, killed, and dismembered his male victims. The film tells about the relationship between Dahmer and Rodney, played well by Artel Kayar. <br /> <br /> Rodney is almost a more interesting character: in love with Dahmer and once having escaped an attack, he returns to Dahmer for sex and experiences a second attack. <br /> <br /> I think the film is scattered, because it shows little for Damer's formative years how events could create a human monster that we see on the screen and does not give an idea of ​​Dahmer’s belief that he can create the sexual zombies of his victims. <br /> <br /> Roles are well played, but the story is subtle.
