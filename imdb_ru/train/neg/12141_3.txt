... because 99 out of 100 times the producers lied through their teeth (or someone else) to make you rent or buy them * graciously censor *. <br /> <br /> Shock-O-Rama Cinema proves the truth about this again with the release of “Feeding the Masses”, perhaps well-meaning, but completely inept and gloomy entry into the zombie genre. People are not only low-budget filmmaking, this is VERY low-budget filmmaking by a group of people who - excuse me, I know that they have families who love them - never, never will Diversity in any significant way. This is one baaaaaaaaad mooin 'pitcher guys, and not just because it's cheap. <br /> <br /> Acting is mediocre, but I do not blame the actors; they had no direction. They had no direction, because the script was an unfinished zombie fantasy without a sense of real cinematic storytelling. The characteristic is subtle at best, not due to weak dialogue and sleep guidance. Did I mention that the script and the direction are pretty lame? They are. There is no drama, no tension, no beautiful moments of character, nothing. The whole premise of government suppression of the media has been squandered on secondary “commercial breaks” and a non-dramatic storyline that challenges rational analysis and awkwardly collapses to a ridiculous end. Syd Fields would not be pleased. <br /> <br /> How could the government hide the truth about the evil zombie epidemic when the reality of this would be apparent everywhere? Why would they give it more than a superficial attempt? Nowadays and in the era of mobile cameras with wireless access, what could they hope to achieve at best for more than a day? Now, if they were hiding something, for example, their own fault ... but "Feeding the Masses" never explores such possibilities. Instead, he relies on absurdity and poorly organized events to seek out laughter and / or significance, praying that his audience would not notice the almost total lack of production value other than the basic equipment for film production. Did anyone in this movie get paid? I hope that the actors did, if only their time was wasted on career dead ends like this one; at least techies are gaining work experience. <br /> <br /> Even zombie fans will benefit little from “Feeding the Masses”. The mountain is remarkably tame for those who are not limited by their rank, and there are no distinctive decorations or memorable effects. In fact, they are all highly forgotten. KNB is nothing to fear. <br /> <br /> Even trash, like the Australian dead, the Undead, was many miles ahead of the Feeding of the Masses. Sorry guys, go back to the drawing boards and take your deceptive marketing with you.
