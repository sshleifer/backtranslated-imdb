I have a copy of it on VHS, I think they (television networks) should play it every year for the next twenty years. So that we do not forget what happened, and what we remember, in order not to repeat the same mistakes. How to put some people in the director’s chair where they don’t belong. This film "Rappin", as a Vaudeville musical, is for those who cannot sing or play. This film is as fascinating as the attempt to teach the "blind" to drive the city bus. <br /> <br /> John Hood (Peebles) just got out of prison and headed back to the old district. Of course, in the case of serving a sentence for a crime of necessity. John returns to the old street, and he is met by children, elderly dogs and his peers who dance and sing throughout the journey. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it if I were sentimental, or if in truth someone smoked a drug pot prescribed by a doctor for glaucoma. In any case, this is a poorly directed, scripted, in effect and even created (I never thought that I was sitting like that) satire from the ghetto life with the Hood. Although, I think that the redemptive part of the story, thanks to the sequences of gang fights and dance numbers, his friends take care of their neighbors and want to save the ghetto from destruction and cleansing. <br /> <br /> Forget Sonny's spoon, Mario could win an Oscar for it compared to this rap. Well, if you want to laugh at yourself silly and embarrassed by three-quarters, do not forget to drink first. <br /> <br /> And please, look responsibly. (No stars, good luck next time!)
