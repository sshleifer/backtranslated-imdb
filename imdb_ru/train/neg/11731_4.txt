As I understand it, this silent version of The Merry Widow is the worst ever made. In this version there is no tenderness, love or spirituality, all this is dark, German, ominous nonsense. It reminded me of the love of the Nazis; who cares? <br /> <br /> This quiet version of von Stroheim is not an exact adaptation of the original story. In this film, we see John Gilbert and his rude relative Prince eager for this stupid American actress, played by May Murray, obsessed with modern hair and an incredible feminist manner that rejects me again and again. I like my romances, light and beautiful, with slow growths; not rude and sadistic, like this one. And come on, those bee lips, get rid of them, girl! <br /> <br /> Watch a live performance of the show if you want to get an idea of ​​the sweetness of the original operetta by Franz Lehar. If this does not happen, wait until TCM shows the Jeanette MacDonald - Maurice Chevalier sound version. This is much better.
