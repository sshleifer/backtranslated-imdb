Bad game, no script, no plot, no convincing killer, no waiting, no original settings, he uses the same wardrobe / under the bed / person behind the mirror again and again, making it repetitive and boring, and NOT in anticipation, but also the fact that NO ONE “really” dies (at least not on the screen), which, in turn, kills any obscurity that it can cause directly from it, and makes everyone feel more cheated for spending money on entrance ticket .... this is a horror movie without any horror LMAO. The most interesting thing you see is that someone took a bottle of ketchup and sprayed it on a plastic sheet. <br /> <br /> You must be a teenager who sat there and shouted at the theater and scared yourself to enjoy it, or you were drunk at the time. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I have a life, and I often don’t write reviews if I really don’t really hate or really enjoy it. <br /> <br /> But this film is HORRIBLE, and I feel that I have a kind of duty to warn you not to give your money to Hollywood, and not to encourage such filming again! <br /> <br /> It’s one thing to rent a “bad” movie in a blockbuster with “Weinsteins”, another thing is when you have to watch it in a movie theater. <br /> <br /> Also, in case you want to redo nostalgia, forget about it! This is not a remake or rethinking. It's not scary, not attractive, and not satisfactory enough to be “fun,” as others say on IMDb ... it's just a stale and exciting experience. <br /> <br /> This is what you take away from this film: remembering the scar on Brittany Snow’s head, which stands out more than the plot, the fact that Jonathan Sheikh MUST have sexual relations with J.S. Cardone of the Forsaken got another killer role (because he is as frightening as my poodle and too cute to kill anyone), and that for some reason (spirit) everyone who returns to the hotel room, never comes back. What kind of person will NOT be worried at the graduation party, when he decides to announce candidates for graduation, the king and queen, and the girl with fierce competition just for some reason does not appear? This is my warning to you. DO NOT waste your money like me. The “original” is also crap, but for fans of Jamie Lee Curtis, this is a more pleasant experience, although not as bad as this piece of shit (sorry for being rude or rude, but as soon as you understand it, you will understand why I said).
