At least, he is not full of senseless violence or fluff. It is also not very full of thoughts or a smooth storyline. This story had some potential, but the director seems to have lost the place of greenery. The story is not connected and unfolds in weird <br /> <br /> directions. I also do not believe that the director spent a lot of time in a country golf club. Some images are absurd. Not very attractive.
