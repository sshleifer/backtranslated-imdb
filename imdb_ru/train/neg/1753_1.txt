The work of Dietrich Bonhoeffer had a profound influence on my life as a Christian, and I was looking forward to seeing this film and to learn more about his life. Words can hardly express my disappointment. This film was scattered ... he did not give any information about his life, historical context or anything about his great works (except for a brief, fleeting reference to the cost of an apprenticeship at the beginning of the film). Instead, we see that he is enjoying jazz (presumably in the States) and is resting with his friends before he decides to return to Germany. Apparently, to show your human side. Well, I'm ready for the dramatic part. The part where he stands for his faith. Instead of emphasizing this, we get a very badly played romance with a 17-year-old schoolgirl. Regardless of whether or not this was the case, it should not have been a major part of the film. Now ... I'm still waiting for the dramatic part or some narrative explaining what his writings were about ... or SOMETHING, so that we know a little about the greatness of this man. drum roll ..... waiting ..... ..... waiting ..... ZIP. Nada This is the film that gives Christian Films a bad name. All they had to do was create a structure that would follow the film, with some background ... even some offscreen commentary or memories of him, preaching from his works ... some story about who he was and where he was, but no ... that's what we got. It is hardly suitable for the hero of the Faith.
