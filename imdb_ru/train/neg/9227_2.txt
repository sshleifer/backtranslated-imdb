CQ was the worst movie I saw this year. Almost every movie I choose to watch in a theater is at least interesting or has something to say. This film looked as if its director had shot for his introduction. in the cinema class. His father makes great films. His sister did good. But brother Roman? NOT! One critic had the audacity to compare this film with MÃ©ris, Godard (Contempt). While Coppola Jr. took the same idea, a film about the film, he tried too hard to seem European, fanciful and witty when all this is really just kitsch. The main actor expresses the same expression throughout the entire film, as if he was either delighted or shocked that this film was being shot around him. Schwartzman somehow manages to fulfill his role as a bright director. Depardieu is fine. The only scene in which there is some real humorous film, surprisingly, is not the scenes of the B-film, but a scene taking place in Italy; montage of shots of several different characters inside a very small car that drive, picking up and dropping random people. It was the only thing that reminded me of a movie, I think, he tried to fake. Or plagiarism. Or both. A documentary film featuring a presenter, camera talker and filming of various objects was played, the ending was marked for "raisin" or artistic value ... I assume that the most funny thing about this film was the film itself, and not how it was supposed . No wonder that this film was sent back after being shown at the festival, to be edited or re-shot, or something else that makes me curious how bad it was before. I can't believe that it could be worse than that. If you want to see a good parody of the film, watch the films of Austin Powers. Any of them. Opening to the third is more interesting and more ingenious than this whole film. Lil 'Romy, for the sake of cinema, PLEASE go back to your cousin's music videos. Leave the godfathers father.
