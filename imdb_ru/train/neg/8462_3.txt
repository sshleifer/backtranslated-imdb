Bullfighter was made in 2000, but for some reason it comes out on video 5 years later. I wonder why? Could this be: a tangled storyline, an incomprehensible dialogue, said by Oliver Martinez, and annoying editing? It should be. I think the plot was Mary (Michelle Forbes) and Jacques (Oliver Martinez) go on a mystical journey. They meet many stupid characters and avoid some evil ones. The film looks great, it has a lot of style, but there is no point in it. Most of the films, trying to catch, do not attract attention to themselves with unanswered subjects and weak special effects. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the cover: Willem Defoe in it 2 minutes in the majority.
