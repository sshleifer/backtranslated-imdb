In Bridgeport, the irresponsible high school teacher Richard Fenton (Jonathon Shek) is obsessed with teenage student Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow); she sees him killing her family to stay with her, but Richard is arrested and sent to prison for life. Three years later, the injured Donna feels better, but is still under psychological treatment and is taking pills. On the prom night, she goes with her boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and two pairs of friends to the Pacific Grad Hotel for a party. But the psychopath Richard escaped from prison and settled on the same floor at the hotel, pursuing Donna, stabbing her friends and hotel employees who cross his path. <br /> <br /> Unforgettable slash "Prom night" is a collection of clichés with a complete lack of originality. The stupid story is petty and stupid, with a bad game of Jonathon Sheikh as the insane killer. The predictable scenario is amazing, as you can predict what will happen in the following scenes. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Morte Convida Para Dançar” (“Death invites to dance”)
