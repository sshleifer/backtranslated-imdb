Wow ... I can't believe how bad the ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T 3) really is. I heard rumors, read reviews - but I had to decide for myself. Well, let me tell you - THIS IS A SHIT !!! The worst game ever made of films, the duplication that had to be done, until all the participants were completely wasted, inept and ridiculous bloody effects, no noticeable plot, “cinematography” that looks like my grandmother was shooting using a video camera, weapon requisites that are not a joke - made of foil - the list goes on and on ... <br /> <br /> Three guys end up on an island where a bunch of cranks run with plastic swords and foil swords. Two of the captives are freed along with the rebels from the island monsters, and they are given a day at the beginning, before they are hunted down by the rest of the "tribe" ... that's all ... <br /> Honestly - this is one of worst films i have ever had to fail to expose myself too. The budget was supposed to be about $ 200, and it was completely spent on the bloody currency (which really could not be a bad idea ...). ZOMBIE DOOM is NOTHING, except for mixed, funny-looking, bloody scenes with a lot of HORRIBLE duplicated dialogues. This movie makes other off-budget excursions, such as PREMUTOS: LORD OF THE LIVING DEAD, similar to TITANIC. Some may rank ZD as “so bad, it's good” - and I think if you are REALLY drunk or high and watch it with a few friends in the MST3K style - I think you can see it that way. But not by me. I hated almost everything about it. If ZOMBIE DOOM or ZOMBIE 90 (which is equally terrible and included as a “bonus” in the ZD Shock-O-Rama release) is evidence of other works by Andreas Sznaas - then he should never be allowed to do anything with making a film ever again under threat of death. There is one funny kung fu battle in the second half of the film, and a lot of blood - so I'll give it a VERY generous 3/10 - Do yourself a favor and skip it.
