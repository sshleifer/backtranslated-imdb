This incredibly bad film, shown in Australia as “Hydrosphere”, is so terrible that you become hypnotized and have to watch it to the end, just to see if it will not get worse ... and so The storyline is so predictable that it seems that it is written in dramatic art classes in high school, the scenery is pathetic, but a little better than miniatures, and the acting is wooden. <br /> <br /> It looks like the baby’s “doll” was stolen from the 'Total Recall' buffet props. It seems that in the whole film there was not a single original idea. <br /> <br /> I found this movie so bad that I laughed most of the time. <br /> <br /> Malcolm McDowell should bow his head in shame. He obviously needed money!
