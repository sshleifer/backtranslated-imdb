I remember when this piece of garbage came out, all the newspapers screamed that it took Barbra Streisand years to make a movie. Well, it could not take so many years; the play was only opened in 1975, eight years ago. This made the Broadway star a great actress Tova Feldsha, who probably should have played in the film, but NOOOOO ... The GREAT STAR BARBRA SHOULD MAKE IT. And with music, no less! This film is a complete disaster from start to finish. First, Barbra Forty, when she did it, and she watched every minute. No one could swallow her like a young girl eager to learn Torah. And then, when she dresses like a boy, she becomes polite. I got the impression that Streisand could not be unattractive, so she played with makeup; she is prettier than a girl than a girl. And as if this is not bad enough, she contacts both her classmate Avigdor (Mandy Patinkin, whose best moment is a shot from his bare back) and her bride (Amy Irving, who performs her usual routine sleepwalking damn, poor woman always resorts to the fact that the director ignores her, but she does not know what she is doing). Yentl even went so far as to marry a girl; I will not even mention the wedding night scene. <br /> <br /> Then there is music. Nine completely forgotten songs, all sung by Streisand through voice-overs (apparently, like a look in her head), and each as intrusive and annoying as the nails on the board. <br /> <br /> I will not say that Streisand does not show a glimpse of promises as a director here; Some visual effects are beautiful (especially Patinkinâ€™s backside), and she has good eyesight for balance. The problem with this film is that it will not go out of its way. I did not believe her for a second in the title role; she NEVER had to add songs, and besides, this whole mess lasts for two hours and fifteen minutes. Forty-five minutes later, I am sick of all this sad mess. <br /> <br /> Terrible, terrible, terrible.
