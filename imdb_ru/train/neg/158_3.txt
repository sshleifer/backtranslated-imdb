Warning spoilers following. Excellent holiday at the base in Antarctica, where the real events of the film took place. In addition, slanderous!, Scandalous! Picture taken in Canada; presumably mostly Canadian team and actors. I recently filmed the second half of this film on global television here in Canada. Nothing special to say, except how deeply I was shocked at what a glaring piece of American historical revisionist propaganda; and Susan Sarandon starring all of the people! I can only assume that Canadian-born director Roger Spottiswood was forced to make the USAF film heroes when in fact real lifeguards, where a small private airline based in Calgary; Kenn Borek Eyre.
