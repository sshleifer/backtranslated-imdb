I question its importance for Queer Cinema, as it seems that it is more related to homosexual relationships through violent behavior than to any clear statements about homosexuality and violence. <br /> <br /> Three stories are confused with each other rather casually. I found that I was trying to unravel the dirty story in the first 15 minutes, which in itself did not suit me. Weak plot moments repeated endlessly, as if we could not get them the first 10 times. <br /> <br /> In the film there was a feeling of soft dialogue. More like a 45-minute short film Boy's Brief, rather than a feature film. He had a certain erotic talent, male nudity and sexual attractiveness, but in general, the amount was not equal to its parts. <br /> <br /> Part 1: The “Boxer / Stalker” storyline was the strongest, and yet it seemed that it had been pulled on him by Bob who had watched Tim for four years, and only now confronts him? I felt that their cat-and-mouse game was not sufficiently developed to deserve its conclusion. We need more information about them and less parking / locker scenes when Tim consistently says, “What do you want?” <br /> <br /> Part 2: Danny wants his friend Tony to beat him while he jerks . Tony does not seem to mind, but he is not even interested in studying the consequences of his homo-erotic hobby - even after they do it in the nude. In this story, there is no crucial transition from “I am an ordinary guy who jokes my boyfriend for fun”, “I think I may be gay and beat him because I would like to push his ass and make him S / M. style. "A very important thing that should be omitted. <br /> <br /> Obviously, each of these stories could convey their thoughts in half the cases. The third part, where a man and a woman clap each other, complements this thought. In addition, it was unnecessary and added nothing to the film. Yes, the actors coped well with the situation, and the four men were very sexy. However, the makeup (bruises and cuts) corresponded to the display of talents in the gymnasium. <br /> <br This story did not have enough meat to influence gay politics. The film did not make a statement l time, and it does not attract enough or worthy of thoughtful investment. His fatal flaw is its amateurish approach, which ultimately makes it impossible for a serious relationship.
