This and “Immoral Tales” left an unpleasant taste in the mouth. It seems to me that Borovchik is disgusted with sex, and these two films are cautionary tales about what happens if you have sex. Like a film, this is not very well done - some actions are really epic bad (such as an "American" woman with a French accent). A young woman’s sudden slap from worrying about marriage to interest (when it seems that it should have been the other way around) and the aunt’s sudden awareness of the young man’s mystery does not make sense — they haven’t explained at all. I also didn’t like the way my daughter’s relationship with a dark-skinned man was presented as a sign of her family’s perversion or addiction to bestiality. The central idea, the idea that there is this “sexual beast”, if you will, who lives in the forest, could serve as the basis for a perverse, but funny story, but instead is simply used as the basis for disgusting, sexual behavior. Negative, moral game.
