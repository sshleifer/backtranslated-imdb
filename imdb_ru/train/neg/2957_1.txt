What a mess !! Why was this movie made? This and other films of his “caliber” should teach how not to shoot a film. Children may like this, but anyone over 10 may or may not approve. Worst of all, such great talents as Whoopi Goldberg and Armin Muller Stahl were completely wasted in the film, unworthy of any notice.
