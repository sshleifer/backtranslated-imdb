There is a group of Fox TV executives sitting at a table in the meeting room wondering what new show will be put into operation. <br /> <br /> “What about striving for something like 24 or The West Wing?” says one of them, but they all agree that it will be too expensive, and cheap television is less likely to harm the station, if it collapses. <br /> <br /> “Well, how about getting together with some great comedy writers and making a quality comedy series?” suggests another and is fired on the spot. “Don't you know, good writers are worth a lot of money! the big chief barks. “That's why we invented reality TV.” <br /> <br /> “We could play another crime drama ...” - suggests a man in an indecent suit. "I listen ..." - the boss responds, suddenly interested. “People like CSI, so let's make another copy of it,” adds Blundmann. <br /> <br /> “But there are already too many CSI clones, what can we do to stand out among ours?” the naive younger asks and immediately leaves. 'Stand out! If we do this, people can get confused! Let's give them more of what they already like! the big chief shouts. <br /> <br /> “Let's just add more violence and make it truly awful, after all, we are Fox,” suggests another costume for a heartfelt answer “now you get it” from the big leader. “We could have made them a Division of Deviant Crimes,” he adds, clearly on the list. <br /> <br /> “Jov, he understood!” the big leader laughs, “and the victims can be beautiful and vulnerable women who wear very little on the screen”. “Well, this will certainly distract people from ordinary acting and bad scripts,” says Blandmann. <br /> <br /> “Then everything is decided, we just need a name,” the big leader announces. “Could we call this“ sex abuse ”? <br /> <br /> “Too literally, what about the Killer Instinct?”, it conveys violence, but it sounds a bit like “Basic Instinct”, which had a lot of sex. ” <br /> <br /> “Puuurfect”, - the main leader answers, and then they slap each other on the back and go and cancel “Arrested development”.
