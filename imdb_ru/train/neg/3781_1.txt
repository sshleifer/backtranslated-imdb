(Some possible spoilers) <br /> <br /> I’m not quite sure what Dreamworks was thinking about when they decided to spend $ 80 million on this extremely tired and unconvincing animated film. They probably thought that an impressive animation would be more than enough so that viewers (mostly families) could see it in turn. Well, it seems, it worked on the first weekend, it was 26 million dollars, approximately, and amounted to 38.1 million dollars. total (estimate for this weekend). But I think that the spectators who came for the weekend saw almost the same thing as me when they saw, and they spread the information. This one is basically a lame film, besides animation and everything else, basically the script seems to be made three years old. <br /> <br /> The film lasts only about 80 minutes. for a long time, but it looks like a three-hour epic. Some controversial points for me: well, the annoying story is one of them, and it is so obviously written. At some point, he runs away from some of the kidnappers, and although you can see that the horse is clearly frightened, the narrator pops up (the voice of the talented Matt Damon) to clarify any misconceptions (which can occur only in the most simple mindsets. <Br /> <br /> Another thing is the constant ascent of Brian Adams songs, now I'm a fan of his music, I think he is good, but let's really, Dreamworks really thinks that viewers will be able to cope with 8-9 of his songs in such a short film I, Of course, I could not. Finally, here is the spoiler: the horse Shooting at a member of Calvary at close range, no less, she (the horse) falls into the raging river. Spirit (the film’s focus) tries to save her, but they both walk along a waterfall that should have a fall of at least 50 feet, much later at the end of the film. we see that this horse is alive and well. I know that this is a children's film, but even such a small amount of realism is unacceptable. <br /> <br /> To sum up, this is a really unfortunate film. I don’t say that it’s not for children like it, but someone else will check their watches, just waiting for this trip to end. Definitely in the top 10 worst this year. - ** out of 4 stars. <br /> <br />
