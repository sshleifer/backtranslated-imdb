99.999% pure shit. And the remaining 0.001% was a short moment when I thought a blond chick was about to undress. Not. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was legendary bad. The action sucks, there was no sex (the above-mentioned blond chick is modestly dressed, alas, the whole movie). CGI had the dubious honor of being the worst I've ever seen in a movie, and the anachronisms were numerous and vibrant. Acting was mediocre even from Ben Cross and Marina Syrtis, the only "names" in this film. And Marina Sirtis looked very, very bad. <br /> <br /> I have seen how school plays are produced more skillfully. This is the movie that MST3K thrived on. Heads should roll in sci-fi in order to allow this steaming pile in the air.
