It is strange that fiction infuriated me so much that I subscribed to IMDb just to write this review. Stranger than fiction - surprisingly complex, touching and thought-provoking film to the very end. As soon as you suspended the repeated mistakes of logic (why didn’t Will Ferrell hear Emma Thompson’s voice 10 years ago when she started writing her book? ”The telephone rang. <br /> <br /> A brief history of literary themes, presented by Dustin Hoffman, should especially entertain the former British majors. And Maggie Gyllenhaal is always a pleasure, although Will Ferrell can be an ax killer just as easily as a clumsy soul. Her quick trust in him is a huge leap of faith. <br /> <br /> Ah, but the end. To the very end, I would give 9 out of 10 stars to this film. The film is a metaphor of life’s journey, a tribute to the concept of “writing the truth,” as a reminder that great literature is a comedy or a tragedy, but not both, is outstanding. The whole movie makes the viewer understand and accept the moment of the fate of Will Ferrell. And no matter how cute a character he could become, we know perfectly well why we will accept the ending. The last act occurs, the screen turns white, the credits roll. The deep and powerful end of an almost perfect movie. The end, which would be discussed for weeks. <br /> <br /> NO !!!!!!!!!! Loans did not fall out. Say it is not. Let's say Hollywood didn’t use another 10 minutes of shit that completely undermined the integrity and essence of the film. Dustin Hoffman got it right when he said, “This is no longer a masterpiece; everything is good". A good review of the film. Besides me, it was not even good. I was so offended because of the betrayal of "writing the truth" about the decision to pander to the film, that I really burst into tears, explaining this on the way home from the film. I don't cry often. I don't care about most movies anymore, but I'm still mad at this one. <br /> <br /> My questions to the writer Zak Helm: did the original film end when the screen turned white? And you were made senseless cinematic forces to take up the ending, the wrong essence of the film? Or did you stick yourself to the end of this defilement? I read you are great. I hope your original script finished the movie for the first time. <br /> <br /> I know that Zach Helm will never see this review, and I was unable to find a contact to which he could ask himself. But please, moviegoers, am I the only one who thinks so about a STRANGER THAN FUNCTIONS? One good thing came from me when I saw this movie: now I double admire the “Lost Translation”.
