I usually enjoy these movies. This is a filmed documentary style, but acting and writing are just awful. The action is wooden and hard, and the letter is just so cliche, but not at all in a good way. Regarding the input of this, I am surprised that this is 5.2 / 10 on IMDb. I am sure that most of these voices must have come from the relatives of the people in the film. I suppose that if this is the case, you could cope with a couple of laughs, as it is always fun to see your relatives / friends make a film. Well, in a sense, I think it gives hope to all novice writers, directors, actors, and so on. Because, if they can do it, you can do it. Although maybe you should not.
