I just finished watching El Otro. I always took my hat off to the performances of Julio Chavez, since he is a great actor, but this film is really depressing and slow. I think it would be even worse if it were not for Julio. In any case, this is definitely a movie that you will never understand if you are not from Argentina, and even if you were, I would advise you not to make this film to have a good time with your girlfriend, boyfriend, family or friends. .. it's really frustrating and incredibly slow, and the plot doesn't make much sense. Perhaps the director wanted to show the fragility of human life, but what he does bothers and impresses the audience with scenes that shock you a little. It gives you the opportunity to think, but not in a good way. In general, I definitely didnâ€™t like this movie.
