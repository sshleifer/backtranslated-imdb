I did not like this movie. I thought the game was not very good and the story was boring. 20-year-old computer saves the day? I thought it was a bit contrived, even for a movie. I could not understand why they could not just turn it off, why not take a sledge hammer to it. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, but after the original film of the 80s you expected much more that was actually delivered. This film could be a version of an old 21st century film, it is not. If this is what you want to watch, do not watch this movie! <br /> <br /> Even if the old computer did not appear to save the day, in my opinion, it would still be very stupid.
