I am tired of all these little oddities about how this film “swayed”. This is pure CG beat CRAP! Do not send a murderer, it is much more sensible to carry hundreds of bright, aggressive, poisonous snakes by plane! The only reason people like this film is because they feel they should. This is not "so bad, this is good." This is so bad that I would prefer to poke a sharp stick in my eyes and then undergo this again. I honestly thought that it would be a comedy like an PLANE! Fake Was I wrong? This is all "This sucks, get it!" Or Samuel A. Jackson screams "Snakes on a plane!". Well, I'm sorry, I do not understand. It looks like a bunch of wimps gave the film industry more money to make more films like Triple X and Die Hard. If you spend money to watch a movie in the company of the same people who bought William Hung's CD, you still live in your Mom’s basement and the stench of a plastic stool of the day’s sweat on the computer, playing online games and watching porn , then hurry to the theater and ask for one (since I doubt that you have a girlfriend) a ticket for the Snake on a stupid plane. To hell with films like “Full Metal Jacket”, “Pulp Fiction”, “Real Romance”, “12 Monkeys”, “Clerks”, etc. There is no irony in watching good movies. The true decline of Western civilization. Calling it a cult film is an insult to a true cult classic, such as a repo man or even Orgasmo. I have said enough here.
