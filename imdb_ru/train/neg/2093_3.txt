If you like the soap opera “SIFI”, then this show is for you, as far as I think, it does not work for me, and after watching 3 episodes, I just can’t watch it anymore. It's boring and slow, and to show that the timeline is based on 100,000+ years ago, if you base it on the Battlestar Galactica timeline to arrive on Earth, they probably have the same things as the Chevy 100,000-year-old wagons riding down. the streets and people watch the 100,000-year-old popular brand of LCD TVs. The same applies to the rest of the sets that are in the show, and much of today's material that is involved in it should not be overlooked, I think that they could cope with this task much better and, yes, Battlestar Galactica There were some of the same problems, but not so bad. As with the rest of the show, this is not as good as BSG, and this is a bad preliminary sequel.
