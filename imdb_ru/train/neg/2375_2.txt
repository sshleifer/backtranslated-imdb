Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, the sixth edition of the series "A Nightmare on Elm Street" and another bad sequel. I think that this is due to the last sequel to "Dream Child". I was lucky to get a DVD with the TV series “A Nightmare on Elm Street” for my birthday, so I watched all the sequels. Let me say that I am more and more disappointed, although with these sequels, at least with the last two, it seems that Freddie has lost his advantage. It’s as if the writers were trying to give Freddie a soul, and they just destroy it, and not reinvent history. It was a sequel that wasn’t necessary, sorry Robert Englund, but it was far below what Freddy Krueger represents. <br /> <br /> Freddie is back, but he has something we don’t know about, a daughter. Maggie, she does not know that he is her father, but soon she will know what his dark secrets are and he wants her help. She must do her best to resist his powers, but she finds it difficult with all the good memories of her loving father. It's ironic, isn't it? But Freddie doesn't give up without manipulating her. <br /> <br /> Freddy's Dead: The last nightmare is also presented in 3D, radically, eh? Pay attention to sarcasm. This is one of the worst sequels, it is associated with the fifth sequel of the series “A Nightmare on Elm Street”, but honestly, it is better to watch the second “Nightmare on Elm Street”. This is just a bad game, stupid editing, and just a bad idea for a story. I did not like this concept, and it simply destroyed the very idea of ​​who Freddie Krueger, the lord of nightmares, really did, and not the father knows better. <br /> <br /> 2/10
