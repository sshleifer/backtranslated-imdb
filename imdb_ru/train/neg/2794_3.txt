Well, because I am a musician, I thought, maybe I will watch this movie on TMC, nothing else is good. One of the worst mistakes in my life, and this is only half the battle. I seriously thought it was one of those soft movies with a shitty plot and a shitty game, shitty shots and shit effects. But no, I do not even enjoy it. Even the "musicians" were not very good. I was hoping for some laughter, but I was not sure whether they were trying to throw one line or not. But now I have to sit here and watch everything else, until Fiction starts. Or maybe something better. And now I sit here and type until I have 10 lines.
