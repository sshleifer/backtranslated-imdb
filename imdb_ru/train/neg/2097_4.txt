I expected much better from the Battlestar Galactica franchise. Very boring prequel to the main series. After the first 30 minutes, I waited for it to end. Characters talk a lot about religion, computers, programming, retribution, etc. There are gangsters, mafia types that make hits. However, Caprica does not have the action of the original series to compensate for the slower parts. <br /> <br /> Let me give you some useful tips when watching movies: as a rule, if a lot of excessive exploitative sensations, then you know that the film will be stupid. Caprica has a lot of this. The director / writer usually tries to compensate for his bad abilities by throwing some naked bodies. It never works, and all he does is demean the (very) young actresses involved, and I feel sorry for them. Directors / writers who do this should be excluded from the business. <br /> <br /> If you want to be bored for an hour and a half, by all means, rent a Caprica. There's also (free) porn on the Internet, if you really want to see naked bodies. Otherwise, move forward, there is nothing to see.
