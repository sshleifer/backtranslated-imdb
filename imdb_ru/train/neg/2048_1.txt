1 is pretty generous here. I really liked BOOGEYMAN, although this is not a BOOGEYMAN advertised on the DVD cover, and we all know that! It scared me. But this film is something else. Due to the fact that he was shot by a guy who has been shooting many films for many years, it looks like he was filmed on a VHS 10-year-old video camera! The story and acting is terrible! David Hess, you let me down too. Having played one of the most formidable villains in the history of cinema, have you resorted to this? However, the plot and acting game could be forgiven if someone took the time to make the video look somewhat professional. There are a lot of filmed videos that are not like this, or at least not so obvious that it distracts your attention from the movie. I cannot say that this is the worst film ever, because I could not get through the whole film, but it is definitely close.
