Being a graduate of the film department, I would like to think that I have seen a variety of films, both good and bad, but I must say that Summer Rain is the worst film I have ever seen! I chose the film in the hope that it would be a great British classic, such as “Mysteries and Lies” or “Lokstok”, but, oh, no, it was so bad that my apartment neighbors and I ended up laughing and cringing from the ridiculous acting and the cheesy script (reminded me of the poor school production "theater in education"). The main characters Michelle and Gary began to annoy us from the very beginning. "Michelle", the main character, who lives with his two friends, has such a face that you never get tired of slapping, and Gary was so wet (he kept crying every 5 minutes) that by the end of the movie I really didn’t give a damn about which of them. All I could think was “I paid 3 pounds for this pile.” I have never written reviews before, but after watching this movie, I was prompted to warn people about this catastrophic production. Therefore, please avoid at all costs. Thanks for reading.
