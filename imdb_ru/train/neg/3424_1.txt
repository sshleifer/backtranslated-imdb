You have never seen a single movie and still know that The Jerk Too is a disaster. The question is not, “How did it happen,” because if you throw money at someone and tell them to make a film, they will do it. <br /> <br /> No. The question is, why did Steve Martin allow it? I think he needed money to deal with an unpleasant suit, and he was determined that it cost him nothing.

Karl Gottlieb and Steve Martin have revived the only continuation of this continuation. <br /> <br /> And “dcreasy2001” (aka Mark Blankfield?): It’s obvious that you’ve been working on this film in a sad way, and the only way to feel better is to be a lonely cheerleader sequel IMDb user comments. I prayed that you would pass into satire, but, alas, you did put effort to turn. Why not 10 stars?
