I am a fan of Colombo, especially on a rainy Saturday, and it was fun to see Oscar Werner after 451 Fahrenheit, but this episode was very lacking. The original plot and plot twists were obvious and could be guessed in advance, even years before modern detective shows today. But it was fun to see crazy samples of sofas and “modern” electronic equipment and, of course, the obligatory suburban humor, making fun of modern art for sale. The hi-tech house is a version of Tomorrowland, created by Jetson or Disney, and it is interesting to think about writers inventing this "weekend thing". <br /> <br /> If it's sunny outside, go play, as there are much better Colombo Episodes. However, we should be grateful for the cable television that these episodes are broadcast.
