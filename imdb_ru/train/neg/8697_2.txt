Carnosaur 3: Primary Species (1996) D: Jonathan Winfrey. Scott Valentine, Janet Gunn, Rick Dean, Anthony Peck, Roger Halston, Terry J. Vaughn, Billy Burnett. Why even watch this movie? Another stupid movie about dinosaurs, in which top-secret war guys discover these deadly (and very fake) prehistoric monsters running around and killing people in horrible ways. The original was bad enough, the sequel was even worse. It is somewhere in the middle, though not connected with any of the previous CARNOSAUR films. RATING: 2 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence and blood, horrible images and profanity.
