Curiosity led me to this "masterpiece." Unfortunately, I did not rent it, I bought it! The most disturbing thing about this film is that it is not so disturbing. For reasons known only to them, the creators of this film intended to show the human side of Jeffrey Dahmer. Are you kidding me? The man gave a new meaning to the term “finger licks well”! And with all the flashbacks and flash forwards, I had problems with the story. Overall, Jeremy Renner's performance was not so bad. You can catch him in S.W.A.T., in which he plays a disgruntled ex-cop. Anyway, I would rate it as 1/10. This is only 1 due to Renner's so-so performance. There are many books and television documentaries that cover Dahmer’s crimes much better. Avoid this.
