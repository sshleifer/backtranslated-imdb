Usually I have no problems with useless curse in films, but this one really annoyed me. All they did was swear. For the whole movie. (And, as someone else noticed, got sick with cancer) It was boring, incoherent and pretentious. I wouldn't be in your place. <br /> <br /> It’s not that I dislike films that, like most people who love it, will demand to “watch life”. I love Eat Drink Man Woman, and all that happens in this is that many Taiwanese people lead their lives. But I could relate to them. I have never met anyone who would have sworn just like the “actors” in this film, and I worked at the construction site. So go figure it out. Having said that William H. Macy made me smile. Once. <br /> <br /> 2/10. Avoid if you don't like boredom.
