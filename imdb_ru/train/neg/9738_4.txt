Not as bad as it is credited (Hooper did much worse) ?? all the more disappointing me. Such a figurative concept that was never used by Hooper with his economical guidance and especially in smoky (sorry for the pun) writing. It becomes so ominous and overly dead in a serious tone, becomes ridiculous and unfocused, allowing all the pessimistic narrative permeated with a secret / plot to be easily wired to end with something completely unexpected. Because of this, the rhythm becomes rather sluggish, and Brad Dourif (great to see him in the lead role) seems to be struggling with an unbalanced performance, despite the fact that he highlights the amazingly bizarre intensity of his unpainted character. Despite the fact that it is cheap, there is a competent technical attitude towards it. Nevertheless, he does not seem to go anywhere beyond the scope of his idea and wants to plaster disgusting shocks (which some work) and amazingly floating special effects (flames, flames everywhere). Hooper really displays some stylish crazy images (moreover, closer to the last end), and camera work quickly maneuvers, and the radiant bill is amazing. Performances take place throughout the store with performances by William Prince, Cynthia Bane, Day Young, John Cyfer and Melinda Dillon. Also Geroge Buck Flower and John Landis have small but funny cameos ?? especially landis. Nothing surprises, but it is attractive.
