This film is pure failure. I'm a fan of Steve Martin, but even he cannot save a weary idea and a script with cheese. Think "Police Academy 7" and apply it to a military parody. Muck <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t feel that other user comments reflect the poor rating of this film (and deserved it!). This is extremely misleading. I have often seen this movie with the inscription up to $ 3.00 at the grocery store, and now I know exactly why. <br /> <br /> If I could return my 90 minutes ago ...
