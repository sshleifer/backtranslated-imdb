This is a frustratingly shallow, naive and mostly unfriendly look at the wildly incredible relationship between psychotic filmmaker Brooks and Harold, his insane girlfriend. Both have the chemical composition of ZERO together - primarily because Harold is not able to do anything, except that he looks good at this stage of his career; but also because the character of Brooks is neither interesting nor likable. At the beginning of 15 static, painful minutes, when Brooks, just broke up with Harold, stumbles about his apartment in a depressed state, intoxicated - intolerable. <br /> <br /> Joe Cocker with joy and without any imagination instructs You are so beautiful, there is simply not enough material for a feature film. At the periphery of their relationship, almost nothing happens to create the impression that these people exist in the real world. I’m sure that Brooks’s intention was to shed white hot light on the case and, in a sense, to make it out; but if you are going to do this, the script and acting should be much better than here.
