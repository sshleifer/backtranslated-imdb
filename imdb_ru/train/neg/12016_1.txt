If Bob Ludlum had seen this mini-series, he would have cried. It was a complete waste of time and money. I read the book, and although the films are not exactly the same as books, CBS wasted time and money on this, and I find it embarrassing to say that it was Ludlumâ€™s work. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the creator should verify the identity of Born with Richard Chamberlain and see how good this series is. <br /> <br /> Poor Mira, Blair, Angelica and Colm, why did they sign so low? <br /> <br /> Awful !!
