The concept of legal gray area in “Love crimes” is about 10% of the attractiveness of the film; the remaining 90% can be attributed to his blatant anger. To say that Shawn Young’s statement as a so-called district attorney is wooden is an understatement. With her soft costumes and excessive hair gel, Young does a decent job of convincing the audience of his sincere hatred of men. Why else would she ask her only friend to pretend to be a prostitute so that she could arrest the police who are trying to catch them? This hatred is also the only reason why she tirelessly pursues a perverted photographer who gives women the unanimous delight and driving force of this crappy film. Observing how Yang moves from a frigid naked body to a full forehead does little to increase interest, but the hysterics she throws while standing next to the fire at the lake does so. Watching her rant and delight about her self-hatred and sexual disappointment makes Love Crimes a decent rental price, but it's all down and from there. Despite her desire to bring the character Patrick Bergin to justice, her police skills completely rid her of the torment of her own tired thirst and passion. Patrick Bergin works quite decently as a slimy sociopath; if it worked in “Dream with the enemy”, then it will surely work. But I can not help but wonder if the noticeable lack of energy contradicts Jan to the film of his slimness. I assume that this is so, and the result is a “thriller” with thrills that are completely bad and yet comedic.
