This film does not offer anyone anything. It fails at any level. The action is terrible, dull and prolonged. They, obviously, were shocking at the end of the sex scene, but in the end turned out to be a parody of what the film was aiming for. Complete bullshit, I can't believe what a funny movie it was. <br /> <br /> And Iâ€™m very sure that Rosario Dawson ended up in this film because she thought it would be her stunning indie hit, a stunning movie NC-17. The problem is that an adult is not going to stick with this film, since the film is played as an uninteresting episode of OC or something intended for teenagers. Pathetic.
