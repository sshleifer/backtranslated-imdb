Awful ... just awful. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. And I have seen some pretty bad pictures over the years. The sound sucks, as well as the quality of the picture, directing, acting ... and so on. D. And so on. D. The only good pictures (that is funny because they are bad) are special effects. In general, laughter costs about 5 minutes. The rest of the film gives you brain damage.
