This film was a messy piece of trash. You never knew what was going on. The characters were poorly written, and for the most part they were completely non-sympathetic, with the exception of Gus (masterfully played by George Eads). I hate this film, but compared to others (“The Dark Harvest”, “The Curse of Dracula”), he should have received an Academy Award. It was especially sad to see a talented actor, such as George Eads, in such a shameful and sticky film. For all your life you have plunged into a completely new minimum. Someone has to make sure that this director never works in a movie again. In addition, it was supposed to be a horror movie, because it was much more fun than scary. For shame Life, For shame.
