This so-called prequel is simply a poorly done remake of the best version of Dangerous Liasons. The plots are identical, as is most of the script. I liked this book, and I liked the first movie, but I won’t even worry about the third movie. The senseless banter between the two main characters in the prequel was absolutely predictable and non-original, and ... I just can't stress how bad the film was. If you don’t want to take my word for it, just look and you will understand what I mean. If you read a review that says “if you like the first, you like the second,” the only reason is that THIS IS THE SAME FILM! Although the plot is not even so good. They took so many lines from the first movie. It's hard to say which movie you are watching.
