I don’t know what the buzz around this is ... This is a really bad movie ... it didn’t do anything for me, the only descent scene is when everyone gets together at a party and plays a good song, an invigorating beat and good cinematic footage, that make you move ... it was the best part of the movie ... Otherwise, this movie lacks everything to suck the viewer. There is no story, there is nothing to think about, as some people say, there is no cohesion between different stories ... it was rather an attempt to outplay Anderson’s Magnolia, which was brilliant, but clearly failed ... Well, that’s easy and easy to watch, but these are also video clips. Maybe write a story first before making a film ... 4/10 One of the worst Belgian films I've seen
