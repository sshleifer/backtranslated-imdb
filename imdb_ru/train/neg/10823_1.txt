I don’t like to use the word “terrible” to describe any work in the cinema for which a lot of time, effort, talent and money were spent, but Jefférelli’s attempt to adapt Charlotte Bronte’s novel "Jane Eyre" is a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> The script lacks grace and strength, everything is explained to the viewer unequivocally, leaving little to the imagination. The main actors are terribly wrong, they are hired for star names, and the music is boring and boring. Charlotte Gainsburg and William Hurt have absolutely no chemistry with each other. She looks like wet noodles, even worse than Joan Fontaine, who at least was capable of some emotional involvement in what should be a story of frustrated passion. And William Hurt shoots the entire film in a single tone, and this tone is smooth and devoid of energy. Of course, the “sluggish and powerless” script does not help any of these otherwise beautiful actors in their attempts to bring at least some flavor of life to this film. <br /> <br /> “Mrs. Fairfax” by Joan Plowight is like some kind of Disney creation, which constantly appears to sweeten scenes in which she would have been better disregarded. <br /> <br /> There are no riddles around the history of the first wife of Rochester. The role of the future second wife, played by Elle MacPhearson, as the Barbie Doll, is an empty cipher. <br /> <br /> Fiona Shaw, a very great actress, is completely for nothing, like Aunt Jane, Mrs. Reed. She would be better off playing Mrs. Fairfax. Only Amanda Ruth, as Jane's favorite school teacher, evokes any genuine sympathy or believability. <br /> <br /> I saw this version of Jane Eyre after watching a Robert Young film for British television, filmed in 1997 with Ciaran Hinds, Samantha Morgan and Jemma Jones. There is no comparison. Life, romantic and deeply exciting version of Yang is similar to the exploding nova compared to the wet boob of Zefferelli. <br /> <br /> It will be interesting for me to see the 1970 version of Timothy Dalton, which I read very well on this site. I am amazed at how many people liked the book with pictures of Zefferrelli "Yorkshire". <br /> <br /> All I can say is good about this film is that the house is beautiful and brightly colored in cinema, except for the fact that it is a complete fool.
