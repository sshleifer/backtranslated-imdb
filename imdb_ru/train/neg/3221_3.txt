I watched it on a pipe last night. The actor involved first caught my attention. The first scenes attracted attention. Some funny, some sad. Good character development. I felt that the last third of the film was sold out. If it were not for the beginning of the film, I would have stopped watching. I kept on watching, wanting to know how it is connected. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I feel that this never happened. I especially didnâ€™t like the period when some characters spoke Yiddish (?). Was it a different shoe? <br /> <br /> I would recommend? No, I think not. As other reviewers point out, most of the slang is dated (jive 60s), but this is not too distracting. The ending completely cut me off.
