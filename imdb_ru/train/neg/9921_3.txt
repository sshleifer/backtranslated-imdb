Strammer’s hippie past was a revelation, but on the whole it was like an awakening. Campfire stories work best around the campfire. There were just too many boring jokes of old friends and too much video about filler. I love The Clash and Joe for not reuniting and selling their songs so far (FU Mick Jones), but this document left me wanting .. so that I could communicate more. The use of story-tellers by the fire without a proper explanation of the one who tells the anecdote, to some extent repels the viewer. They had to have an interview on their own. Even the use of "radio DJ" Strammer did not help glue the film. Can someone explain all the flags that fly over the fire? After the amazing Dirt and Fury, I was hoping that Temple could do it. Joe Strummer’s document deserves better.
