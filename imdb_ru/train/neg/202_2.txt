This is not the sound of bees, it is an effect caused by watching this very long, very boring, poorly-played film. How I was able to get through all three and a half hours without falling asleep, I will never know. The plot is simple ... 3 completely unsightly morons talk about sex 3.5 hours. And you thought Romer was deadly. It is even worse if it is possible. > I really have to be a masochist if I could watch this whole movie without turning it off ... and not killing someone.
