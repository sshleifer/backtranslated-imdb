In a word ... terrible. I give him one star for hippie sex scenes and for women with candy, otherwise I will forget about it. Corman's worst effort, without exception. Ben Verin had to permanently exclude his name from the cast. I can’t believe that it will now be on DVD (as of February 15, 2005) with "Wild In The Streets" - another retro-style bastard. This morning I woke up with a sick person in bed from a cold, decided to watch a movie to cheer me up, scanned digital channels ... the package looked quite interesting because I like to watch sci-fi movies in style B, a movie about hippies and rebellious teenagers movies It seemed familiar somehow, and with Ben Verin in the cast, I thought ... why not? What a big mistake ... it was a terrible start to my day. <br /> <br /> Only after watching, I now understand why acquaintance penetrated the niches of my newly awakened brain. I recalled that I saw the nearest sights of this film when I was 14 (I'm 45), in the early / mid-seventies at the local theater of arts “Sombrero”, which is no more ... the whole theater laughed hysterically and even moaned loudly how bad this movie looked. Act: terrible, story: terrible, cinematography: almost terrible, music: terrible, sound: terrible, direction: joke. If you want to see it after my warning, remember ... "I told you so." <br /> <br /> “Gass-sss” is the perfect name for this movie ... you feel “befuddled” after watching this rotten movie - or maybe you should be taken to “gas” camera in order to drain your brain. I have seen homemade Super 8 films that have shamed this movie. Definitely, this is a new addition to my best films from "Top Ten" ... it's there (well, there) with "Tentacles". <br /> <br /> Ted in Gilbert, Arizona
