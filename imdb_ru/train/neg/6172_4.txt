I'll get to the movies in a minute. First, someone wanted to get "evidence" of Clinton’s comments in Georgetown, where he claimed that the United States “deserved” the attacks of 9-11. Well, that's what Clinton said: <br /> <br /> “During the first crusade, when Christian soldiers captured Jerusalem, they first burned down a synagogue with 300 Jews in it and began killing every woman and child who was Muslim. on the Temple Mount. I can tell you that this story is still being told today in the Middle East, and we are still paying for it. "<br /> <br /> Are we still paying for it? What does" we "mean, a pale face? the infantrymen did not storm the Temple Mount. <br /> <br /> But in truth, Clinton never came out and categorically said that we “deserved” 9-11. Like all of his statements during his presidency, he meant what we deserve is 9-11. Just put the “fact” A, B, C, and possibly D, and let the listener conclude that he should draw conclusion X. When in fact pain Clinton's sting "facts" is summed up with guacamole. <br /> But this is not relevant. We are here to talk about the movie, not about politics. Unfortunately, when Oliver "Captain Conspiracy" Stone makes a film you cannot escape his perverse policy. It was only a matter of time when he concentrated his paranoia and bitterness on the Reagan era, and what better time than when Stone’s dreams almost came true, on the day when Reagan almost bought a farm. Unable to find any heinous conspiracies or schemes in an attempt to assassinate Hinkley, he comes up with one with Al-Haig. From a simple misunderstanding of the chain of constitutional power, Haig is transformed from a public servant, who really had to put himself in order in his correctional civil system, into a delirious megalomania. You almost expect Haig to rub his hands together, like Montgomery Burns, and tell Cap Weinberger to “Free the Hounds.” Stone even hires the smartest man in Hollywood to play our former secretary of state Richard Dreyfus. The guy you love to hate on the spot. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is fine. Average, hovering below average. Do not worry about renting or buying. Try to catch him by cable. 4 out of 10
