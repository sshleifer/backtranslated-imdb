Kodjak meets the mafia. Telly Savales is one of those guys from the past who seems rather forgotten. I never thought his show was so great. This is his one-dimensional characteristic of criminal authority, with very predictable results. If you take up the pursuit of the car and generally blab it, there will be no particular development of the plot or action. I find mafia films boring, because I donâ€™t respect and are not interested in simple criminals and their actions. Hollywood, and in this case the Italian cinema, treat these guys as heroes. I saw the film, and in a few days I will not remember much about it. A lot of shooting, innocent witnesses die, betrayal and this sick loyalty. The film is photographed pretty well, and the acting is decent. But the dubbing is so bad (because of the voices that simply could not get out of these bodies) that I almost started searching for Godzilla approaching the bay.
