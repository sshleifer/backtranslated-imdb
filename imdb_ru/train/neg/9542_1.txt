I do not know what else to say about this terrible film, which has not yet been talked about. Honestly, I should only be angry with myself. I should have known better when I saw the name of this movie that it would be a terrible piece of shit, but I loved the war games, so I indulged my whim. I will live to regret this decision for the rest of my life. From the very beginning, when government officials explained that their supercomputer could determine who the terrorist was, simply by how well they played the video game, I knew that the trip was waiting for me, although the land, which was good to write, forgot. The list of very, very, very bad storylines, dialogues and actions is so long that I would disable IMDb if I tried to publish it. Please tell the people who said theyâ€™ve seen worse films than this one. I'm really curious to see something that could surpass this steaming pile of horse manure.
