My name is Modesty - a low-budget film that tells the story of the origin of Modesty Blaise. The point is not that the film is terrible, it's just not what I was expecting or hoping for. Although I have known the character “Blaise Modesty” for many years, I am not too familiar with comics or graphic novels, so I enter this film as something else. This may be the cause of my disappointment. I expected more action and more comedy. The film is based on dialogue. I guess I was looking for something with a bit more camp value. What is my name Modesty is a deadly serious film. There are very few, if any, "light" points. The game, at least from Alexandra Staden, is acceptable, but nothing outstanding. As others have commented, it looks too weak to be completely believable in the title role. What kind of action movies in the movie “My Name Is Modesty” are some of the film's weaknesses. I never believed that this woman could handle a group of trained killers. <br /> <br /> I really hope that Quentin Tarantino will go ahead and make, according to rumors, a big budget film based on the character of Modesty Blaise. I am convinced that the concept has great potential, and I would look forward to it.
