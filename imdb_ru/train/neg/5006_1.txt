Nothing like a film about a group of friends who not only do not love each other to such an extent that they are disgusted, but they have little or no redemptive qualities to “like” the audience or empathize with any of the characters. There are films that are so bad that they are good (a la Ed Wood or Tod Slaughter films), and there are just bad ones (for example, 99% of Uwe Boll's “works”). This film is barely tolerable, even if you are a brilliantly talented MSTie riffer (for example, Mystery Science Theater 3000). Fortunately, although I am quite talented in this regard (this is how my mind works all the time), for those who are not so naturally talented in the MSTie riff, in the end, in this film you just want to break away, painfully aware that the film “Taboo ”Takes you about an hour and twenty minutes, you will never return. Even my talents at MSTie hardly matched this slow, boring waste of time. The most mysterious aspect of this film is that * someone * lit up and / or financed it ... I rented Taboo exclusively for the usually talented Amber Benson, who was obviously blackmailed in making this film. I have another less well-known film in my queue for rent, reviews, to which I would rather read first. Ironically, the best aspect of the film was its impressive labyrinth mansion due to its internal location.
