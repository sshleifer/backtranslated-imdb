This film on paper looked as if it could be good after watching, although I realized that this film was absolutely terrible !! The plot does not make sense, and I think I considered the best part of the 5000 cut scenes, each of which makes the film more boring and ridiculous. I watched this late night pitch not making any noise at all, just to add it to the TURN, but the truth is that the only thing that scared me was the music, what they would call tragic music, they play opera, I mean, be serious !! This film sums up all that is not good in this type of film. Honestly, do not say more, but look at your own peril and risk, this film is just complete nonsense, ENJOY !!
