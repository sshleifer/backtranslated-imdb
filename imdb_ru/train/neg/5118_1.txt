I am a Christian, and I say that in this film there were terrible acting games, unreal situations and a completely facade facade of Christianity. You can also watch “Remember the Titans” and, at least, not mix Christ in a football film as a formal steroid for losers. Let me make some really sharp comments about what bothered me in this film. <br /> <br /> 1. The school was in Georgia and was a white academy. I have not noticed a single black student or player in school. I deal with the White "Christian" Academies in the south, and they were built only to restore segregation. It worries when the film tells how Christianity and Christ change lives ... how about changing the hearts of segregation? (note: I really liked the black coach marker; as if he compensated for the all-white team and all the black players of the Giants.) <br /> <br /> 2. Every Christian’s uncritical recognition of this film. Can I get a couple of people to say that it was a bad acting game, bad shooting, bad writing and, in short, a bad one compared to other films. If we compared it with another football film, would he have the same charisma and energy? <br /> <br /> 3. The manifested unfinished Christianity made even less sense for me than an unrealistic ending. If Christianity is just a small scripture reading and prayer to begin a complete change in life, then do not be surprised when no one listens to what Christians say. We want to sell Christ as a cure for all diseases. He does not need to sell, and he does not need to be tied to such a bizarre lifestyle. It is not surprising that all consider Christianity anti-intellectual in this unreal presentation. <br /> <br /> I understand that this film can inspire some people. Most will not. This will not give a real picture of the struggle and mental stress. Most importantly for me, this is not a Christian by any means or tension. He has his own values, but he is not as good as the message “pull yourself up to the load,” as superficial as positive thinking. If you live alongside people who struggle and / or live in a third world environment, this film will be empty, since most churches today practice their religion.
