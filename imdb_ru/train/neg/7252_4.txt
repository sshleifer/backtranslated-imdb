DECK is one of those independent works created by obvious newbies, but it does not have all the usual flaws that most of these films omit. It has a certain story, it has an adequate game, the photo is very good, the hero and the bad guy are amazing people, and the background music is not exaggerated. This is a new DVD release, so people will search here to see if it is worth it. I do not know where all 10 came from, since this film is no good, even if you are the mother of the director. <br /> <br /> The last film we saw in the theater was the destruction of Warner J. C. Rawlings, a very beloved and excellent book, The Order of the Phoenix. Comparing THE DECOY with PHOENIX, note that PHOENIX (created by Warners) has no history, of course, the director did not allow any actions, the photo was terrible, and the imperious musical score was just erratic. I rated Phoenix at “1” because the scale does not fall below. DECOY is 4 times better - in all respects. <br /> <br /> If you have such an opportunity, give THE DECOY a chance. Remember that this is not "Bait 3 - shootout" or any nonsense. This is original. If your expectations do not exceed a stupid 10 points here, you can simply enjoy the film on its own terms.
