For this review is a list of good and bad points. I'll start with the bad ones. <br /> <br /> Bad moments: the choice of actors (especially Burt Reynolds as Boss Hogg), whose actions were called poorly chosen cast, storyline, the idea of ​​setting the film in modern times, directing, editing, soundtrack and most importantly, the whole idea of ​​making a feature film from a television series that is not so good to begin with, despite its popularity. <br /> <br /> Good moments: Jessica Simpson in a red bikini ............ that's it! <br /> <br /> Analogy can be made here. In the scene where Jessica Simpson in the role of Daisy Duke goes to Michael Weston in the role of Enos and asks the question: “Enos, where is Boss Hogg and Roscoe?”, In her blurred judgment, tells her where they are. She might as well be asked: “Enos, is this a good film?”, A red bikini would have clouded his decision to say “yes”, although in his right mind he would say: “No, not quite.” As well as she looked in a bikini, she could have been completely naked, and even that would not have saved this horrible movie. Stay away from Hazzard!
