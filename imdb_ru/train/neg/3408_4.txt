I was in second grade, 12 years ago. I remember it well. We studied space. All little children want to go to space, right? Well, after I saw this, I was so scared to death that I was “accidentally” thrown into space by some psychotic robot with a unidirectional mind. I had no idea that this was a movie. I thought it was some kind of news program or something like that. I guess it was my own version when people were shocked by the War of the Worlds radio program. So, I recently watched this film again, realizing that my favorite actor, Joaquin Phoenix, was in it (then it was called Leaf Phoenix). I can tell you, I laughed at dramatic roles and laughed even harder at acting. I mean, when Andy is in space, she is moving in slow motion, have you ever noticed that? I do not think that being in space makes you talk too slowly or think too slowly. <br /> <br /> The best part is that Andy is unconscious in the oxygen tank and starts to float back when the security doors close. , Little Max is trying to pull her in. Suddenly we approach Max’s face when he screams (in slow motion) "Whaaaaatttt'ssss happpeniiiinngggg?!?!?" I had no idea.
