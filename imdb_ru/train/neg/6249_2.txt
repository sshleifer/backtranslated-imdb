(r # 97) <br /> <br /> There is one good thing in this poor man's Pokemon (make this what you will): the topic of discovery. It should be the coolest themed music from any casually titled Japanese anime TV show "Oh, I mean young fans." Unfortunately, after opening the topic it was necessary to add some kind of show. And they simply could not come up with something more interesting than people loudly arguing about whose cards are better than the cards of others. Freud would have a field day, unfortunately, I can not imagine why some children want to see the show, where the dialogue, written by thousands of monkeys in five minutes, takes 98% of the time. <br /> <br /> “My supernatural being of Doomsday from Ultimate Doom will take your miserable Diamond Animal Pyramid in one hit!” Do not you see that you have no chance to win this battle, you fool ?! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! ”<br /> <br />“ Oh, yes? Well, look it up! I'm going to use my Pie of Destruction Force card, which destroys each of your Power Reapers and makes your Uber-Fantastic Creature of the Day of Judgment of Destroying Final Doom beyond any significance Attack is useless! I bet you didn't see it coming! "<br /> <br /> Seriously, that's all they do in this show, let's talk. Considering that in another shitty children's show that I used to watch, namely, in the commercial phenomenon" Pokemon "( every football mummy's favorite blistering), at least the monsters were so kind as to occasionally show it, “Yu-Gi-Oh” just in the quiet words of Roger Ebert’s “A Clockwork Orange”, “just talkative and boring.” to mention boring ones (I understand that I’m hypocritical here, given the sentence I just wrote). <br /> <br /> This wow lasts forever. I don’t know if there is a conspiracy, and static monsters have no Pokémon character. Even if you compare it with my favorite cartoon in childhood, this show sucks. Goodbye, sleep tight, dreams wet dreams.
