I borrowed this film because not only because its fun theme, but also the thought of role-playing game really intrigued me. I was pleasantly surprised that this was filmed in San Francisco since I live near SF. And, of course, it was nice to see pictures of the Castro district (although it seems to me that Castro is really more interested in gays than in women). But apart from that, I cannot recommend this film. The characters are not really developed for me to take care of them, and when they finally started playing role-playing games, I was already bored. And the role-playing scenes I saw were a bit awkward to watch. The game leaves much to be desired. Needless to say, I have not finished the movie. I would have missed it.
