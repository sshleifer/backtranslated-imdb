Impressionable! This is the worst SRK movie and one of the worst Bollywood films I have ever seen! I did not like the novel, but this film made it even worse! Very bad music, even worse actors (except, of course, SRK, even though he does not manage to save the film), and there is not much point. The director makes it all look very confusing, God knows why ... Maybe it's because he is trying to make it all look very surreal, and yet trustworthy. Well, he doesnâ€™t control either. <br /> <br /> Even if you have several free hours, do not watch this movie, please! (Saying this for your own good!) Keep looking, you will find something else to see!
