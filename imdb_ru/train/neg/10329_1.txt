I'm trying to portray the field for Dark Angel. â€œI think of the Matrix, I think of Bladrunner, I think of the girl who plays Faith in Angel, in shiny black skin - or some girl like her, leave this one with us. This can be done without any plot, dialogue, character, decent action or budget, just loud punches and hot chicks in shiny black leather sitting on a large pulsating bike. Is not it? <br /> <br /> Bright, shallow, dreary, formulaic, passionless, tedious, dull, dull, without humor, despotic, barely competent. Live anime action with no action or no life at all. SF just the way it likes Joe Fanboy. :(
