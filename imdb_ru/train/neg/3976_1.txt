The plot was boring, the girls were disgusting, and the alleged Italian man had clearly never heard of an Italian accent. Someone said that the boys were cute in this film, but it seemed to be filled with mediocre people. There were literally no useful features in this movie. <br /> <br /> I think this is a graveyard for actors who will never work again, except, unfortunately, for Olsen twins, who seem to fascinate people for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> I hope the Olsen twins will find something in the spotlight to distract them from the entertainment business. They have no place in it.
