Someone called Howard Koch a shlokmeister, but he wrote the script for "Casablanca", right? Or not. Maybe not one Koch wanders around in Hollywood, and I still donâ€™t love Casablanca too much. Wait a minute - yes, there is another Howard Koch sneaking around Hallwood. This is the one who wrote "Casablanca". Regardless of. I will put as much attention in this comment as Howard W. Koch in this production, that is, only a little. <br /> <br /> Do you know how it sounds? Someone read Cliff's Notes on King of Lear by Shakespeare and decided, since the Incoming Inspiration Express had no original thoughts to update it and make it hollywood with a happy ending. <br /> <br /> There are differences. Lear decides to divide his vast domain between the three sisters and, before doing so, asks them how much they love him. Two sisters rush to his feet and scrape their noses to get his money. The third is clever and refuses the opera on Lyra. But in the play Lear remains alive in order to regret his decision to give the two supporters his own hiding place and deprive an honest girl. He goes mad and is exposed during a storm in the swamps, puts flowers in his hair and hallucinates. Kids can do it with you. (Take, for example, my child. After all the efforts I spent on raising him, does he show any interest in becoming a doctor or a lawyer? No.) In the end, everyone in the play dies. <br /> <br /> In the film, obviously, the good sister is sullen and suicidal, but when she tries to break away from herself, someone jumps and rescues her, so the end is more or less happy. That is the difference between Hollywood and real tragedy, unless you have defined Hollywood as a self-sufficient tragedy.
