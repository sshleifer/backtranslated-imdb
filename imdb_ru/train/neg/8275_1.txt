(First of all, sorry for my bad English) Of course, only the film with Jessica Simpson in the lead roles can include serious nonsense like this .. I am Norwegian, and I felt offended and shocked that the creators of this film did not find the time to do their research while making this American / "Norwegian" film. Even Wikipedia is more accurate when it comes to facts about this country. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I publish my corrections due to my disappointment: - The country is called Norway, not Norway. - “Yes” is Russian, not Norwegian. - Norwegian priests never use these black capes with this white paper behind the neck, since the Protestant church dominates for a long time. It is true that we have local traditional folk clothes (which we use only twice a year), but the outfit in this film is more like a German outfit. -I could not understand the so-called "Norwegian" in this film .. Jessica had no meaning .. Neighbor made "Norwegian priests" <br /> <br /> The only thing I know is the Norwegian flag (and Viking hats, but it’s so stereotypical that people think of Norway as Vikings! but at least I have clarified something and got rid of this disappointment ..! <br /> <br /> I’m proud of my country and I’ll be happy if people in the United States will be less stereotypical and more accurate when they talk about this country. <br /> <br /> That was all .. Lenge leve Norg!; n
