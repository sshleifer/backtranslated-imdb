There comes this touching tale of hope. I hope you never have to endure anything so terrible again. * cough * Razzie reward * cough * <br /> <br /> I didn’t like this movie because it was unfunny, predictable and stupid. While watching, I felt I was in a psychological experiment to determine how low cinema standards can be obtained before people complain. When I asked for my money back at the end of the film, I was informed that, since I was watching all this, “I did not have the right to a refund”. An assistant manager told me that several people had already complained and received a refund. <br /> <br /> The film’s summary is pretty simple. A young thief steals a diamond and impersonates a child in order to elude the police. However, under this clever outline lies the repertoire of original, fresh and fun scenes. Or not. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself the following questions: Do you like to see how people get into pots? Do you like farting jokes? Do you like to see dwarfs posing as babies threatened with a thermometer in the anus? Do you like tired racial jokes? Do you think kids say “Goo Goo Goo Goo Goo Gaa Gaa”? Are you drooling? <br /> <br /> If you answered “yes” to any of the above questions, then this film is definitely for you. Although in some places it was announced as “The Worst Movie of the Decade”, there is probably a film or 2 that are worse ... somewhere. I can not say for sure. I gave this movie 2 stars, because we all know that a review with one star will indicate bias on the part of the reviewer, and then the review will not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> This low-profile comedy is intended for a less intelligent audience, and I cannot recommend it to anyone with a clear conscience. Save on something ridiculous. <br /> <br /> respect
