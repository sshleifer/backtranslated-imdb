The story of Cinderella, created for adults who live in a country of dreams. Romance is very unrealistic, vibrant, cute, perfect, etc. The Cinderella story to the very end and Shahid Kapoor is the only reason for my stars. If you're looking for a dreamy twist with a twist, this is definitely your movie, but for all of us real people, I highly recommend saving your three-hour viewing time. Wake up the people! <br /> <br /> Four out of five people who watched the movie with me would not recommend this movie. We had a great time beating up most unreal scenes. Maybe I’m missing something .. I just can’t believe that such a film can surpass classics like HDDCS !!
