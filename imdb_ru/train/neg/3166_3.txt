I confess that I have rather unpleasant feelings for ghost films, and although sometimes I enjoy the genre when it comes to horror, but when it comes to comedies, they really need to be crazy to be funny. “Above her dead body” seems to take the afterlife too seriously, and, in my opinion, it does not fit almost all aspects that I can think about. Of course, the story is absolutely unbelievable, and I failed to convince me in either the comic or the sentimental register. The choice of main actresses was terrible. While Paul Rudd is at least handsome and looks like a good guy, the taste of his character’s women seems to need serious improvement, since Eva Longoria seems too old (sorry), and Lake Bell seems too unattractive (once again excuse me). A romantic story without enough reason for romance is due to failure from the start. Jason Biggs and Lindsay Sloan were actually better, but they only had supporting roles. The rest is uninteresting and not inspired, with flat cinematography and cheap plugs borrowed from unsuccessful television comedies. Nothing really worth watching, nothing to remember.
