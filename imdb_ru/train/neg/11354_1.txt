Having also survived hundreds of children's films in the past, I believe that this is one of the worst that I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> 1) I resent these days, when I have to explain to my children that Russia is not “bad guys.” In addition, these mocking Russian names, such as Popchev, are inappropriate. <br /> <br /> 2) On the birthday scene of Grandfather Fly, there was a quasi-sexist joke in which he meant that men drink beer and women talk on the phone. The other two flies also unnecessarily use the word "shit" twice. <br /> <br /> 3) The whole film smacks of the stereotypes and propaganda of the 1950s, which, as I thought, we, as a nation, were proud to have risen higher. <br /> In general, this is just rude, poorly animated, even worse written and not worth wasting time watching.
