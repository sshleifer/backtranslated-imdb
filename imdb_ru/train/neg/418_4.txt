One might wish that an idea as good as that of an “invisible person” would work better and be more carefully processed in the era of fantastic special effects, but this is not so. The plot, characters and, finally, the last 20 minutes of the film are about as fresh as the film of the mad scientist of the early 50s. There are some wonderful moments, mainly because of the amazing special effects and the very idea of ​​an invisible person walking through the streets. But, alas, soon we will again find ourselves in the close conclusion of an underground laboratory, which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable, but also schematic. <br /> <br /> There have been so many remakes of old movies or TV shows over the past 10 years, and some of them have their own charms. But with each film it becomes clearer and clearer that the idea of ​​putting such passionate madmen as Verhoven (who has his own moments) to the classics is very bad. Obviously, money is the key issue here: time and energy invested in the script are far from sufficient, and as a result, “Hollow Man” is seriously undermined with the help of clichés, rich characters, predictability and the absence of any depth. . <br /> <br /> However, except for special effects, I was really impressed only by the curse. When creating this type of film, modern producers really want their children to see them. Therefore, the language (and sometimes violence and gender) is very relaxed. When the whole world explodes, the good guys say, “Oh, shit!” And “My God.” "Hollow Man" with gratitude rejects this kind of hypocrisy, and the characters can say that for them the most natural. I'm not saying that the most natural answer to something went wrong is to swear, but it makes it more likely if someone actually swears. I think we can thank Verhoeven for that.
