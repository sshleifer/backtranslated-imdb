Last night I was browsing our DVD-tower for something to watch. We were between NetFlix mailings, and it was a quiet Saturday evening. I pulled one out, which I had never heard of before, and realized that I had borrowed it from a friend. From the jacket, it sounded like a “Great Cold” plagiarism, but with the participation of all the stars, it felt worth seeing. Boy I was wrong !!! Not only was it like “Big Cold”, it was a robbery almost character after character. The character of Bill Paxton was a copy of William Hurt (the role of "where you have been all this time") - a warning spoiler - and, oh, a miracle, he is left behind to take care of the old place (house / camp). Kimberly Williams = Meg Tilly; jerk womanizer Matt Craven = Jeff Goldblum, etc., etc. I found myself wondering why I even watch these people. For me it was not enough developed character to find any interest in them. How did Unka Lou find these characters in general after 20 years? Plus it wasn't even funny, except that when Perkins fell, mistakenly “flopped” out of bed on the first morning, it was a sign, and I missed it. After it was over, I asked my wife: “Were there any cute characters in this movie? ... Are you sleeping there?” She replied: "No, I still think ... No, I can’t think about anything."
