The lack of content in this film impressed me the most. At first, I thought that people were going to compare this with Rock On! but I'm really surprised to say that it was worse than Rock On! So-so story The awful cast of Ajay Devgan Jamming with Salman Khan and Asin, you must be joking. The music was fine, Khanabadosh was a movie track, the rest was bad! Vipul Shah has not studied with Singh - King's critical comedy. Asin ... where she got from, sorry for the Asin fan, but she sucks badly in this film, seriously frightened, she didnâ€™t look good with a makeup overdose! My last verdict is to go watch Aladin with your family and not waste your time here.
