I am so disappointed. This film left me with a sense of the brokenness of my time and mental energy. Here and there again and again was the most important film of Woody Allen: high-class neurotic Manhattan people argue over whether they will deceive their spouses. Woody, I've already seen these characters, I've seen the story from you ten times already. Where did your creativity go ??? You need to open your eyes and look around. Since Annie Hall, the world has changed dramatically - and you need to change with it. <br /> <br /> There are much more interesting and funny scenarios to which you can apply your fear and neuroticism - why not try them? instead of rehashing the same old wash over and over and over. <br /> <br /> When I hear that Woody Allen has a new project coming out, he doesnâ€™t do anything for me - because now I was expecting his old reserve: a couple who are tired of each other and end up cheating. Sad and same old, same old. <br /> <br /> If Woody wants to return his fans, he must understand that our sense of humor and intelligence must be stimulated, not insulted.
