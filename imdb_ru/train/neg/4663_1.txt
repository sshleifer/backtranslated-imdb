This movie was just bad. I love war movies and I can usually move away from most movies and find what I liked, but it was not one of them. This film lacked pithiness and intensity. Well, the Finns staged a single fight, which is great, but the story is badly told. You have no real connection with any of the characters, and there is no real storyline to follow. You simply move from one random scene to another, nothing flows to form the story you are trying to convey. If you want a film about the war that will not let you get bored, and surprisingly enough without battle scenes, then I would suggest The Downfall (a German film of World War II). Or, if you prefer a great storyline and a lot of action, I would suggest The Brotherhood of War (Korean War / Korean film). These two films will not let you down like the Winter War.
