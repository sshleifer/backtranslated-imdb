As a fan of Eric Rohmer’s research on modern war between the sexes, I really wanted to see “Lady and Duke (L'Anglaise et le duc)” about how he would treat men and women during a real war. French revolution. <br /> <br /> The film looks beautiful, each scene is framed as a historical picture, as a living picture. And I expected a lot of talk, as this is Rohmer's style. But maybe Romer was restrained based on real female writing scenarios, which is why it was similar to the version of the Scarlet Pimpernel version. <br /> <br /> As horrible as the excesses of Robespierre et al., How about some recognition that the French aristocrats were spoiled assholes? I kept humming to myself: “Marat, we are poor / and the poor remain poor”; You can also choose a melody from “Les Miz”. <br /> <br /> I was not so sympathetic, since the central figure must go back and forth between her town house and country estate to stay ahead of the revolution. At some point her maid claims that the storeroom is bare, but, no doubt, it will be possible to lay out a wonderful dinner. I simply did not understand her, the English sympathizer who alternately rejects and protects her former lover and protector, as he and the Revolution continue to shift political focus; I think I should have sympathized with her consistency more than with their political machinations, like a character from the Scarlet Catcher. Hey, the only reason she did not return home was her shame after the affair and the child with the Prince of Wales or someone else. <br /> <br /> Certain changes in the relations between men and women usually occur during the revolutionary period, but I have not seen anything here. One day I went to a lecture by Herbert Marcuse, which ended with lengthy questions and answers; The last question from an audience member, much older than all of us ministers, damn her, she had gray hair: “Why are revolutionaries so dark?” They shouted at her, and Marcuse didn’t deign to seriously respond to it - but this is the only significant, what I remember for the whole evening. Romer demonstrates that counter-revolutionaries are also dark and didactic. <br /> <br /> (Originally written on 8/11/2002)
