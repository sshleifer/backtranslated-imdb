You understand that you watched the EXACT SHOW for eight years, right? I could understand the original curiosity of how strangers coexist on the island, but you might think that after watching the untidy, arrogant smelly heroes running through the bushes with an egg on a spoon for half a century, it will be enough to get you pledge to do something more original (and interesting). <br /> <br /> And I'm not even talking about the reality of the show, which is for the record, which I consider to be dubious. It’s just hard to stop the disbelief that the “fluffy bill” eats a rat when the entire team of producers and cameramen is housed in a bio-conditioned air dome that sizzles with frost moins. <br /> <br /> What is the appeal here? I don't care about these people or their wandering life. I just don’t understand. But if you REALLY find yourself captivated by hairy, unwashed people, I suggest you turn off the TV and just go on a trip to the local bus station where you can see such people in their TRUE habitat. They call them HOMELESS PEOPLE, and for free you can mess around and wonder at their uncanny ability to extract various cigarette wreckage from a variety of garbage cans, ultimately hitting “mud of dirt” and creating homemade cancer in the style of Dr. Frankenstein And yet, all the while asking people about the exchange of food, when the stinks of “Aqua Velva” on their breath are enough to suggest the opposite. And the best part? As in the case of the survivor, every week one of the members of the tribe "leaves" the "island" when he is unceremoniously sent to pack in a local institution when the frightening state of medical schizophrenia begins to act! Now THIS IS ENTERTAINMENT!
