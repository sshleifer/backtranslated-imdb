I have this movie. Not by choice, I do. I was very bored the other day, and the box intrigued me. Therefore, I inserted it into an old video recorder and spent the next hour and a half of my life shouting "why God, why?". The storyline wasn't as bad as a gamer, I could appreciate it. I think that maybe if you like romantic scenes with super-geek cheese, you will like this movie. "I always thought of myself as a Vulcan, whom you know, as Dr. Spock ... unable to love." Very little good can be said about this film; indeed, it is terrible. But if you want to make a really badly made film, then it is for you !!! The real story is much more interesting;) <br /> <br /> If I had to sum up this movie in one word, it would be: <br /> <br /> LAME
