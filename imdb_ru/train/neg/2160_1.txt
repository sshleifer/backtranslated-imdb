Gods ... where to start. I was only able to stomach for the first 10 minutes, before I turned it off with disgust. In addition to the actor playing Robin Hood himself, the rest were just awful. And so far I can only stretch my suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> From the very opening of the first episode, I lost count of how many mistakes, gaps in the plot and terrible costumes. It all started when a poor man tried to hunt deer in order to feed his family. All is well. However, the poor fellow must have been mostly deaf, because a handful of soldiers, in full armor, mounted on horseback, could sneak up to him with an accuracy of 10 feet. <br /> <br /> Then, when he ran far away, he goes from being 10 feet behind him to a shot where you cannot even see them, immediately following them about 20 feet behind him Then he bumps into the bushes and immediately finds himself in the hands of two soldiers ... who, just a few seconds before, were riding a horse, tens of feet behind him. <br /> <br /> “The armor” on the soldiers is so painful, obviously, the fabric that they tried to make similar to maille, and failed miserably. Not to mention the fact that the "armor" of the main soldier was about 5 sizes larger than for the poor fellow. Seriously, he looks like he's a little kid in his father's huge armor! Finally, Robin manages to make about 5, ideally aimed shots around the arm of one soldier, for a gap of about 2 seconds from what appears to be a bow. No living person could have made such shots in such a short time with a rifle with a sight, and especially with a bow. <br /> <br /> After that, they run away from the soldiers and stop to help them wonderfully well dressed and clean the “peasant” by digging ditches ... that all the nobles were ready to do all the time, right? How is it sorry for the series, which ever received the second season, I do not understand. Production costs (at least what I saw) must have increased by tens of dollars (or euros) ... <br /> <br /> Seriously - I think that the school drama class could improve the quality playback. It was so bad that even this horrible version of Kevin Costner’s Robin Hood was better. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend that you skip this monster and rent or buy the Robin Sherwood series of the mid-80s. Much better written, played, costumed and prepared. <br /> <br /> To shame, BBC ... to shame ...
