This film just walks in a circle, and the viewer does not know where they are. At first I thought ... mmmm, this may be a cool movie, but it just stretches and continues, and in the end you don’t know what is going on. The lead actress is a good actress and played her part well, and the psychopath is creepy, but after a while you don’t care what happens, because this film is simply delayed. It's a shame, in fact, everything could be much better. <br /> <br /> At least the main character and the psychopath had a good career, but they will remember this film for making it. or a film that they regret having ever done.
