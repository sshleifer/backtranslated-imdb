This move was on television last night. I think, as a filler of time, because he sucked badly! The film is just a reason to show some tits and ass at the beginning and somewhere halfway through. (Not bad tits and ass, though). But the story is too ridiculous for words. "Wolf", if you can call it that, is hardly shown completely, except for his teeth. When he is fully visible, you can clearly see that they had some interns working on CGI, because the wolf is running, as if he is running on a treadmill, and the CGI fur looks like he is waxed, all shiny :) < br /> The film is full of blood and gore, and you can easily determine who will be killed / cut / eaten as follows. Even if you like these movies with splashes, you will be disappointed, they did not cope with this task. <br /> <br /> Don't even start me as actors ... Very trite lines and girls scream at everything about every 5 seconds. But then again, if someone asked me to make a bad game, just to give me a few bucks, then, hey, where can I register? <br /> <br /> Altogether a boring and funny horror.
