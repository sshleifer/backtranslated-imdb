This film is a waste of time, the plot is terrible, the dialogue is terrible. <br /> <br /> The cast is all right, but the actors have absolutely no plot or script for the work. With the photo and some special effects, too, everything is in order, but again in this film there is nothing interesting to watch. In the story there is no logical progress, the storyline is complete nonsense. It's not even scary. For a film to be scary, there must be at least a small element of credibility. There is no likelihood in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are only three characters in the film. Each character is shallow and has no individuality. <br /> <br /> Most of the special effects and work with makeup are performed poorly or in most cases mediocre. <br /> <br /> I hope you read this and do not waste time on this film, if only It is curious to watch a completely horrible film.
