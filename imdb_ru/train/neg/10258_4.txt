Thanks to Father Pergado and the group of nuns, Earth should no longer exist. Christopher Lee (who has since said that his producers deceive him into appearing who told him that many great actors are involved in him) is Pergado's father, and he performs his usual serious and terrible routine. The cast is not so bad, although most of them have already left the game. The film has terrible sound effects (it seems, mostly created by pressing keys on an old computer), and sometimes it thinks funny - for example, it shows a sky scene that resembles hours at a time. Despite this, the story is quite funny in a world doomed to failure, and the production is adequate. Interestingly, Albert Band and his wife Jackie are depicted in the same scene; Meda Band; Writer Frank Ray Perilly and Assistant Charles Band Benn Burton. Despite his picky character, I sincerely wanted to see how it all worked, and I really liked it.
