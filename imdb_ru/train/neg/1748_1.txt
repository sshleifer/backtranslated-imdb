Do not waste your time with this film. This is a real thrash from the point of view of acting, directing, sound editing, soundtrack ... Some of the very good actors performed with such a meal. The film does not pay tribute to Pares Raval, who is perhaps one of the most talented actors in Bollywood. Akshay Kumar, who is also a new star, did a pretty bad job. John Abraham, what's wrong with him? Is that what you call acting skills? I mean, he has to thank God for having a beautiful face, otherwise he would have won Razzie's awards in India if there were such awards in Bollywood. Asran has a great talent, but he overdoses it as before. <br /> <br /> The script, not to mention the robberies from the 1965 Boeing, was rather poorly worded. First of all, people in Bollywood just can not do something original. In addition, they do not even know how to copy well. The jokes in the film were so exaggerated that it became painful to look at them. Priyadarshan may be a star in the south, but he is simply not suitable for making a decent Hindi film. Sound editing is surprisingly cheesy. I can continue in this matter, but the bottom line is that Bollywood should be ashamed to make such a film. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, some people seem to like this movie. What is wrong with you guys? That's why Bollywood is where it is. Do you know that Bollywood makes more films than Hollywood every year, but most films are unheard of abroad because of films like this one. I am an Indian, and I am very ashamed of Bollywood for creating this piece of trash. Films like Dil Chahta Hai and Lagaan were simply awesome. These are world-class films that are timeless ... among the best in this decade. Garam Masala, however, is perhaps one of the worst in this century. Period. <br /> <br /> I give him 1 out of 10.
