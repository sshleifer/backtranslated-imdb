This film was shown at the 2007 Sydney Film Festival. I did not expect the film because someone else chose it for me. <br /> <br /> I really like films that take time to develop, films that allow characters to unfold and allow stories to evolve. Immobility is good. But this film was rather slow. <br /> <br /> We must pay tribute to the two main actors. There was a feeling of tension between them when two completely different people, really losers, gathered very awkwardly. There were tender moments and sadness when we learned more about them. <br /> <br /> I also liked the setting and the way it was shot. It was claustrophobic and monochrome, and this added to the proximity of the film and reinforced the strangeness of the characters. <br /> <br /> I just donâ€™t understand the ending. What was the point of all this?
