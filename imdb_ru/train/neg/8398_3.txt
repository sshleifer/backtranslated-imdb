Shlocky 70s horror movies ... you gotta love them. Unlike today's boring clicks, these K-tel special effects actually do something scary and don't resort to a weary formula. <br /> <br /> This is film B about making film B ... it went terribly wrong. Faith Domegg (This Island Land) plays a major role in the movie “Queen of Cinema”, filming a series of horrific murders that befell the family in their home. Her boyfriend / director, who looks and behaves like Gordon Jump with this attitude, shoots on the spot and in a short time. Partner Ken Doll discovers a book of Tibetan chants, which they add to the script to add "realism." Unfortunately, “realism” is something they could do without. <br /> <br /> John Carradine, who has long ceased to look for the 17th gland (“Unearthly”), is now seeking a modest existence as a caretaker for real estate. He does his daily work, but he always seems to go against the director. <br /> <br /> Horror is growing slowly; the dead cat here, John Carradine enters the grave there, eventually ends with a family, but seven with murders. (At least in the advertisements there is some truth.) It's just sad that the ghoul did not understand that the film was made above him. How did poor Vera know that these damned Tibetan chants really work? Let's face it, you just can't pull over Satan's coat and expect him to take it in a lying position. <br /> <br /> Sterno says that an autopsy in the House of seven corpses.
