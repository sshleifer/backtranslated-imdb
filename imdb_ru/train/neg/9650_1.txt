Maan, where do I start with this horrible movie. Bad bad bad story. I donâ€™t know what the director was thinking about when filming this movie. To be honest, Namaste London was a pretty nice movie ... even the soundtrack was good. But in this ... oh my God ... for a film that should be musical ... the songs are sooo bad. A. R. Rahman was to become a music director. <br /> <br /> Given the two great actors, the director had to do a much better job. Although the first half sucks, the last 30 minutes of the film is fine. The performances of Salman and Ajay will save the film from complete disaster. <br /> <br /> See it if you have nothing to do. The last good movie from Bollywood that I watched (and I watch a lot of them) is Dev D and Wake Up Sid.
