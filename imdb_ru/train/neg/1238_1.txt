This remake of Tim Burtonâ€™s original 1968 Planet of the Apes (with Charlton Heston in the title role) is very far from the quality and plot of the original. <br /> <br /> Of course, special effects improved in 1968, but the spelling does not have. The characters were boring and the dialogue was terrible. I spent the whole movie with a friend (who, fortunately, only rented it) and fully understood why before Christmas all the Planet of the Apes toys in Target were in the trash can. <br /> <br /> My advice to Tim Burton: do not put this on your resume. <br /> <br /> My advice to everyone else: see the original 1968 film Planet of the Apes.
