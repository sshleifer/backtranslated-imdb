This film is not able to grasp the mystery and intrigue that the book offers. The essence of the book, ideas, are not even affected, and viewers are wondering why everyone thinks so much about them and why they are willing to risk their lives. <br /> <br /> character development is not at all good. No past or personal development leaves the audience really no concern for what happens to them, and therefore the sequence of actions does not work. <br /> <br /> The search for manuscripts ends abruptly, and without real explanation, without leaving a feeling of satisfaction from the fact that there was an entire search. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst adaptations of the book I have ever seen. This is terrible and a waste of time. If you have not read the book, skip the movie and read it. If you read the book, skip the movie and reread it. <br /> <br /> It is as if the purpose of the filmâ€™s creation was to discredit the book, that is, how bad and ridiculous this film is. This is also a shame, because it would be nice if they earned it at the height of their success, and they probably could get a good screenwriter and some good actors. <br /> <br /> Please don not waste your time, READ A BOOK !!!
