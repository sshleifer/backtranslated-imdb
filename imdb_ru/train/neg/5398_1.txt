This self-indulgent mess may have put an end to Mr. Branah’s career as a Shakespeare film adapter. (Released 4 years ago; since then, not a word has been said about adaptation.) I just finished watching it by telegram - God, this is terrible. <br /> <br /> I agree with the opinion of the reviewer below, who said that to consider something so obvious and sadly terrible is an inappropriate act that looks like shrill. At the same time, I would venture, if only because “Love's Labour's Lost” is the ideal reward for those who overestimated the directorial abilities of Mr. Branah in the past. Brana has always been a pretty lousy director: incredibly literal; star struck; unpardonably not generous to his fellow actors (he loves his American stars, but loves himself more, damn sure he gets all the good lines). <br /> <br /> Despite this, the sad fact remains that * Love's Labour's Lost * has hardly been worse than the endless, terrible, bloated Hamlet * since 1996. In fact, this film may be preferable, if only because its length is 1/3 of the length. Brana decided that it would be nice to update this early Shakespeare work for the environment of Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Fred Astaire, Yad Poison. Thus, he establishes this in 1939, leaving about one eighth of the text intact in favor of glaring interpretations of the standards of the thirties (wait until you see the actors raised on wires to the ceiling during “I am in heaven”) and actors not known with your dancing or singing (including yourself). As a result, there was such a surrealistic catastrophe that it overwhelmed that they simply did not cause a terrible halt to all of this after seeing the first daily newspapers. I don't even blame the actors. To paraphrase Hamlet, "The script is the thing!" None of them could work well together in this mess: the renowned RSC graduate is no better than Alicia Silverstone. Who could play this? <br /> <br /> The first mistake of Brana was that Love's Lab's Lost is a performance worth shooting. Believe me, it is not. This is an anomaly in the canon of Bard, written specifically for the educated group of courtiers, and not for the usual audience for which he wrote. Consequently, there are many precious (and Tedious!) Word games, references to modern scholastic nonsense, and parodies of Lily's Euphues. , in other words, it is hardly the kind of material that would appeal to a wide audience. Hell, this does not attract an audience already predisposed to Shakespeare's comedy. A piece cannot be produced without abruptly cutting out the text and desperately “updating” it with the help of any trick that comes to hand. In this regard, the question arises: why? <br /> <br /> The second mistake of Brana was that Shakespeare's pie with the play could be served with a side dish of marmalade Gershwin. Obviously, the idea or hope was to make the unintelligible Elizabethan exercise acceptable to the modern audience, while at the same time driving a nostalgic American pop culture. But again the question arises: why? <br /> <br />
