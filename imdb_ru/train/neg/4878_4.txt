If you want to make such a film, the threat must be real. Do not surround your cunt with a bunch of bosses. There is no trust. The plot is boring and incredible. The game is even worse. I thought I was looking at Arthur Lake (Dagwood), who is one of the worst actors in history, when I saw the main character. Well, okay, at some point he will have to face the music and go crazy. I don't care about you? In this strict cabinet there are all these long scenes (furniture made of cardboard or masonite). People talk, smoke and do nothing. Most of the action takes place in a five-minute sequence. After that, it's over. Do not worry
