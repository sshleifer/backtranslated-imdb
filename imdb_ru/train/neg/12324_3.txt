It was a robbery of the same garbage that we had to watch the owner of Bob Saget for half an hour before that. Dave Kyulier only thought he was funny, and it was pretty much the same show as America’s “funniest home videos”, except for those owners who have a total IQ of three. Tony Kiten must have really needed the money, and Kuller had to go to the trash can for his jokes. It was painful enough to see how he imitated Popeye and the other tangled animated series on Full House. That dude who played all the practical jokes at all, deserves to be on the receiving side of the rank A. Must have needed Kurlye money to please Alannis Morissett while they were dating.
