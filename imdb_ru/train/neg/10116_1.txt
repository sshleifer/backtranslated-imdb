I honestly want the last 30 minutes of my life back. <br /> <br /> The only person to watch this movie is Helen Keller. I kept telling myself that it should get better, it should get better. <br /> Then, finally, zombies appeared, and raccoon paints appeared in front of their eyes. <br /> <br /> They talked like ordinary people. <br /> <br /> One of them drove the car. <br /> <br /> A voodoo woman asked what one of the Zombies wanted, and the zombie said (I want to dance). <br /> <br /> (THIS WAS) I can no longer tolerate Can I sue for half an hour of my life?
