"Crazy" Eddie Murphy - a rude, rude and rude people. This is really the only way to describe this horrible, trashy case. Eddie Murphy prefers to shock, not laugh, trying to win his followers. He sometimes manages to be funny, but in most cases he loses the plot because of obscene vocabulary and unpleasant sexual jokes. <br /> <br /> Forget it! If you don't like Eddy's nasty style. I don't think I'll worry about Eddie Murphy Row. I prefer Eddie as part of the movie script. <br /> <br /> Saturday, January 17, 1998 - video
