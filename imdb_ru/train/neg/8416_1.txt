It makes sense for me that this film gets a delight from Hollywood, because often in Hollywood it's just a popularity contest. It also makes sense when you think that people who like the film can simply react to the countless songs they put on you, not the content of the story. However, this film is overvalued and overblown. Eddie Murphy looks ridiculous. Jennifer Hudson and Beyonc√© Knowles in no way give an Oscar rating, so many were delighted before the movie was released. I can't even believe that Condon is going to be promoted to the post of director Oscar when he just put together an album. Glitz does not replace the storyline with anything. A bunch of songs are not from the movie do.
