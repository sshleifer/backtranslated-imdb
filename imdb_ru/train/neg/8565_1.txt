Sorry. Someone has to say this. It really was a boring movie. Perhaps worthy, but nonetheless boring. I almost cried from boredom when I watched it. The acting game is pretty terrible, the story is drawn out and predictable, the score and camera work are completely standard and uninteresting. This is one of those films that you can't hate (because itâ€™s about people with disabilities), but I hate it, I suspect that almost everyone does. Interestingly, the critics were so kind to this film. I suppose they are not allowed to be objective either. It was made to win awards - which I remember properly done. But it was neither interesting nor interesting. I did not see the play, so I can not compare.
