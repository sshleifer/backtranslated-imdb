This film seemed too long, even in just 75 minutes. The problem with jungle horror films is that there are always too many shots (through the jungle, on a rocky cliff, near a river or lake) to count the running time. The film is worth a look at the funny and naked local zombies with large bulging, bloody eyes, which is always accompanied by a soundtrack with heavy breathing and lots of reverberation. Eurotrash fans will be entertained by bad English voice acting, gratuitous female flesh and very silly makeup works on the monster and local extras. For Zombie / Cannibal, this was pretty easy, but then I probably didnâ€™t see the uncut version.
