Poor Whoopi Goldberg. Imagine her at a friend's party, and she adds a commentary on the ongoing political debate. People just look at her and say, “Oh, what would you know, you were the star of Theodore Rex.” How could you take her seriously after she sank down to become the star of this terrible shit? Even small children will be horrified by this thing. It reminded me of a particularly bad episode "Zygmund and Sea Monsters". In fact, if you think about it, Zygmund greatly surpassed that. <br /> <br /> And how did it come about? Give the manufacturer an illegal substance before telling him about it? Watch this abominable abomination at your own risk.
