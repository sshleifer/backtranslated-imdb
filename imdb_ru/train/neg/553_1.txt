After waiting impatiently to the end, I must say that I would like not to join the whole series from the very beginning. The final episode was all against the previous seven years. It all ruined. The journey lasted 23 years, but Captain Janeway has the right to shorten it ... let's say, only seven years. Why seven? Why not just one? Or nothing? Why not avoid the whole adventure? Crew members died all the way. Why does she want to save only seven of nine? The rest does not count or how? The funniest part is when the team says that returning home is not the most important thing for them. As the saying goes, “travel is more important than destination”. Incredible. And on the final scene, they are surrounded by other Federation ships, and the Earth is in sight. Nothing about landing, getting back to normal. <br /> <br /> The worst ending ever.
