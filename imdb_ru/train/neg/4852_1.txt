I saw this movie once, and I thought that everything was in order. Then my friends at work said: "Look again, better." So I did. And, to my surprise, it was worse the second time! There is a limit on the number of words, so I'm going to transfer the ball here. <br /> <br /> - All the bombing scenes were so stupid. Why on earth would anyone wait for an explosion ??? - None of the characters here are even remotely cute. Not the first time, not even the second. <br /> <br /> - Oh, and the last time I checked, the car doesn’t explode from a single shot, and such a huge fire cannot be put out with a tiny fire extinguisher ... is it really 3/10 viewers watched the movie ??? “The camera is so shaky, I can hardly tell what is happening.” In that introductory scene with a robot, my stomach was displaced, the rest of the film was not much better. <br /> <br /> - Sniper scene. The McManus brothers (from the Boondock Saints) rolled their eyes, it was so stupid. First of all, why did the guy plant his weapon where one person was shot? In addition, why would he spend so much time cleaning bullets, reloading, aiming, and NOT on a shot, when there is so much chaos around him? -SAS type to run instead of stay and fight back ?????? Yes ????? Soldiers ... gay ... ??? I didn’t want to sound homophobic, but to be honest, this scene was so ridiculous. <br /> <br /> - Too long for own good, but too small for the amount of material that was squeezed into it. Bigelow seems that the more action the better. It seems that she is not right - the film is full of unnecessary scenes added there to distract you from the lack of a central plot. I know that “The Watchmakers” are 163 minutes longer, but at least this film has not tightened. This film, on the other hand, does, and for this, it seems, longer. <br /> <br /> The only good thing was Renner, who was satisfactory at best. But do yourself a favor, just skip this, and do not be deceived.
