Watching this, I mostly noticed the placement of advertisements. DHL, Aquawhite Strips, Rockstar and more. This one product placement after another. It is clear how this film received funding. Jessica Simpson's "Game" is laughable. Any Dick should never get a job because he plays the same lame character. “History” is just the background for this very long commercial. I cannot believe that this film was even considered for theatrical release. The longer you watch this movie, the more you are ashamed of all the participants. The only insignificant saving grace is Larry Miller and Rachel Lee Cook, who have almost no time to screen in the role of Jessica's cousin. I'm embarrassed, I watched it all. I would recommend avoiding this.
