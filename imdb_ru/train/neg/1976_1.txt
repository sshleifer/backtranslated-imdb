How is it possible that such a bad film can be made. Bad game Bad script Just embarrassment around. Itâ€™s just one bad cliche after another. <br /> <br /> There are several celebrities in this movie. Unfortunately, they are singers, not actors. <br /> <br /> This film brought almost no money for a good reason. The appeal of black cowboy movies simply does not exist. Wish they had a good story to tell. <br /> <br /> There are several celebrities in this movie.
