Well, no, not really. This is not a very good movie, but it is not as bad as I thought. I really didn’t feel cut off from my rental money, and sometimes that’s all you can ask for. The plot is fine, nothing brilliant or new, the acting is pretty bad, but the cast is good. The direction is passable, but the consequences are terrible, especially the effects of the werewolf, which in the film about werewolves is quite a big problem. It was a pretty decent amount of nudity, which is a pretty good thing for me, but it was not so hot. In general, this is a fairly average straightforward movie, not the worst movie I've ever seen, and if you're a bored fan of the genre, watch it somehow. I would even watch it again. <br /> <br /> A horror fan bonus, Kane Hodder (Jason Forhee in several of them) plays a werewolf.
