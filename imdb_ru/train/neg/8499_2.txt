This is the thing that only now excites the film heads of the film. In the end, Feierstein's Flex Crush will make you know that real men are not looking at Truffaut. <br /> <br /> It might be interesting if Truffaut said anything here. The motive “camera as a voyeur” was not new. Have we all forgotten De Scyne's "Bike Thief"? Or something from Hitchcock? <br /> <br /> Thus, all we get is an extended metaphor of a minor in the role of Truffaut, who spends all his free time on “squinting his eyes” on films, destroying discipline in the class, and blaming . plagiarism (many petty thefts), and ultimately avoids social boundaries in order to make “your own film”. Sorry ... was there, did it too many times for it to matter.
