SCARECROWS, it seems, a spoiled horror meets a supernatural movie. A group of mobsters commits a militarized payroll burglary at Camp Pendleton in California. They took over the cargo plane that kidnapped the pilot and his daughter with demands to be delivered to Mexico. On the way, one greedy robber decides to save money landed on a cornfield, followed by strange-looking stuffed animals. These are not just ordinary stuffed animals ... they can kill. The game is no better than terrible dialogue. And the attempts of humor are not ridiculous. The budget is very low and is removed completely in the dark. <br /> <br /> Cast: Ted Vernon, Michael David Simms, Christina Sanborn, B.J. Turner, Phil Senderland and Victoria Christian.
