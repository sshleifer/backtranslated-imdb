A sentimental school drama, staged in Denmark in 1969, We Shall Overcome offers a pathetic Danish understanding of US culture. Fritz (Janus Dissing Ratke), obsessed with flowers, a naive 13-year-old, comes out with a half of his ear hanging from the office of the cruel master Lindum Svendsen (Bent Making). Lindum-Svendsen, the principal, portrayed as a fascist tyrant, controls the local community. Lindum-Svendsen went too far this time, and with his father recovering from a mental disorder (of course, there wasn’t enough drama ..) and the overly stereotypical hippie music teacher Mr. Swale (“Hi, call me Freddy”) Fritz for justice. <br /> <br /> Say what. This is so unconvincing, excessively (method-) acted and so full of suffering that this grotesque picture of the "family", filled with a cliché-excuse for the film, fails miserably to convince a non-Scandinavian audience. Sorry, good Danish readers to bump into your sentimental travel this way ... But this is definitely NOT a story about "a boy becoming a man fighting a system." The boy never becomes a man, but remains naive, with big eyes. If you call a church of small little people headed by a dictator, like a cartoon character, “system”, sorry if something is missing. <br /> <br /> If you like family photos go look happy legs instead ..
