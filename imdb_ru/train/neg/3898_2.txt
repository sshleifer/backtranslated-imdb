I'm sorry, I know that Fassbinder is still called one of the greatest directors of post-war Germany and that most of his films are considered “masterpieces”, but when I see “Lily Marlene” today, in 2004, I wonder that everyone knows this movie! The game is just awful - Hannah Shigulla is all smiles like an idiot! “The changes between Nazi glamor and the battlefields are ridiculous, the whole movie looks like it was made in two days in the attic.” Perhaps it was so, and many people perceive it as “real art”, but for me this film is simply bad and cheap. Compare this with Viscontis "La Caduta degli Dei" and tell me again that "Lili Marleen" is a good movie ...
