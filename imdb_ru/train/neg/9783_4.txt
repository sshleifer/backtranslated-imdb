Not the worst movie I've seen, but definitely not very good. I myself am a paintball player, I used to play a lot of aerobol, and the transition from the forest to the aerobol is a pretty big change. The film depicts similar qualities. First of all, the film begins with this team, which, obviously, is trying to shoot this “phantom” guy or something else, they seem to be a professional team and wear T-shirts and remove magicians, carcokers. One guy is sporty thick. Not so bad with the film, but more than that, as it is perceived, it was very stupid. A bunch of guys who are good guys are forest soccer players who don’t seem to have much money and a dream of getting the “best weapon”. The other team constantly throws them up and insults them because they play forest and blah blah blah. The ghost helps these guys from woodsbol teach them and all this nonsense, he forces them to play the balloon and basically wins all the teams, including the “professionals”. <br /> <br /> So what’s wrong with the movie? Well, the budget is a huge thing, the paintball film WILL NOT be bad, but the budget is quite low, and it seems that the film was made by an amateur. There are no big names in this movie, and the acting is very foolish. The perception of paintball is also pretty bad. It seems they mean everyone goes to the speedball and all that shit. In my opinion, it was a lousy film, and it does not give a real idea of ​​what paintball is. Honestly, a real paintball is not exactly a friend, it’s a lot of curses and bonuses, not “respect” and playing by the rules. Do not watch this movie, and then expect to go to the field with a cry of "4 - 1 !!"
