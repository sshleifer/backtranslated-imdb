Having decided to collect Billy Bob Thornton films some time ago (because of cool films such as Sling Blade, Simple Plan, and The Man Who Wasn't There, among others), it was inevitable that there would be a strange turkey there. However, I did not realize that this could be bad. I'll give you an idea of ​​how incredibly poor this film is - the most amusing dialogue in it is: “Knock, knock,” “Who is there?”, “Big smelly person”, “Big smelly person, who?”, “Big the stinky man is YOU! ” Yes, guys, this is really so bad. Billy Bob is only about two minutes in it (I guess he needed a job at the time in his career), and the rest of the film is painful. For some reason, although it is certainly terrible, I do not hate it. This is probably because I put my rage on any high-budget trash with special effects, such as “The Fast and the Furious,” and not on a ticketless film like this one. 2/10 in the push.
