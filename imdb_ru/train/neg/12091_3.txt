Well, Canti artists may have liked this movie, but I'm afraid not me. If you like the movie, in which the footage is delayed so long that you wonder whether the actor or the operator fell asleep for lunch, then this may be for you. Much of this is like this with a short stay in the realm of trouble. I did not find it shocking or disturbing, as some other reviewers are just a little unpleasant and pointless. The only reason I didnâ€™t give this star was because the acting was worthy of praise and the film was pretty good shot. The plot, however, can recommend little. Most of the film simply shows a grumpy woman teaching or listening to the piano, which some people might like. But lest you think it is harmless enough to be ready for some bits of pornography and sexual assault, only to wake you up with a bad taste in your mouth. Not recommended.
