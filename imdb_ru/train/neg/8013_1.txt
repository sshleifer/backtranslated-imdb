You would think that a film about how a young man reconciled with his growing homosexuality would not be boring at all. Think again. These products should be bottled and sold as a cure for insomnia, because it is about ten times more effective than any sleep aid on the market. Itâ€™s almost as if the director * thought * to make a film, but became lazy and decided instead to launch a series of random (and randomly boring) images and scenes from nowhere, add a couple of real scenes with real actors, to pretend that good lighting doesn't matter the process of making the film, and wrap it under the cover of the movie "arthouse". This is exactly the crappy product that allows many traditional filmmakers to easily bypass the movement of indie films and does not allow the general public to perceive indie films easier. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in films devoted to this topic, you will be much better able to customize some of the short films available on the Logo website, or hire Get Real. Better yet, read Stone Butch Blues. Whatever you do, skip this lingering piece of trash.
