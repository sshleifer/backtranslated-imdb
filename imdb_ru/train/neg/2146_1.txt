I'll just lay it out here, it was the worst sequel to the classic Disney movie I've ever seen. In 1950, Disney released what I call one of his greatest films of all time. Now remove the wonderful songs, add a bad storyline that resembles the story of a lost TV show. "Connect it and what will you get?" the biggest load crud I've ever seen. After I saw this, I thought it was over for Disney. Cinderella was supposed to end with the fact that "they lived happily ever after." not this garbage. This film did not deserve such a continuation. I thought it would be like a “turn in time,” which was moderate, but better than this. Also, what do we care about Anastasia? She went to the other side, as Iago did, but it did not help anyone.
