Garson Kanin wrote and directed this look at the “modern day” of Las Vegas and the generation gap, his first directorial work since the 1940s! David Janssen is somewhat mistaken as the owner of a large casino who is reunited with his son (Robert Drivas, who looks embarrassing like the elder Jason Bateman). Janssen approaches each scene in the same way: in defense, with a chip on his shoulder. Going through this role coolly and naturally demands too much from Janssen, who barks at everyone, like a grumpy inflated husband (he even chews Don Rickles and makes him cry!). His son, succeeding in his search for his own personality, makes fashionable comments on how young people look down on Vegas (give them another ten years), and his disapproval of his father’s lifestyle causes friction. Brenda Vaccaro is cute as a shy secretary, and Edie Willims plays like a dancer at the audition. Unfortunately, “Where It Is” has nothing else but the now obsolete reflections on ethics between adults and their children, some quick shots of T & A and funny satirical bits in the world of high stakes - most of which are already covered to nausea. ** from ****
