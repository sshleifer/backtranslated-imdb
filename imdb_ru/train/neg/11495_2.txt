It was one of the loudest films we watched over the past few months, with a predictable storyline and a rather bad game (mostly from supporting characters). The interview with Hugh Laurie on DVD was actually more useful than the film itself ... <br /> <br /> Hugh Laurie obviously made a lot of efforts to learn how to dance samba, but the scale of his character just required he will plunge into the children's part of the pool. The film is based on the appearance of a beautiful girl and great music, but they are not enough for good entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you've never seen Rio or a British bank inside, this film is for you. 2 out of 10.
