I bought this film because it was the debut of Shah Rukh Khans. And I also wanted to see how he would do it. I must say that he does an excellent job with his role. Divya Bharati is great in this film. Rishi copes with his work. OK. Alok Nath was good in his role. Amrish and Mohnish also coped well with their role. Dalip was also good at his little role. Actors starred in the movie "Mediocre." The direction is average. Editing is bad. He tells us about Ravi, the famous pop singer. He has a lot of fans. One of them is Kaajal. Ravi and Kaadzhal fall in love and get married. Ravi is killed by his cousins. Kaadjal becomes a widow. Cousins ​​Ravis. They go to Bombay. She is facing Raja. She falls in love with him and gets married. Ravi is back. History is predictable. The climax is predictable. The first half is boring. saved by actors and music. The second half is entertaining. The music catches the eye with some good songs. Cinematography looks outdated in the first half, but it looks inconceivable. Pictures of songs are boring, with the exception of "Sochenge Tumhe Pyar" and one song of rain. The costumes are outdated. Anyway, watch this only for actors and music. Rating 4/10
