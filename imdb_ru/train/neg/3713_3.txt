DOWN TO EARTH / (2001) * (out of four) <br /> <br /> Blake French: <br /> <br /> “Down to earth” is such a misleading and desperate comedy because of which sitting at home sofa, watching on TV scene comedy show Chris Rock, looks like a paradise. Speaking of heaven, the film is based on the 1978 film Heaven Can Wait. It was a good film, and it’s good to demonstrate how a group of aspiring screenwriters can take decent material and turn it into garbage. Directed by Chris and Paul Weitz, almost all targets are missed. From concept to story-telling, “Down to Earth” fails; This is an incredibly bad production. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock is a lousy comedian, both in his role in this film and in real life. He plays Lance Barton, whose manager, (Frankie Faison), even regrets him when he is booed off the stage during an amateur night in a local theater. Shortly after the script establishes his lack of talent, the character is killed by an accelerating truck. The death played by Eugene Levy made a mistake by taking Lance before his number grew. God's assistant (Chazz Palminteri) is very angry and decides to allow Lance to take the remaining time on Earth, while he takes the only accessible body of a 60-year-old white millionaire. <br /> <br /> The old man is Mr. Wellington, whose life has his problems. His wife (Jennifer Coolidge) has an affair with his assistant (Greg Germann), who takes away his money. But that's all right, because Lance inside Mr. Wellington fell in love with a young black woman named Sontie (Regina King). Meanwhile, there are plans to kill Wellington, Lance is trying to get a better body, and Santi’s confused feelings about the hospital situation related to Mr. Wellington’s finances. <br /> <br /> Down to Earth has some good ideas, but they are in a meaningless and unconvincing love story filled with tricks and recycled material. The biggest problem he faces is how we perceive Lance as Mr. Wellington. Chris Rock is an actor with popularity and publicity, so he will not be absent in most of this film; All characters see Mr. Wellington in the new Lance, but we see him as Chris Rock. This is convenient for a love story; we believe that the young woman will fall in love with Lance, but in fact he is an old gray-haired eccentric. This is not so convincing. <br /> <br /> It is assumed that in the comic situation with one joke we observe how the old man does the funny things that the young black man does. But what inspires laughter is when the characters face conflicts without their knowledge. Just look at Mary's Something. In funny scenes, the characters are subjected to awkward experiences, and not of their own free will. Here Lance knows that he is in the body of an old man, and does what the old people usually do. If Lance did not know the body in which he was, he might have potential. <br /> <br /> Another problem with the concept: we never knew Mr. Wellington, so how can we compare Lance in his body when we don’t know how he was originally. To top it off, Chris Rock should be the center of attention, and makes the character look too much like Doom. He tells simple routine jokes that are tedious and painful; his dialogue is so obvious, wooden and direct. I hated the film's sense of humor. There are so many unfunny jokes and horrible comic situations. It's like watching Chris Rock - it's Chris Rock, not the character in the movie. <br /> <br /> We emphasize the positive moments in the film “Down to Earth”. Mark Addy does not do anything worse here than in the "Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas". Eugene Levy and Chazz Palmentar are well played, but they are dominated by a scalped script. These are all the good qualities that I can mention now, and if you give me another week to remember, I’ll hardly come up with more.
