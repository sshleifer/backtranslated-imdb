Hearing about George Orwell's prophetic masterpiece in my whole life, I am now 37 years old, but without reading the book, I absolutely do not understand what I had just seen. <br /> <br /> I am very familiar with the concepts described in the novel, as I am sure most, but only on the basis of rumors and quotations. Without this limited knowledge, this film would have been a complete mystery, and even with that I am still no more aware of the history of 1984 than before watching. <br /> <br /> On the positive side. .. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is awesome, Hurt & Burton show wonderful performances, and the overall impression of the film is amazingly dark and deserted. The prostitute scene was a fantastically dark cooking film. <br /> <br /> Now about the shortcomings, and there are a lot of them ... <br /> <br /> There is a war (at least in relation to propaganda), but why and with whom? Nothing is explained. There are several names (Eurasia, etc.), But they mean nothing without an explanation. <br /> <br /> Who is Winston? what does he do? where is he from? where he works? Why does he change the news? why is he not on the front line? Why he does not eat food in the dining room? What is this drink that he drinks through the whole movie? Why is he so weak and sick? Why isn't he brainwashed like everyone else? What is the matter with his mother and sister? What happened to his father? A small background would be good, without any scrub that would be necessary for people like me who did not read the book. Without it, it’s just a tangled and hard-to-see art-house film that constantly makes you wonder what is really going on. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was disconnected and poorly edited, and constant chatter from Big Brother screens flooded the dialogues in places, making it even harder to understand what was going on. I agree that it may have been an artistic choice, but it is still very annoying. <br /> <br /> Also, I know that this is mentioned earlier, but why all the nudity? It seemed completely useless, and I felt that it was added there to make up for the absence of any plot. <br /> <br /> I personally cannot accept the fact that Hollywood feels that he has to explain words from subject lines. per word these days. We are not all brainwashed simpletons, but this is somewhat far apart. I can only assume that it is entirely based on the fact that you read the book, because if this film is indeed a “literal translation”, which, as I have seen, many people say, it would be very difficult for me to understand why 1984 proclaimed as a classic. <br /> <br /> One cannot deny that these were light years ahead of their time and largely predicted every change in our society today (perhaps it was a kind of bible for isn't it?), but many - fantastic novelists did the same, leaving no gaping holes in the storyline. <br /> <br /> I think I should do what I should have done from the very beginning, and buy a copy of the book if I am going to figure it out. <br /> <br /> In general, I am very disappointed that I have been waiting for years to look.
