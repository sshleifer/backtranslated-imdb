the guy who wrote, directed and stared at this shocking piece of garbage should really think about changing the guardian. Yes, Rob Stefanyuk, I mean you! Seriously, who financed this shit? There are so many talented writers who are better off spending money. I think the idea is great, but acting, screenwriting and directing are just awful! Jokes are not funny, I understand that they should have taken mickey. BUT do it with style, this film screams live parodies in 1995 on Saturday night. Why, I say again, why studios give money to hackers like Rob Stefaniuc - NEVER GIVE THE COMEDIAN THE OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE DIRECTLY AND STAR IN YOUR OWN FILM OF SPIRITS
