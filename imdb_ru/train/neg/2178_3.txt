I would have liked this film a little more if it were not for Jason (Herb) Evers, who constantly rests on the experiment. Many early reviewers of the Seven Samurai accused Toshiro Mifune of replaying. However, since more and more critics viewed this film, they saw that it was purposefully shot. Jason Evers is obviously not Toshiro Mifune, and his replay is just that. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors in this classic B were pretty good, with the exception of Evers and the show girls. If you watched this movie, you would notice how Evers screams almost every line until he smokes and blows smoke from his nose. <br /> <br /> The special effects were on par with the course in the movie “B”, such as this one. Looking back, I don't think there is anything fantastically good or bad about this movie.
