I have always admired Susan Sarandon for her honesty and honesty in her personal life, as well as her talent as an actor. Therefore, it seemed to me strange that she would appear in a film that distorts these facts so much. A Canadian charter company from Edmonton, Albert, who flew a Canadian Twin Otter, rescued her character from the South Pole. The trip was rejected by the air force, the navy and the US Coast Guard as going beyond their capabilities. The same company a few years later organized a similar rescue, in order to withdraw a person from the base of the South Pole. I feel that the film rightly presented a very exciting topic and documented a very courageous woman, facing a frightening task. I do not understand why manufacturers consider it necessary to ignore the courage of the rescue pilots and show the rescue plane as the US Air Force in Hercules.
