Best of the Best 4, better than 3, but barely. Basically, I say this because part 4 does not contradict parts 1/2 (like 3 does), (that is, they are not related to Tommy Lee, who has brothers and sisters). <br /> <br /> In any case, I liked the Russian storyline of the story, and especially the episodic role of Sven Ole Thorsen in the role of Boris. In addition to this, although several scenes of struggle, the film is not something special. The limited budget is also very noticeable (especially in the scene of an airplane explosion). <br /> <br /> In addition, part 4 has no morality or, say, nothing like part 3, there are a couple more famous actors (Hudson, Thorsen) in the fourth part, but alas, nothing like the beginning of the series ( and even these characters have very small roles). <br /> <br /> Alas, it seems that the best of the best is the Rhee show, and, frankly, he cannot carry the film. <br /> <br /> Seen on the tape, Rating: 4
