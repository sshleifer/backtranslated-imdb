While I recently gave OPERATIONAL PETTIKUAT a positive review, I really did not like this film, although it had a lot in common. Both were made in just a few years, both played the lead role of Cary Grant, and both were comedies of World War II. However, the overall tone and style of the films were very different. KISS IT FOR ME, on the whole, just looked like a cheaper film - with poor writing, a small amount of energy and VERY ample opportunities - even compared to OPTATION PETTICOAT. I think that at least most of the blame for this lies with the casting of Jane Mansfield. The combination of her abundant talents and limited acting skills really made this budget film look like a 3rd studio film. Plus, there was not much chemistry or energy in conjunction with Cary Grant - an actor usually loved for his grace and class. This is similar to Sir Lawrence Olivierâ€™s connection with Marjorie Mine.
