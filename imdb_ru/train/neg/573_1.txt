The last reviewer was very generous. I like the first movie, but I can't say that I like it very much. The beginning is tolerable, but it is going pretty fast. I just don’t see John Bon Jovi as the “hunter for bad vampires” and the vampire princess isn’t sexy and not scary. Many scenes just do not make sense. I mean that any normal person might suspect that something happened when a strange woman suddenly appears from nowhere to tempt you, not to mention an experienced hunter. Why is Una able to communicate with Jovi? Nothing was ever explained in this film, you would not mind if it was interesting, but it was too much to ask. This is supposed to be one of the worst vampire movies I've seen.
