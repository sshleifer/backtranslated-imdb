This game has (not) the honor of being the first game that I stopped playing right in the middle, and it seemed to me that it breaks into pieces and then burns. Congratulations. FIRST AND LAST Tomb Raider I will ever play, I assure you. <br /> <br /> Plot: Just typing that word, I laughed. There are none. There is also no character development. Finally, we have a heroic girl who can take care of herself, who is not “squeaking” Mary-Sue, but, unfortunately, she dresses like a whore, and her breasts are huge. You see, they should have attracted sexist gamers. In any case, all she does is go to the tomb after the tomb, shooting things while she goes ahead. Why she does it, I have no idea. I had subtitles on TV. as loud as I could, and I still do not understand what the hell. The development (or lack of it) for her, her two friends and * villains * was ridiculous. There will also be levels through which you must pass, which do not give you any hints of what you should do next, and you will literally be in most boring, like hellish Tomb HOURS, trying to figure out what the hell you are supposed to do. There is one course (of two), in particular, with her on a motorcycle (believe me, this is not fun at all), which you will be taking for an hour without a save point. This means that other motorists and guys in vans that shoot at you are knocking you down, or you are hitting the tree, and you are starting an hour-long hike. COMPLETION. <br /> <br /> Boss, stupid F * ck: You know what levels allow to do for a very long time, basically have no save points, have no history, no character development, do not give any diversity in the game process, have most of the music is at the longest levels of bleeding from the ears, and do not give any clues to the player so that they can stay even longer in place, instead of getting to a non-existent plot. <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck one: It sounds like ideas to shake up. <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck two: I agree. Who needs character development, plot or boring gameplay. <br /> <br /> Todd: Sorry, sir, but it seems that these ideas will scare the player away. <br /> <br /> Boss stupid F * ck: Shut up, Todd. You're fired. <br /> <br /> Gameplay: all she does is shoot. Of course, she can roll over while shooting, jump while shooting, or kick when she shoots again. But turning over, jumping and kicking do not erase the fact that all she ultimately does is shooting. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Boring Music: The intro music is very beautiful. I love listening to it. The music in the game goes from bearable to the desire to cut off your ears. <br /> <br /> Visual effects: Considering that this game was made in 2006, I expected the visual effects to shock me. Well, I was blown up, but definitely not in a good way. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: this game has no plot, no entanglement in character development with barely dressed unassuming (THANK YOU) young women at the head who pass through boring tombs for some boring reason (that this may be, I can't tell you) with unimaginable gameplay shooting. Stay away from this. !!!!!!!! He gets two stars for the fact that he has a woman who does not suffer from a girl (no matter how scant she is) and from beautiful music.
