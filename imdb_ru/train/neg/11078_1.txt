honestly, where do i start! It was a low-budget, HORRIBLE film, it was so crappy that we all burst out laughing at how backward it was! the sword battle scenes were not even sword battles, they played with plastic swords that they bought at Wal-Mart, and all they did was just moan, trying to make them look like they were fighting !! Once, my family and I were in the mood for a really good action movie, so we decided to go to the store and look for it, and there was the movie “Sawtooth Island”. I mean, it looked so great, but when we watched it at home, I practically died after the first scene. <br /> <br /> Yes, and the plot of the film, the plotline, the script, and so on. D. There were lots of garbage that I don’t even know why the director and producer even wasted their time doing it !! But if you happen to stumble upon this film .. don't get it !!!!!
