Basically a typical propaganda film about a past good war. But there were a couple of things that startled me. First, it was the use of oral epithets. On two occasions, Scott’s character utters once, once at the beginning, when he drops his bomb from the target during the bombardment (“hell”), and once when he tries to force the bomber to become a pilot (“s *% t”). "). I may be wrong about the second copy, but I reproduced it several times, and this is how it looks to me. The third case is when the character of Ann Shirley wishes the hero O'Brien goodbye and good luck ("Give them hell") over the roar of the engines. She must have thought it was too unpleasant, because she clearly says “damn.” I also found an interesting character who has moral problems with the bombing, in particular with the bombing of civilians. A senior avuncular officer assures him that only combat targets will be hit because of the accuracy of the used sight. Given what we know about LeMay’s later strategy of setting fire to Japanese cities to oblivion, this scene plays with a little irony. I remember McNamara quoting LeMay in The Fog of War, something like the fact that if the US does not win the conflict, he will be judged as a war criminal. The ending is very overloaded, according to the film. It reminded me a bit of the end of White Heat (I don’t compare films, just the ending!). Maybe it's just because they blew it up. Blew very well !!!
