Gung Ho was a good idea, but you should ask Americans to understand the dynamics of American employment and foreign competition. In this film, the main character Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) goes to Japan and convinces the Japanese car company to come. to America and help his dying city of Pennslwia. Two things come to you. Firstly, why does a Japanese company come to America to make cars, when they do it, and so good at it? Secondly, can anyone understand that American companies of all types are sent to third world countries to manufacture their products in order to avoid American labor costs? This makes the assumption of the film that the number one car manufacturer in the world will go to one of its main competitors (except Germany) and declare the plant unreal. By this time, Keaton was still in a comedy mode. But he, nevertheless, gives a decent idea, because he can prove that he can move from comedy to drama in a matter of seconds and at the same time not embarrass himself, but director Ron Howard cannot refrain from turning into a television film, which ultimately turns out to be in any case, because they must give an unlikely plot a happy end to politics and the problems of Japanese and American relations, not enduring. Gong Ho has happy days, and Laverne and Shirley feel this because the producers of both TV shows made the film and then made the television version of this film, which gives the film a “light feeling.” The Japanese manager loves his American workers and believes that he and other Japanese can learn from the Americans. This man is number 2, Saito, who allegedly does not like Americans, does not think so. I would prefer all the Japanese characters to be the same as Saito, rather than the stupid characters they made Japanese. That would make the film more interesting.
