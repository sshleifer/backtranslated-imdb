This film does not contain humor for those who lived with a family member suffering from a mental illness. So many scenes reminded me too clearly my own life experience. This film was the male version of "Dear Mom". It graphically and accurately reflects the life of many children of a mentally ill parent. It also shows how easy it is for a psychiatrist to become corrupt and act as if he were God. <br /> <br /> Someone told me that this is funny. No, I say! This is a sick humor at best. <br /> <br /> The film is so tense and depressing that my son and I had to leave the room. The best use for this film is for people who do not understand mental illness or do not believe in what our families actually experience.
