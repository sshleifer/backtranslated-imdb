After reading all these positive reviews, I was confused. Why do many people like what I consider to be a terribly poor adaptation of my second favorite novel, Jane Austen? There are many problems with the film, already mentioned in several reviews; Simply put, this is a tangled, overly active, fussy mess from the opening credits to the hacked finale. <br /> <br /> Although many of the characters are wrong, neither Ewan McGregor nor Tony Collett put on a performance worthy of them, the worst today is Paltrow. I really liked her performance in some roles, but here she is disgusting - she is shy, nose, slouched and completely unrelated to her characters and people around her. Extremely disappointing effort - even though the perfect Emma could not save this film.
