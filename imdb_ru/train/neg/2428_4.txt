Most of all, viewers will remember that because of the overly bright, shaky, camera work and the fast, confusing cropping, the film experiences a severe headache. I am not against this kind of stylistic techniques, if they are done correctly, as evidence of Oliver Stone and Stephen Soderbergh with most of their films, but in this case there was WAY too much. It seems that the jumps and light flashes that accompanied every flight over Mexico City and every important scene were there to distract you from the knowledge that the story was rather thin and it was all very predictable. The biggest disappointment is that you can easily understand how this will end. For a film that pretends to be cruel, ruthless and morally corrupt, it is unforgivable that his story has been told so many times and with much greater depth and development of character. This is another disappointing aspect of the film. If I want to see an excessive fighter, I don’t need any excuse, but this film tried to justify the murderous character of Denzel Washington’s character, and he couldn’t get any plausible ideas. The first half hour or so nothing special happens, except that stupid archetypes and clichés are depicted, and when the action machine starts rolling, it is cut so quickly that you do not know what is actually happening. So the film does not work either at the level of a plausible drama / thriller, or as a purely action movie. Of course, the film is not as bad as some of the completely entangled blockbusters of the past years, but I absolutely cannot understand why so many people claim that this film was something new and so cool. It's too long for a video clip, and too short for a movie.
