Clearly tears Nakata (Ring, 1998) and Hongurai Mizu no Soko Kara (Dark Water, 2002) with hints of Ju-On (The Grudge, 2000) from Ringu Hideo, but terribly perfect blood (a green corpse with red eyes!) Is a weak story and a weak topic (it's very difficult for me to find a message with a scary picture). There were two moments in this film that made me flinch, both because of an unexpected hand, and after Oodishon (another Miike Takashi, this one from 1999) made me tingle within a few hours after watching, and all the films, which he stole. From what was really scary, I donâ€™t see anything in this film except the sale of the western popularity of big Japanese horror films. Two out of ten.
