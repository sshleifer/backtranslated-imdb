Waiting for a combination of a fantastic and historical film about Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, computer history, etc., I was disappointed with this senseless pseudoscience in films and a mixture of real and incredible history. It seems that its author (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) does not have a real understanding of mathematics, technology or history that make up the subject of the film, but works instead from a kind of unclear artistic impression of them. This is very painful for me, because I was annoyed for a long time by the tendency of art to mislead scientific terms and ideas and mislead them, for example: Emmy Ker: “Information waves have a half-life. Ada: “I’m not at all sure that half my life is better than none at all”. <br /> <br /> This film is worse than not entertaining - it is misinforming. The only useful value that I can imagine is that it can attract the viewer to study a subject that distorts so much. I think that it is more likely to contribute to the superstitious perception of science and technology of any level of development as indistinguishable from magic.
