Ridiculous little bumps that spawn and multiply. So far for the horror elements in this movie. All the other MUNCHIES are played out as a really backward comedy, so stupid that in 15 minutes you will not find it funny. I can imagine young children who are sick of these little buggers, but adults will only have those supposedly “smart” links that translate into on-screen things, like the recordings of Captain Kirk's journal from STAR TREK, the most famous scene from ET, a crying statement of the directors: “Look! We are gaining on the success of GREMLINS here! ”And Clint Eastwood's cardboard cutout, which tells us ... what about his western films? This last one was completely lost for me ... Oh yes, and the disposal of chemical waste in the caves seems to be bad. I do not know where they got this idea. <br /> <br /> Not to say that MUNCHIES is the most unbearable movie to watch. It's just very, very stupid. And if you manage to smile while watching, you will probably feel so stupid that you did it after the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Good badness? Yes, but only if the criteria for "stupid", "backward" and "ridiculous" are the criteria you are looking for. 3/10 and, well, well, 6/10.
