I could not believe it when I inserted this movie into my DVD player. I thought I would laugh since I played D & D for half my life. I had to turn it off as I had company, and they were surprised that I watched the shit. <br /> <br /> I did it later, and I should have just left it at the soft core of a gay porn clown at the beginning. No, they run a range of farting jokes, sperm, incest, racism, dressing up in a KKK ... This film is completely unacceptable for anyone who has ever played D & D. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, it looks Real D & D wouldn't let them use their game. Who would want their name to be attached to this?
