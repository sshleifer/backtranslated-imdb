Stereotypical, derivative, unoriginal and boring western. Both popular stars (Charlton Heston and James Coburn) give performances that are far from their best, and this is justified; they both have superficial roles and character traits, expressed mainly in the dialogue. Heston is the sheriff who “loved the world better than he was before,” and Coburn is the criminal who “owes something to the person who locked him and must pay his debt.” In addition, Heston is so old that it is difficult for him to ride a horse, and Koburn is mean-spirited and tough, but not as cold-blooded a killer as some of the minor villains. Apparently, the filmmakers could not come up with even ONE original idea of ​​how to make this film something outstanding. (* 1/2)
