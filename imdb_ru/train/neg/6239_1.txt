Where was his criticism of the democratic and republican administrations? In the end, he served more than 17 years in a government body, where his influence remained unchanged. Oh, I forgot about 8 years when he was second in command of the most powerful nation on Earth. The film gladly demonstrates footage of a young Senator Gore asking why a NASA scientist was forced to change the conclusion in his scientific work, but does not ask about Clinton / Gore’s complicity in global warming. Perhaps too close to the election year, or maybe it will hurt Hillary’s chances in '08. In any case, he is a political coward and party-goer to the bitter end. He offers no criticism of consumerism, no criticism of capitalism, in no way is the history of industrial development that led us to this point in time. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film was much more about Mr. Gore himself, than about any real-life problems that our environment is facing. Mr. Gore, if you really want to make a commercial, cut it and name it as it really is.
