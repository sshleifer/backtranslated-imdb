"Lunaty" - the first film for which Stephen King wrote the script. Considering this, and the great Santo & Johnny song that they used as the theme of the film, you expect to get an unusual and ultimately full viewing experience. Unfortunately, this is not what you get. The fact is that they could make it a good movie. The beginning is intrigued by the fact that with its creepy atmosphere of a small town. But something strange happens 20 minutes after the beginning of the film. The film turns out funny for no apparent reason! From this moment on, the whole atmosphere of the Lunatics has been destroyed. For those of you who have seen it, who can forget the good old Johnny screaming "COP KABOB !!" after I poked a pencil into the ear of that cop?!? But don't get me wrong, humor has no quality of redemption. I just rented it again to see if I could be wrong for the first time, considering how original the plot was, but I was right. Man, what a waste. I can't believe they got the rights to this song by Santo and Johnny. I gave it 2.
