Unusual padded shirt Armand Louque (gently played by veteran actor Dean Jagger in a rare leading role) joins a group of researchers who want to find and destroy a secret zombie making technique. Armand falls in love with the beautiful Claire Duval (for blonde Dorothy Stone), who uses meek juice to make her colleague Armand Clifford Grayson (hopelessly wooden Robert Noland) marry her. Furious that Claire is using and rejecting him, Armand uses his knowledge of voodoo to get revenge. It sounds exciting? Well, this is definitely not the case. To begin with, the static (non) direction of Victor Halperin allows a winding and trouble-free story, carried away by conversation, to wander in a painfully slow pace. Worst of all, Halperin is extremely incapable of bringing tension, atmosphere and momentum into a terribly tedious trial. Mostly bla, acting from a mostly tasteless composition, has no meaning; only George Cleveland in the role of the heart general Duval and E. Elin Warren in the role of an angry doctor Trevisan managed to revive them a little with their hospitable and refreshing history. The boring stock library of films, painfully obvious stage scenery and rough cinematography are also quite disgusting and not impressive. In fact, this weak excuse for fear is so disgusting that even the uncredited, sharply tired eyes of the great Bela Lugosi cannot relieve the boredom that is numb. Terribly boring
