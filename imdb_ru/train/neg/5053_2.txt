I read another review in which the view was expressed that Platoon is an endless cycle of marines who kill people, die, take drugs and speak garbage. <br /> <br /> I disagree with this, because the film is really more about this, but this is the way I can see what this person is trying to say: this has not had any real conspiracy - which I agree. <br /> <br /> This is a suicidal stone at its best. He really wanted to show not only how war leads to death, but also how it extremely traumatizes those who survive. Unfortunately, the film seems to “glorify” this aspect, and the grand finale is too champagne, a huge Oscar hunt “let's create a lasting image” for my taste. <br /> <br /> The Problem I’m related to Stone and other filmmakers is that they don’t understand this simple concept: the image of terribly bloody lethal spending that war DOESN'T prove or EVEN THAT was unfair or immoral war. We saw the same thing happening with Iraq. If you miss the point, let me tell you directly: if you saw how bloody World War II was and how destructive it was for the lives of the surviving soldiers, would you think it was an unjust war? If this fact alone does not convince you that it was an unjust war, then why the horror images of Vietnam convince you that in this case it was wrong to start a war. <br /> <br /> Personally, I do not support the decision of America to start a war in Vietnam, but I certainly do not agree with the theory that “this war is wrong because people died and suffered”. I do not think that the motives are always wrong by default, simply because the war itself is terrible. <br /> <br /> This does not say anything about the fact that the final or final big “turn” was a bit silly. However, this is not the Stones first strange departure. Wall Street was a great movie, right up until the last 30 minutes or so, when he made a terrible "wrong turn." JFK is probably one of the few films that Stone has made that actually ended very well. <br /> <br /> But this hardly matters, because up to this point of the film there was very little plot that could be wrapped. And that's why I gave him such a low rating. It was practically without stories and ultimately boring - unless you fell in love with trumped up sharpness.
