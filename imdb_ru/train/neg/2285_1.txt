Well, this is 90 minutes of my life, I will not come back. This film makes the youth television show "California Dreams" look like "Almost Famous." The game was terrible, and the storyline was unreal. Don't even turn me on to the real band that stands at the forefront of this story, to lame songs, outfits, etc. You should have believed that they were one of the hottest bands in the country, and the world is not enough irony . A guitar player is considered a heroin consumer, not that I blame him if I were around such a rotten band with stale songs and a wooden game, I would also inject a horse. <br /> <br /> If you take music remotely seriously, avoid it at all costs.
