How to wear a shirt for hair. Positively, absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the worst films ever. Pure torture. Zero stars out of ten. One long, tedious, difficult, pretentious, shy, theatrical and lead-artsy scene after another. It is supposed to be fabulous and impressionistic, the soul is naked, instead it is a gloomy mess. <br /> <br /> Half-naked, father and son grope and whisper to each other like lovers. “Homoerotica” is a point, loud and clear. Well, so what? <br /> <br /> The son repeats a line several times, allegedly taken from the Lives of the Saints: “The love of the father is crucified. The loving son allows himself to be crucified. ” The parallel with God and his son Christ is tough, irrelevant and pompous, like everything else here. <br /> <br /> Some landmarks on the topic of Russian filiality: “Mother and Son” (1997); “Return” (Andrey Zvyagvatsev, 2003); "Little Odessa" (James Gray, 1994); Turgenev, "Fathers and Sons"; and, of course, Dostoevsky, The Brothers Karamazov. <br /> <br /> Loans in English indicate an alleged international distribution, which means that you cannot use the excuse that you have to be Russian to understand this mess. <br /> <br /> This is far from perfect or convincing as in the last Sokurovsky Russian Ark (2003). <br /> <br /> As in his Mother and Son, an equally powerful sleeping pill, some scenes were taken from the distorting mirrors, although not so interesting. The film is almost monochrome, shot from beginning to end through beige filters, which makes it as visually as sharply stunning. Haze due to soft focus only enhances the feeling of the drug. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is buzzing, which never turns off like a tape loop. The old radio is constantly playing in the background. Russian romantic melancholy infinitely swells as "Tchaikovsky themes." The presence of a "sound engineer" (Sergey Moshkov) means, of course, that all these annoying little sounds, radio, noise, distortion, and the like are "developed." <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe that someone (Sergey Potepolov) really wrote this. All this seems as arbitrary as traffic, as if imitated by bored actors protruding from non-being into non-being. <br /> <br /> Contemporary art finally managed to designate a thing, not being the fact that we see the idea of ​​an idea, empty as a shell, but not even a shell, just a shell idea. Can one ask for a better definition of decadence?
