I'm surprised everyone (even critics) seems to think that it was a good movie. It was the most clichéd thriller I've ever seen. We have a “bad guy” who wants to make the “good guy” (or girls in this case) do something or face consequences. The “good girl” in this film should use her skills to defeat the “bad guy” and save the day and her loved ones. Using charisma, courage and even good luck to save the day. <br /> <br /> How to start? Well, a young woman named Lisa Reisert meets a young man named Jackson Rippner (good name) at the airport. One coincidence leads to another, and soon it seems that fate unites these two. Sharing drinks, sitting next to each other, it would seem to get along in all respects ... Is there anything else in this weirdness? Can these two be meant for each other? Does “fate” have a reason for their strange and accidental collision? <br /> <br /> Well, as it turned out, unfortunately, yes. Jackson needs Lisa to help him kill the director of national security by moving him from one room to another so his people can attack him. Oh, if she doesn't, her father is dead. Although we will never know the exact reasons why and who is really behind this madness, Jackson more than explains how this will happen and why it is in Liza’s interest to help him. <br /> <br /> Of course, Lisa defeats his evil plans with her mind and in the process strikes him in the neck, makes him stumble over chairs and hit him with a field hockey stick. Oh, and before that, she leads him in pursuit of a wild species through Miami Airport, where she passes through security after September 11 and hijacks a car, which she later uses to hit a man who was ordered to kill her father. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's right. <br /> <br /> First of all, I find it strange that a person like Jackson, who can acquire high-tech weapons, needs the help of a hotel manager. Couldn't he just bomb the building? Doesn't that make him and his team safer if you don't consider any third parties? And why do characters like Jackson also explain everything they are going to do to someone they threaten? Doesn't it help to stop them from the same people? <br /> <br /> The actors did their best, considering the film they were given. Rachel McAdams and Killian Murphy are still actors to watch out for. In addition, I believe that Jaima Mays (who played the “sweet” Cynthia) will be those we will see more. Too bad they all got stuck with this. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
