The audience glimpses in everything, including the episode with the title (now it's funny), so that we believe that this is some kind of cinematic miracle, but believe me, guys, this is one of the most embarrassingly bad movies you have ever seen, and if you don’t laugh at it five minutes later, I would say that you have lost your sense of humor. <br /> <br /> David Niven plays the doomed and insane RAF pilot, who for some reason finds it wise to hire an impressionable (female) air traffic controller in an emotional conversation about love, just as he plunges into his sure and fiery death. (Isn't it romantic ...) Of course, he is free from the oddities of metaphysical chance and takes a bath on the beach, just like this air traffic controller is riding his bicycle. (They immediately grabbed). <br /> <br /> Looking through bizarre homo-erotic overtones (so you really need to call them supertexts, from a naked boy sitting naked in the sand, playing the theme of the film about the twilight zone, on his little flute, heavenly courier , so picky / royal that his makeup is baked more carefully than the ladies' one), the most bizarre aspects of the film lie in how he weaves such bad caricatures of national and racial stereotypes into an intricate attempt to argue about some point of view the universal nature and the power of love. We understood that boys fly like girls in skirts and heels, and girls love them back, and obviously all you have to do is cry a little to make your movie noble enough for your movie to get 10 stars on IMDb . . <br /> <br /> With regard to production quality, continuity / editing is bad enough to cause a rattle, and the lighting is perhaps even worse, but you can hardly notice because the script is so bad there are games that playing with Technicolor (everything that goes for heaven, in black and white, if you can make sense of it), and foreshadowing, (so funny, my colleague in the audience, who usually loves such films, actually greeted and laughed, when then the dock motorcycle finally found itself in a fiery wreck) and freeze-frame (which is funny its all because the leading woman stands so badly in place that you know that stage hands were breaking out of the camera). <br /> <br /> The best shots are early on the beach, but after that everything goes downhill. The staircase (moving as an escalator), at least, is hardly the “Odessa steps”, and I really warn anyone against the feeling that he will have to see this unsuccessful attempt at making a film on their account. In general, the film is bad enough to be funny, and this is the best thing I can say about it.
