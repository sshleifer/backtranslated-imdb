Yes, in 35 years of filming, I finally saw a bitch, who surpasses all the other horrible films that I've seen. The victory over Goodwill on Baise Moi and Flirt is terrible. This is a pretentious hold of the first order ... not even a spectacular stunt. The effects are cheap, and worse - meaningless. <br /> <br /> The script seems to have been written by a first-year student who doesn’t really leave, but wants to appear full of omens! Acting is simply indescribably bad — Tilda Swinton ends a career filled with an empty tree with a game that neurotically changes the direction between komotoza and ridiculous intensity. Apparently, some kind of fool allowed the director of this film to make another one ... to be warned
