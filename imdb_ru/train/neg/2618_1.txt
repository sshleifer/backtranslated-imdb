... because it was just awful. 101 Dalamatin was funny, even if it was formal, but this is nothing more than trifling chatter. The same plot, with the exception of the story cut from it; the cleverest and terribly annoying macaw in the world; Tim McInnerny proves that he really can't do a comedy (someone remembers Percy in Blackedder, but this was his main achievement - since then everything has been downhill); The direction is so bad that if a group of college students did this, you would throw it in the trash can and tell them to do it again - this time correctly. Iuean Griffford should return to Hornblower, and Glenn Close and Gerard Diepardier should be hiding for several years. <br /> <br /> Maybe I can be too harsh; in the end I did not manage to sit through the whole movie. It gets 1/10; just because I can't give him 0.
