Vera Domerga (better known as “Dr. Ruth” in THIS ISLAND ISLAND) is the only reason to watch this movie. The story is very thin, and as soon as the Air Force friends return to the States with the curse of the cobra, the action becomes just a game of waiting. Look at the Faith Snake and try to pretend that nothing is happening.
