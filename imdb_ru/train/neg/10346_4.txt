You would think that with Ingrid Bergman and Warner Baxter this film would be much better. Unfortunately, the film suffers from difficulties with faith in the characters, as well as from the main plot problem, due to which some characters seem to be drugged. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the fact that Ingrid Bergman comes to work for the Stoddard family. Everything is so beautiful and beautiful - the family loves Bergman, and everything could not be better. Well, until mother (Fay Ray) dies, the stock market will collapse in 1907 (destroying the familyâ€™s fate), and Bergman will have to return home to France. This part of the film is a bit sticky, but not bad. <br /> <br /> Later, after improving the condition of the family, Bergman returns. All four boys have already grown, and in fact there is no single reason why they would hire her as a governess again. But in short, everything is fine again. But when World War I happens, all four go to war - damn it! In the midst of this, one of the sons (David) brings home his new wife (Susan Hayward). Miss Hayward's character is as black and white as the others, although, although they are all good and good, she is obviously an agitated devil. To make matters worse, she comes to live in the family home when David is at war. <br /> <br /> Now this is where the movie becomes really, very stupid - dizzyingly stupid. Hayward begins an affair with one of David's brothers, but when his father sees the silhouette of lovers, Bergman enters the room from another entrance and pretends that it was she, and not Hayward with Jack! WHAT FOR?! Why does any sane person do this to save the ass of an obviously angry and insidious woman? This was exactly the excuse that Bergman needed to get rid of the snipe once and for all! This is just a case of a lousy letter that infuriated me ... and, most likely, did the same with the audience back in 1941. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film consists of an unsuccessful opportunity after an unsuccessful Heyward opportunity. evil must be exposed. It is simply counterintuitive and has made the film a silly melodramatic mess. However, as expected, however, in the end, it turns out, and everyone is excited again - happy to be one big loving wonderful family without whore Hayward. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from bad writing. The Hayward case did not make sense - at least in the way they were treated. And the presence of such damn good or evil characters (between which there is nothing) lowers this film to the level of second-rate soap. The only thing that saves him at all is the acting skills - they tried their best using the dim script. Suffice it to say that the Columbia Pictures screenwriters who shot this film should have been killed by dead chicken!
