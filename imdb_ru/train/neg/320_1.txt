With Adam Sandler. <br /> <br /> This is without a doubt one of the most idiotic films in history. We are talking about the waiter of the cruise liner Shaki (Sandler), who wants to become a comedian on a cruise ship. Firstly, to be honest, there is not a single funny or clever line in the whole film. It is so unfortunate, it is a pity. There is surprisingly not much harsh or sexual humor, but that word is abundant. The budget is really low, and it also destroys the film. This happens on a cruise ship, but it seems they only had money to rent a small boat, and only 10 additional ships, one of which is Billy Bob Thornton. The opening credits are animated very cheaply, and thatâ€™s just pitiful. I hate this film, and everyone else who sees it will also hate it. <br /> <br /> 86 minutes. rated R for language.
