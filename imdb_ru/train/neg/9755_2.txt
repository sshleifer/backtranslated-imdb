This picnic of Ours in 1974, directed by Leon Klimovsky, and a quick glance at promotional photos and packaging may lead you to believe that this medieval noise lies somewhere between the Inquisition and Sadomania. Unfortunately not. <br /> <br /> This is a strictly PG-scene with manual torture, without naked bodies and with a slight margin. Ours (of which I am sick) records his stuff as Gilles de Lancre, Antiguo Mariscal de la Nacion. Unfortunately, he is more of a pantomime villain than anything else. With this film there is a feeling that we have seen how he (and this) did everything before. Strictly speaking, therefore, for Our most complete.
