Will they ever make films without nudity and sex? It happened at 3:00 on a Sunday afternoon, and I could not believe what they showed. Thank God, my son was outside, or I would be shocked if he saw soft / medium porn! People who make films do not care who they insult or corrupt? Children could watch the church, and this is what they show ??? !!! The game was good, and I enjoyed the wait, but GEE! There was violence and bad guys, but that was to be expected in a western film. Randy Travis was really good at his role. If writers, directors and producers would simply stop putting so many inappropriate for sex scenes. What should happen to stop moving in this direction? Where can I complain?
