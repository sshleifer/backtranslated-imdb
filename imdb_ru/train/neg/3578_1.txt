There is absolutely nothing to redeem this film. They took a sad story, missed it, wrote it wrong, shot it wrong. He has a bad dialogue, poorly executed in a winding and dirty story. <br /> <br /> As bad as art and commerce. Who could be the target market for this. What is the age group? What interest group? <br /> <br /> Someone has to make a film about how and why he made this movie. I would pay to watch. <br /> <br /> I have seen thousands of bad films, and this is counted among the "Sailor who fell from grace" and "Manos" ... my choice is like the three most irreparably bad films I have ever seen. All who are connected with this should be forced to talk with VanDamme for all eternity. <br /> <br /> I challenge you. Watch this movie and do an academic exercise - how can you take it and make it worse? I can not think of one way.
