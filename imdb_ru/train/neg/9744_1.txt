This is one of the worst things that have ever appeared in England, and it says a lot right here. The stress when we have to find out whether Lembach remains or not is amazing. On the other hand, pleasant secretary Sheila sits in her underwear with a picnic pattern for a while after being caught by Dr. Rat Faith. This film has several views of London, although none of them is good. There is also a point at which an almost car accident occurs at which the heart rate becomes slightly below normal. There are also watches that are teleported away, and the fear that a woman will not return her watch is parallel to the horror of the “Sixth Sense”, only much more boring and British. Add a violent exchange of fire between the British police and Dr. Rat, which will lead nowhere, plus an electric shock to a large number of people, plus a cat, and you will get yourself ... mmm ... a British film. The MST3K version is pretty good, although not the best.
