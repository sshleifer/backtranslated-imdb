This film is pretty boring. There are passages of naked flesh, abandoned in an unsuccessful attempt to keep the viewer awake, but they do not succeed. <br /> <br /> The best thing in the film is Lena Olin - she does an excellent job with her character, but Day-Lewis distorts most of her lines. <br /> <br /> Kaufman clearly did not know how to shoot this. Inconsistencies in overcoming problems between the household / marriage and the political crisis are not well combined. Character behavior changes without explanation. Strongly divided.
