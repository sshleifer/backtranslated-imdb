I have read all the books to date in the series left, and the film hardly pays tribute to any of them. Of course, I have seen the worst films, but it was incredibly disappointing. This film would make a good episode of MST3K. The script was a terrible adaptation of the book, and the actors felt that they were reading their own lines, rather than actually saying them. The characters were tough and incredible. The effects were cheesy and looked terribly fake. The ending was terrible. First of all, he did not even go through the entire first book. Secondly, it did not make sense. If you did not read the book, you would not know what is happening. It was supposed to be the most gentle, film-like film I had ever seen in a movie. I'm upset that I actually paid money for this film. If by some miracle it becomes widespread, they must completely revise it and allow Hollywood to take over. These two producers of the film copycat and the film copywriter must leave the filming of the film to the professionals.
