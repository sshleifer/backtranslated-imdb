After a long stay in space in search of the remains of the planet Krypton Superman (Brandon Ruth) returns to Earth. He misses Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), who married and has a son with Richard White (James Marsden). Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is developing an evil plan using the crystals he stole from the Fortress of Solitude to create a new land and sink the United States. <br /> <br /> After so many superman movies about Superman with Christopher Reeve, an unforgettable series such as Lois and Clark (and Teri Hatcher) or Smallville was expecting Superman to return to this version of Brian Singer. Unfortunately, the horrible story is too long and boring, with many unnecessary details, lack of emotion and a reassessment in IMDb. In addition, the romance between Lois Lane and Superman is something shamefully funny. Twenty-two-year-old actress Kate Bosworth mistakenly mistaken, playing the role of a mature reporter and an experienced mother of a five-year-old boy. Brandon Ruth is two years younger than Tom Welling, who plays the teenager Clark Kent in Smallville. The hero of Parker Posey, Kitty Kowalski, is actually a silly cartoon. Last but not least, Kevin Spacey owns a stunning Lex Luthor, he is forty-five years old, so he is older and older than the rest of the cast. The banal conclusion looks like a soap opera and is terrible. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): “Superman Returns”
