So “Thinner” ... Yes ... This Stephen Bachmann (read Stephen King) talks about a man who gets his desserts just made from a Gypsy elder whom he just killed. I do not know why I did not enjoy it more than I could. I think that really distracted me from the actors. I mean, who leads? Robert John Burke? Who is he? And if you scream loudly, can someone stop hiring Joseph Mantegna for every Italian mafiosi role that ever was? And while we're at it, should every mafioso have pasta cooking an Italian mother? The only good acting work done here is less than 10 pounds of make-up, Michael Constantine, like a gypsy senior. He is pretty good. But everything else I make of you all "better actors ..."
