It was assumed that in this film was depicted a bachelor "lady" who was ready and wanted to finally settle. However, I did not care about his mission to calm down, because I did not care about his character. I do not understand what all these beautiful women saw in him. He had absolutely no class or charisma. He had to, at least, deal with himself, which made the ladies weak in the knees, apart from his saxophone playing, but to no avail. The fact that he is a musician does not make him sexy. Not to mention the fact that what he was doing to attract the attention of a married woman in whom he fell in love in five minutes, recognizing her, was absolutely outrageous and ridiculous. Does this person have any shame? If he had put himself in order and stopped doing stupid things, he would have been a more attractive character, but, alas, his character would be boring and boring. <br /> <br /> Gina Gershon's character was unnecessarily British. She could just as easily get excited about her usual speaking voice, like a bad British accent that sometimes disappeared from the movie. <br /> <br /> The only two characters I cared about were a fish and a frog. Now these two had chemistry! Nomination Academy for both ?? STAT! Holes in the plot, lack of character development, terrible game, unnecessary drama, cliches ... What a mess in the film.
