I still have not seen all this; now it works by cable, and I seem to continue to enter it. My main reason for being interested is that I am a fan of Bill Paxton; he is a pretty good actor and has worked well throughout his career. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that, although I have never been a fan of the old series, I liked the Thunderbirds for ships and spectacular work. Derek Meddings may have been the best in the business of the sixties and seventies, and his designs for the International Rescue Ship are wonderful. The current team did a great job on translating their work to the big screen. <br /> <br /> BUT ... <br /> <br /> This is one unfortunate story. Children are asked to drive it, and although they do a good job, it is difficult to suspend your disbelief, especially when you have an eight-year-old son, Brains, flying a T2, a huge multi-ton vehicle with all the aerodynamics of Buick. Wherever you look, you'll see the Ford logo. Product placement is too much and it is annoying. Ben Kingsley copes well with the role of Hood, but he can do a lot only with a one-dimensional role. If you can take a movie for its very subtle virtues, Thunderbirds is a fun and enjoyable trip. Just do not look too closely at the mechanisms that lead it. <br /> <br /> ADDENDUM: I finally saw it all, and it's worse than I thought. Acting is pretty evenly bad, and although the effects are pretty good, the story has become more enjoyable on several views. The overflowing product placement for Ford is annoying, and the children as the main characters lose my remaining nerves. As with the Avengers, if you ignore the source material, it is tolerable. But not so much. Watch the original show and you will understand what I mean. <br /> <br /> And advice to John Fraix. Take advanced training courses in the Directors Guild. You can do better, old friend. <br /> <br /> Another footnote ... <br /> <br /> I saw it again. Last night. On Telemundo. Voiced in Spanish, with gentle comedic sound effects. And yes, I came about in the middle, with Ben, Ron and Sophia on their battle scene on Tracy Island. <br /> <br /> I did not think that already a bad movie could be worse, but it was so. It was embarrassingly bad. <br /> <br /> If it was done right, without the help of children, without joking, it could work. In fact, this is just another favorite childish joy that has been destroyed.
