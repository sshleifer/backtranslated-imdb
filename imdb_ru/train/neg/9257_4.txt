If you are hoping for ANYTHING new, you have chosen the wrong movie. Who would think that a movie that is a virtual reproduction of its predecessors can be a good one. Maybe a producer and maybe a director, but hopefully they weren't serious when they did it. This whole film is like making the DVDs of the best hits of the first 3 films, but changing the actors. BHHAAAAD.
