**** Do not read this review if you want the “Lake Monster” shocking conclusion to be a complete surprise **** <br /> <br /> Clay plesiosaur rises from the depths of Crater Lake to damage a group of local residents, let alone already about your fast forward button. Calling the "Crater Lake Monster" an amateur means exaggerating the obvious. If you are not a fan of low-budget entry films, you probably would not be watching in the first place. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is that when there is no monster action. It really sucks and won't go anywhere. The script is very similar to Ed Wood, as he was completely invented in the way he sets the basic action sequences. Nothing is too outlandish for "Lake Crater". This explains his dinosaur that it collided with a meteor in a crater lake, “overheating” the water to such an extent that it incubates a dinosaur egg, which apparently rests on the bottom of the lake for thousands of years. Even if we could admit that an egg could lie there for so long and remain open and viable, would not the “overheating” of water lead to such a high temperature that most of the lake would evaporate? In addition to some symbolic fog in one or two scenes, we see no evidence that the water is hot, except for a few lines in the script. <br /> <br /> The script is complemented quite clearly in several sequences, and it will do everything possible so that the characters approach the lake so that they can be in danger due to the clay dino. The couple have just survived the car problem, and while their car is being serviced, they decide to rent a boat and head to Crater Lake. Hmmmmm ... do you think these strangers in this story might be there to face our monster of the name? In a strange sequence, the drunkard robs the liquor store and decides to kill the cashier and the witness instead of paying four dollars for a bottle of booze. This is followed by a car chase, and you will not know about it ... they will be right at the lake. Snack time for Kreyti! Yes, it is not difficult to understand, and you are so far ahead of the script that you are annoyed when it takes ten more minutes to unfold these scenes. <br /> <br /> The shamelessness of all this is darling, and I really want to like the "Crater Lake Monster". I just can't do it. There is not enough to continue, and this is more a film that can be put on during a party, because you can talk directly about it and it will not matter. <br /> <br /> In the film there is a small list of what is needed for this. The most important of these is the dinosaur itself, which is presented in three forms: a shadow puppet, a large head model that drags through the water and a fully implemented clay insert, which actually looks pretty good. It also has a pair of attractive hicks, and they carry most of the deliberate humor in the film. The bleak ending makes us mourn death and the monster, and one of our favorite assholes, so all the good in this film is dead by the end. Why has I been so affected by this conclusion? Was it a sad song played on the closing credits? Or did I just internally cry because of the time I spend watching movies like this?
