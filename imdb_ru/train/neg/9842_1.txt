It seems that everyone in this film is directing Woody Allen. They stutter, freeze and stutter some more. Only for REALLY resistant DeNero fans! He tries to look harsh and artistic, but he looks like a very, very budget film shot by college students. The most frequently used word in the entire film is “hum”. The film does create an atmosphere of the late sixties / early seventies, though. If you like movies in which people CONSTANTLY discuss each other, terrible coverage (even if it is “for the sake of art”) and makes you feel that you are sitting in an unconvincing political meeting, then you may like it - but you must be very bored. I found this disk in the trash can and now I know why.
