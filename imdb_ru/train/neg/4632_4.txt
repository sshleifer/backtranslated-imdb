Maria Bello doesn't seem to care what people think of her choice in movie roles. Again, she chooses a very difficult and unpopular film to star in. Maybe she needs these films to make films with sugar coating (or “Hollywood”), which she does here and then (Coyote Ugly and, of course, Mummy 3). /> <br /> Although I think she doesn’t manage to achieve what she intends to do (I won’t spoil it), Maria Bello is just as good as her other independent / small films in which she is being shot. movie. This combined with a strange subject almost made me. But in the end (and even if I try to overlook some flaws, such as poor tempo and drama), the film is still too long.
