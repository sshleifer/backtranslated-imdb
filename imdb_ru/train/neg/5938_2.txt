if you havenâ€™t lived in the 90s or ever listened to a rapper ever !! this movie may be fine for you, but any for any fan or any person who has ever listened to rap, this movie was boring, and there was no point in the movie when I said it was interesting or I didn't know it . Another thing that bothered me was that in his life everything looked as if he did it very easily, there was no struggle, he made the prison look easy selling drugs, and even knocking on them was unrealistic. I think that if the film is released in about 15 years, it can have a greater impact !!! good rap movies fussing, getting rich or dying trying not sad
