I hate to spend time writing 10 lines about this crime. Heng-Rae Shima was lucky that bad filmmaking is not a mortal crime, or he would be executed twice for writing and directing this catastrophe. I am surprised that this film had a budget of 75 million dollars, but in fact I am glad that it was such a colossal failure that I hope Shim will never be able to make another film for the rest of his life and, therefore, do not waste more time moviegoers. I would have thought that the actors would have gathered and began to lynch him. <br /> <br /> With the resources available to them, one could make an excellent film with such a budget. As usual, the failure had to be discovered at the very beginning with a terrible scenario and history. “Transformers” was another visual holiday with a weak script, but it makes it look like “Citizen Kane.”
