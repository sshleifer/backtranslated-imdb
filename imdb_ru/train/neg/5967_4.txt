Just think that “clerks” cost $ 250,000. How the hell did they spend $ 45 million to create this famous music video? Almost an unknown cast, two or three sets, no special effects that I could see ... I know it must have been spent on this elaborate, cost-effective, stress-filled script. Shoot, this bar set should be worth a bunch. In any case, I think that Jerry Bruckheimer will not be caught dead, producing something for less money. I'm just surprised that he blew nothing. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I think it was not a horrible movie. The women's leashes seemed to have good chemistry, and the soundtrack was fine. IMO It's just a pity that this rather mediocre project could be implemented for $ 5 million without any losses for production, and another 6 films worth $ 5 million could be made.
