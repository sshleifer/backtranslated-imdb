Perhaps I am not sophisticated. This and Closer are two of the most supposedly cerebral films I have seen recently, and both suffer from the same problem in an agonizing degree. Dialogue is false, false is false. Nothing that comes out of someone’s mouth seems remotely believable. Perhaps the way this film was created is what it should feel, but it could not be seen. And boring. I left after 20 minutes of fatigue. <br /> <br /> I will stick with Sleeper and Bananas for my Woody Allen solution. If I ever come across this on Tiwi, I’ll roll over and try to find an episode of Quincy instead.
