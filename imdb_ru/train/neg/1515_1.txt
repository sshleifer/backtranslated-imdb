I watched the film “Flock” because of the casting of Gere and Danes and because the synopsis of the story sounded interesting. It was one of the worst films I have seen in a long time (and I have seen some turkeys). I have never published on the Internet before, but this film was so terrible that I had to do it. I guess the problems start with a script that was so amateur that it’s unbelievable. History does not make sense, and the dialogue is so banal that it makes you sick. Poor Gear, he deserves much better. As for the coincidences between the characters and the Danes on the screen, because of the terrible letter, no one will believe any of the characters for a minute. I bet Gere would like him to buy out the negative, such things would be possible. It's a shame to see that talent is being wasted so much, not to mention that I would like to return my 2 hours ago. (I know what you're thinking. How do I actually feel?)
