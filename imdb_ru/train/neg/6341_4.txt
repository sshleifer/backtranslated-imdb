The Eastern Palace, the Western Palace somehow reminded me of a detective story, with Frank Sinatra as a policeman, and William Wind, the boy. I think this is a progressive film for China, but it also perpetuates the myths about the femininity of gay men: much has been done from the Chinese myths in which men play female roles. The film tells about a effeminate man who desperately wants macho to overcome him. He is traveling around the park without fear - he hopes that the officer will take him to the station. And it actually happens. Then he tells the officer his whole life, being subjected to light torture: he is forced to squat for some time, handcuffed, slapped on the face. This is what gay wants, and, indirectly, gay challenges the policemanâ€™s self-esteem as a courageous person. The story of gay life (including memories) is tolerable, but when he begins to describe the old Chinese myths and dramatic works, the film becomes unbearable. This becomes a cry of pity for China's gays, who only want to perform a traditional role in Chinese society. Sorry, I can not communicate.
