An elderly man touches a flower in the greenhouse of his wife, who seems to fade. He pricked it or bit something from it. He quickly falls ill, and in the hospital he spits out some big wriggling white larva. A later attempt to reanimate it with oars leads to a splash of blood. <br /> <br /> A policeman is in the hospital because his partner was seriously injured in a shootout. Somehow, the policeman is paired with one of the female doctors, as well as with the entomologist who led. There are a few small children roaming around the hospital, which, I suppose, we should find charming, but which are extremely annoying little aprons. They accidentally enter the room where the sample is stored, and fall on it with growth hormone. The logic of horror films says that they deserve to die for it, but they are never in danger. <br /> <br /> Creatures grow and begin to breed. People run away from him, and sometimes to him for some reason. The hospital is surrounded by the military, who are ready to destroy everything, if necessary. <br /> <br /> There are no really convincing characters in the film, and in most cases people seem to be looking for a monster. It was pretty boring. It is completely obvious that he owes something to films about aliens: a monster is born inside a person and has several stages of its growth. There is also a character named Bishop, and the main actress has Sigourney Weaver hair.
