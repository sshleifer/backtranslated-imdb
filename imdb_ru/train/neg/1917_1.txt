This film, although not entirely bad, should have been shot where real events took place. Grand Island, Nebraska, was destroyed by at least a family of tornadoes on the night of June 3, 1980. Grand Island is located in the almost treeless, flat valley of the Platte River in County Hall. The creators of this film were filmed on the tree-covered hills of Ontario and transferred all this event to a non-existent city called Blainsworth. Grand Island people bravely survived on this horrible night, but they were forgotten because of a poorly made film.
