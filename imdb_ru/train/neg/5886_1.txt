I would have left the movie halfway, if I hadn’t been with people who liked it. The film is based on real incidents, but it is so excessive that it does not feel real at all. I have some psychological experience, I communicate with many psychotherapists and I know seriously crazy people, so I do not think that such people do not exist. But in the film, the only characters that seemed invariably human were Father Augustin (Alec Baldwin) and young Augustin (Jack Caedin). (Although Evan Rachel Wood was an intriguing diversion — very sexy with an evil sense of fun.) There were some funny moments, but the general tone of the film was dark, strange and nasty. What a waste of a great throw! When I watched them go through their lines, I just felt like I was watching an acting class. It was brought home during the credits, when they showed a couple of people who were just sitting, not playing or talking. These few moments were more interesting than the previous 2 hours.
