“Soldier's Blue” is a film with claims: claims to be some kind of profound statement about the inhumanity of a person towards him, about the exploitation and cruelty of a white person towards indigenous peoples; biting, steady and sardonic commentary on the horrors of Vietnam. Well, I'm sorry, but nothing like this can be. What Soldier Blue really is is destructive, trite, poorly made, dishonest garbage. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer here hit the nail, saying that it is a hybrid of two completely different films. In fact, this is a lame, cliché, poorly acting romance of the “strange couple” - Strauss and Bergen overcome their prejudices about the other person’s way of life and fall in love (oh, bless) - two horrible massacres are imposed on them, of which there would be no place about Lucio Fulci spray. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for the disgusting, insightful, blood-soaked climax in which cute little Native American children are shot, cut, dismembered and pierced in love and graphic close up, and women with big breasts are Native Americans subjected to harassment, rape and tension - that is, no excuse other than box office. (The massacre itself, although repulsive in its inappropriate intent, is very poorly organized and shot; a group of actors lying around with bright red paint smeared on them is interrupted by several sequences of special effects of decapitation / dismemberment - dismemberment, among other things, which used real people with amputees limbs in their filming. Now this is what I call exploitation.) <br /> <br /> Forget about everything you heard (including ridiculous comments that start and end the film) that of "protest" "Blaming America for violence against indigenous peoples. This film does not cover the plight of the Cheyenne; if this were done, some Native American characters would be involved in it, which would allow us to recognize and take care of the nameless, faceless innocent people who are being killed at the climax. Instead, we get a novel about the stupid white bread of Bergen and Strauss (lousy actors, at least in this one), with lots of blood, guts and severed heads thrown to attract the curious. <br /> <br /> That this is a terrible shame, because there is a film about the Sand Creek massacre, about all the real killings in which the US (and the UK, and all the so-called "civilized" countries) have been involved for centuries ( Iraq). ?) it's just not the movie.
