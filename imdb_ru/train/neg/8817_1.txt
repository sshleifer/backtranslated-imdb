No, I have never seen a single “Santa Slasher” series, that is, “Silent Night, Death Day”, the original “Black Christmas” or this “Christmas Evil”. I heard everything about their reputation, or MADS (Mothers Against Abnormal Santa Clauses). I thought I would rent this one because I heard it pop up as a link to the Fat in the Cinema segment. /> <br /> Moms should be against this, but not for oooooooooooooooooooy "killer" Santa, but because this film was just crap. Bored for a long time ?? even in 92 minutes, shit. <br /> <br /> A little boy sees Santa descend through the chimney in 1947, deliver gifts, eat some goodies, and miraculously float through the chimney. The boy goes to bed, but returns to the living room to witness how his mother and Santa put him on. Obviously, this spoiled this child for the rest of his life, although the scene was about the same steam room as when Ralfi's father received the “Foot Lamp” in the “Christmas Story”. He was sooo worried, he went to the attic and cut his arm well. <br /> <br /> Fast forward to the future! It's 1980, and the spoiled boy works in a toy factory. It seems to us that he is a little insane, and he pursues both children and parents. Who is naughty, who is good, blah blah. It takes a good two-thirds of the film to finally break up ?? as if this is not foreseen from the first frame. NO FILM should take so much time. <br /> <br /> I admit that tension has increased in this film, but only because I always expected him to do something with someone. When he finally does this, well, punish "who is naughty," it is as clear as the "Trash Can" card. And I did not mention the WTF final. I think it was a metaphor, but actually it’s as strange as the whole movie. (Take a brother who is upset, his brother kills, and his decision is murder.) Do not open this mess, even on Christmas Eve or Evil. Again, I did not watch the other Santa Slasher, but this one sucked badly. He created tension because of the nature of the film and never delivered a worthy gift.
