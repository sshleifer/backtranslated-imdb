When I saw the preview of this film, I thought that it might be stupid, but at least it would be funny. Well, I was wrong. Although somewhere in the depths of the soul, the producers had an interesting message that the parents were left alone and overestimated their lives, the way they tried to convey this message was terrible. The first fifty times something stupid happened to a couple, it was relatively funny. But by the end I could almost predict what a stupid mishap would happen next. <br /> <br /> In the film I like a total of five lines of dialogue, and everything else is mediocre at best, which is still more than I can say for the film itself.
