Well ... it seems that for now, only Barman fans have commented on this film - time for a counterpoint. Carefully, this article is written * LONG *. <br /> <br /> For those who don't know (mostly non-Belgians): Tom Barman, the director of this film, is the frontman of dEUS, one of the most famous rock bands of the late 90s here in Belgium. In fact, they made a couple of very adventurous and innovative albums and quickly gained fame nationwide. Then the ego began to hurt, and the band mostly collapsed, and Barman and several other people continued to make albums under the nickname dEUS. As is always the case in such cases, dEUS, after a breakdown, turned out to be much more tedious and less interesting than the original. They tried to achieve an international breakthrough with their album "The Ideal Crash" in 1999, presenting a significantly diluted form of their earlier songwriting style. They did not quite do it. Nevertheless, the ego was still quite large, it seems large enough for the Bartender to consider himself enough an artist to try on films. <br /> <br /> More often than not, such things are a VERY big mistake, and this film makes no exception. And the Barman clearly went to the “art” of this, another very big mistake. Firstly, he is a musician, not a director. On the other hand, dEUS teaches and provokes music best, but never comes close to what I consider “art.” It shows. <br /> <br /> So what is this movie about? In fact, he tells the story of a group of completely uninteresting people who do equally uninteresting things during an absolutely uninteresting Friday in Antwerp, because even more uninteresting things happen to them because they are uninteresting. The characters are small, the plot is completely meaningless, and the film simply does not have other redemptive qualities to fill these shortcomings. Humor? The whole movie made me smile (slightly) about 3 times, and actually managed to provoke one 5-second laugh (not quite loud). Mood? It seems that the film does not show any emotions or feelings. Mystery? Well, (* MINOR SPOILER *) the idea of ​​a "man of the wind", the inspirational title of the film, is as captivating as a banana pepper pizza is not very much, and was made a thousand times earlier (everyone remembers Joni Destini) - one of Tarantino’s worst performances film for today) (* END MINOR SPOILER *). And, well, this is * artistically *, so do not expect that any real actions will fill all previous ones. In other words, with the exception of a few smiles, I was bored from my shorts. <br /> <br /> So what's left? Well, the soundtrack is pretty good, although it has suffered from some of the same problems that other OSTs have shown lately: first, the film looks like a TV commercial for a CD. Secondly, it seems that the Bartender is trying to hide weaknesses and the lack of emotional content in the film because of the quality of the content of the songs, which simply does not work. In the end, the film looks like nothing more than an illustration of the songs. And, unfortunately, the most attention is paid to Barmans own contribution to the soundtrack, although this, in my opinion, is the weakest part of the entire soundtrack. In general, it simply means that the Barman knows more about music than he does about movies. With the camera, too, everything is in order, although there is nothing that could make you scream with joy. <br /> <br /> The only thing that made me watch a movie was the sightseeing factor. Since I am from Antwerp, it was fun to play some kind of “guess location” game. Although I hardly think it is quality. <br /> <br /> In general, another chance is lost for a Flemish film. I continue to notice that lately the best Belgian films have come from the French part of the country. This is mainly because, at least, they have something to say, and that they will be able to say it so that it is both acute and emotional (recall the brothers Daarden). Perhaps the Flemish art-house filmmakers should also try.
