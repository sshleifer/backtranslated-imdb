A really, really bad slasher movie. Psychotic man runs away from the shelter. Three years later, he kills a sociology professor, end of the scene. One semester yesterday (hey, this is what is written on the title page), a new professor of sociology appeared at the school. She made friends with another female professor of sociology, who works there, and begins to meet with another professor. All students, like us, are bored. <br /> <br /> There are several cards that indicate how much time has passed. The scenes are rather short and cut into different characters somewhere else, which makes them a bit progressive. In many scenes, characters walk and talk, or sit and talk, and serve a small purpose. Despite the fact that over time, many characters are always wearing the same clothes. Sometimes the obscure passage of time means that when we see the body a second time, we ask ourselves: how long has this body been there? Also, at least one of the dead people seems to have not been missed by others. <br /> <br /> The killer manages to kill one person by stabbing him in the chest, and another by striking him in the crotch. and one more, cutting her forehead. Is his knife poisoned or something? <br /> <br /> There is a cheerleader on the cover of the video box: they are not in the film. On the back cover is a photograph of someone in a graduation cap and dress threatening a group of women in a dorm room. The central redhead in the photo is in the film, but no one ever wears such an outfit, and there is no such scene. The killer is strictly one on one.
