Jane Eyre is one of the greatest novels in English, and this screenwriter should read it. I hate it when authors use Spark notes for a novel. Watching this movie is unbearable if you read the book. <br /> <br /> The whole “red room” is played out so much that I wonder why they don't even want to insert it. The book "Red Room" foreshadows for the whole story and the rest of Jane's life. In the movie with Helen Burns, they are so mistreated, I am sure that she was happy to die and leave early. In the book she is one of the most convincing characters, and she was not a red head. The whole Christian theme is missing from her life and the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, skip this film and read the story, as Charlotte Bronte masterfully told her.
