To admit to the Brad Pitt fantasies is a rather difficult admission for heterosexuals. But what can I tell you? Maybe this is a famous addition that everyone talks about and makes a star a star. It crosses this barrier. He pulls you into an unknown sensual and emotional territory. Brando had it in the pikes, Montgomery Clift, Gary Cooper, James Dean and, of course, in more recent times, Tom Cruise, Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Ewan McGregor and Billy Crudup. Women fell in love with Garbo, Dietrich, Katherine and Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Christie, Charlotte Rampling, Meryl Streep, Vanessa Redgrave, Julia Roberts and more recently Natalie Portman. But Brad Pitt single-handedly revised the concept. He is the only reason to go out, get in the car, find a parking lot, buy a ticket, popcorn and get into the theater to watch Troy. If you liked the Favorite Jupiter epic, you might like it. But if you do not do it, keep up the good work, we want to keep Brad Pittâ€™s business.
