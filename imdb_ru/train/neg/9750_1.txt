The film, the universal product of Protelco-MLC, is a boring retelling of the theory of the destruction of the molecular structure of an object, its capture in the cell as “pure energy”, and then sending it completely to the “target zone”. "There is no explanation why this is necessary, but Professor Paul Steiner (played by a joker actor Bryant Hallid," Devil's Doll ") thinks that this is something to devote him, as well as his assistants, Pat Hill (Mary Peach) and Chris Mitchell (Ronald Allen), lives up to. <br /> <br /> During an experiment conducted by the previously famous Dutch scientist "Lembach" (Gordon Heinz), his car fails due to sabotage, therefore its secretary, Sheila (Tracy Crisp) He "projects" himself to get revenge. Of course, she's screwed up, and he comes out in the form of "fried pork, capable of electrocution. <br /> <br /> With this new power, he manages to kill several idiots of Cockney, a guard named Latham (Derrick de Marni) and his laboratory chief Dr. Blanchard (Norman Woodland). He can also penetrate the pharmacy and steal a pair of rubber gloves and a black coat. <br /> <br /> In the end, despite Hill and Mitchell’s attempt to help him, the clown destroys his equipment and himself. In general, a completely meaningless film without any message. <br /> <br /> Also one of the most depressing color films you have ever seen.
