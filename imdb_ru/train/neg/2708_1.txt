This film is disguised as a social commentary, although in reality it is as ridiculous as racism itself, which it condemns. The premise of this film: African American = strong ... any other race = weak. Worst of all, when Rapaport shoots a pistol at Omar Epps and a Jewish guy. The Jewish guy, in a stereotypical manner, collapses in fear and begins to beg for his life ... but the big, strong, defiant Omar Epps remains strong without fear. We also have the conviction of every member of the fraternity as an arrogant drunk drunk or rapist. Of course, a raped white girl starts thinking about lesbianism, because in the end she is just a weak white girl. When a detached white guy is rejected by fraternity members, he must, of course, get in touch with skinheads, who are incredible cowards; especially the big muscular guy who is quickly knocked down by strong black men. Wait ... BUSTA RHYMES beat a guy twice his size ??? Yeah, right. <br /> <br /> Of course, black people NEVER reject their own people, and Omar Epps moves with them easily. The scenes in which Ice Cube threatens his white roommates and keeps them in line are stupid - of course, he dominates, while his weak white roommates sit in fear of him and eventually leave. This film was just awful, and the ending made me laugh out loud. An excessively long slow motion between Epps and Banks becomes ridiculous with the faces they make — it's like watching my nephew and cousins ​​make faces at each other (and they are less than 5 years old). Do yourself a favor and miss this crappy holiday.
