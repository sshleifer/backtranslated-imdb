I saw this movie at the AFI Dallas festival. Most viewers, including my wife, liked this comedy drama, but I didn't. It starred Lucas Haas (Brick, Alpha Dog), Molly Parker (“Kiss”, “Five Senses”, Hollywood) and Adam Scott (“First Snow”, Confidential Art School). Directed by Matt Bissonnett, who is married to Molly Parker. All three actors do an excellent job in this film with three friends, marriage of two of them and infidelity with the participation of the third. All this happens in a lake house and looks wonderful. The film wants to first see it as a comedy, and then a drama, and I thought that you need the opposite.
