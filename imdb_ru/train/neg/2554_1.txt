Honestly, I don’t even joke when I say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! This film does not have a single ounce of originality in its fragile dialogue or its clearly plagiarized storyline. I can’t even count the number of things in this film that are clearly disrupted from The Signs and other similar films. For example, Nanny “Lucy” in this film is actually one of the devil minions sent to direct and protect the creature of Satan ... it looks like Mrs. Beilock to someone else. Another thing is that in the shelter, where the child was first burned to the ground, just a few months after his adoption, as in "The Omen". However, fortunately, one priest survived the flame and avoided severe burns all over his body ... another coincidence ?????? And to top it all, the burned priest is in the hospital ward with images of Jesus on the walls, like the priest in Omen, on the walls of which the Bible pages are pasted, like on wallpaper. Please do not even force me to make comparisons between the end of this film and “The Omen” for you, because, as I said above, there are too many references.
