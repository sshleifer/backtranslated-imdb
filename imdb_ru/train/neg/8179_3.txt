â€œA trio of treasure hunters is looking for a hidden state in the West Indies. The lure of gold contributes to the growth of tension when people approach the location of the treasure. Deep-sea divers hope to track down the gold, but finding this greed and hatred leads to murder, "the annotation says on the DVD cover. Manfish is the name of their boat, not a monster. The skeleton that gives muscular captain John Bromfield (like Brannigan) its half of the treasure map is very good. Old salt Victor Jory (as professor) provides the other half of the map. First friend Lon Cheney Jr. (as a Swede) plays silly, and sexy Tessa Prendergast (as Alita) guards rum (obviously, not very good). Serious problems we spoil the picture with editing and continuity, which would otherwise cost something. <br /> <br /> *** Manfish (2/56) V. Lee Wilder ~ John Bromfield, Victor Jory, Lon Cheney younger
