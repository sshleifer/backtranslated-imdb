This film is a waste of the film. Do you believe that the map of the military mission plan will be placed on the easel in the courtyard in broad daylight for those who see binoculars or a camera with a zoom lens? It happened in this movie. Do you believe that a deaf person will really be enrolled in the active army in Europe during World War II, to serve in the unit of "blacks" ... to prepare, provide services, details of burial, etc.? It happened in this movie. Do you believe that a black (and supposedly intelligent) officer would choose this most deaf KP? to be part of an active combat mission to protect the dam from being destroyed by the Germans until the Allies arrive? It happened in this movie. Would you be surprised that the Deaf soldier did not understand that a German plane was approaching from behind and would shoot and kill him? It happened in this movie. Would you be surprised that a group of American soldiers who were detained in a barn on a farm that the Germans ran into, REMAINS of their emotions at the sight of German soldiers who were only 50 meters away? They did this in this film and left any possible entrances to the barn that the Germans could check out completely unprotected. Could you believe that the captain mentioned the rank of general over the airwaves and in pure English, if not his name, as the person with whom he spoke, and that the general said in plain English over open airs that the dam should be protected on the next day? Perhaps they should have just sent an emissary to tell in which direction the US attack would go in order to ease the task a bit to the Germans. This so-called film should be included in the list of the top 50 worst films. If it were, Iâ€™m sure it would be good. Take a look at your own risk.
