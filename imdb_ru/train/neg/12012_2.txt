The dialogue was pretty awful. The plot is not really all that inspired the obvious turn that it represents. Not visually stunning. In fact, visually annoying from time to time. Definitely one of those movies that you find it easier to finish if you hold one finger on the fast-forward button. If you could watch it for free, you would have absolutely no other options at the moment, and you would really dig when you saw a little poltergeist lady ... well, maybe I would recommend it to you, but not to someone still about whom i might think
