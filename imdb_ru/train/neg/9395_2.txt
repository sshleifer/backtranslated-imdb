This series is interesting to watch as a feature of MST3K, but for today's audience that is all that is needed. I was very surprised to see the year in which it was made in 1952. Given the fact that this fact alone makes it hard (modest?) 2 in my book. Used cars don't even look modern, they look like things from the 30s. This is basically Cody (saving the lonely world? Shish speaks about insulting everyone else, such as the military), anyway, it is Cody in his flight suit with a nipple against Graber and Daley, two stupid assistants who carry pistols and a random beam gun. pretty lame in itself, enjoy. If you want to watch a really good series, watch Flash Gordan, it's full of rockets that attack each other, and a good, evil, sworn enemy, as well as good looking women, this is NOTHING. And Flash was created about 15 years before this shit so you can relax a bit. Something done in 1952 is bad, deserves 2. Nuff said. give it 6 points, if you watch it as an episode of MST3K, these guys will enjoy it; tweak here, tweak, and I'm flying! And now, as an additional bonus, I present to you the song Commander Cody Theme, originally sung by Joel and his two robot heroes Tom Servo and Crow on board the love satellite for the eighth episode of The Enemy Planet: <br /> <br /> (Singing at the very beginning of the credits); <br /> <br /> (TOM SERVO SINGING) YOUR OWNING KODI TEAM .... HE IS A NEW CHARACTER OF THE REPUBLIC, <br /> <br /> HE MEETS IN EVERY AWESOME WEEK ... BUT IT SAVED EDITING, /> <br /> SIMPLY TWO SEVERAL HIS JACKET ... SEND IT TO YOUR WAY, <br /> <br /> THE PUMP HEAD AND THE ROQUET PACKAGE .. .. will save the day, <br /> <br /> (Joel sings). His lab is a boxing ring ... When the bad guys come to mix it up, <br /> <br /> Someone always gets kidnapped. .. AND CODI SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED, <br /> <br /> HE DRINKED HIS TEA IN CAFE AL ... AND FLYING FORWARD ON WIRES, <br /> <br /> BEAT ON CIRCLES AND SUMMER WITH HOOKS ... AND PUSHING FOREST FIRES, <br /> <br /> (DOOR SING) <br /> <br /> THE BAD GUYS REMAIN ... THERE ALSO, <br /> <br /> YOU Like his hair, it's under his HELMUT ... AND BECAUSE WE CAN'T THINK ABOUT A GOOD REIFE, <br /> <br /> THIS IS THE END OF THE COMMANDER CODES SONG THE SONGS ... SO IS THE RIGHT BACK TO THE GRANITE, AND THE HEAD EIGHTH WHY IS A ENEMY PLANET
