Summary: According to legend, Valkyrie Brunhilda defied Odin and was chained to a rock surrounded by eternal fire. Only a warrior, pure in heart, can pass through the flames, liberate Brünnhilde and free her from the claims of Odin and receive her for himself. War is now brewing in the Norwegian lands, and the king needs an alliance with the berserkers. Berserkers are warriors claimed by the Valkyrie of Odin, thirsting for war, blood and flesh and, therefore, outcasts, but superior in battle. The leader of the Berserkers is the despicable son of the King, the Boar, and his price for an alliance is his brother, the future king, Barek. But after the king won the battle, he refuses to surrender his only remaining son, breaking the boar’s oath and betraying him and killing him. The boar is saved only by calling Barek to Odin. But this is only the beginning of the battle between the brothers, and their last battle should start now, after millennia ... <br /> <br /> Comments: I hoped that it would be a movie based on some Vikings, too little quality film about Vikings . It all started very well, with detailed armor and armor, beautiful and suitable landscapes and a successful battle. <br /> <br /> The basis in the ashyr myths is thin and seems to me very spoiled. One much more vengeful, angry and absent than I remind him from school, and the Valkyries turned into vampire demons. I am not an expert, but it seems wrong. <br /> <br /> But this fatal mistake made by this film is to move the time setting from the original time period to the present. If two brothers fought at the right time, with some decent battles, this film would be much better. Now the settings are unexpectedly changing today in Stockholm. However, Odin is present and sends Kaban and his berserkers to Brunhilda and Barek, who give silly scenes when the armored and painted berserkers fight on swords with Barek among the industry. Beautiful mountains and forests were exchanged for cement. And when I was allowed to focus on individual battles, and not on mass battles, as in the beginning, I quickly saw that the battles and skills of the actors are slow and clumsy. <br /> <br /> The end result is a delicate story, sometimes difficult to follow, and sometimes just silly, and the only thing that could save him, the action, is slow, boring, and clumsy sword battles. He relies very little on the ashyr myth or Viking tradition. Thus, both the story and the action fail, and the film is simply bad. <br /> <br /> Finally, like a Swede, this film is a bit confusing. Presumably filmed entirely in South Africa, it still contains some familiar Swedish signs, signs and something like a genuine police car. However, efforts are scarce and go so far that they actually set it up in Sweden. No names are Swedish (perhaps, with the exception of Ani), no familiar landscapes are Swedish, they (presumably) speak a little (ancient?) Norwegian, not Swedish. And the uniform, both police and medical, is clearly not Swedish. If they are not even going to try to do it right - and really create the illusion that this is happening in Sweden, why bother? <br /> <br /> 4/10
