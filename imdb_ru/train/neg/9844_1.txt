it was one of the worst movies i have ever seen. I'm still not sure if this was serious or just satire. One of those films that uses every fool who doesn't know the clich√© they can think about. Arrrrgh. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson was pretty good at it. But otherwise it sucks. It was more than 10 years ago when I saw it, but it still hurts and will not stop lingering in my brain. <br /> <br /> The last line of the movie really shows how stupid it is. I will not spoil it for you if you want to try your luck by watching this movie. But I guarantee you * nghya * a moment at the end, with several in between. If you have nothing to do, and you like to point and laugh, then perhaps it's worth it. In addition, if you are forced to go on a date with someone who you really do not like, offer to watch this film together, and they will probably leave you alone after they see it. I think this is a fair price.
