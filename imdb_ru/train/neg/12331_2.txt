One of those films about "coming of age", which should cause nostalgia for adults and promise children. This film has neither. This is a bad excuse to let Sylvia Christelle frolic twice with a jerk Eric Brown. Worse, the film is either stupid or stupid when it tries to be funny, sexy or dramatic. It is embarrassing to laugh, as we must believe that the teenager will go alone, burying the dead woman in her yard. Think about why a woman known to Emmanuel needs a double body. When the film went on and on, I began to imagine a hybrid of private lessons and little Miss Millions in which Sylvia Christel seduced Jennifer Love Hewitt, because Howard Hesseman causes us nostalgia for WKRP. Look to laugh at the folly of other people, at the committed performance of Ed Begley Jr., or at the surprise of what Sylvia Christel with Jennifer Love Hewitt will look like. But I can give you an idea of ​​your lesson, stay away from films with Sylvia Christelle, who are not Emmanuel.
