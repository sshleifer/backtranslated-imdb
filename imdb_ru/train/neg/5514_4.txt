I don’t know about you, but what I love about the cartoons about Tom and Jerry is the (often violent) interaction between the two characters. A mouse in Manhattan sees Jerry leave Tom to spend an adventure in New York, and as I understand it, this man definitely suffers from a lack of a cat! <br /> <br /> As magical as Jerry’s "Big Apple" study might be for other T & J fans who commented on IMDb here, I could not wait for this smug rubbish to end, so I could watch the following cartoon on my DVD. <br /> <br /> In fact, the only part of the whole episode I sincerely enjoyed was when Jerry almost “buys the farm”, dangerously hanging from the end of a broken candle hundreds of feet above the busy road.
