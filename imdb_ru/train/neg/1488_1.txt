I had to register on IMDb to comment on how awful this movie is ... my cats and string club have a better storyline than this one. Not the worst acting I've ever seen, but when you destroy almost the entire cast of a film within 5 minutes, it leaves much to be desired. There was not a single “frightening” moment in the film, except when they watched the movie “Halloween” on TV. Around, it seems, it could have been a good story, twisting the captions and saying that Chacey Lane was involved, it was a small loss, because I didn’t recognize it right away, and her scene was already over before I could say “oh yeah , here she is". I am so glad that I saw this at the hotel and did not pay for it, because I would be very unhappy if I paid a cent to see it. I usually like it, or at least I can find the ransom factor in the film, but this one is an exception. It's so bad that it's not even so funny, so good, it's bad ... it's just bad.
