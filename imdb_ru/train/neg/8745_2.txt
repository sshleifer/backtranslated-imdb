Another one of the extremely unprofessional films about programmers. <br /> <br /> It seems that the authors of this film do not know the real specifics of the world of programmers. <br /> <br /> The 20 best programmers in the world, programs for which have their own satellites (for what?), a program that uses satellite frequency, someone kills someone to steal codes (why?), and many silly moments in this movie. <br /> <br /> People who are not programmers will see something terrible in this film, because not professionals in this. But people will see not real things. <br /> <br /> Programmers find this film strange and terrible, because many moments in the film DO NOT MEET real life (why isnâ€™t the film fantastic?).
