After reading the reviews, it became obvious that everyone had intellectualized this work. How boring. Oh, how about the good old days, and there was nothing like that. Of all the comments, no one expressed any emotion about this work or any other. <br /> <br /> I grew up immediately after the end of the steam age, and this cinematic stone, together with Dan'l Bun, was decorated with Saturday afternoon matinees. chuckling, snotty monsters like me or being myself. And it was the filler of the cinema at that time. Almost as big as the Wizard of Oz. <br /> <br /> IMDb insists that in every criticism there is something about the plot. The problem was that it was rather a template. Here it is. Randolph Scott (cowboy / hero) gathers friends and defeats those evil people. Hooray! <br /> <br /> All of us children have figured out this conspiracy before we lowered our quarter to watch it. It was the storyline of every Scott, John Wayne and Roy Rogers film. If you take the time to go back and watch each movie - just do not ask for surprises. <br /> <br /> We need to remember the context of time. There was no or little TV. None for kids. There was a school there. It was great in the fresh air. There were toy guns. No cyber time. And the steam age has just collapsed. But films like this provided entertainment and filled the imagination of the young captors. Even the girls got into it. <br /> <br /> This movie was fun. And this is as meaningless as everything that is produced today. Initially, the goal was propaganda. But children's films quickly became. <br /> <br /> Our fathers have experienced the present. And not earlier than in ten years, Sam Pekingapah, who, at last, is replete with red splashes of artificial blood in realistic and abundant quantities. Until his leadership died slowly, with great pain and misfortune. Before the war in Beijing, the shootings were a rather bloodless affair. Thanks Sam. <br /> <br /> To watch the film, there was little blood or no, adults did not mind. I think they would not allow it. No guts spraying destructive plant life. So this film had all the glory, not all the blood. Gong Ho then suited for children. <br /> <br /> You will see that I assigned a four to this rating. Why should I do this? Well. This is a terrible movie. No matter how much I love it. I really like this film because it gave me one of the happiest moments of my childhood. But this is not so good in terms of film quality. In fact, Goong Ho has become a romantic romance for children. <br /> <br /> If people watch it. Of course. I am not saying to stay away. Realistically however. The plot is simple. Are the characters small? they are shoals. You can love a bad movie.
