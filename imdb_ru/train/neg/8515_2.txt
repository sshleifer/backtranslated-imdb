I was so disappointed with this show. Hearing and reading all this hype about it, about how it was "innovative show" and all sorts of wild promises, if the quality, I tried to watch it. <br /> <br /> What a bad luck !! The game was forced and exaggerated. The story had very little meaning. As for any hint of the vaunted "look at the life of adolescents," I could only see a meager attempt, in which there was as much reality as there was a reality show. <br /> <br /> Some wonder why there are so many negative reviews about this show. The reason is that this is actually not so good, and the kick in quality drums on this show only draws attention to how poorly it is made.
