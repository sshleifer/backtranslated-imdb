Having nothing to do with any type of filmmaking and healthy evaluation of documentaries, I can honestly say that I was angry with myself for having bothered to sit for the duration of the “20 dates”. I will not waste your time on the plot, you can read other reviews. I will say, though, that hyper Berkowitz, the Woody Allen style story was extremely annoying. You either wanted him to put off coffee, or to take tranquilizers. And for Berkovitsky himself it is potentially obvious that this film was a bad idea, since in some of its parts his attempts to finance the documentary are described in detail. Sorry for masking insults as a compliment, but I pay tribute to Berkovich for the fact that he knew how to convince some idiot to finance this terrible piece of ****. I appreciate the limits and intentions of the film here, but even with regard to the standards that Berkowitz sets for himself, it works and does not fall on all levels. In conclusion, I am sure that many of these female companions were not going to go on a date with a daring, willing director, and therefore I question the feeling of authenticity of the film. Hey, Miles, I liked your movie when I first saw it ... when it appeared in the episode of the TV series "Seinfeld" or directed by Woody Allen or Kevin Smith.
