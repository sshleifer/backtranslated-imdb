Words cannot begin to describe how horrible this movie is. I wish it was "so bad, it's good," but it is not. It's just boring, lifeless and boring. It is so bad that I could not even laugh at it. <br /> <br /> In response to other posters, Anne-Marie Frigon is not the highlight of the film. The only person who is less charismatic is director Brett Kelly, who, as a true statement about vanity, considers himself a leading man. They both look like inbrids, sister and brother. <br /> <br /> The girl, Sherri Turig, is very pretty. The exact opposite of Anne-Marie is attractive. This girl is tall and willow and can act. Although you can say that she is holding back. <br /> <br /> It seems that all the actors are holding back, especially the supporting man, Mark. I saw less wood in the rainforest, but it is still better than Kelly. Why Kelly does not allow actors to play? Is he really such a bad director? All the others perfectly summed up the story - it is not. Children are kidnapped, and Kelly enters a piece of shit to solve a crime. I know how he felt on the march, as I felt after watching his movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, I tried to get my money back from the rental. This is a home movie that is best watched by the director’s friends (and if you find them, you’ll see that it’s these friends who gave the film positive ratings).
