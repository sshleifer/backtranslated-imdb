A rather useless movie for television, which largely follows the script of the insect killer. Ants mysteriously turn into killer ants near the hotel. I think this is from the hotel’s food, because the wastewater from the hotel’s kitchen flows directly into the ant’s bed. In this film, there is not enough waiting, and this is also not scary. Watching ants sting their victims is not very scary. <br /> <br /> Section "Spoilers" The stupidity of the hero is incredible. He is told that he is a health inspector, that ants cannot be a hero. It must be a mysterious virus. After the inspector said this, the hero picks up his bulldozer and destroys a huge colony of ants. It interferes with millions of ants and traps people in a hotel. <br /> <br /> Final spoilers In general, this film is extremely unfortunate. I don’t understand why he released a DVD when there are so many decent films. My only guess for the DVD release is that Suzanne Summers is shown in the film. This is a film to avoid.
