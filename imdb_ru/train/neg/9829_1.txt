Sending me was delayed, but after 30 seconds it became clear that it was either David Lynch, or something really terrible. Itâ€™s interesting to just go through the list of fundamentalist laundry. I can be biased to an exciting spiritual work (I recall Romero), but there was nothing spiritual about it. It seems that we all have to pretend that we have iq 80 (or just do a lobotomy - Jennifer, what happened to you?) And blindly follow the Bible without any introspection, otherwise we will call the second comes. It is this attitude that makes people fly giant planes in 110-story buildings (I work around the corner from the site of the former WTC). I like to think that God is a little more than that.
