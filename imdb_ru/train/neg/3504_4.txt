I gave this show (I only watched seven episodes) four stars, because most of its jokes / attitudes seem to fail. Some of them are not quite funny, but some are funny - in the spirit of a 12-year-old boy. She reminds me of that New York artist who paints on canvas, calls it art and sells for big money. Silverman throws away what she has, including the kitchen sink, while she prays for a few things to stick to the wall in her desire to be funny, but different. <br /> <br /> However, what she “received” often is not enough, as if she lacks what a good comedian needs to succeed. <br /> <br /> The whole enterprise looks like an unfinished potato.
