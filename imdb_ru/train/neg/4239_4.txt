I thought it was a better movie because he was on cable. I was expecting something like a stupid melodrama and bad special effects that can be seen in classic games such as Christmas Peak or First Daughter / Target / Shot, etc. <br /> <br /> The cast was chosen correctly ... I especially liked Ron Livingston as the commander of the special forces. It's nice to see that he is again looking at the same material with which he was so lucky in the Band of Brothers. Producers and designers did their homework, because all the scenes and shots looked like on that day in 1997. <br /> <br /> So, if you have the opportunity to watch this movie, and Iâ€™m sure you will, since FX restarts all 50 times ... it takes 2 hours and enjoy.
