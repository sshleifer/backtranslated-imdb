Why no one can make a decent film from the legendary tale? This is the second adaptation of "Beowulf", which I was disappointed in a year. But I have to say that the previous version (“Beowulf and Grendel” with Gerald Butler in the title role) was far superior to that. It was a bit disappointing. This is a mess !!! <br /> <br /> What worried me the most? Were they useless plot elements that they added for no particular reason (human sacrifices? Useless love interest?), Or bad CGI, or inconsistency of characters, or not an inspired game? Even worse was how they made the beautiful Marina Syrtis look so awful !!! And let's not even talk about this ridiculous crossbow? <br /> <br /> And why do they constantly remind us that Beowulf had the strength of 30 people, and yet he never showed the slightest sign of such strength during the entire film. He was thrown by both monsters, with whom he fought, relying on his assistants to save the bacon. Even when he hit the arrogant prince, he didn't knock him out. He was too dependent on weapons. Beo-wimp more like it. It was, of course, not a powerful Beowulf from an epic poem! <br /> <br /> I would like to end this on a positive note, but I cannot come up with any surprises. All I can say is, if you have ever read Beowulf, you will be infinitely disappointed by this grim, inaccurate excuse adaptation!
