When I recall my college years at Ohio University, there will always be one event that I will remember with pleasant memories. Channel 23 is the local access channel OU, and until the last few years it basically reproduced everything that was sent to them. This included a lot of do-it-yourself movies, ranging from a guy who prints a micro-relief, and then scanning their photos on the Internet, to a Macbeth version with eighth-graders who apparently just learned how to make pumpkins. <br /> <br /> However, the king In my opinion, from the line of the channel 23 was the Midnight Skater. The first time I looked was about 2 in the morning. I had to study. Or asleep. Or watch a regular TV. But no, it's all for pussies. My roommate and I watched Midnight Skater, and when it was finished, I didn’t think any of us believed that a movie had just happened. But, of course, it happened a few nights later, and we had to accept the fact that this film really exists. <br /> <br /> I could go on and talk about how terrible he is, but this is a kind of horror that makes life worth living. The plot is scattered, it acts terribly, all the scars are from the heart, but, damn it, if there are others watching you, it’s impossible not to have a good time watching it. It’s like the first time you hear Chuck Pahalnyuk’s “Guts.” You hear it, you feel disgust and shock, but after five minutes all you want and want is to make someone experience the horrible horror that you just experienced. <br /> <br /> In short, the Midnight Skater, for all its epic flaws, makes for some very nightly fun. Plus, I desperately want the Midnight Skater theme. Kudos to the one who wrote it and sang it. Sweet God, I love this song.
