If your idea of ​​entertainment is to look at graphic shots of people hit by cars (you can see a woman driving under the front wheel, spinning when the car passes over her before she sits under the rear wheel - and they show it twice if you missed it the first time), then this is a documentary for you. In truth, I no longer watched this very disturbing piece of voyeurism, but that was enough for me. Maybe everything else is even better. <br /> <br /> I wonder how long it will take the television networks to start running slush movies. Perhaps self-destruct game shows would be good. <br /> <br /> I already know that there are worried people in the world and that terrible things are happening. I don't need to see evidence on TV disguised as entertainment.
