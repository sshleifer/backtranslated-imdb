... but the key word is usually. I know that I adore films that EVERYONE thinks are stupid. But in the world of B rated films, this one is Z-rated. Absolutely funny. In most of my favorite B rated movies, I respect the fact that they do not take themselves too seriously. The creators of such films are easy to film, even if it is a heavy topic. However, I have the impression that the producers of this film seriously got down to business, as if they were collecting a 10-star classic, full of failed attempts at sharp lines and stupid frames. Nevertheless, in spite of all this, I ALWAYS gave him 4 out of 10 stars, as I am inclined to such films. However, if you are a fan of category B, I would try too hard to find it.
