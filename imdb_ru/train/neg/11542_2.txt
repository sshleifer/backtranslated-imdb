An unpleasant woman and an equally unpleasant man are subjected to a brutal and terrible attack by a group of two-dimensional psycho-raiders during a nightly meeting on a forest road in Shropshire, England. A man and a woman who have been attacked are planning and attacking revenge on their attackers ... <br /> <br /> A completely repulsive piece of voyeuristic garbage, somehow disguised as a “thought-provoking” drama, while in fact, it sounds like a sub-michael winner cr * p (you just know that Oliver Reed and Susan George would have been played if it were so easy to do in the 1970s). What happens to Alice (Gillian Anderson) and Adam (Danny Dyer) is terrible and destructive, but Dan Reid somehow manages to rub the viewer's nose to the last drop of his sexual nastiness. His camera eagerly lingers on Anderson’s naked body both during and after the attack, while the script leaves almost all the characters wandering in the muddy sea of ​​a two-dimensional cliche. His script causes his characters to behave in such a way as to further repel the viewer from the "victims", stuffing more horrible situations into their faces (Adams attempts after the incident on Sophie and Alice; Alice’s attack on Heffer AFTER his suicide is an attempt to confess). <br /> <br /> Trouble comes from the speeches of the main characters - Dyer is a terrible actor incapable of light and shadow like a young man who fell victim to the initial attack (he is ultimately the Past, remember my words), but Anderson is extraordinary. Even though the cruel scenario makes her character behave lewdly and ridiculously, she somehow gives an unusually convincing and complex character as a self-deprecating, arrogant hedonist who is faced with such horrors and needs to be responded. A vile and meaningless film then, almost, but not entirely saved by an irresistible central female game.
