There were some great actors in this movie! Unfortunately, they forgot how to act. I was hoping that the film would be better, but it was so robotic that it was doomed from the very beginning. In fact, it turned out that the actors might have been reading the script all the time. Maybe it was a musical score or the director himself, but one thing is for sure, the makeup artist needs to find another job! Face powder was so thick that on the faces of the actors you could see her caked! I would not recommend this film to anyone, no wonder it never hit Theaters. Cuba Gooding Jr. / James Woods disgrace you guys for not giving all this. The plot was great, just needed a lot more.
