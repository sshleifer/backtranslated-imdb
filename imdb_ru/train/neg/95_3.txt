You have to admire Brad Sykes, even if you don’t really want it, a person who lets out budget horror after budget horror for less enthusiastic receptions. But still continues to do so. Even indecisive praise than that which surrounds his films “Blood Camp” is reluctantly given, and I am guilty of this, like everyone else. Brad usually manages to bring something interesting into the mix, an elegant idea, a strange character, anything, but without the means to raise it further than the basic level, he relies on the audience to weaken it and appreciate what it is and What could it be. Joe Haggerty in the role of Ebenezer Jackson gives a sharp and very funny performance, and Sykes believes that he can feel that this strange turn will work within the film. Approaching the multiplex next to you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.
