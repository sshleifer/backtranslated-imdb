Great West, I hear you all say! Brilliant first effort! Well, I'm not sure which movie you all watched, but it had to be different from the one I saw. Great westerns or really good films of any genre have characters you can believe in, but they don’t have them in this movie! The game was bad, to say the least, and I didn’t care about any of the characters, which made the whole film meaningless. this story was too big for the creators, and perhaps they should try to make low-budget trash directly on television, as you see in these programs “FACT OR FICTION” in science fiction. <br /> <br /> Please, if you are looking for a good film, a great western film or even just a pleasant one and a half hours, please look elsewhere.
