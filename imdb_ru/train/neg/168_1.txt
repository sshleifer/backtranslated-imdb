Despite a decent first season, this series did not come close to realizing its potential. Established as a prequel to the original Star Trek series, he was doomed almost from the very beginning by executive producer Rick Berman, who felt compelled to artificially limit and limit the definition of what Star Trek could be (that’s a futuristic show, all more anachronistic from a dramatic point of view). The actual runner of the show, Brannon Braga, did not help him with the boring and weary rephrasing of previous episodes of the Track and careless disregard for the internal mythology of the franchise (from the very beginning it was obvious that he was in it only for salary). I have never seen the series, which so consistently did a disservice to talented actors (excluding Jolene Blaylock), which lasted so long. It is as if this entire series was created in a bubble that exists outside of the modern television landscape, where the audience (even the Trekker audience) is more demanding and tempted in its dramatic desires and desires. Unfortunately, it seems that Berman and Brahe managed to convince the top officials at Paramount that the Enterprise suffered from “franchise fatigue” and that its main audience did not go away, but was expelled. Make a quality proposal that meets the high ideals and standards of its predecessors, and they (the audience) will come. <br /> <br /> Simply put, in the TeeVee universe, where we are given shows like “Battlestar: Galactica” and “Shield”, which should be in power, should give viewers a Star Trek that corresponds to the level and is extremely competitive. It's so simple and simple.
