This film must be the worst I've ever seen. The name of the film deceives the public, making you think that maybe there is hope. The plot line of the movie is ridiculous at best, and the acting is so poor that you just need to cringe. The name “Zombie Nation” implies a zombie treasure, although in fact there are only six of them. This cannot be categorized as horror movies due to the introduction of raw 80s music when zombies “attack”. Zombies actually speak and behave like people in a film, with the only difference that makeup is like something from a La Roux video. If you ever get the chance to buy this film, do it, and then record a copy.
