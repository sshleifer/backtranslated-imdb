Absolutely horrible movie. Ameteurish, and this is not at all funny. The main character, played by Mehmet Ali Erbil, is very annoying. Edit E.T and Star Wars is just silly. <br /> <br /> Actor Yilmaz Goksal is the only good thought about this film. He must master his English and move to Hollywood. Hollywood cannot find an actor with his qualities. Besides Goksal, this film is rubbish. <br /> <br /> Directed by Ghani Muyde is a comic and this film is his worst written work to date. <br /> <br /> Jam Karaka's music is another plus is a waste of money. Actor Sumer Tilmak also has some presence. An actor who plays three sons has no more talent than ever.
