S.I.C.K. really worth it so incredibly crappy I killed myself. There was absolutely no acting to talk about. The best part of the entire production was the artwork on the cover of the box. The budget of this film was sufficient. The shooting took place on Sesame Street. The staging is similar to the underground shooting for gangster hits. The props used in this film were stolen from a clothing store. The ending was so predictable that you should go back to the last 5 minutes and laugh. If there is a book for this film, Iâ€™m sure it is better. I would have avoided it at all costs. I really liked the intimate scenes in which they shot the whole movie. just kidding.
