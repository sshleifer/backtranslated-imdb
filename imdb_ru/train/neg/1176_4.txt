Revolutions always provide opportunities for dramatic films, since, in fact, most revolutions are themselves dramatic events. Unfortunately, the fact that this film is not enough in the drama is compensated by an excess of boredom. No matter who wins, loses, dies, or survives, just end this as soon as possible. This is largely due to the fact that it seems to me superficial use of background technologies. The scenes of Paris and the French countryside are of cardboard quality. Better to make them on a bare stage and leave it like this. You can not expect the amazing effect of “House of Flying Daggers” or “Golden Compass”, but in the end, this is a digital work of 2002. It seems that the characters enter the scene for the sake of entering the scene so much that the number of times the character enters and leaves the room is lost. In my opinion, this film turns the French Revolution of the 1790s into a papier-mâché revolution in the world of papier-colleagues.
