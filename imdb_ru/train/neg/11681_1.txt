The trailers for this movie were better than the movie. What a waste of talent and money. It is a pity that I would not wait for the release of this film on DVD, because, at least, I would not have $ 9. The film completely misses the mark. What could be a BIG movie for all the actors turned out to be a B-movie at best. The film moved VERY slowly, and when I thought that he was going somewhere, he almost worked, but then this did not happen. In our time, we need unpredictable plot twists and turns in the film, and this film has not offered either. Everything about how everyone is suspected is good, but Iâ€™m not sure if it was the way it was directed, coverage, line delivery, spelling or what, but nothing came of it. A lot of hype for nothing. I was VERY disappointed in this film and I tell everyone NOT to watch it. Mean saxophone music everywhere made the movie worse. And the final has nothing to do with the rest of the film. What a disappointment.
