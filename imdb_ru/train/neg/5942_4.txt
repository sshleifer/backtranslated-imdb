If this is supposed to be a black experience, let me out through the front or back door. <br /> <br /> Once, motherâ€™s boy sees 2 young hoods pass by, and since then he has gone down the hill. Angela Bassett, the only radiant grace in this film, plays over her protective, religious mother. Despite her anger at how his life has changed, by the middle of the picture she really decides to accept it. She allows her friends to enter, and suddenly everything is in order, if you use profanity, while she is not in front of children. <br /> <br /> This is a sad state of affairs with gangster rap. You knew where this film is going. <br /> <br /> I literally laughed out loud when, at the end, when Bassett escorted his son's body to the funeral, she states that although his life was cut off at 24, he became a man. What man? He was a convicted criminal, wrote the most brutal rap music with constant vulgarity and despised society. The scene in the classroom where he tells the teacher that as a health worker he will earn more than the teacher is a great example of what is happening in our schools. Complete and total lack of respect for the teacher. <br /> <br /> Competition between the gang of rap on the east coast, the west coast is never fully explained. All that we see is a blazing weapon. <br /> <br /> A terrible picture that does nothing to prevent gang violence. What horrible role models are these rap singers and their dirty music. The African American community should be offended by their being. Who was this classless fat man who portrayed Biggie? He made Roerun from the old TV show look thin compared to him. I know that it was on the streets of Bedford Styvesanta that this plump little boy turned into a vulgar monster that he was. What a dismal state of affairs when this is called cinematic entertainment.
