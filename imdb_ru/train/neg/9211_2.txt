This film reminds me very much of the anti-drug films of the 50s and 60s due to the fact that it was shot by people who, obviously, had never experienced the social evil that we were warned about. Tom Hanks and his buddies "play the role-playing games", but there are no dice in the game, a lot of candles, and then you are simply swept away by a poor assembly, showing that Hanks is falling in love with a woman from the group. quite funny, but mistaken. I wonder how many poor children destroyed their D and D materials, and they were told that using their imagination was the path to destruction. Like a movie, it's mostly after school, a bad acting game (although Hanks does show some of his talents) and talk about relationships, and no one seems to be having fun. It seems that these films have a psychological focus on adolescents who begin the path to adulthood, which seems to be more serious and requires you to buckle up and do what everyone else does. Despite my voice 2, itâ€™s worth seeing because of its unique genre, scared movies that I personally find quite funny.
