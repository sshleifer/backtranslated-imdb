What is interesting is acting; it was not bad, just not enough. It was rather unconvincing. Special effects and lines were not the only culprit for this failure. Stand alone they were not terribly bad, but together it was a tragic step. The show seemed long and slow with special effects, obviously intended to speed up the film, but it completely failed. <br /> <br /> Much of the blame for this catastrophe was placed on special effects. they were cool. Appleby was not the best choice for this endeavor. Although, perhaps, she was the only one they chose, with little recognition from the fans. An experienced actress would bring something to the role, as Appleby never did. Scfi releases some really good original films, itâ€™s just too bad that it failed so radically.
