This film essentially deals with Inspector Gadgetâ€™s sworn enemy Dr. Kogtem, who has returned after many years to the now peaceful city of Metropolis. The Claw Plan is to once and for all prevent the Gadget with the help of a newer "tough" criminal to help destroy the popularity of the Gadget. Unfortunately, the film failed miserably, the series was great, but it was restored almost 20 years later with tragic results. Without the voice of Don Adams, as the Inspector of the Gadget, he simply does not shrink anymore; Dr. Koog is not only visually less intimidating, but also more like a fighter against a cold than his original, frightening personality. Of course, this is a children's film, but the plot is so painfully weak (God forbid to mention the animation) that it pales in comparison with the original series. Someone also decided to update Penny to speed her two decades, she now has a bit of quasi-punk rebellious style of clothes, and she does not play half the role she played in the series. Gadgetmobile speaks and also includes a plot angle that focuses on all talking cars. Maybe I'm just a kid who loved the show, which grew exhausted, but I thought the live action version was more painful than I could bear, but now they go and put this full stream of quality series on us. This is more than I can take.
