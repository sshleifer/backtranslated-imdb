This film was one of the worst I have seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> This is a combined police drama and comedy about two Hollywood detectives Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett, who are investigating a shootout at a hip-hop club. <br /> <br /> The plot is invented, and there are too many side questions. Ford is involved in real estate on the side (Martin Landau is one of his clients), Hartnett runs a yoga school, where in his spare time he entertains chickens, both are under investigation in internal affairs, Ford fucks a former girlfriend (Lena Olin) from an investigator of the IA, and A psychic who has a radio show, a man who organized a murder in a club, is a dirty ex-policeman who shot Hartnett's father many years ago. <br /> <br /> Throw in a mandatory car chase and several unsuccessful attempts at humor, and this is the essence of this turkey.
