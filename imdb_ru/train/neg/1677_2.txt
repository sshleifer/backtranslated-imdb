Unlike others, I refuse to call this pathetic excuse for a film a triumph of style over substance (I don’t want to call style a bad name). However, this is the most appropriate description that comes to mind. <br /> <br /> A meaningless, unpleasant and, ultimately, meaningless attack on the eyes and ears. "Wonderland" makes you think about why the film was made in the first place. and who in his right mind gave the green light to this dark and confused mess. Biography of porn star John Holmes? Studying who this man was, why he went into business, and how did that affect him? Fine. Must be irresistible, must be interesting. Connected to be instructive and fascinating on about a million levels (and I have zero interest in porn). <br /> <br /> But confused, violent, Rashomon style Holmes study series study was connected with after his career ended? Who cares? What ideas do we get? This film completely ignores the most interesting aspect of John Holmes’s life - that he was a porn star! “Wonderland” might as well have been about someone: the fact that the main character is the most famous adult movie star in history for men almost doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> To make the situation a thousand times worse, the picture is loaded with jerkoff tricks - annoying editing of machine guns, careless camera work Dogme-95, unnecessary graphics and animation on a split screen, etc., etc. br /> <br /> In the absence of a convincing story and a unique protagonist, the director (and I freely use this term) gathered a dozen or so techniques from other films and decided to call the resulting mess a film, including: a trendy, bleached look “Narc or “Road Traffic” or “Minority Report”; the crazy, often incomprehensible “throw pieces of the film into the air” in “Natural Born Killers” or “28 days later”; the soundtrack "Goodfellas" or "Blow", filled with every moment of silence with the old song, to trigger a period of groovy, title retro-sequence "Velvet Gold Vein", "Autofocus" or "Catch Me If You Can." The list goes on and on and on. Sorry. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. I had real hopes for that. Wonderland Avenue has existed for years; if the context of the killings had been emphasized, and not the killings themselves, I think it could work. If the killings (and Holmes's growing involvement in LA's unhealthy types) signaled the end of a career or the late 70s, I think the film could have mattered; it might serve a purpose. How is it - meaningless. It makes no sense. Who cares how many points of view there are on a series of murders, generally unknown to the public? The case is not well known to deserve such a painstaking study. <br /> <br /> This film was to be the third act of the John Holmes Story. That's all. Period. And it might work. What it is? Oh, yes, right, they did not want to tell the traditional story of rise and fall. They didn’t want to do Boogie Nights, Goodfell, Star 80 or Autofocus. They wanted their film to be different. Good? <br /> <br /> Well, in a sense, they succeeded. There is a big difference between these films and Wonderland. The difference is that these films are good. <br /> <br />
