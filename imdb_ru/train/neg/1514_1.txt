I just watched this movie yesterday. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend wanted to see him only because of Richard Gere. <br /> <br /> I feel that I wasted my time and money and told my girlfriend that this is the last Time when we go to watch a movie just because there is a certain actor / actress in it. I hope she learned the lesson because I had trouble keeping her in her place. As for me, since I already paid, I wanted to see the end, at least, simply in the hope that something good will work out, but I did not hold my breath, and, fortunately, because I would have been a victim of the film exactly same <br /> <br /> This is not a black and white film, but black and black. The main character (Richard Gere) is almost as bad as his owners, and all sexual criminals are portrayed as unsuitable for committing serious crimes criminals, and the bad ones were really very, very bad. Let's talk about the cliches and exploitation of a typical American phobia. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere acted well as usual, but the blond girl who had to replace him was helpless at best. Absolutely unconvincing for work. <br /> <br /> The film tries to use a popular theme and gives it a cheap, dramatic and sensational twist that is simply unreal. They simply use sex offenders as an excuse to indulge in cheap violent acts of murder, beating, rape, and torture â€” something that seems almost free. They even have a wolf attacking people in the film - how low you can get. <br /> <br /> I believe that the film will not be released in the USA and will go straight to DVD. It was supposed to stay in other countries, but since it was Hollywood and Richard Gere, they just needed to show it. Believe me, without the Gear, the movie is not even worth the B-series movie.
