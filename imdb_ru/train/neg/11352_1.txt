that's what you get if you let a 10-year-old American write a story about a trip to the moon. Absolute rubbish without redemptive qualities. Maybe he drew attention in the 3D department. but as a narrative and entertaining animation, there was nothing in it that could have wasted an hour and a half. Save time and money and instead see BOLT <br /> <br /> Damn. Not enough lines, but I feel that this sums up ... well, I agree with the aforementioned review - it looks like the propaganda history of the Cold War. Perhaps it would be more interesting if they learned about flies, revealing the deception of landing on the moon, or flies died in the first minute. By the way, why are all the main characters flies deformed? - none had a complete compliment of the limbs!
