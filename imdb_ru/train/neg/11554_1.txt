This film confuses filmmaking. I can not believe that it was even listed as a comedy - not funny. Not only was the script terrible, but the actors had to be shot. Gale O'Grady - just a great actress, but other than that ... 99% of the rest of the actors ... oh. Almost everyone else ... wow, it's hard even ... wow. Here's the number one rule for the comedy "DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BE FUNNY." There are many very talented actors in Canada who can act in drama and comedy, but none of them have been used in this film. Canadian filmmakers and directors help perpetuate bad filmmaking in Canada. I understand that technically this is an “American” film, but look at the director, actors, place, etc. I just saw this on Bravo - they should be ashamed that they bought the rights to show this film. Again, there are a lot of great movies that can not get airtime, and they show this crap.
