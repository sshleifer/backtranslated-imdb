The soul of the ancient mummy is passed on to one of his followers, so that he can punish everyone who was involved in the desecration of his grave. The transfer of the soul makes the young man develop rapidly, until he himself becomes like a mummy. One by one the blood is expiring from those who participate in the excavation. <br /> <br /> To be brief, Pharaoh’s curse is a rather boring affair. While in the film there are several good, original ideas (mummy, blood-sucking, soul transfer, interesting makeup effects, a scene of a ruptured hand, etc.) And a few atmospheric moments, the direction and pace are the same definition of hustle. Worse, the first 15 of the relatively short 66-minute length of the film consist of nothing but filling. I usually go to these slow movies about mummies, but the Pharaoh's Curse even checks my patients. The cast is very little help. With one exception (Ziva Rodann - a lonely bright spot - it’s a pity that the film couldn’t focus more on its mysterious character), the cast is as boring as the script. Finally, I do not know whose idea it was to put an ant servant in something like pajamas, but this is a funny, ridiculous look at a creature that should inspire fear in the audience. <br /> <br /> Despite my mostly negative comments about Pharaoh’s curse, I’m going to rate him 4/10. Not a very good rating, but generous, considering all my problems with the film.
