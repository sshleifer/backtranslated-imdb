Oh, dear, what a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Production was so cheap and unpleasant ... Remember a scene from the movie “Natural”, where lightning hits a tree (leaving a burning stump), what does Roy Hobbs make a bat out of ?? Well, the producers of this film used the same scene to prefix the stage where a tree branch crashed into a house. <br /> <br /> I wonder if they paid to use footage from Natural, or did they just hope that no one who would watch the movie would pick it up? <br /> <br /> Then at the end, when they tried to get away in the truck. Such an overstrain in the cabin. <br /> <br /> A very bad movie, a very bad movie.
