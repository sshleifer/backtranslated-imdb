I went to see it a few days ago, and it's hard to forget this movie ... for the wrong reasons. This film should be funny, it is not so, not a single laugh in the theater (perhaps for Jose Garcia and Gerard Depardieu), and it is boring, boring, boring. Sometimes it was even difficult to understand what they were saying. They just speak quickly and do not reveal them enough so that we can understand. I was with a friend, and more than 4 or 5 times I caught myself saying that after the line, which was supposed to be funny “what, what he said,” and I am French. I hate to talk about it, given the fact that I think that good films are made here, but I apologize in advance for all the foreigners who will go to see the film (if they are ever shown outside of France). <br /> <br /> We are very sorry about this cr @ p. 2/10
