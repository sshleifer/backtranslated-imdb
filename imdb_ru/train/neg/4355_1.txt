Horrible. I see a lot of user comments about how great this show is. It really is wanna-be-friends - Made in Taiwan is a fake. The jokes limp like ... and the plot is funny. The actors are obviously struggling to be funny and probably cringe when they fall into these terrible raisins (if you can call them that). Most of the other users who have commented, obviously, from another planet (or at least from another continent). There are obvious reasons why television companies cancel the show ... and none of them is the reason when the shows go well. It makes sense? In any case, stay away - even if it rains and there is nothing left on this planet ... instead, stand up in the rain - more fun.
