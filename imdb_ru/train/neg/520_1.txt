After we counted using the word f, about 22 times in the first 10 minutes of the film, we listened to some really bad actors talking about a woman and a horse, and pretty much acting like 12-year-old boys being naughty together, we turned off this. Reliance on unsubstantiated profanity and insignificant humor is a sure sign of the loser of a Hollywood film, a product of extraordinary and worthless writers. <br /> <br /> We gave him a second chance, thinking for sure that it would be better. No dice. Later, my boyfriend missed the rest of the film in case he improved, but the dice wouldn't work anyway. <br /> <br /> The main character had a cool bike. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to anyone except, maybe, really immature adolescents or boys.
