I've always been a big fan of Woody Allen and will always be for most of what he did in the past, but only a blind lover could ignore how boring, meaningless, pretentious and most badly was this film. Useless mental masturbation based on conflicting grounds. And what a terrible idea to artificially recreate the alleged “actor Allen-clone” who puts in Will Farrell’s mouth and shows what Allen would have done in Farrell’s place if he were 30 years younger. The result was obviously ridiculous. And not to mention the dialogues ... what was conceived as philosophical reflections turned into an involuntary mockery of intellectual reflections, not realizing its comic effect. How sad ...
