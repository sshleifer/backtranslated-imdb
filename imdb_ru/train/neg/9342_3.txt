Completing the release schedule of Our Gang of 1929-30, A Tough Winter has two storylines. First, Weather and Mary Ann, alone at home on a winter day, decided to make some eggs. Little Wheezer transmits Mary Ann's directions from a radio cooking show. The Problem: Wheezer transmits information from different shows, and Mary Ann ends up adding soap to the mix! Fun moments occur when the rest of the Gang appears to pull out the tuffy - and eventually get it all over the house! <br /> <br /> The second plot is about Stepin Fetchit, a neighbor / laborer from the Gang, and his interaction with the gang. <br /> <br /> “Tough Winter”, as far as I know, was never shown on television, although it is available on home video. The reason for this is the characteristic of Stepin Fetchita, which shows a running, sly and slow character. Our Gang producer Hal Roach called Fetchit a “skilful comic” and used this Our Gang recording as a pilot for the comedy series Fetchit, which had never seen the light. It is clear that the Fetchit feature today is offensive to many people, which explains why the film was postponed. <br /> <br /> Although there are some funny moments, both with Fetchit and with taffy, “A Tough Winter” is a tortuous and tortuous effort. If any positive came out of this film, it’s what Hal Roach studios have become more confident and more experienced in creating conversations. The sound in the film is good, and some of the sound effects used are very funny. For this reason, this film partially set the stage for the magnificent films "Our Gang" of 1930-31. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
