This must be one of the worst manifestations of vampires ever conceived by men. How can you turn such a fascinating subject into a completely boring story? Obviously, this is not such a difficult task ... First, an indispensable condition for any vampirfilm is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a pleasant sexual undertone, in which all these things are missing ... Too much light - spots! My God, why was it in the name of Christ / Judah? <br /> <br /> Every time Dracula appeared, he was absorbed by the light (in the script, to keep him weak, for the record: just weak) There was only one scene that was almost worth seeing to it, towards the end film (beautiful scene with Dracula and his new conquest). I really liked the first one, Judah’s turn was definitely original, but this one is simply not good, by no means. Hopefully, the third one will bring a vampire signature that I like so much in other classics such as Duke’s Nosferatu, Coppola’s Dracula or even Interview with the Vampire.
