The National Security Agency, the CIA, the FBI, the FSB and all other agencies investigating the events in the world should watch this film to get information about how to spy on people. (As stated in the MST3k comment ... "Sanat has dirt on everyone! Santa's tentacles reach everywhere! There is no disguise from the Klaus Organization") <br /> <br /> From telescopes that can spy millions of miles from ear to ear, who can hear everything. Surprisingly, the CIA does not have Santa on salary. <br /> <br /> Satanâ€™s dance routine is fun. Feeling ... he is so useless. <br /> <br /> The cheese factor in this film is huge. Very low budget, but so fun to watch. I recommend watching the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version for even more laughter. <br /> <br /> You will even laugh at the misfortune of good children. <br /> <br /> I give it 1 for production. quality and 10 for pure cheese and fun.
