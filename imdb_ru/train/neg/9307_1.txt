I made this film about a month ago, when I had nothing more to do on Friday night. All I can say to describe this useless movie is “TRASH”. The game is so bad that I saw children in high school doing a better job. The whole cast, it seems, just reads their lines, no feelings, no emotions. and no place to capture the viewer. On the other hand, the special effects were insanely stupid, and it all looked as if he was filmed using a camera that anyone can buy a radio toy. <br /> <br /> The clown himself does not look like the one on the cover. Gosh, he doesn't even appear in the film until the very end, and all he does is hum a song and play a few characters. Also, no real killings are shown, so this is not a real slasher movie. So as I saw him, I questioned a few things. 1. If this is the “Serial Killer of Insane Clowns”, is it not a serial killer that kills? clowns? 2. If your friend goes missing, why would you go into the woods to have sex and not look for her? Sad really. <br /> <br /> 3. Why is the only REAL actor vainly exhaled at the end? In the end, the actors decided to show effort in their work? This film is as sad as they are. My advice is not to rent it, so as not to waste an hour or two of your time on laughter, and not on screaming.
