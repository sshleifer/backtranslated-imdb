Tatie Daniel talks about a terrible old witch who, out of sheer anger, torments her loving and forgetful family. There is some subtext that may be about the colonial past of France, but basically it’s just Daniel, doing something like (for example, deliberately leaving a small child in the park), which will soon force a person to raise his teeth with broken fingers. Unfortunately, this is not happening here. It looks good, and the game is good, and there's nothing wrong with the concept, but it's just SO. God, this movie loves itself. It is a pity that it is not as clever or funny as it seems. The only impulse in the series - I'm sorry, the film - comes from the fact that Daniella is becoming more disgusting and unpleasant, and the only surprise - from the incredibly incredible ways she does it. That's right: in the same way as in the comedy series, which is, with an additional “bonus” of delusions of grandeur and a duration of 110 minutes.
