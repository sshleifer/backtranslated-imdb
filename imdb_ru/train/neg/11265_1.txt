There were some low moments in my life when I was confused and depressed. One of them was sitting in Rancid Aluminum. <br /> <br /> There were warning signs. Without the premiere (even the stars did not want to be present) and without reviews in magazines. The only reason I sat in the film was in the hope that I could get some sleep. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the film was explained. The story was stupid. Once I was delighted when the film was shot, and then, to my growing despair, it turned out that it had not really been shot, and this did not weaken my joy. I sincerely hope that all participants in the film were hanged for this atrocity. <br /> <br /> There were some positive moments, mostly unintentional moments of humor. For example, a scene in which the protagonist for some unknown reason feels the need to manually free himself in the toilet stall, while the person talking in the next stall puts fingers in his ears. <br /> <br /> My words cannot explain the anger I feel, so I will conclude. <br /> <br /> Rancid Aluminum: only for sadists, unrest and regressive artists who want to torture themselves.
