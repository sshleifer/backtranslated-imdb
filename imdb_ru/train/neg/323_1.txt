This film was so bad that I could not be reconciled without doing anything else. There was no plot, no meaning. I was very bored and I could not remember a single joke or a funny line worthy of description. Politicians without charisma, speaking in technical jargon, could not be less interesting. <br /> <br /> So how was this done? Is there no quality control in the movie? Watching bikini girls was the only distraction during this terrible experience. <br /> <br /> Itâ€™s hard to imagine that Adam Sandler, who became popular and appeared in great comedies, could survive such an impact. He was not at all funny in this film, so it proves that the script is so important for an effective comedy.
