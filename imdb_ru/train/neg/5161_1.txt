My life is about saving animals. I volunteer with a cat rescue organization. I am a vegetarian because I could not kill an animal even to maintain my life. I can not even kill the spider, I put it on the street. The scene where children throw stones at a bird until it dies, with Soneraâ€™s participation in trying to be adopted by other children, makes me sick and has been haunting me ever since. It just convinces me that people are pitiful about their need for adoption. The ending - adoptive parents adopt Early - does not redeem the image of cruelty to animals. Why does anyone want their child to see this movie?
