Soft spoilers are contained here. I spoil this movie to save you from having to watch it. <br /> <br /> The films of Jet Li fall into one of two categories: films of the Shaolin period and films originating in modern Hong Kong that revolve around the Triads or organizations like the Triad. Each genre has its best and worst films. "Twin Warriors" - the best film of Shaolin era Jet Li, and "Evil Cult" - its worst. “Fist of Legend” while in the recent past the best film of the “modern era” Jet Li. The black mask is undoubtedly the worst. <br /> <br /> Jet Li plays a mercenary who is driven out, who received an injection that gives him superhuman abilities, but shortens his lifespan. In his "new life" in exile, he plays a pacifist librarian. When his old squad of mercenaries becomes furious, Jet Li becomes a vigil who decides to stop them. He puts on a very stupid corrugated cardboard mask to hide his identity from the police (and the public) as a librarian, as well as hide his true identity with his former comrades in arms. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was duplicated, and terribly at that. Why does Jet Li capture and hold his library employee hostage if he is a pacifist? Is there a love story between them? Why does the police chief care when he finds out about the true identity of the Black Mask? The plot is just bad. Bad because of the feeling of a superhero, bad in the sense that the characters never develop properly, badly in his interactions with the characters, and all this ends with a semi-explained story in which I quickly lost interest. <br /> <br /> The action and sequences of martial arts are excessive. In the film there is a lot of blood, blood (an abundance of severed body parts), explosions and superhuman martial arts in the style of the Matrix. Unfortunately, this is the best movie and the only selling point. If you want to see how Jet Lee plays a superhero vigilance in the film in the style of "Mission Impossible" "Black Mask". For the rest of us, Jet Li fans are a real disappointment. This is one of those films where Jet Li never becomes Jet Li: he has no chance to charm us with his charisma, no chance to hit us with his impressive but realistic martial arts skills. <br /> <br /> Usually, Ozzy Osbourne’s Chinese fake would be enough to captivate me into the film, unfortunately, “Black Mask” was an exception to this rule. Indeed, the antagonist of this film, by the way he dresses, his long straight hair and signature round sunglasses look like a modern and aged Ozzy Osborne. However, the villain does not appear on the screen long enough to justify the trick. I guess the resemblance to Ozzy was intentional; in addition to seeing the villain, he also ran a satanic hideout. Much more could be done from Ozzy Osbourne's trick! If only a writer, director or ANY bothered to give the background and develop the character of the main villain of the film! <br /> <br /> “Black Mask” was the first film of Jet Li, released on video in the United States. after the Deadly Weapons 4, and I am glad that I stayed away from him until now. Perhaps it completely destroyed my perception of Jet Li as a martial artist and actor. If you want to see Jet Lee in his worst form, rent the Black Mask and the Evil Cult and make a double feature or horror of them, both intentional and unintentional. Otherwise, stick to movements that use Jet Lee talents and have plots that are well thought out and believable. 3/9 stars.
