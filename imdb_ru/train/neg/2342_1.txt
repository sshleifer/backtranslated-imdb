I don't know what would be so great in this movie. Even worse, why should anyone bother to see this? First of all, there is no history. It can be said that even without a story, the film is worth seeing, because it evokes some kind of strong feeling (laughter, crying, fear, ...), but, in my opinion, this film also does not. <br /> <br /> You just watch the images for +/- 2 hours. There are other useful things. <br /> <br /> I think you could say that the film is an experiment, and it is audacious, because it lacks all of the above. But is it worth 2 hours of your precious time and 7 euros of your money? For me, the answer is no.
