This is a pretty bad movie. The plot is a sentimental mess. I assume that production values ​​are in order, worthy photography, unobtrusive guidance and all that. Mark Hamill was terrible. I never cared about him, and this film confirms this perception. Unsurprisingly, he never had any career other than his Star Wars films. I'll just say “bye Mark,” when he plunges into deserved obscurity. On the other hand, the very young Annie Potts completely stole the show. She showed charm, beauty and acting chops in one performance. I remember seeing her at Texasville recently and celebrating her beauty. It is interesting to see her ten years earlier. In any case, if you are not interested in Miss Potts, run away from this film screaming about the hills.
