Prom night: the most important night for any small girl, consisting almost entirely of plastic. And so the characters kept reminding us every ten minutes, when some kind of dizzying tiny event occurred in their tiny lives. <br /> <br /> In fact, the prom cannot be an excuse. This is nothing special, and I would really give him zero or less stars if it were possible on IMDb. The only part of my viewing that I liked was that a group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play “ghosts”. It was much more exciting than what was happening on the screen in front of them. <br /> <br /> The plot was basically some guy who went wild. And the fact is that it wasn’t even a little exhilarating tumult Perhaps if the guy was a little scary, and not a tame Robbie Williams, like a baseball cap, I would sit there with a little anxiety. The fact that I cared less about the characters than about the color of the carpet in the movies didn’t really add to the effect either. Worse, the rest of the characters were equally one-dimensional and forgetful. The hotel staff did not seem to notice or care that one of their maids disappeared, and is further evidence that the killer is not recognizable after shaving. I was incredibly surprised that the bitchy, stereotypical girl in the blue dress was the only person who noticed who he was. She realizes this and then falls down the stairs, gets tangled in a plastic sheet, and then knocks over a bunch of paint buckets. Good. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, I believe that the director is trying his best. He really pushed all the boundaries, not showing any murder in fact. Outrageous! And the music, don't even turn me on. It was almost as appropriate as undressing at a funeral. <br /> <br /> I really want the prom to be a joke. It was awful and stupidly predictable. No one, sane or not, has no reason to watch this movie. Mainstream cinema seems to be on the rise, and such films worsen the situation. If you want to watch this horrible movie, hear my request. Do not do that. There are better things for which you can spend six pounds. Like a leaf to play with ghosts.
