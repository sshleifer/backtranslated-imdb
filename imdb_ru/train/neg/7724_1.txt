After seeing all the negative reviews about this film, I realized that it could be another comic masterpiece that should not have been completely. I watched the first two scenes of the fight, listening to the general dialogue that Lungren and all the other enthusiastic actors uttered terribly, and found the film so terrible that it was funny. Then Brandon Lee enters the story, and the storylines begin to fly, the plot falls apart, the writers begin to drink, and the film wears out, and this is welcomed as it turns into the worst action movie of them all. <br /> <br /> For this special honor, Lungren defeats his previous efforts in The Punisher and others, as well as in all the films of Van Damme, Seagal and non-Rocky films of Stallone. This film has absolutely the worst part (look at Tia Carrere’s face when she’s in any scene with Dolph, it’s good to laugh), with the worst dialogue ever (Brandon Lee’s comment on little Dolph is the worst line in the film) and the worst outfit in the film (Dolph in full Japanese clothes). The film “Tango and Cash” with the worst acting game, acquaintance with “Commandos”, meeting with “Friday the 13th” (due to senseless nudity and Lungren’s performance is very similar to Jason Vurhisa), a joke and a fifteen-minute joke. br /> <br /> Good (how about not horrible) performances go to the bad guy (who still looks shut during his entire performance) and Carrere (who somehow pronounces her 5 lines without laughing). Brandon Leigh is Lungren's bosom buddy and does a really awful job in him. <br /> <br /> A horrible, terrible movie. Fear it and avoid it. If you watch it, ask yourself why underwater shots are twice as good as most non-underwater shots. Speaking of underwater shots, look at the water fight scene with the worst final in the world. This film has all the versions of a bad battle scene for those who have short attention spans and that they fill outbreaks of nudity. <br /> <br /> BAD BAD FILM !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
