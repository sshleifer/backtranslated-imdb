It’s almost as tiring to watch, like reading, “Evening” is a terrible failure ... until Meryl Streep enters and quietly shows her other actors how to behave in this way. Vanessa Redgrave is shocked by her role of dying Ann, and Claire Danes - with a cipher. Perhaps, if Vanessa and Claire had switched roles, we could see the vibrations of young Ann, who gave her an idea of ​​the tattered world of history, and we could imagine that the eldest Ann was really dying. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that adding Michael Cunningham to writing titles would smooth the bustling narrative, but alas. It gave me a headache.
