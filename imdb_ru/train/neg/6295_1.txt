Suffice to say that - despite the strange, ridiculous panegyric of his “abilities” published here, the director of this inept, disgusting game has not made a film since. Well, this is good news for me. <br /> <br /> “Dead Babies” has everything you need to create, but there is a lack of intelligence and technical skills that make Martin Amis a writer-reader. <Br /> <br /> When the British film industry wakes up and realizes that if she wants to regain the status that she once had, she should stop producing garbage like this and do something that they really want watch real people? <br /> Avoid like the plague.
