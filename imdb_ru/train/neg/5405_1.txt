I got it like a turkey movie and I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> In general, despite the fact that many were shot in other films, it is clear that they had to work hard to behave so badly during all of this film, in which a certain degree does not slip by chance actions. <br /> <br /> The plot - being generous, I can say that the screenwriter initially started with the plot, but tried not to pay attention to him. the plot collapsed faster than the Chinese computer shot down <br /> <br /> Scrip - now it was an abomination of nature. it could not flow with any rhyme or cause. most of the character lines were, at best, pathetic for lack of talent. The script worked hard to make sure that no character was remembered. I watched other movies where the add-ons were more interesting and memorable. <br /> <br /> Special effects - ROTFLMAO !!!!! They were special short buses <br /> <br /> Guides - until you can come up with your own directing ability, copy the style of your favorite director, otherwise you will only make such mistakes. <br /> <br /> It's nice to know that your friends / family gave you 10 stars for this movie.
