Final score: 0 (out of 10). <br /> <br /> *** Possible subject spoilers (but who cares) *** <br /> <br /> Yes, that's right: zero. And I rarely give 1. Even for the loudest films, I look for things like music, cinematography, imagination, humor, and even a good pace to be as objective as possible with respect to the score. Looking at it within your own kind or subgenera. But there is absolutely nothing atoning here. I don't remember another time the movie actually made me walk around the room when it was all over. The only reason I got to the end was because I could not change the channel — I just sat in horror and looked to see what an offensively stupid step he would come next time. It was like a snake digesting a rat. <br /> <br /> But let's have some fun and reveal this baby, okay? First of all, there is nothing technical in Whipped that works. Visual effects are made in the sitcom style. Cut-off scenes are all just pictures of the traffic going on at night again and again. Music and musical score not only contribute nothing to the film - it is unpleasant. Not to mention the fact that there is nothing that could help. The actor's game is just as cardboard as everything else, and this also applies to Amanda Pete (obviously the “star” who received this train wreck with a green light). These guys, supposedly good friends, have no more chemistry or a sense of purpose than if director Peter M. Cohen gathered them at the bus stop a few minutes before filming. <br /> <br /> On the creative side, there is no original bone in his body. He has no imagination. This does not show us anything that we have not seen a thousand times before. The whole premise of this film is based on the beating of men and the "idea" that empowered women can play men "just as they are played." Anyone who thinks that this is somehow unusual or in any way original is obviously never turned on the TV before. Twisted, shallow women are common. Male beating is the norm. It is not stealing from something specifically, it is worse: it is theft from clichés. I cannot imagine women filming a film that depicts other women based on stereotypes and with such a sense of contempt. Makes me want to rent "In the company of men" - or, better yet, "There is something in Mary." This film wants to be a "sharper" version. "There is something in Mary," so bad you can see the sweat. <br /> <br /> In the film, there are no women, no men, no dating, no sex, or anything else. Cohen is simply content to spell the myths he has been inspired from other sexist films. On the other hand, the film also does not work as a satire, because, although it is full of exaggerations, it can be considered as “satirical,” but in reality it does not have the basis that satire needs. He doesn't even know what makes it fun. Then there is a dialogue that is a little more than characters screaming obscenities at each other. Example: Character 1: “F ** k you” Character 2: “Oh, yes, good f ** k you” (repeat) <br /> <br /> And at the end, something that can justify all the others Discretion: there are a lot of movies without plots, without a good game, with morally repulsive characters and obscene dialogue, which were fun and, therefore, good. "Whipped" is not funny. Not for a second. He has no comic skills or time. The situations are completely false, not based on a shred of truth, especially enough to snatch laughter from us. All the characters are in general terms drawn, so they LOOK at the corresponding minimum of the lowest common denominator. Just look at the "tent scene", "cult classics", the scene with hair gel. One of our awkward antiheroes opens the first-aid kit and sees Mena's vibrator (Pete). For some reason, the light falls on him as if he had found the holy grail. Why Cohen believes that men react to vibrators like that, I don't know. Rubbing him at himself, he throws him into the toilet, and then tries to catch him with his bare hands, when, oh God, Mena comes to him. Oh my sides. <br /> <br /> But oddly enough, people really like this movie. Of course, people also like Friends and reality shows, so I shouldn't be surprised. However, all this has a common thread. "Whipped" is for me a great proof that in America there are a huge number of people who will laugh at any joke just because it concerns sex. They will love any show or movie (or they think they like it) just because it’s about dating or relationships. This lack of any quality has nothing to do with these people. Just as people want white teeth and thinner bodies to sell toothbrushes and weight loss programs, they also instill that they are silently silent about everything related to their acquaintances and relationships in order to sell them cheap, empty, light TV, movies and any number of products. <br /> <br /> The only consolation is that when I die, because I watched this film, I have a loan to get 80 minutes back of my life. <br /> <br />
