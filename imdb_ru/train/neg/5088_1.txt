This guy has no cinema idea. Well, it seems that he did some interesting theater shows in his youth and about two acceptable films that were successful for political reasons because they deceived the communist censorship. This is all very good, but look carefully: He DOESN'T KNOW HIS WORK! The scenes are unbalanced, without a proper start and, with disordered content and full of emptiness. He has nothing to say on this issue, so he overly licks with the help of violence, nudity and profanity. How can you keep such a rotten corpse alive that has never understood anything from the cinematic profession and art? Why don't they let him die?
