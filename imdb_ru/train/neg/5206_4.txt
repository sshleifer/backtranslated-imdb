Adapting plays to movies is often a bad idea, because they are two different environments. Do you think it's a great idea to make a ZULU play? Imagine where the two valiant red cloaks are sitting in a tent, panting, "Blymi, there are thousands of them." An excellent film and a bad performance <br /> <br /> In order for a stage performance to turn into a magnificent cinema, two things are needed <br /> 1) A wonderful cast that creates chemistry on the screen. <br /> <br /> 2) Excellent dialogue. <br /> <br /> On paper, Sher and Chazz Palminterri would be a good choice, but not in these roles. The story revolves around an assassin who Palminterri bursts into the house to kill the wife played by Cher, with most of the actions taking place in the house. I could not take these two characters seriously, although perhaps it was a script error that could not decide whether he was trying to be serious or ridiculous. Since the story is very static, it is imperative that the dialogue shines, and again because of the bizarre tone of the script, it embarrasses most of all, since most of the conversations revolve around sexual intercourse. If you want to see a great translation of a stage play transferred to a silver screen, let FAITHFUL skip and watch 12 ANGRY MEN instead.
