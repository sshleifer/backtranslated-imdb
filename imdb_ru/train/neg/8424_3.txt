This film can be judged from three points of view: as a story, as Amin’s profile, as a fictional thriller. <br /> <br /> As a story, it fails, mentions a coup d'état, which resulted in the expulsion of Obote, the expulsion of Asians, and has high-Entebbe as a background, but not in any chronologically agreed time frame . <br /> <br /> As Amin's profile, it could be interesting, because Forest Whitaker is incredibly good, and if it was the best film, he would get an Oscar. (He got it - this proves that Oscar voters do not watch the films for which they vote.) He ignores relevant historical episodes in the novel, in which Amin and Uganda’s history were viewed from a doctor’s point of view. Instead, he talks about the fictitious story of the Scots doctor and his impossible love life from the point of view of Amin. But the story told is the only case in which Amin was probably innocent. <br /> <br /> As a fictional thriller, there is no conspiracy to keep it together. Getting tight - it takes cinematic freedoms with a novel, but sets up a story. The character of the doctor is clearly defined, but he is lost in the second half of the film, with the result that suffers. <br /> <br /> Why does the doctor decide to stay in Kampala, poorly explained - seduced by force? Why he is not friendly with anyone is strange. The character of a friend in the novel was lost, because the Scotsman, instead of the black doctor, the novel is a ridiculous entanglement, which does not seem even a bit believable, but allows the filmmakers to show Amin's ferocity at hand. <br /> <br /> Finally, in 1971, Uganda went left, not right, the license plates were three letters and two or three numbers — and where are the fangs of the equator ?! <br /> <br /> In short, if you’ve never heard of Amina, you might want to spend two hours watching this movie to appreciate Forest Whitaker, but the last hour will bring you confusion. If you know Uganda or read a book - do not watch the movie - it will only depress you. And if you want to know why the doctor was so reckless - he was not.
