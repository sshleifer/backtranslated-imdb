One of those documentaries "Thank God, I do not live." This tells of the two warring factions in Colombia, the partisans and paramilitary groups, as well as the surrounding peoples of Medellin. <br /> <br /> Weapons, drugs and death are rampant. Guys, not older than 22 years old, not participating in the war, are in prison. Girls ?? not women girls ?? always react the same when one of them is killed, with tears and a cry. You scratch your head; what did they expect, right? I don’t know what’s more disturbing: night skirmishes and civil unrest, or that everyone seems to just passively accept things as they are. Or, seeing that this boy is drinking something that is clearly not his first beer, being all than 10? If you took these young people out of their position and put them in some place where they had the opportunity to do more, be more, how many of them would prefer not to stay? <br /> <br /> Based on this documentary, everything, I'm afraid.
