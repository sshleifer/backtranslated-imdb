Here's a movie with a good cast and a good looking location, but it just doesn't have it. Director Richard Brooks must be a little tired at this stage of the game; How much better were his PROFESSIONALS! The horses and the rest of the action seemed to be in slow motion even during scenes without slow motion. This film needed to be speeded up, if anything. This foam for horses looked awfully fake for me and the obvious tire tracks in those moments of tracking the desert were just lazy. sloppy work. Very bad. The actors are fine, but I definitely saw how they all play better. Ben Johnson is always happy though. I first saw this film almost 30 years ago; I was disappointed then and remained so after the second viewing 30 years later.
