The plot certainly seemed quite interesting. How to turn a real brutal murder into a really boring movie? Well, you can watch “Wonderland” and find out. <br /> <br /> I heard about the killings in Wonderland before the release of this film and found that it is an interesting true story of some really sadistic people. Unfortunately, character development is zero, so we never had the opportunity to understand why all this was done, or to get a good idea of ​​the relationships between the characters. The pace of direction was very tedious. All this leads to an unusually boring film. <br /> <br /> Given that Dawn Schiller, the central character of Holmes's girlfriend, was an assistant producer and Holmes's wife was a film consultant, we should have had the opportunity to get a real idea of ​​the characters.
