The shame that even a talented director, Desplekhin, could not collect a decent performance from the insanely talented actress Phoenix, Esther Kahn lacks content to convey a very succinct and clear plot. In an attempt to perform the concentric circle of the actor’s distress, the performance and the performance are too far-fetched and poorly executed to evoke any compassion from the viewer. For too long, the redundancy of Esther's struggle is too melodramatic to be effective, and reduces the storyline to the fragile structure of a disastrous show. The content is incoherent and free, as Phoenix struggles to follow Despleschin’s instructions, just as Esther allegedly tries to do the same. Without ever feeling a convincing victory over the pain of Esther, we never feel victory in the talent of Phoenix.
