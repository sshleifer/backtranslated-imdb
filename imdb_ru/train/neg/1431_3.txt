!!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILER !!!!! <br /> <br /> One might think that in the story of Archie Grey Sow, an Englishman posing as a red turkey, there would be a huge amount of humor involved. In fact, I would say that the only way to relate to such a film, where a wonderful person confronts a gullible public, is to treat it as a comedy. However, Richard Attenborough does something similar to a crime, turning GRAY OWLS into serious drama. Worse, he also made an extremely horrible movie. Pierce Brosnan lacks the charisma necessary for the main role, and in the romantic plot between Gray Owl and Pony (who plays the same wooden Annie Gopo) there is not enough chemistry on the screen. But honestly, the actors did not help with the script, which does not portray Archie as a daring guy, whom he cheats, forcing everyone to believe that he is Native American. The producers and screenwriter made a major mistake because Archie is an Englishman. That is why I wrote “Possible Spoiler”, until the very end of the film it was not clear that the title character was In English, but it is obvious that everyone who watched this movie knew that in advance, therefore, there is nothing surprising. <br /> <br /> Yes, I agree with everyone that the landscape is beautiful and deep. environmental communication, which is not really a new concept. Theodore Roosevelt was the first important environmentalist of the 20th century, to tell the truth. And it should also be remembered that, with the exception of SOYLENT GREEN (and possibly the TWO TOWER, if you want to classify it as a green message), there really wasn't a good environmental film. In fact, most environmentally friendly films are crap, including GRAY OWL, a film that, unsurprisingly, had serious problems finding a distributor.
