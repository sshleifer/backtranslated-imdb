Here is what happened: <br /> <br /> 1) The head of BBC3 must create programs targeted at an audience other than BBC1 and BBC2 in order to keep the license and work. <br /> <br /> 2) Lenny Henry offers his unfunny friends. <br /> <br /> 3) The BBC3 head picks them up, completely ignoring the fact that they are not funny. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, itâ€™s probably a racist, like all characters play up to bad stereotypes. If a white man did things like that, it would make a noise! <br /> <br /> Garbage.
