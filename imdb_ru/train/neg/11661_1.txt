In fact, it is too long, unfunny, an action / comedy. First of all, I would like to say that I really liked the movie Scary Movie from Wyan's brother (1), and the sequel had moments. Unfortunately, white chicks do not even laugh. <br /> <br /> The humor in it is completely raw. If you like burps, farting, silly phrases, you should probably take a look at this. When it is not rude, it is idiocy. The first 10 minutes of the movie gave me everything, quite unfunny, just idiotic. <br /> <br /> However, I have watched it all since I was with a friend (otherwise I would not worry). The story is undoubtedly thin, it was also in a scary movie, but at least there was a quick and constant laugh. I think that this is probably one of the main problems in this film, to laugh not fast enough. Some jokes drag on too long, when they are more disgusting than funny. If you prefer comedy with several brain cells, just avoid it. If you need a stupid comedy with a lot of laughter, then watch a scary movie, a plane, hot shots 1 + 2. <br /> <br /> 1/10 Completely unfunny, Thin plot, Film based on one idea (i.e. what , if we dressed like white chicks for a movie?) but just didnâ€™t have enough material.
