Cheap exploitation of the film about the mother to find her daughter, who was abducted by people who make smelling pornographic films. The trail leads the mother across Europe as she seeks her child, and we in the audience struggle to sleep. <br /> <br /> This is one of countless soft-core films made for people who want the excitement of porn with off-stigma or the danger of showing it on their credit card bill. Personally, I would prefer to have a stigma, since these films have a tendency be more interesting and honest about what we see. This is a sexy thriller, but it is not. Most of his people talk about things, accompanied by a large number of walks from place to place and leading to leadership. Periodically, during the film, various people undress, and everything has more than a S & M touch on the proceedings. Material about violence and fetishes, as it were, provokes laughter, not horror or even excitement, all this is incredibly false. Worse, even nudity is not enough to keep it interesting. (This is mainly a course for many of these films.) <br /> <br /> You will forgive me for the lack of detail, but this is just a boring boring film, with which I remained until the end, hoping that something remotely sensible would happen, but nothing happened. The most interesting thing was a blonde country girl with a huge bite and a nose the size of a Buick. I looked at her with painful charm, wondering how she looked like a young girl, and wondered if she had a plastic surgery, and not something to think about in an exciting thriller. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
