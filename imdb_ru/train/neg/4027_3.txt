It should be one of the most overrated Spanish films in history. The lack of subtlety and complexity, as well as a complete political correction make it truly childish, with good / bad characters. The world is simply not the same, and good films show complex characters with opposing impulses, dilemmas, etc. However, what I hate most about this film is the father of Bolâ€™s friend. The director is trying to teach us a good lesson: tattooers with shaved heads are not always bad guys, in fact they can be better than a middle-aged dad (wow, it's like ... philosophy or something like that). Thank you, Achero. I will offer you the Nobel Prize in literature.
