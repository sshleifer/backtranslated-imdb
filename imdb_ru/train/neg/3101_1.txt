This excerpt from the 1984 hit Gremlins is arguably the biggest train wreck ever made. Even for a class B film, all other cheap horror films on the same platform completely eclipse this film in terms of plot, action, and virtue. <br /> <br /> He starts with a random old guard and a junior punk guard whose name doesn't matter. What for? Because after a few minutes of the film, he enters the "forbidden" safe and is killed when he lives his fantasy of being a rock star in a cheap pub. <br /> <br /> This is just a stingray snack. Main course The main character, KEVIN, fights at different times in order to show himself as something more than a complete pussy. Perhaps he succeeds in the film, but he proves to the audience that he is just a bad actor. Kevin gets a job with an old security guard and is guided by a change of security at (wait) abandoned studio. Yes, why make a set if you can just use the studio itself. Back to the movie. Kevin somehow opens the forbidden safe and releases hobgoblinov. Hobgoblins force people to embody their wildest fantasies, and then kill them for some reason. Should they be returned before sunrise or something else ... or what? For sure. <br /> <br /> Other characters include Kevin’s “macho” Nick’s army friend, Daphne Nick’s “woman”, who has a character no more meaningful than a bitch whore and worthy outfits of a prostitute. There is a manipulative and “secretive” girlfriend of Kevin Amy, whose deepest desire is, apparently, to be a poorly pictured girlfriend, Cher, with fishnet stockings and a pair of blue grandmothers at the top. Do not ask me how it works. Quite possibly, the most interesting character of all is KYLE. How such groups of friends are created is questionable. Kyle - a perverted creep that can not pass an hour without self-stimulation. His hobbies include calls to sex chats from other people's homes and most likely sniffing underwear. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds when heroes search for hobgoblins: knee-beings (puppets) who, for some reason, attempt to travel no further than the borders of the local neighborhood. Each of the characters ultimately embodies their wildest imagination, which never has anything to do with millions of dollars ... or a film that has a big budget. <br /> <br /> WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD: the turn at the end of this film will make the viewer think: “What?”. Hobgoblins return to the safe of their own ... Perhaps they lost patience while waiting for dawn to cause damage, or perhaps the authors of the stories got the writer's convulsions and decided not to worry about the ending. Returning to the safe, the old guard reveals “What he learned in the army” and explodes explosives that destroy the safe, signaling the end of the evil hobgoblin and the end of this rollercoaster ride; better suited for riding an escalator. <br /> <br /> One of the worst reasons for this movie is that someone might cry. If you plan to watch it, I recommend to drink a few alcoholic drinks in advance in order to seriously think about the film.
