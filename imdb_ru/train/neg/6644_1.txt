Yes, this is it! ... No, not because Pingtili likes to undress her actors and publicly reveal their secrets. Pinty is the naked "emperor" - so to speak ... <br /> <br /> It is time to declare the truth. This impostor is a voyeur, a child trapped in an old man's body. Its abundance of naked scenes in general has no artistic legitimacy. This is a 100% visual perversion: he gets his blows, forcing the actors to undress and look at their will. And if he does it in front of an audience, he can get a job! Did you know that on the set of “Niki Hardelin” he confused poor Kok Blossom, telling her: “O Kok, how I want to kill you!”? She is an excellent lady, very decent and sensitive, and she became inexpressibly ashamed - to his petty satisfaction! And, as the alarm signal about the degree of vulgarity and lack of education of the Romanian audience, so many people are still so stupid as to declare these visual obscenities "works of art"! Does anyone have the decency to expose the truth of all this?
