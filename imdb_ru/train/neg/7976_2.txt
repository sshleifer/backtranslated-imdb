You believe in God or not. You believe in Jesus or not. You believe that He is the Son of God, or not. The choice is yours. <br /> <br /> Director Denis Arkanda really did his best to return Jesus to a simple historical figure, a social worker, the son of two people instead of the Son of God, the Holy Spirit and Mary, who again opened heaven to us. By encouraging the Big Bang, the world comes from evolution, and does not see the beauty of creation. The film depicts a theologian bringing some “modern finds” to the actor who plays Jesus in the play “The Passion”, who happily incorporates them into his play. <br /> <br /> The depicted priest administering the sanctuary where the Passion takes place A performance in Montreal has a sexual relationship with one of the women playing the Passion play, instead of showing their love for God through celibacy. Most often, the director’s aversion to the Church is clearly visible. <br /> <br /> The director tried to draw a parallel between the life of Jesus and the life of the actor Passion for the Play. This is a wonderful attempt, but the image of the Resurrection with the transplantation of the organs of the actor from the Passion Play in other bodies shows how the director thinks about Jesus. <br /> <br /> My opinion is not important, the opinion of God, but I would not like to stand in the place of the director and actors, standing before the throne of Jesus.
