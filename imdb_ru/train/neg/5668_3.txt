Firstly, in this film, absolutely not flirting with Anthony or anyone else. These people don't flirt - they just do it. Your first endurance test is to complete more than 15 minutes of intense violence and sexual perversion. It would not be so bad - damn, I love violence and perversion just like the next reviewer, but without context to put it in, it repels. So you do it through torture and lawlessness. Then we meet with Donna, and the film turns into something completely different - not better - just different: a road picture without a heart. There are inconclusive comedy attempts thanks to cameos â€” widely written and widely played TV shows such as Judy Tenuta and Mink Stole (as well as several prostitutes and transvestites). They all deserve the best. Photography is deliberately disorienting, so if you get a motion sickness (or really ANY kind of illness), this film is not for you. If you think about it, I'm not sure who this film is for, except maybe gay and bisexual S & M fans who like poorly written scripts, poorly made indie films about themselves.
