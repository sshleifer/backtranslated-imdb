Cliff Robertson, as an intriguing husband, married to a rich wife, demonstrates a worthy performance, if any; as if director Michael Anderson kept shouting “type this, think zombies are only less alive” through his little mouthpiece when he trained Robertson's efforts. The rest of the cast is barely better; Jennifer Agutter from fame LOGAN'S RUN is hardly visible in what was to become the main role. If the quality of the game was three times better; if some of the more gaping holes in the plot were filled; and if adrenaline was given for stimulation, this onlooker could be brought up to the standard acceptable to the crowd of the Hallmark \ Lifetime TV channel. Thus, his rating is so inexplicably high that it is impossible not to think that chronic insomnia uses DOMINIQUE to take a nap. Perhaps the nightly television telemarketers are missing out on a great opportunity not shilling per se.
