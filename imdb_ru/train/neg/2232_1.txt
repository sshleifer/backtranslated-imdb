I watched it ... let me rephrase ... survived it because I am an Eva fan. I don't think this is the click she puts on the back of her photo. I like Gangsta Flix, but it wasn’t even close. The budget could not amount to more than a few hundred dollars, and this money was probably spent on provisions. <br /> <br /> The room was interesting, but the first victim died before you got the opportunity to take care of it or not. <br /> <br /> I will not say who did what and how, because it is not worth the effort. I'm just glad that because of my monthly rental plan at a local video store, I didn’t actually have to pay for this garbage. <br /> <br /> OH !! Before you hit me, I love movies, I thought it was good that some of you were stuck, so for me this spell tells you all you need to know.
