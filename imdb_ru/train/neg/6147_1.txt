I really don't get all the flattery that this film got. This is disgusting, unnecessarily manipulating and evading many important issues - for example, from Nash's affairs and his penchant for sex with men in public places. This, I believe, is quite tolerable in the context of a commercial Hollywood film, but with all the praise for the work of Russell Crowe? It seems that a person is just fussing, squeezing his briefcase and putting on a rough hat, and does this somehow qualify as a good game? Anyone who has ever known a person with mental health problems will realize that Crow doesnâ€™t have so many cartoons. It's also pretty annoying. And, I dare say, just on the right side to be really awful
