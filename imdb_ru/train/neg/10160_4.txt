A typical flick of Lanza, which had a limited audience appeal with a weak storyline, which was collected simply to justify Lanzi's contract with MGM at the time. <br /> <br /> As a Lastliberal contributor (above) reported, Grayson could not tolerate Lanz because of his indecent advances to her from (and sometimes from) the camera. In addition, his obscene demeanor and the constant smell of alcohol on her face during the scenes they did together were unbearable. After they shot the second (and last) New Orleans Toast, the usually quiet Grayson burst into the office of Louis B. Meyer and unequivocally told him that she would never work with Lanza again ?? period. Meyer felt that Grayson was much more valuable to MGM than Lanza, so Grayson’s statement was stuck. Grayson starred in a number of widespread (and much more lucrative) musicals with Howard Kiel and others. Later in life, when he was asked to compare Lanzu and Kiel, she replied that there was no comparison between them and it was great to work with Keel, and he was much more attractive to “real people” in the audience.
