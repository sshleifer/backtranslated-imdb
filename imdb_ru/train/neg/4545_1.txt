This delightful fusion of New Age chatter and terribly bad filmmaking may not “open up” you to borrow one of the film’s favorite verbs, but may lead to weakening of the jaw and stomach pain from laughter or vomiting. Based on James Redfield's bestseller, first published in 1993, this cornucopia kitsch tracks the spiritual awakening of the American history teacher (Matthew Settle), who, traveling to the deepest, darkest, most basic Peru and sniffing the air or something even more illegal . Namely, what he found is the Shangri-la castle, inhabited by smiling zombies, who may be crazy or simply cured, perhaps because they are often accompanied by a sandpiper and an occasional cry from the celestial choir. Although there is a lot of talk about “energy”, this quality is clearly absent in the motley cast, including Thomas Kretschmann, Annabeth Gisch, Hector Elizondo and Jürgen Prochnou, who are now firmly rooted in the camp pantheon. For those who do not care, the plot involves the military, terrorists and the Roman Catholic Church; Armand Mastroianni provided mismanagement, while Mr. Redfield, Barnet Bane and Dan Gordon wrote the script horn. In short, easily the worst movie in more than 40 years of watching movies.
