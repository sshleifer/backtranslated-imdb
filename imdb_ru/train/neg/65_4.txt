I’m not really getting the “Amati Girls” rating, and I think that I REALLY graciously gave her 4 out of 10. What would otherwise be a wonderful story, with a set of more or less decent actors, became a complete farce in my eyes. There are so many clichés in this film, women's hair is just awful, and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or seem fake. There is no real passion in this film, but a bunch of actors outplay all the boundaries. It's not funny enough to be a comedy, too fake-sad to really touch, so in my opinion this is simply not good. Watching this, I could not believe how something like this reached my television in my living room in Switzerland. But .. maybe it was still good, and it just got lost in translation? Who knows. Definitely one of the strangest films I've ever seen, and that is certainly not in a good way! Sorry.
