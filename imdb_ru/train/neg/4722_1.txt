Do not watch this Serbian documentary, but Serbian propaganda is looking for this documentary, and you will see the facts and the truth. http://imdb.com/title/tt0283181/ <br /> <br /> The series of the documentary series “Death of Yugoslavia” five episodes) is a carefully compiled and researched report on the ongoing mass bloodshed that marked the end of the old federal Yugoslavia and covered almost the entire first half of the 1990s. It includes a huge amount of news stories and interviews with stakeholders, both Yugoslav and others. The only real “improvement” that could be made to this amazing achievement is the inclusion of later events in the Balkans since the inception of the program. This was indeed done in the late 1990s for a BBC television rerun, but adding some even more recent events will help complete this remarkable detailed and cumbersome work. Perhaps another whole episode can be justified? The very laconic title of this documentary became even more appropriate as a result of the final rejection of the term “Yugoslavia” by the now-named Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro - a very late and formal recognition of what happened many years ago. /> <br /> not fiction, as in “Yugoslavia: a war that can be avoided (1999)”
