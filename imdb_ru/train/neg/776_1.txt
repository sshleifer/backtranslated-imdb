I remember, I saw this cartoon when I was 6 or 7 years old. My grandfather took his video for free at the mall. I remember that it really sucks. The plot did not make sense. I hated the fox who became a friend of Casper. He was so stupid! Casper cried if he could not find a friend. So what? Get over it! The only good part, and I don't want to seem mean, when the fox was shot and died at the end. I joked back because this cartoon sucks so much. The bad news is that the fox resurrects and becomes a ghost. I wish he stayed dead. I think I even gave this video to someone, because I hated it. No wonder they offered it for free at the mall. If you have a child, do not let them watch it. They will probably agree with me that this sucks.
