Little Mosque is one of the most boring CBC comedies I've ever seen. They have a way to create the simplest comedy programming for the oldest viewers who are the easiest to offend, which for CBC means 85 year old farmers in Saskatchewan. All jokes are predictable and deadly lame, I can not believe it. The performances are very foolish and overly active, but I do not blame the actors, since such stereotypical characters are probably exactly what CBC asked and demanded. They tried to present a very lame show with bad jokes as “controversial”, well this is less controversial than other boring CBC comedies like Hour 22 Minutes, Royal Canadian Air Farce and Rick Mercer's report.
