I was probably spoiled for the first time I saw the 1973 version with Michael Jaston and Sorche Cusack, so the 1983 adaptation is such a disappointment. I just didn't get any chemistry between the two main stars. Many entertainment and theater actors simply do not do this for me, and what was what Tim put on the role of Rochester. Has the casting director ever read a book? Very strange! He is a good actor, but Mr. Rochester is definitely not! And Zela was just, well, strange, a bit like a couple. In his favor, the supporting cast was pretty good, and the Lowood scenes for me were the best of adaptation, but on the whole did not catch any novel magic. Of course, no one would ask to see it as a real adaptation of the novel. This summed up!
