This could be a pathological view of the life of one of America’s most famous serial killers, but unfortunately it’s not even close. Awful editing, directing, bad game, you name it. This film is literally about 10 minutes of plot, stretched to 100. The only redeeming quality is Bruce Davidson as a father, but this is not enough to save this stinky. 1 out of 10.
