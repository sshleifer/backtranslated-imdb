... the first film I had to go out on. And it was a preliminary selection of actors and film crew (do not rush to add, I hasten to add). I did it in the first hour, so I think Iâ€™m qualified enough to comment, but that was my limit. <br /> <br /> Like the other comments here, as it went through any kind of quality control. The accumulation of the worst in the dialogue, the embodiment of wooden acting, terrible casting, everything was concluded without a plot. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald was weird, almost comic. She has the worst Russian accent in film history. <br /> <br /> When I left the film, the director and producers drank in a bar near the cinema. Obviously, they could not come to terms with it again. <br /> <br />
