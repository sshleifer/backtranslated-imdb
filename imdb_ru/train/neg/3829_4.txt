The imprisoned train robber near Yuma releases his chain gang and heads for the retired sheriff responsible for the murder of his wife (as well as the hidden cache of gold, which remains hidden thanks to the screenwriter). An attempt to bring the Western genre in line with the violence and cruelty in the style of the 1970s is not even in the same league as some of the new-fangled westerns that appeared in the late 60s. She is incredibly simple and square, and the female characters are simply in the form of pears and possible victims of rape. As a former sheriff who has returned to power, Charlton Heston gives one of his laziest, least inspired speeches in the entire history (he has one good point, he tries to read the letter and fumbles in his glasses). James Coburn, like a half-crazy half-breed, is also very much interested in autopilot, but Koburn has a way to turn even the hoarse dialogue and situations into something prickly and unnerving. This is his show completely. * 1/2 of ****
