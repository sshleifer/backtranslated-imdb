I absolutely hate this program, what kind of people are sitting and watching this garbage ?? Well, my dad and mom love it, lol, but I have to be sure that I leave the room before this happens. It is so depressing and sad, but the worst thing about it is an acting game, I can not stand all such detective programs, because detectives are so wooden and heartless. What happened to detective programs with a real mystery ??? I mean, who wants to know what happened to fictional characters, about which we do not know anything, who died more than 20 years ago ??? I would like bcc to put more comedies on bcc1, because now that Vicar Deeby is finished, there is more room for shit like this.
