Warning: it contains spoilers. If a movie starts with a sex scene, then this is a bad movie. (see for example 300). This confirms the above lemma. The second scene is the rotating center of the whole action. The fact that we know the end makes the film boring. Moreover, other plots are revealed as the story repeats several times. And it made it more disappointed. To compensate for the lack of expectation, we will more and more learn how unbalanced the characters are. And yes, they have something to show. Andy (P. Hoffman), for example, a drug addict, more ?, he deceives his wife, more?, He plans to rob his father, more?, His wife cheats on his brother, more?, He does not regret about his complicity in his death mothers, anymore? he is a serial killer, more? and so on and so forth there is not enough space to write here ... I wonder how he could get a better job. And why his wife did not leave him earlier. On the other hand, I really like the speeches of the actor Hoffman. <br /> <br /> Even here, PSH saves what's left of my $ 7 spent on this absurdity. Why is absurd? Because it does not make sense, why should I take care of vile characters? Another broken lemma is that the film must have a cute (at least pleasant) character. <br /> <br /> There is also a lot of sentimentality, for example, we must take care of the sufferings of a widowed father, knowing nothing about the life of the parents before the crime.
