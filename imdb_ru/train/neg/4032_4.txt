I never heard of it until he appeared on cable television. This is very typical of science fiction of the late 50s: sober, depressing and not a bit paranoid! Despite the equally typical inclusion of the romantic couple, the film is largely presented in a documentary style - which may be a cheap way to leave most of the narrative for the narrative and an excuse for inserting as much video as humanly possible because unbelievably incredibly low-budget enterprise! Although this is not uninteresting in itself (the Apocalypse-through-Apostate-Rocket angle), later used, with much greater aplomb, both for DR. STRANGELOVE [1964] and FAIL-SAFE [1964], and Fortunately, the short, purposeful approach of the film leads to a lot of unintended laughter - especially in scenes related to the inevitable childbirth and a gang of stupid juvenile delinquents!
