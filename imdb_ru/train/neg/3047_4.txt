I saw this film many times in the late 60s - early 70s, when he looked up like a deer with rabies every November-December as a children's Saturday show. It has always been a tough competition for Christmas, which almost did not exist (oops, can I say “Christmas”?), Perhaps the greatest, most iconic film about the Christmas season of all time. But this is another review. <br /> <br /> At that time I was surprised that there was a hint of SANTA on the screen. CLAUS was almost pink-white, so the color of the asterisk prints changed color. <br /> <br /> The film is kind of creepy! I thought so - and still do, in fact. I was very entertained then, just like I am still! It's funny in the style of "backward elves." By the way, the image quality on the DVD, which I have now, is much better than in the theater, around 1969-74. <br /> <br /> If you expect perhaps a “lost Christmas special. Forget about it! If you want FELLINI DOES Christmas - read on ... <br /> <br /> By nature dubbing these foreign films (the original version here was in Spanish) always makes them “surreal.” It adds to the film’s inherent oddity. It’s also pretty scary that the “bad demon” (as described in the original American trailer) spends the whole movie to turn decent kids into “evil.” One particularly nightmarish scene has ode "latch boy" wanting his parents for Christmas - all of a sudden the "family port" emerges from the giant "Christmas gifts" until he realizes he is just dreaming! Watch it, Christmas lovers - and if you Stoner, save your stash - this movie will make you think that you are hallucinating ... without drugs!
