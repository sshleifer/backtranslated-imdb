Believe me, I wanted to love "Spirit." The idiotic comments that people made during its release, how strange it was to see old-fashioned hand-drawn animation, as if the last cartoon pencil was released twenty years ago, and even more idiotic comments about how computers now made old methods obsolete, raised my blood ... but then, the offensive, odorless banality that I had to endure in the first ten minutes of "Spirit" raised my blood even more. <br /> <br /> Character design is animation, animation (partly as a result) is just a competent, artistic direction as a whole is so boring and boring that you wonder how this could happen (we know from "Prince of Egypt" and “The road to El Dorado” (that talented artists work in Dreamworks), and the sophisticated use of CGI is condemned in each case. (Why are they worried?) There is not one thing worth looking at. In the cartoon is deadly. <br /> <br /> But it gets worse ... <br /> <br /> Horses can't talk, but they are much more anthropomorphic and unconvincing than Deer in Bambi, which can. And it seems that in some ways horses CAN talk. Spirit himself pronounces the prologue (sounds for the whole world as a 21st century actor who was chosen at a mall in California), and since then his laid-back, completely horse-like narrative is hardly missing from the soundtrack, although he never tells us everything, that we did not yet know, or expresses a feeling that a work of art, although bad, is not able to express twice. This prologue, by the way: (a) contains information that the Spirit, as we later discover, knew in a way of knowing it; (b) express ideas that the Spirit cannot express, even if it CAN talk; (c) includes the trash of a new century, for example: “This story may not be true, but this is what I remember”; and (d) countless children (I guess at the age of six) give the impression that horses are from North America, which is kind of true in the sense that the common ancestor of domestic horses, zebra, etc. was originally from North America - but all types of horses on the continent died out long before the appearance of the first people, and the mustangs of the flock of the Spirit (who allegedly "belong here as buffalo grass") came from horses brought by Europeans. <br /> <br /> So the prologue annoyed me. <br /> <br /> Brian Adams, as usual, says Spirit, sings as usual, as if he has a strong throat infection - and it is not he who sings or even HOW he sings, this is what he sings: narrative ballads reminiscent of Maudlins, which make even less of a contribution, if possible, than what the narration of the Spirit said, and sound as if they all have the same melody (although I paid close attention I could see that they probably did not). If only Brian Adams and the guy pretending to be a horse could STOP for a minute or two, the movie could have gotten its true form: mediocre and derivative, and not terribly bad.
