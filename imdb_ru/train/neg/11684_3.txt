This film does not make any sense, it has large enough openings for the passage of the huge cars of New York. Characters do not act in any plausible way. I will post my comments in the chat, but saving you time and money is stupid. I hate it when Hollywood spends millions of dollars on flash-bang equipment, uses fancy editing and great music, and doesnâ€™t worry about the plot, which keeps together even at the most basic level. But it's nice to see that Denzel V. prevails over Man, which is presented in three versions: Jodie Foster, Mayor Blumberg and Captain Von Trapp. There is even a cute little baby with a video game that is good.
