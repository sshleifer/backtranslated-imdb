As others have noted, this film is pretentious chatter for insane or masochists. <br /> <br /> We all know after seeing the railway station and acid house that Scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world. But unlike choppot and acid house without a good dose of humor or films with realistic realism, like these, do not work. And more importantly, without a decent script, the film will not work, and there is nothing new, inspiring, or suggestive about the script for this film. <br /> <br /> The fact that this film won a couple of works by Bafta shows how Bad the British film industry is at the moment. I thought the Australian film industry was pretty bad at the moment, but unfortunately the British industry is even worse. <br /> <br /> This film is so bad that I wouldn't even rent it on a weekly basis. <Br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and give this movie a wide selection.
