I joined this site to see what people would do about this absolute disaster of the film. I was not involved even for a second. All characters were one-dimensional. They threw all the topics that could come up, hoping that something will work. I can argue (and hopefully) that everyone involved in the Masters looks around shyly. There are some great actors here, but you will never know. Thank God, it didn't ruin the career of Morgan Freeman, Judd Hirsch, Nick Nolte or Laura Dern. There was no vision, no labor of love, only a terrible effort went wrong. By the way, I do not think that a writer ever set foot in a real school.
