Although in many respects I agree with the comments of other reviewers. I think the plot and the idea are very good. Many of the supporting actors were very good. The fatal issue with this film is Ellen Pompeo. I'm sure I have never seen a less talented "actor." As this man ever starred in movies or on television, I can not imagine. In my opinion, she would be better than better at Wal-Mart. To see a person with such a low level of talent involved in paying for roles, does the question arise ... ...... “Who does she know”? I would really like this movie to be rewritten with some talent. I do not blame the author for the fact that this film was not worth watching.
