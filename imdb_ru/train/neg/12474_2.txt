I saw the version of "Deathstalker III" for MST3K and so loved the film - even the "not obsessed" - that I decided to watch the entire series of films "Deathstalker". I bought I and II and calmed down for a laugh. <br /> <br /> Nothing in “Death I” was funny at any level, and when the loans rolled, I was embarrassed and regretted that I had bought it! Too much deformity and nudity. I think either “DS 3” was a much cleaner production, or MST3K really edited a lot, because I was expecting something similar, that is, stupid, carefree and simple. I was wrong. Even for $ 6.99 it seemed like a waste of money. I haven’t even opened DS 2 since I’ll return it tomorrow. Now I’ll probably just throw away this DVD, because I can’t get it back, and no one wants it, including myself! So really, don't worry about it. Even nudity (in many ways, by the way) is boring and unsightly.
