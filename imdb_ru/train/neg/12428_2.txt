I liked the first two films, but this film was a waste of time and money (for me and the studio). I'm still wondering why they shot this horrible movie. The fact that a plastic gun and a toy car can get into another house is ridiculous. Joe Sands and Daniel Stern in the first two films were so funny, but the terrorists in this film are so stupid and not funny. Believe me, this movie is just a waste of time.
