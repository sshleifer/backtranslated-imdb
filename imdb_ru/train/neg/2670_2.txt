There is no way on earth to take care of any of these characters. A bunch of spoiled, overgrown middle class children take drugs at a party, come down with each other and argue. I just saw it on TV, and I did not think it was a “film” as such, rather an indulgence after “This Life,” which really has no resonance or proper drama. Such things, unfortunately, will be put into operation for immemorial times, unfortunately, an irrelevant middle-class shit for “life” that takes itself too seriously. There is David Buddyel and this bird from Cold Feet, you know what to expect. In 2000, there was a lot of it all, especially the British malaise ... "They are educated and use drugs - friends, but in some way dysfunctional and with incestuous relations - it sounds great!". Such nonsense and comedy-gangster stuff after Guy Ritchie ... dark days. If you have a taste, it will annoy you to the point of violence.
