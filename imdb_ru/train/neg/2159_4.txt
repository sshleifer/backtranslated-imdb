Well, this Robin Hood as an eccentric is all right ... just as advertised! It did not sound very encouraging, and, alas, it was worse than I suspected. <br /> <br /> Mighty Robin, whom I can take; Robin, who gets confused with the daughter of a daring handsome man whom I can believe; but Robin, who exchanges not very funny banter with his only minion, is harder to swallow, and Robin and the whole cast *, who seem to have difficulty managing their lines, is a kiss of doom. How could anyone let such a difficult delivery pass without skirmishes? Over and over again, a lot of things sound as if he is struggling with half-meaningful Shakespeare, instead of releasing a salty wit; At first I hoped that it was just an unfortunate comedic trait in character, clearly intended for the role of a comedy friend, but then it began to spread to the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> Whatever you say about Errol Flynn about him in this role, he knew how to carry on a dialogue with high popularity as naturally as if he had just thought it up on the spur of the moment ... and, as shows this performance is not as easy as it sounds! If they were going to play characters in cheeky guys, the corresponding actors should be given the appropriate lines: they sound like they have no idea how to handle them. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid I didn’t even like the pantomime Sheriff for the same reason; The lines are clearly not intended to be taken seriously, but put (and in this case they wrote) with an impetus and wink to the audience. They are irrelevant, everything is in order, they are destroying the fourth wall, but in reality it is not that funny. <br /> <br /> This promised production reminded me of a lame school play. The only actor and character for whom I felt any appreciation was the one who played Guy Gisborne, who was the only one who seemed to have something to do with (a) trustworthy villain and (b) trustworthy characterization - but honestly, I did not say that it was a very good omen for the future of the series! At the time of this writing, I will take another shot in the hope that the situation may improve and by the end of next week will calm down a bit, requiring a less sensitive stage setting and it may be easier for actors to dialogue: finally, the opening episode of “Doctor Who” was not just a show stopper, although it was not as bad as this one. But if I don’t see any improvement after episode 2, I’m afraid that the show almost certainly lost one viewer. <br /> <br /> That would be a pity because I have a weak spot for “Robin Hood” “The legend on the screen, from the adventures of Douglas Fairbanks to Richard Green's strong confidence. But this Robin can in no way stir my blood.
