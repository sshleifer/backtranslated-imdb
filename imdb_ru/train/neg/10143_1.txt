FLIGHT OF FURY is the worst Steven Seagal film I've ever seen ... Until now. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible thing, without any interesting scenes, Seagal is not really trying to do this - he is fat, and his voice is duplicated again. <br /> <br /> Colleagues with the stars do not live better, being a rather miserable burden of 3 appraisers. <br /> <br /> Keush’s direction is very poor, and it’s not surprising that he is also responsible for another pair of Seagal abominations (SHADOW MAN & ATTACK FORCE). The script, written by Sigal himself, is ridiculously inept. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb, $ 12M was spent on this boring load of old tosh - if these numbers are correct, I feel a big tax violin, because this amount was not spent. <br /> <br /> FLIGHT OF FURY is actually a shot for the remake of THE BLACK THREAT Michael Dudikoff - which should be better than this trip. <br /> <br /> It has NO redemptive qualities, GIVE MISS! 1/2 * of *****
