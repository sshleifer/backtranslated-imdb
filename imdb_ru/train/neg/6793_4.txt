Sandy, dusty western from director Richard Brooks, who seems to be completely absorbed by the genre, while retaining all the usual clichés. In the early 1900s, a quiet cowboy (Jean Hackman), a courteous player (James Coburn), a saucy child (Ian Michael Vincent), and even WOMAN (Candace Bergen’s game) are involved in horse racing. After the preliminary exams have gone astray (with predictable arguments about whether a woman should take part), this becomes a rather exciting note, although it does not reveal any new basis (instead, it resembles something from the era of Gary Cooper). Beautifully, if a too long piece has a manly character and a beautiful shade, but the mechanisms of the plot rather quickly become tedious. ** from ****
