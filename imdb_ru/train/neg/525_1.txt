I looked through other comments and was very surprised when I found out that only those people who actually worked on the film commented. I mean, I don't want to say bad things about an amateur production, but if you shoot a bad movie and want to comment on it, muffle it a little. “Innovation” is a bit higher. This is a college setting in Boston that does not even reach the level of most amateur student films. This is what you expect from a group of children. Silly fighter without much creativity. It's pretty funny if you're ready to poke fun at it. Not something you will ever see if you are not studying at Emerson College.
