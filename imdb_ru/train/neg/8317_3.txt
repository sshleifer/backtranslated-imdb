For a killer movie, this is surprisingly boring. <br /> <br /> Nothing special happens, and even when something happens, they do not cause any real excitement or interest. <br /> <br /> Cassetti's acting, in particular, does a good job with the work, combining Succoâ€™s confidence and stupidity, but the rest of the actors also do what they need. <br /> <br /> The problem is that bad writing and Direction, and the fact that, like a real story, is not interesting, Sukko is not a unique character, it is not interesting or exciting. <br /> <br /> Films of this kind usually try to cause tension or sympathy or outrage, and this causes nothing but a feeling of regret that you have wasted your time watching.
