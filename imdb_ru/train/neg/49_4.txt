A very stupid and boring road film, with the intention of being fashionable and fashionable, is shown in the editing style and some strange camera angles, which only leads to drowsiness. <br /> <br /> The composition is wasted, the writing is silly and pretentious. The only thing worth is the soundtrack of the first-class Lalo Schifrin, really cool, as well as the opening sequence, very original and interesting. <br /> <br /> Run if you can, bad opinions and comments about this are absolutely deserved; this is really clean trash. Of course, this has its own charm - to watch a movie in which everyone would not have thrown a beer glass, if it were on fire, but saved it on a stormy day when you have nothing more to do.
