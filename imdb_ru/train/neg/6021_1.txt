I can't believe they managed to spend $ 17 million on this film. Impressively bad behavior, blatant scenarios and effects that you could do on your regular PC, incredible plot tricks ... a reporter who can arrange an inexperienced stewardess with a main job at the UN? What kind? Not only that, but the essence of this film is so unconvincing that you have the feeling that they were trying to beat you on the head with a crucifix in full size. Everything that this film does will preach to the choir and make everyone laugh at such a ridiculous waste of money. If the creators of this film really wanted to incline people to Christianity and show what it means to truly believe, they would use money to help people who really need it. Now, it could make some people really listen to them.
