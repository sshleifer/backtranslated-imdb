Going into a movie like me, I did not expect absolutely nothing interesting, except for the murders that I had ..... I got even less. <br /> <br /> Christmas Eve 1947, when a child sees his parents do it while dad is wearing a santa costume. In horror, he runs up the stairs and cuts himself. The story begins 33 years later, and Harry Stalling is your usual daily activity ..... except for the fact that he is obsessed with Santa. After his boss makes fun of him, he goes crazy, dressing like Santa, and starts killing unbelieving patrons and his boss. The disobedient neighborhood overtakes him, and as soon as they are about to set it on fire, he drives his van away from the cliff ... to the moon. Not the best final I've ever seen, but it was original. <br /> <br /> It was a slow, boring film that really had no quality redemption, except when Harry applied for the church members. There was almost no blood, and even the “sex” scenes were softened. <br /> <br /> too boring ...... 4 of 10
