I saw this film twice in a Pentecostal church, which my family attended in Nanaimo BC in the 1970s. I was 6 years old, my brother was 4 years old, and then, when I was 8 years old, my brother is 6. This movie horrified my brother and me and shaped the way we looked at the world with disbelief. It was not just a film, but a philosophy that embraces so many "Christians" about the "sign of the beast" and admiration. This film, the church and the unsustainable educational background lead to serious paranoia for the future. For many years I lived under the delirious influence of the church and the fear of being forgotten by Christ. I am 40 years old now. Years of counseling have passed. Once I explained to the psychiatrist this film and the belief system of the church and family. I was attached with delusional disorder. I really started to believe it, it was my brother who reminded me that this cult philosophy really happened. I no longer fear the future, I have come to terms with the fear that the church inspires in its members. I used this experience to achieve the goal; I am close to obtaining a license from a psychologist specializing in childhood trauma.
