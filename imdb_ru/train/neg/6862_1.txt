This superiority compared to the original blunt film "The Blind Dead" is another waste bin. So many people have been promoting these films, that I can't believe what they are saying about it. Since I was a kid, I heard about how scary and good these films are, and I saw them all and was completely disappointed, were everyone with drugs from the 1970s or simply donâ€™t know how boring this raw oil?
