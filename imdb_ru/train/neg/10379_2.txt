The film begins in 1840 in Japan, in which a man kills his wife and her lover to death and commits suicide. This is a very bloody, bloody sequence. Then he jumps to our days ... well, to be exact, in 1982. Ted (Edward Albert), Laura's wife (Susan George) and their annoying little child move to Japan to work her husband. They rent a house and - surprise! Surprise - it's just the house where the murders occurred! The three dead, like ghosts (hysterically bad makeup), make life a hell for the whole family. <br /> <br /> Sounds normal - but it’s really hopeless. There is a bloody discovery and an end, and NOTHING happens between them. There is an attack of giant crabs, which is simply outrageous! They look so fake - I swear, I saw the strings pulling one after them - and they mumble !!!!! In the first 20 minutes there is a meaningless sex sequence (probably, just to show George’s body), another after about 40 minutes (but it was necessary for the plot) and really stupid exorcism at the end. The fight between Albert and Doug McClure must be believed. <br /> <br /> As for acting, Albert was fine, like a husband, and McClure was a pretty good family friend. But George - as always - is awesome in a lousy movie. She gives this film a much-needed boost - but she cannot save it. I give it 2 only for her and bloody opening and closing. In addition, it is a very boring movie.
