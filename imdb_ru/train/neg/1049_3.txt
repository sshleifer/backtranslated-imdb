This film has a very Broadway feel - background, action, noise - and yet this is all it has. Some "feeling" of Broadway without an explosion. <br /> <br /> The film goes slowly, the picture is not divided, the singing “pops up” on you, so you are suddenly reminded that this is a musical. <br /> <br /> Unsatisfactory: Sinatra <br /> <br /> Unbearable: Sinatra's fiance is undoubtedly the height and accent of her voice are not needed. <br /> <br /> Acceptable: Mr. "I remember the numbers on my dice" <br /> <br /> Delight: Brando's discreet singing (very biased!) <br /> <br /> Surprise: how many Jin Simmons looks like Vivien Leigh in her Havana scenes. This is a bone structure! How I would kill if I saw Miss Lee in the role of challenging Brando.
