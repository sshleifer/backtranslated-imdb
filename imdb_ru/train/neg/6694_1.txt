I really had hopes for this film, since I saw Kari in several other things and I think she has some talent. Alas, this fool is an example of what not to do in the script. Absolutely vague characters without the slightest sympathy and no plot. Is it the road / buddy / comedy / thriller / romance / drama? The filmmakers have no clue as we do.
