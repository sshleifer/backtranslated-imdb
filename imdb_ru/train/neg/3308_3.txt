When you get into the hands of a British film, you expect some quality. And when it comes to acting, camera work, lighting, etc .; this film does business. This is done by highly skilled craftsmen. This alone can bring you a pleasant one and a half hours. But when you look under the layers of professionalism, you really do not find anything. Besides the fact that you feel good and protect the views of the liberals on drugs, there really is nothing there. The script is mediocre, the plot is predictable, and the final must be one of the worst east of Hollywood. In all its English coziness, it's just a shameful and cynical attempt to make another "Full Monty". Why did they make this film? I have no idea, except, of course, to earn money.
