Do not misunderstand me. If you need a deep presentation of everything that was wrong with the history of human civilization, as well as an immaculate path to the bright future of humanity, who should you turn to rather than a comedian and a practicing pop culture? If you need a healthy dose of all compelling and compelling reasons why religion has outlived its usefulness, then turn to Sagan or Dawkins, and not to BILL MAHER for God's sake (?)! This is a good moment in itself. Maher rejects our religious past as a neurological disorder, conveniently ignoring the way in which his whole society, art and science are rooted in it. <br /> <br /> In this film, he relies heavily on his astutely honed skill of irony and cynicism. to express their point of view, trying to seem erudite and wise. Unfortunately, his intellect does not cope with this task. <br /> <br /> Maher makes us laugh, but obviously not the brightest light bulb in the box. As an example, he responds to the statement of the interlocutor (and I use this term loosely, since they clearly were ambushes) that the existence of Jesus is a historical fact with the deadpan expression “No, it’s not so” followed by a long look, intended convey contempt for the subject’s naivety (a device nauseatingly used in this film). The problem is that this man was right, and Maher is completely wrong in asserting that Jesus is mentioned only in what he considers to be the historically suspicious Gospel. I believe Mr. Maher never read the contemporary historian Josephus. <br /> <br /> But the masses flock to this pseudo-documentary film, as they make fictional works of other intellectual giants, such as Michael Moore, and they talk loudly and guffaw (they, of course, did at my show). <br /> <br /> However, it doubly says that the loudest and most mule-like jealous occurred during approximately 70% of the film’s time devoted to this. anti-Christian tirade, while the audience was completely dumb for 10% of the critics of the self-described Religion of the World. Hmmm Either the criticism of Islam is prohibited for a poor and liberal target audience, or they were simply afraid to laugh. Very revealing one way or another ..
