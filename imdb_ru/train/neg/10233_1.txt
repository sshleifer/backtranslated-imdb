Reflecting on captivity, many words come to mind. Among them: uninteresting, uninteresting, unacceptable, obscene, incomprehensible and invisible. <br /> <br /> I hated those films from the middle to the end of the nineties that were mostly Scream robberies, but these new fakes of Saw start to make these films look like classics. They still indulge in the same demographics as other films in which they have so succeeded, but now they add a new level of degeneration that makes girls between the ages of twelve and fourteen the years they aim at feel hardcore and fashionable. <br /> This movie is boring nonsense! What the hell happened to Larry Cohen? His name has not been associated with anything good since 1993! Despite this, I was still surprised to see that he had something to do with something REAL! Was anyone surprised when the love interest of the film turned out to be one of the psychopaths? Did anyone know when they first saw him? Only he who has never seen another movie in his life!
