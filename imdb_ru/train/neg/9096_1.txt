I think this is probably one of the worst films I've watched in a long time. <br /> <br /> Trying to get “the same characters” from different people - * such * is a bad idea. If they could not get Sarah Michelle J. And Ryan P. in this, they would just have to cut their losses and say what the hell is with this. Instead, they get NEW actors who are terrible at what they did. I seriously felt like I was in high school or (bad) college playing with the leverage of these people. <br /> <br /> Where do they get some of these people? Was that their first movie? It seems so. <br /> <br /> This film is also similar to the original in several lines. I just finished watching the first one and popped # 2. I was very excited to watch the second one and it turned out to be the worst show I've ever seen. I hardly ever * NEVER * turn off a movie, but this one certainly worked in about 30 to 40 minutes.
