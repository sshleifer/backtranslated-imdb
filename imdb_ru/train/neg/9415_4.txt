The heavily edited and often confusing original screen version of Man On Fire has been outdated by at least ten years, and recent years have not made it any better. This is a film that producers with too much money and too little experience make to attract attention, and everyone else just pays for their outstanding alimony or drug dealers, and Scott Glenn's bodyguard goes to the limb to save him. summer accused, kidnapped daughter of a rich Italian family. An interesting cast - Joe Sands, Brooke Adams, Danny Aiello, Jonathan Price - all did better, the action is slow and rare, and only the exceptionally good result of John Scott (part of which was on the last drum of Die Hard) makes a positive impression. One case where the remake (made by Tony Scott, the initial choice of director for this version) is an improvement.
