Am I wrong, or is the 2007 version just a plagiarism of the original? I have to ask, because the DVD I just bought is one of the worst movies I've ever seen ..... bad play, bad editing, etc ... the only aspect of "exploitation" here - the way we were ripped off for our money by buying this piece of shit. This is nothing more than a lightweight porn movie ... no real gore, no scary images, just cheap stuff made a bit. If someone wants to see a great movie without personal actors, blood mucosa and a decent storyline ... take Baby Blood ... also made for a cheap budget, but well done ... and a real story too! a waste of money, but I will keep it just for fun .... it's a pity! A new comment .... September 3 ..... I will keep this film forever just because it is VERY bad, it's almost good .... very bad ... the worst game in history ... but real crap classic movie!
