What can I say? I am a secret fan of action movies and horror films "beyond that". Especially when there is a lot of humor and understatement in it, but I'm not a fan of “Snake on the plane.” <br /> <br /> There are three potential draws in this movie: ?? Comedy situation; ?? Horror; and ?? The novelty of hundreds of snakes in the plane. <br /> <br /> Firstly, this film is not written as a mocking horror or comedy, and in the film there is only 1 or 2 points where you will smile to yourself. If you want to get an idea of ​​the movie, the trailer really represents the movie, horror. <br /> <br /> Secondly, if you expect a movie full of action and upheaval, you will not be disappointed, It does not stand out from other films, but always keeps your attention. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, despite the fact that the novelty “Snakes on an airplane” is not erased, you will leave the movie in thought. ” what's the fuss about? <br /> <br /> I know that this film has a high rating, but it does not add up. A) Many reviews were written before the release of the film, and, B) The breakdown of user ratings is significantly less than usual, 77% of people rate the movie as 10/10, and only 7% of people give it to 9/10 - Why such a huge gap?
