This is a ghost story. This is the story of cannibalism. This is a story of revenge. This is a very poorly made film with a lot of violence. I suppose it is cheap in the wake of every scam movie you've ever seen. He has the usual isolated place, daring tourists, heading into the desert. Of course, there are quite intense scenes. It's so boring. Bad editing and everything works. There are ghost children who sound like they are talking in a trash can. I'm not quite sure that controls the ghosts and the loony with a cap. It also has a common scene where a man eats a piece of meat, which in fact is what is left of his wife. A friend of mine once asked me why it is necessary to show this kind of unreasonable, sick violence. I'm afraid this is just another step in our desensitized evolution. Three is not the mind, not the tongue in the cheek, only a sad waste of time. A lot of blood; little story
