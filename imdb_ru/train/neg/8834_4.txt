There was some truth in this film. I remember a story told 15â€“20 years ago that 4 fishermen found a body in the water, and they decided not to report it until their journey was over. I also remember that they were charged with interfering with a corpse (or with some other accusation). I'm not sure if it was in Australia. Viewers outside of Australia should think that we live in a country full of rapists and serial murders. Wolf Creek and this film will encourage this perception. The film itself reminded me of a simple plan. But since someone claimed that I was one of the best Australian films ever, I can't be so generous. Let's just say I wouldn't watch it again.
