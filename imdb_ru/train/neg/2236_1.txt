I really do not know where to start. The acting in this film was really terrible, I don’t remember that in one movie there were so many “actors” who couldn’t play. Not only the acting was bad, but the characters were incredibly stupid. <br /> <br /> Then there is the action. I believe that even children know that when someone is shot, there is blood mixed up. But when someone is shot at Snitch'd ten (!!) times, there will be no blood at all. Well, I think it's just me. In short, (because, believe me, I can talk about this movie for hours), this is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. This movie should be number 1 in the bottom 100 without a doubt.
