Poor Michael Madsen; he must be kicking himself to know that people learned about this terrible click. I really can't think of anything worse, I've ever seen, except amateur porn. It's so bad, and everyone is here; The wooden game, the bad script, the wacky moral end, you hate it and it's in this movie. <br /> <br /> My question is: “Who the hell put $$$ into this piece of dog doo? At least we could see Michael Virginia’s sister nude in the scene, but I don’t think even that would save this bitch ... <br /> <br /> For a tough guy who made some exceptional films, I want to know that the stupid church sponsored this piece of shit.
