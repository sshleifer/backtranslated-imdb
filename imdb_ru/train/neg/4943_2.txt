I watched 3 episodes of Caveman, and I have no idea why I continue, except maybe, in anticipation of its improvement. <br /> <br /> For me, this show is simply ad-free, without much humor. As we sat and watched these shows, we all thought about what was going to happen. <br /> <br /> An episode with a female cave woman with such an attitude was for us really big, yes, the right one. she is rude in the theater and behaves harshly with strangers, and, in truth, she needs a slap in the face <br /> <br /> I consider myself to be a pretty good reviewer who accepts everything, but I must say that Cavemen is comparable to the old show, mom car I give him 2, just because they deserve 1 better than 1, because they really spent money on him.
