This is the biggest piece of lamo I've ever watched. This is terribly boring, I would rather sit at a creationism seminar than watch it if I knew that it would be as boring as before. Even 40 seconds of hot chicks in a bikini with big ta tasas do not buy back anything below 1. Reviews of this film claiming that this film is “unintentionally funny” is absurd. and just WRONG. There is nothing funny in this movie. they spend the first 50 minutes walking around the forest talking about things that you don’t understand and do not care about them, and this is also lame when people start dying because you don’t even know who these people are, because they are INTERESTING. Honestly, I have not watched it to the end, but it must say something about how terrible it is. GOOD FILM. <br /> <br /> Immediately after removing this dirt from my DVD player, I started scratching it on the cement in front of my house, not wanting other blockbuster clients to fall for the same mistake as me. how to shoot this movie. Then Zach urinated in his pants. Thank you for your time.
