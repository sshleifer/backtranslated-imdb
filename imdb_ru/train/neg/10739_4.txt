Iedereen Beroemd has everything we can expect from direct to video film. This is a story about a man who believes that his daughter can be a star. The only thing he needs is to bring her to the stage surrounded by cameras and reporters. A simple plan for which he should kidnap and do a bit of blackmail. The problem with the film is not in the main plot, but in how it is made. Everything should be funny, but it is not. This is trivial and clumsy, the characters are small, and the final sequence is absolutely without climax or emotion. The last sequence is probably the only scene in which you want to laugh, but only in how pathetic is all this.
