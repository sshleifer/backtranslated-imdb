Warning: Spoilers are plentiful! <br /> <br /> Tim Burton, reworking this sui generis film, is about as sensible as reworking “Psycho” - oh, really, some idiot has already done that - I stop my business. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the fact that the chimpanzee simulates coarsely, proving that he is not so smart from the very beginning. Marky Mark appears in the picture without the characteristic pants, and then rejected by a simple woman who prefers the touch of a chimpanzee. <br /> <br /> A careless shot of a space station that rotates around Saturn for no apparent reason. the bustle of the ship with genetic experiments on monkeys. Should we go 1300 million kilometers to Saturn to conduct these experiments? The special effects team does this. <br /> <br /> Chimpanzee Marky was lost in this mainstream science fiction cinema of the 60s - Time Warp. Marki then demonstrates the stunning safety of the space station, stealing a capsule that no one has noticed, and at the same time demonstrates his reckless stupidity in setting a rescue mission in deep space into a wormhole for a million dollar spent vehicle with limited fuel and oxygen. <br /> <br /> Before anyone said that “There’s no point in reworking,” Marki ran through the wormhole, crashed on another planet, took off his helmet, not thinking about the lethality of the atmosphere, and pursued through a sound scene that almost resembles a magnificent rainforest, if not kliegs, illuminating plastic trees. <br /> <br /> Surprise! This pursuit is pursued by APES - or at least it would be * a surprise if no one had seen Planet Of The Apes THIRTY THREE YEARS OLD BACK. <br /> <br /> Since Mark Mark failed to show his pets, take off his pants, or kill his lame white rap boy, he was faceless. The teeth of the gorilla Michael Clark Duncan, which were inserted crookedly, greatly helped to establish his lack of character. Helena Bonham-Carter (known as an annoying chimpanzee activist), having lost the Shakespearean script, did an excellent job with the task of outperforming both Mark and Clark as Cardboard Bridge. Paul Jamatti, an orangutan slave trader, provided the role of symbolic comic relief and interspecific sham. Despite the fact that I became mad when I listened to puns related to this film, one of the review headlines reflected the essence of the “rethinking” of the planet “Monkeys”: “Rota Monkeys”. While everyone else thought of looking like extras from Million Years BC, or Greystoke, Tim Roth, in the role of a chimpanzee, Tade is chewing on a huge amount of landscapes and beautifully throwing Kaka. No matter how funny he is, portraying the psychotic Teid, his character lacked a behavioral arch: Teid goes crazy when we first meet him ... and he is pretty much at the same level of insanity at the end of the film. Good twist. <br /> <br /> In the original film “POTA” (1968), the lead character was depicted - “Taylor” by Charlton Heston, who was so disappointed with humanity that he left Earth for space without regrets - while this film was being developed, Taylor unwittingly unwittingly turned out to be locked in a battle to prove the value of humanity - as their only champion! The original film was ultimately a tale of humiliation, not salvation: when Taylor discovers the Statue of Liberty, he is forced to understand that his appearance has NOT prevailed. Is there something that is cerebral or ironic for Leo Mark Mark? Or Toth Roth? No, but a lot of running. <br /> <br /> Slogans scream: "Take the planet." But this is the planet APES. In this film, people and monkeys landed here together, people degenerated into cavemen, allowing monkeys to acquire speech and sensual armor; monkeys wanted to inherit the planet! Together with Mark, in true anthropocentric arrogance, it is taken for granted that humans MUST be apex predators simply because they are there. “Pick him up” is as funny as the monkeys landing here in 2001 and complain: “The planet where humans evolved from APES ?? !! ”and then causes problems with their replay and hairy anus. <br /> <br /> Geston was thrown into the 1968 POTA because he established his reputation as an individual: he was Ben-Hur, Michelangelo, Moses! To consider him a dumb dog animal in an alien society meant to stun the audience’s expectations: how insane should the world be in which our man Charlton cannot command respect? Marky Mark is now only found that he has narrow panties. <br /> <br /> Although the council of monkeys constantly insulted Heston, he dominated the screen with its charisma and tremendous replay. When Marc Marc tries to instill enthusiasm in Mongolian people, it’s like the unpopular guy in school who suddenly becomes a school monitor who tells you to stop drawing penises on the blackboard and you throw a shoe at him. Burton is trying to raise the Mark to the icon of humanity, but he looks like a talkative deviant. In the original film, monkeys consider Taylor deviant, but for viewers and monkeys, he was an icon of humanity. And again this irony. <br /> <br /> It was fortunate that the person who raised the stage while chewing on the acting technique - Heston - should play the father of the main spectator of this film, Taddeus Roth. Being a monkey of Roth, Charlton says his own immortal lines, this time against MAN: “Damn them! Damn them all! '<br /> <br /> By the end of the film, everything is dumber and dumber. While Thaddeus gives Marki a lesson by beating on the ass, a pod descends from the height from Mark's chimpanzee. The monkeys demonstrate their hebetud by bowing to this unrecognizable creature, and Marki proves his hebetud, muttering: "Let's teach these monkeys evolution." First of all, they are not monkeys, you are a monkey! Secondly, these were genetic falsifications and invented fabrications that led the monkeys to this point, and not evolution. And the fact that you intend to teach them, taking them away with the help of hidden laser weapons, is called misanthropy, not evolution. <br /> <br /> Refusal from the final spin would only knock the audience down with the belief that the role of Estella Warren in the semi-bad was actually an integral part of the plot (be still in my pants). <br /> <br /> No matter that he was the last hope of mankind; in the end, police monkeys take Marki to Point Point Jail, where the last time he heard him say, “This is a lunatic asylum! MADHOUSE !! ... '
