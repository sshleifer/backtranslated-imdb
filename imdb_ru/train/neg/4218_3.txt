This is not one of those reviews about bad special effects or technologies or outdated problems that only the dumbest people can deal with, but rather a review telling a story that most of us are really interested in. <Br /> <br /> The story of the connection of the members of the Allied Navy and the German Navy and two civilians (hero and heroine), who are grouped on a German submarine and end up in a wild country of dinosaurs. /> <br /> Manipulations are not so bad by the standards of cinema, and we know from the plot that realism will not be high. In films like this, you need trustworthy and cute characters, as well as some semblance of intelligence in action. <br /> <br /> This film lacks both. For the full-length film, only 6 characters are given at any time, and 3 of them are hardly studied. Hero McClure goes beyond the "routine" and does not make much sense in any era. <br /> <br /> The female seems to be looking for an answer to the mystery of the land of dinosaurs, into which they entered, but the mystery is not a big mystery, and we would not give a damn. <br /> <br /> A lot of failures in the film, which was supposed to be better, even for its time.
