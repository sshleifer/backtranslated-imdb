Let's start with simple lines. On the part of the viewer, there are several good “director details”, several points of view on good movie scenes. The special effects are good enough, good acting / good scenery too. But the story is too simple. It shows how an elite army bomber squad lives, acts, and sometimes dies. It shows the drama of life in war. In my experience of cinema as a serious action movie, “addicted” to a guy, I missed the click that gets stuck on the screen. One of the things that must be present in the film in order for me to consider it good is the ability to immerse the viewer into the reality and time of the film. This did not happen to me. I remained “conscious” throughout the film. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I think this film has gained fame thanks to the “subconscious” appeal of American patriotism, healthy and sincere feelings, but inadequate use as a generator of film fame. On this is based not only a film about the war, but also its popularity. <br /> <br /> A simple thought: if it was a film about the Second World War or the film “I”, only the time when everything would have remained the same would have changed, wouldn’t it? to be awarded? Definitely not. What for? Because there are excellent ones that raise the bar to the maximum. <br /> <br /> Compared to his competitors at the Oscars, I do not think that all the prizes he won are awarded correctly.
