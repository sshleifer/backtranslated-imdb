3-D, shown in "The Man Who Was Not," means DUMB, DUMB, DUMB! This inept comedy shows lousy 3-D effects that make 3-D effects in Jaws 3, Amityville 3 and Friday the 13th Part 3 better than them. Not to mention the movie, it is utterly stupid. It was one of many films of 1983 in which the effects removed from the screen were shown. Steve Guttenberg and Jeffrey Tambor are trapped in this mess, but at least it didn’t kill their career. Tambor will continue to appear in the HBO's “The Larry Sanders Show” and at the Ron Howard box office “How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” while Guttenberg followed this failure with the Police Academy and Cocoon. That they are in those projects instead of them here in "The Man Who Was Not." If you do, you will regret it. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (out of four)
