I'm a big fan of low cost horror films like this, but come on! This must be the worst part of the S @ # t monkey I've ever seen! I ignored the reviews posted on this site, believing that I would like it terribly, but I got bored and I turned it off. from the depot house. The masks were made from something like tin foil. <br /> <br /> Mountain: The mountain was pretty good, I have to give it. But Ittenbach's Burning Moon was better for a low-budget movie. <br /> <br /> Acting: it was terrible! I did not mind duplication. I find it with humor, as in Ittenbach's Premutos (great movie). The sequence of battles and actions was bad. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: do not watch Snaas films. There are much better directors such as JÃ¶rg Buttergate and Olaf Ittenbach with films of the same genre and subject matter. Check out Premutos, the House of Blood, Schramm and the Necromancyx.
