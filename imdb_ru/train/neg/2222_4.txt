Carlo Verdone once managed to combine superb comedy with smart and subtle social analysis and criticism. <br /> <br /> Then something happened, and he turned into just another boring director "holier than you." <br /> Il Mio Miglior Nemico can be more or less summarized in one line: “working class = kind and warm, and the highest class is snob and dodgy. But love eventually wins. " <br /> <br /> Such a banal cliche for such an intelligent director. <br /> <br /> There’s nothing to talk about in the film. Each character is a walking stereotype: a self-made person who forgets about his roots, but who becomes “good” again, a despicable wife, a naughty rich girl who falls in love with an honest, but poor guy ... barely average. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing in every aspect.
