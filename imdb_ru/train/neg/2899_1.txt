seriously, what the hell was this film about, just stupid, I would give 0, but ,, 1 "terrible" is the lowest that you can go, seriously, this film is not worth watching, waste of time, I do not know what the hell is wrong with you guys who vote for this movie 7 out of 10, I can seriously make a better movie than this one, hire other unemployed, and promise that I will make a movie better than this ,, this movie was so bad, that I will never watch a movie with Steve Carrell in the lead role, the point is not to waste my time to download it from network or rented ,, film of the century I mean the worst, must give something, but after that it is the second
