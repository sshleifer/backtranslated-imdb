Usually, when a film gets one vote, this is because someone just does not like him and he is annoyed, he does not have a lower rating, and therefore he decides to pull him as low as possible, and not just assign him a low rating. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> Bonesetter is a great example of a 0/10 movie. He does not do anything right, and he has no chance, because he is not really trying to do anything. There are features of a bad D & D plot that does not stick together, and the complete absence of any action in everything. It is clear that no one involved in this project put any serious effort into it, because even the hard work of a completely incompetent person can cost more. Really horrible movie.
