This movie was just moved by MST3K and for good reason. First of all, because this is a film about the "cops" with Joe Don Baker in the lead role, which, as we all know, is about as good actor as Michael Jackson, the country-western singer. <br /> <br /> The whole typical plot of a film about police devices raises their ugly heads, bar fights, children's hostages in gunfights, bad behavior, lame police bosses, bad behavior, revenge / justice, endless idiots and, of course, bad behavior. Do not watch it without people filter MST3K.
