This is the most depressing film I've ever seen. I first saw it as a child, and even thinking about it now really upsets me. I know that this happened at a time when life was hard, and I know that these people were poor and the harvest was vital. Yes, I understand all this. I find it hard to understand that I cannot remember a single light moment in the whole film. Maybe it was true for life, I do not know. I am quite sure that the acting was top notch, and the direction and quality of filming, etc. It was wonderful, and I know that every film cannot have a happy ending, but as a family film it is terrible, in my opinion. <br /> I would not recommend this to anyone who wants to have fun with the film. I can not stress how this film influenced me in childhood. I recently talked about this, and all the sad memories came back. I think that would be all but the heartless achievement of Prozac.
