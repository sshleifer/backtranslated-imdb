This should be one of the worst films of all time. Awful game, horrible script ... and they were good moments! One will definitely miss! The jokes, if you can call them that, were so predictable that they would be pitiful. Pamela Anderson still relies on her body to divert attention from the fact that her actions are just as plastic! I sat, wanting to give him a chance, hoping that he would improve, which, alas, no! If it was a choice between this book and a book, I suggest you read well! I like Denise Richards, which is why I gave this film a try, but why she allowed herself to act in this film is beyond my power!
