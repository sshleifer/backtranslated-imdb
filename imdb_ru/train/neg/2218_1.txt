I admit that my review from the point of view of 2006, almost 30 years after the creation of this film, and at the time of its creation, perhaps it was a brilliant horror film / thriller. <br /> <br /> Beginning on the night of Halloween in 1968, 6-year-old Michael commits the brutal murder of his 18-year-old sister. Michael goes to a psychiatric hospital, and after 15 years he manages to escape and return to his hometown to kill again. <br /> <br /> From this point on, it becomes clear that the film will follow a basic and elementary path that is very predictable. The beginning of each scene is easily predictable by how it ends, while the music for each scene containing Michael (the murderer) is the same throughout the film, thus warning the viewer about the likely events that should follow. <br /> For horror / thriller enthusiasts, compared to modern films, there is a shortage of blood / blood, although I don’t look like the amount shown these days. It was possible to find a happier environment. <br /> <br /> For half an hour in the movie, no scene is unexpected. Shooting for a horror movie / thriller is quite typical for that era, and therefore there is not enough experience for a modern enthusiast. <br /> <br /> The film’s long footage and dark lighting, which creates a frightening atmosphere, are a positive thing for the film. The second positive point will be the character of Dr. Michael, who gives clues about the likelihood of what the story can lead to. <br /> <br /> However, it is clear that the star in Jamie-Lee Curtis is in the infant stage of her acting career and is thus unable to provide a truly frightened central victim. <br /> <br /> I find it difficult to appreciate this film, as it was in his days, but from other horror / thriller films really In the 80s and, to a lesser extent, in the 90s, he is far from a really great movie horror / thriller. <br /> <br /> I suggest you continue and find the classics of the 80s. Hooray!
