I remember watching ATTACK when it first came out and recently caught it again. The science fiction channel works worse, but not by much. The shameless robbery of the Jurassic Park, ATTACK replaces saber-toothed cats with dinosaurs. And they are free, devouring as many extras as possible. CGI is pretty bad, and close-ups of prosthetic cat heads are ridiculous. We get some blood, which helps a little. Wait until you see how the mad scientist who started this whole mess gets it. In addition to Robert Carradine, who has little to do, the cast is unknown. Apparently, this was filmed in Fiji. Good work if you can get it. Reminds me of all those budgetary monsters that were popular in the 80s and 90s.
