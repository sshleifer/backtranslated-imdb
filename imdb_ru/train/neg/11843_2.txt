The fact that the event really happened does not mean that it will become a good script / film. Peter Bogdanovich's “cat's meow” claims that it is based on real events that took place on a cruise organized by William Randolph Hearst. The author paid more attention to the creation of bizarre characters, than he took the time to create a story for the habitat of strange characters. Key moments of the story seem implausible; for example, when Hurst accidentally shoots a producer, regarding him as Chaplin. To base a key element of the story on a person wearing the wrong hat is corny and contrived. The story tries to be a dark comedy, but Cat Meow does not fall into an important part of this equation, comedy. Also not enough sympathy for any of the characters. It doesn't matter who to shoot, who to kill, who is to blame, and who is innocent. There is no strong character to cheer for him. As a result, conflicts are difficult to take care of, and the possible outcome is random.
