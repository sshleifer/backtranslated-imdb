A very “straight” sweet old woman who desperately needs money to save her house and property, grows a “pot” in her house, smokes it together with several old girlfriends and then sells it. This is a story for this modest comedy, emphasizing the absurdity of the situation and some humor that brings the predicament. For most of the movie it works. Humor is not from a ridiculous variety, but it entertains you for an hour and a half, so I think it serves its purpose. <br /> <br /> There are funny moments and Brenda Bletin is interesting to watch in the lead role. But the final really spoiled the “cute” film with offensively bad messages that only the ultra-liberals of the movie world would like to see. <br /> <br /> Like most people, I would prefer a happy ending, too, but it should not be all warm and fuzzy for those who grossly violate the law. Also presented here are typical (1) unmarried children, but this is not a problem and is considered normal; (2) clerics are portrayed as morally weak people; and (3) even a doctor who is also stoned! <br /> <br /> Hello? Did the reviewers here blow Hollywood? This is an exhibition on how secular society lowered standards in the UK and Europe as a whole. Hey, people: at least, there is a moral trail instead of nothing but Timothy Leary's message “If you feel good, do it.”
