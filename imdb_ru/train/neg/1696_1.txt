I hate throwing out such lines, but in this case I feel that I must: THE GRUDGE American remake is definitely the worst film I have seen in theaters in the last 5 years. There I said it. And now that I’ve pulled it out of my system, please allow me to explain why. <br /> <br /> “When someone dies in the grip of powerful rage, a curse is born. The curse is going to death in this place. Those who encounter this will be consumed by his rage. "This is GRUDGE's premise, and I admit it sounds intriguing. Unfortunately, the filmmakers do not go further. Those who are faced with the" curse "are really absorbed in his rage, and this everything you get. Do you want more? Well, very bad. Some critics and fans point out that THE GRUDGE's only goal is to scare you. The problem is that when there is no story to talk about, eerie images and sounds can come in so far. Directed by Takashi Shimizu, filming George Sluizer and re making his own original film (s), valiantly trying to create an atmosphere in the first hour ?? repeating the same scene over and over, over and over again. It looks like this: <br /> <br /> - a person enters the house <br /> <br /> - something flashes at the camera and / or a strange sound is heard <br /> <br /> - a person goes to investigate <br /> <br /> - the sound starts to sound loud <br / > <br /> - a person sees a ghost <br /> <br /> - a loud cry and / or screeching of a cat <br /> <br /> - black <br /> <br /> Even before the audience is given hint at the plot, the same scenario takes place 5 times in the first hour. The first time was actually somewhat creepy. Each subsequent use became ridiculous as the film continued. By the time the end of the film ended, my friend and I, with a laugh, wondered if this scene would end with a "loud cry and a sharp blackness." We never made a mistake. <br /> <br /> There is no storyline in the film; instead, a series of vignettes are unfolding that confuse the audience. I have no problem with non-linear storytelling, when everything is done correctly. The film goes from a time period to a time period without any rhyme or reason. I have not seen the movie in this state since the opening of the theatrical version of HIGHLANDER 2. And this storytelling technique is fraught with some sort of mystery that the film could have. If you already know that ghosts scared two characters to death, how does it shock when their bodies were found in the attic? And why should we care when the detective tries to investigate mysterious disappearances, when we already know what happened to everyone? <br /> <br /> Obviously, the green second American version of THE RING earned $ 15 million in the first weekend, GRUDGE. Nothing else but a calculated imitation disguised as a real movie. The worst thing about GRUDGE is that he earned $ 40 million the first weekend, and some consider him "the worst movie ever made." I wonder what happens to those who are consumed with rage pay per view GRUDGE?
