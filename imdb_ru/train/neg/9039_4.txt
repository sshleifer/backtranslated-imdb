I suppose a noble effort, but ultimately unsuccessful. Before I watched this movie, I felt that Bartleby Writer was invulnerable. Seeing this, I still do. Unfortunately, I think that only those who have read the story will understand what is happening, and they will be upset because of unnecessary revisions of the film (updated from 1850 to 1970, moving from New York to London). Even the excellent talents of Paul Scofield cannot save what seems to me prudent, but an erroneous effort to remove Melville's metaphysical classics.
