This film reminds me of “Irréversible (2002)”, another feature film with a cruel and radical approach of human nature. I didn’t like the film, but I can’t say that it’s a bad film, it’s just special. I also remind me of “Camping Cosmos (1996)”, where a group of people from a lower class are residents of a camp at sea in Belgium. The same description of people living together, side by side against their will and with all the opposition of characters who do not coincide together. I also thought about the books of the French writer Emile Zola, who was the author of the style that is naturalism. I did not like the film, and I also do not like the people who are in it. They all seem so vulgar, without any simple good taste. One may ask the question why they live, it seems that all of them on this planet are members of a big farce, forced to live against their will. Or you can say: hell in this world.
