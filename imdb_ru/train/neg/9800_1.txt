Mighty Morphin Power Rangers came out in 1993, presumably based on the Japanese television series sentai, which began in the 1970s. Now, being a fan of Japanese action movies and TV shows, you might think that I would enjoy this show. <br /> <br /> You could not be wrong. What worked in the Japanese version was the complete abomination of television with powerful morphine rangers. <br /> <br /> MMPR is based on five teenagers who are given the authority to transform into costumed superheroes with robotic dinosaurs that make up an even bigger robot. <br /> <br /> Now this premise is more far-fetched and more ridiculous than anything in any Transformers movie, but the showâ€™s ridiculousness is often overlooked. <br /> <br /> Two really bad ones followed, and I mean, really bad films are being made, and the actors who played the main role in this series have completely disappeared from the stage. <br /> <br /> If you like, try watching the Japanese TV series Zuranger. <br /> <br /> Also, what happened to the horrible long hairstyles of the 1990s and all the earrings on the guys? It makes them all look feminine!
