My dad is a fan of Colombo, and I always didnâ€™t like the show. I always express my contempt for the show and tell him how bad it is. But he keeps watching it nonetheless. I think it is his right as an American. But my feelings were tuned to the series when I found out that Spielberg had filmed the main episode. It was then that I was grateful that my dad bought this show, which I really can't stand. I looked through his DVD collection and found this thing when I came home from college. My opinion of the series as a whole has not changed, but I gained respect for Spielberg, knowing that he started out like most low-level directors. And it makes a little drop until the big fish comes (get a pun, HA, HA. Like Spielberg did. It's like Jesus before he became a man. Colombo fan than you most likely will like it, although Peter is not enough Falk. I associate this with the fact that this is the beginning of the series, and so far no one knew where to go with him: the perpetrator of the crime instead of the Colombo investigation, as many later episodes would have done.
