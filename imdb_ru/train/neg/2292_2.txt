First of all, I have to admit, Batman: the animated series is the best Batman series to date. We watched it when it was on TV. I did not realize that was the fourth season. In fact, it was not. BTAS ends in the third season, and he had to stop there. <br /> <br /> Why did they have to mess with a good thing. Catwoman and poison ivy now have horrible gray faces. The joker looks scary, it seems that every time they review his appearance, he looks more and more creepy. It seems that he no longer has students, and now he does not even look distantly human (although he is). <br /> <br /> Bruce Wayne is voiced by Kevin Conroy, who makes the best Batman. Although now he looks like a superman. Nothing makes him stand out like that, because they both look the same, Bruce Wayne now has blue eyes. <br /> <br /> Night Wing really need a haircut, please! Alfred has only pupils out of his eyes, he looks more like a character from the 80s. <br /> <br /> I watched three episodes from disc 1 in the series, and I already find that this version is more rigid and graphic (there is blood in each episode). <br /> <br /> If you're a Batman fan: there is no season 4 of Batman in the animated series. They just included this series in season 4 for competitiveness. If they had just released him as “The Adventures of the New Batman,” I don’t think so many people would have bought him. <br /> <br /> Get rid of frustrations and stick with 1-3 seasons.
