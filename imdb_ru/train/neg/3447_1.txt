This is easily one of the worst 5 films I've ever seen. This is not scary or anything that is proposed in terms of plot. This film is painfully slow, and I was bored for almost all 98 minutes. While acting is mediocre at best, the biggest problem is a script that is poorly written, slow and foolish, with no real direction. Sometimes an eerie mood is set only to break some useless line or event. I'm not surprised that the whole cast was sick and torn between shots, they still have to try to digest the horrible script. As a big fan of good horror films, I'm always annoyed that something bad is happening. Save 98 minutes, you will never return.
