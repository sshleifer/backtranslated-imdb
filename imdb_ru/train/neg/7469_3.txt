The script of this television soap opera is so bad that even A. Hopkins at some point had to play as a playwright to revive his scriptwriter-dead character. I don’t know if this was the director’s goal, but Ciano Hopkins smelled nothing but vainness, fear and lack of self-esteem. Perhaps the real Ciano was all this, but why then make a film about him? Mussolini was a little more convincing, and his long journey was closer to the truth. Edda Mussolini was just ridiculous (not because of Sarandon, but because of the powerless script), although she was supposed to be the main character of this supposed family drama. Watch it only if you like the Venezuelan soap opera.
