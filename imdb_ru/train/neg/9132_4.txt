Dr. Fu Manchu’s “Fiendish Story” with Peter Sellers starring as characters created by Sachs Romer is an injustice until the end of Sellers’s career. The plot was very simplistic, and if everything was done correctly, it would be possible to cope well, but instead it was poorly executed. One of the reasons why this film was not so good was a bad dialogue, cheap laughter, intermittent direction and an awkward feeling that the film was somewhat incomplete. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, was really the only thing that supported my interest during this mixed picture. I found the Sellers depicted the devilish Manchur brilliantly, with random lines that would be remembered. For example, there is a scene where Fu Manchu is confused about how the minion is, in which he says: "Oh, you all look like me." I don't want to admit it, but I laughed out loud with this line. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, a handful of strong characters supporting me really caught my attention by people like Helen Mirren as the constable in the back, David Tomilson Sir Roger Avery (also his latest film, not the way to end his career ) and Sid Caesar (who gives a rather bizarre presentation to an Al Capone relative working for the FBI). These characters also made me look. <br /> <br /> The sets were good too. Oriental designs and English society in 1933 were gracefully depicted in this picture. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I advise you to watch a movie if you are Peter Sellers or Sid Caesar's fan. Otherwise, you'd better stay on chewing aluminum foil.
