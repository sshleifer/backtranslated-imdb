The spoiler is lower, but read on, or you will never know the terrible fate that awaits everyone who plans to rent Rodentz. <br /> <br /> On a moonlit night, in a remote research laboratory, there will be a major breakthrough in the field of medicine. have deadly results. A chemical compound that was created to “hunt and destroy” deadly cancer cells has leaked from the hazardous waste disposal system to the basement of the building. Now the rodents participating in the laboratory experiment at the top are not the only rats in the institution that will become modified species. Professor Schulz, a leading bio-researcher, has just determined that the addition of a new enzyme now allows his “hunt and destroy” drug to be regenerated during the period of time necessary to neutralize fatal cancers. When three different degrees of a new mixture are introduced to three different rats, and the rest are poured into the defective sink “Danger of waste”, the shocking side effects lead to a terrible night ..... truly ..... <br /> <br /> Seriously, This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen this year. Everything in it shouts "Low budget!", From the terrible game to the special effects, which are some of the worst I've ever seen. Characters are mediocre morons and behave foolishly, predictably: they walk along dark corridors alone, look for a cat, stumble and fall so that the “rats” can catch them, sit in a small room, etc. <br /> while some movies are cheap, this movie really wins. Every possible angle is cropped, starting from reusing earlier shots, filming the laboratories' hallways from different angles, so that they look bigger (It reminds me - why only two guys worked in this huge building?!?!?!?) music and special effects that can be done on the computer for the children's workshop. <br /> <br /> This brings me to the worst aspect of this steaming pile of manure - the special effects. Just awful. Computer-generated rats look so fake and stand out in every scene that even the most stupid movie lovers could see that they were computer-generated. And this giant rat costume is - Oh my God !!!!!!!! seriously, do we have to believe that a nutty bean kid is a monster? Just a pity ........ On the other hand, part of the blood looks pretty cool, especially considering the budget. <br /> <br /> Actors all sucks. no one associated with production cared or knew what they were doing. I spent enough time to consider, just take my advice, it's rubbish. 1/10 <br /> <br /> About DVD: transmission sucks, sound is demolished, and there is a track on the disc with comments from the director and his two friends, who say they haven’t had anything to do with the film, but were there to ask questions and comment. All three of these primary human mucus do not have such incredible stupidity that they should be institutionalized before they can harm themselves or others. I don’t want to waste any more of your good reader’s or mine’s time, because I’m starting to remember more than I want about this movie ..... DVD rating: 1/10.
