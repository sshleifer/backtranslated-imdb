This British cauldron has one thing: young people look equally good. Older people are arrogant right-wing Thatcherites, whose behavior brings back all the rage of the Reagan / Thatcher era. Young and old, however, the moral in this three-part mini-series is generally suspicious, and no one is particularly good. <br /> <br /> Nick is a young handsome gay man, just from Oxford. This is not decisive for the story, but it has an extraordinarily beautiful head with hair, which makes it much easier to observe this chatter. Nick arrives in London with his friend, whose father Gerald is a rich conservative politician, and looks after his sister Kat while the family frolics in the south of France. They do not inform him that, when upset, Kat is cut with an assortment of knives and other kitchen utensils. Nick is mistaken in his selfish "gratitude" for affection and enters, too late to find out how much they despise him and patronize him. It is inexplicable that Nick has lived in this house for four years, but since the plot depends on this moment, it is better not to question it. <br /> <br /> Although Nick looks at him with pleasure, he is unbearably obedient. His shy submission to rich fanatics soon made me climb the walls. Deeply hidden, with the exception of Kat (she realizes his big secret is in sight), he loves a little anonymous sex only so that we know that he is actually gay. Although this is hardly possible, Nick takes a lover who is even more closed than he. <br /> <br /> Supercilious Tories scorn and insult the two blacks in the film, so imagine the poison that erupts when Nick's sexual orientation is reported in the tabloid. Gerald, truly Tory, became a member of several personal and financial scandals, so the revelations about Nick reinforce his embarrassment. This gives Gerald one last chance to severely condemn the unfortunate boy. <br /> <br /> With the exception of one brief moment of indignation, Nick collapses on him in tacit and tacit consent. Denial, self-hatred, naivety, or ignorance? You decide if you can get through all this without throwing something on the set.
