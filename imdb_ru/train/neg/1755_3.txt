This film is not without charm and also shows some warmth, but ultimately this effort is too vain and too much focused on the main roles. There is no doubt that Mary Tyler Moore knows what to do with all her screen time, but she takes too much attention from the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> Another problem is overloading the clich√© script. A daughter who secretly quits college, an elderly woman who is having difficulty getting a good job (and ending up with a rather humiliating job at first), a sloppy network manager with her performance toys, who is committed to being brilliant in essence, a journalist who adheres to her beliefs, etc There is nothing really bad in this, that is, they are all firmly rooted in reality, but in combination they are too large and leave us with too much deja and too few surprises.
