Ascension is actually a step forward in terms of what was in the original film and in the special effects. Jason Scott Lee A good vampire hunter looking for the earl himself (if you remember him, he was from the movie “Dragon, Bruce Lee Story.”) from the stove. Diane Neal is good as a woman who steals the body of Dracula to find a cure for her dying boyfriend, and Stephen Billington is gorgeous as Dracula himself. Giving a better presentation than Gerard Butler did score in the original film. Roy Shader completes work on the rest of the actors in this film, and he copes well with the role of mentor character Jason Scott Lee. This is the second sequel to the trilogy, and they have a good start. The question of whether the last movie will close the series on a good note right now.
