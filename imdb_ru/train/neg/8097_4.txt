Many critics consider him one of the greatest stinkers of all time (undoubtedly the most smelly in the career of director Brian De Palma). <br /> <br /> Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks) is a smug rich boy whose life is falling apart. when he and his beloved Maria Raskin (Melanie Griffith) go on strike. His story is written by another smug guy, reporter Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis). <br /> <br /> Well, as I said in my resume ... <br /> <br /> What should this film do? It seems that it combines comedy, drama and satire, but this, of course, means little. It is undermined by the unimaginably disgusting, one-dimensional characters that you never want to experience discontent in real life. <br /> <br /> I’m not a big fan of the novel (I started reading it once, but I couldn’t finish it because I didn’t like it), but for me it’s obvious that those who liked the novel consider this film a complete parody. <br /> <br /> Never can it be seen that so many talented actors try their best to give the film below the average some sort of quality and failure. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The problems begin with the fact that we will play the good guy Tom Hanks in a role that obviously should be Compassionate. And the role of Peter Fallow in the novel was the role of the British. Bruce Willis is bad, BAD wrong in this role. What a thought there. <br /> <br /> Alas, even Morgan Freeman cannot escape the film with its intact dignity, being forced to read a lame, tough lecture on “decency” after the climax. /> <br /> This film eventually turns into an absurd farce. <br /> <br /> I liked the collection of talents; for that, I will give four out of ten, but I’m sure some people will say that a much better film could be made from source material.
