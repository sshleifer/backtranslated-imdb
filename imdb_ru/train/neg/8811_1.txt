SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> I watched half of this film, and I didnâ€™t like it <br /> <br /> First reason: boring. Hardly anything happens, women sit and discuss how terrible their lives are and how they have no hope, they smoke weed, read magazines, care for their sick friend and sometimes cut a dead body. Bored !!!! <br /> <br /> Second reason: too much of everything remains unexplained. Many scenes are devoted to a zombie hunter who kidnaps random people, keeps them in a chair and interrogates. Who are these people? How do they learn anything about illegal activities against sick meat eaters? Why does he kill one and release the other? <br /> <br /> In addition, there is this dude, who at first I thought he also had a disease that consumes meat, but he punches his fist through the wall with superhuman strength, suggesting that he is not quite what we initially thought - and did not explain! How frustrating is that? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I find women annoying, the plot is uninteresting, tiresome duolog and non-existent action. Also, the cover is misleading, because it makes you believe that this film will be cool when it is clearly not the case. I rented this film based on some of the reviews made by other people on this site, and although I respect the fact that some people may have liked this film, I will now make sure that I read more than two reviews inland to avoid renting another movie that I regret.
