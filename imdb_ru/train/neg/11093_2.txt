If this film were about a fictional character, the film could stand on its own and be evaluated objectively. Unfortunately for the viewer, the film is based on "facts" that are very unfairly obscured in relation to Ruben Carter. Many of the smaller facts were ignored (Carter was NOT the number one contender at the time of the killings, there is no evidence that he saved a friend from a childhood seducer in his youth), but some larger facts, such as, apparently, being robbed By the decision of Joey Jardello because of the "racist" judges, it is unforgivable for those of us who have seen the fight on tape and totally disrespectful of Jardello. Why Hollywood feels the need to make a hero out of someone who, at best, was in trouble and in trouble is much more than any normal person (who was arrested many times for beating women), it is strange to me. Ruben Carter never considered his actions in the 60s or even now when he refuses to talk to his son, a man whom people can look at. Everyone knows that Jewison can lead, and Washington can act, but why they chose this story as their vehicle is beyond my power. Does Hollywood need a black hero so much that they need to bend the truth in all their biographical photos to make them believable? (Here's a suggestion. How about Denzel playing a movie about yourself? Now it's inspiring.) Given all the inaccuracies in the film, I would suggest skipping this one.
