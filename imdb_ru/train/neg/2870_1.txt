Oh my God! Please, for the love of all saints, do not watch this film! These are 82 minutes of my life, I will never come back. Of course, I could stop looking halfway there. But I thought it could get better. This is not true. Anyone who really enjoyed this film was seriously ill and perverted. Not surprisingly, we Australians / New Zealanders have a terrible reputation for making films. Everything in this film is terrible, from acting to editing. I don't usually write reviews here, but in this case I will make an exception. I only want someone to warn me before I hired this catastrophe
