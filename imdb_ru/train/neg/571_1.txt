I rented it only because I liked the first movie. However, calling him John Carpenters Vampires: Los Muertos is just a trick to get you to rent it. He is actually an executive producer and obviously has nothing to do with making this film (Jeepers Creepers Anyone?) <br /> <br /> The tragic storyline, terrible special effects and Jon Bon Jovi as the least convincing Vampire Hunter all the time. This is not even comically bad. <br /> <br /> As a result, we get a boring, unattractive film with a terrible scenario and an incredibly bad and clich√©d game. It just smells low on budget. <br /> <br /> Avoid like bubonic plague.
