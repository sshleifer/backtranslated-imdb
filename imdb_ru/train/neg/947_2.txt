As a person who survived and still remembers this decade well, if the real 70s were half so funny and (semi) normal, they would have been much more pleasant. Actual children in that era did not behave or behaved as closely as bright and normal as these children. The youth of the country was still under the influence of hippies and drug culture during its entire uprising of the 60s, especially in the department of behavior: irritability, self-righteousness, selfhood - righteousness, childishness, their unreasonableness - none of the characters demonstrate anything of the sort. <br /> <br /> Someone compared them with “Happy Days”, and I understand why: both of them were comedians who took place 20 years before the current time, they were broadcast, and they both offer only superficial cliche images actual eras, not even fully, just showing the obvious things - fashion, toys, music, tricks, etc., and that's it. For those who are too young to remember, or not born then, trust in me, the 70s were not the same as “Happy Days” looked like the real 50s, because “M * A * S * H * "Not accurately portrayed life at the medical base of the US Army during the Korean War, etc.
