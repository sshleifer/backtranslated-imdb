They played it at the Twilight Zone Marathon on July 4, and this, hands down, is the worst episode of the Twilight Zone I have ever seen. It is not completely synchronized with the rest of the series in its tone. Although the Twilight Zone is a rather uneven series, and many episodes eventually moan predictably, this episode was completely inappropriate. Compare this to legendary episodes such as “Stop at Willowby” or “Midnight Sun,” and you will realize that there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton did what he could with such terrible material, and, frankly, it surprises me that someone from his historic comedy growth falls to the level of this episode. Despite the fact that he seemed to be putting some effort into this, he MUST need money ... there is no other explanation.
