This pathetic film is a remake of the 1927 film. They should have left everything as it was. <br /> <br /> What a colossal bomb! Douglas Fairbanks here shows absolutely no charisma. Cesar Romero plays the role of a real jerk, and Bette Grable sings with the refrain: “What am I going to do with this Hungarian!” (Fairbanks) Now let's fast forward to 300 years later, when Grable, who had just married Count Romero, is faced with a similar situation, when an invasion of Hungarian soldiers occurs on her wedding night. <br /> <br /> Romero behaves cowardly and runs until the army arrives. He disguises himself as a gypsy and is forced to remain in the castle when his violin playing gives pleasure to Fairbanks. The ending is worse than the whole pitiful film when Grable meets Fairbanks to tell him the good news - Enraged Romero dissolved the marriage: <br /> <br /> This bad imitation of the film was made in 1948. As Harry Davenport, a veteran of player support who is in it, died in 1949; It must have been his last movie. What a bomb to take after such an outstanding career. <br /> <br /> Walter Abel is removed with him, but he can do little with such a bad letter. Costumes are more like those that come out of the Stone Age. I can't understand what Fairbanks was wearing.
