Noting the cast, I recently watched this film on TCM, hoping for an undervalued gem, as I view many films from the 1930s. It is not a gem - even a semi-precious. Anachronical clothing and a 1930s Rolls Royce limousine immediately startled you. Casting is also strange. But mostly too many stupid and unnecessary plot devices. This film has a lot of good ingredients and a main story that promises, but the ingredients are not mixed according to the correct recipe. It just does not get together as it should. And that's a shame. With some pretty obvious, but minor changes, this could be a very good movie. <br /> <br /> A film about an American dancer (Gene Harlow) who is looking for a rich British husband - preferably from a nobility. She meets Franchot Ton and his boyfriend who live on a Rolls Royce owned by his buddy's employer. Harlow mistakenly believes that Ton is the Lord to whom Rolls belongs, and she aims at him. This early part of the film is a light comedy with no real differences. <br /> <br /> However, Ton unwittingly reveals the fact that his employer is in fact the German 5th columnist on the eve of the First World War, and it was then that the film completely changes its tone and begins to fall apart. Ton and Harlow are married, but as soon as the honeymoon begins, Mata Hari (Benita Hume) shoots him and Harlow flees the scene when an observer accuses her of Ton's murder. (In fact, Ton recovers from his wounds.) <br /> <br /> Harlow flees to France, where he falls in love again - this time with a rich French guy (Cary Grant). Ton, now in the army, and Harlow unexpectedly return to Grant's hospital ward, where he is undergoing rehabilitation after a plane crash. In the next scene, Thon blames Harlow for leaving him because she is, in fact, a gold digger. Harlow never explains that a witness accuses her of murder and her panic! This is one of those unrealistic breakdowns in the plot of the film. <br /> <br /> Then Tona is again associated with the woman (Homeom) who shot him. She is on hand to watch her lover, Grant, test a new plane that Tone delivered to him from England. Incredibly, Hume and Ton also vaguely recognize each other, but simply cannot determine where they come from! So Tone was shot and almost died; perhaps his memory is a little out of order. But how many men shot Hume so that she forgot one of her tags? (It seems that she does not pretend that her memory has failed.) This is inexplicable and unnecessary. Hume should have absolutely recognized him, but let slip when he realized that Ton could not find her. This would be a much better solution to this problem. <br /> <br /> The final is also very unsatisfactory. In the film, filmed in the film, Thon and Harlow conspired to maintain Grand's good reputation, which led to his fraudulent burial as a hero. Then Harlow and Ton will just leave. It is noble to keep the French publicâ€™s perception of its national war hero, but very unsatisfactory as a love story! <br /> <br /> The film suggests itself: Harlow explains that she fled in panic in the face of murder charges; The tone forgives her and quietly kindles his love for her; He then carries a torch for her, even helping her tinker with the crash site to preserve Grant's reputation. Meanwhile, Harlow finally recognizes Grant for his eccentric. Then, upon seeing Ton for the brave and noble man he is, Harlow kindles feelings for him too. At the end of the film, they both reconciled, even working together to rig the appearance of Grant's death. After the funeral of the hero Grant, we see how they embrace and kiss in the fading. That would make a nice little movie. For Cary Grant's fans, it would be even better if Tone did not play the murdered French Cad, and Grant - the long-suffering first husband reunited with Harlow. <br /> <br /> It is not clear that Franchot Ton will play the Irishman living in England, while Cary Grant acts as a Frenchman. This film would be much better if they swapped roles. It would also be more favorable for a film that was supposed to be ...
