If you ever saw this movie, you would know it! If you have not done so and want to watch a classic BAD film, I advise you to watch this film, because it is rated as the worst. So, if you are REALLY boring, rent it. If you want to know what it looks like, here is my little summary: Adam Sandler is hired to work on a giant cruise ship with some Ms Universe models and five other people. Adam does not like the way one passenger gets all the babies, and he tries to take on the vulgar jokes. BUT WAIT! It only gets worse! Youâ€™ll have to rent the movie yourself to see how bad it really is.
