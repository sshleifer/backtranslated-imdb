Best-selling author George Plympton (Alan Alda) takes on the task of illustrating the sport. He should go incognito to the training camp of the Detroit Lions and try himself as a third defender. He is quickly recognized by team members with Alex Karras and Mike Lucci. The whole team finds it amusing to put stumbling blocks into the authorâ€™s determination for the Quarterback for the series in a real game. <br /> <br /> This film makes its debut with Alda, and also helped Karras to leave the bars for the acting. In addition to the Detroit lions of 1968, Robinson's Sugar Ray, Roy Schieder, and Lauren Hutton also joined the cast. <br /> <br /> Alex March directs this story based on the book of Plimton.
