If I hadn’t read the Union Street Pat Barker before watching this film, I would have liked it. Unfortunately, this is not the case. This is actually my kind of film, it is well done, and by no means I want to say otherwise, but as an adaptation, it fails from all sides. <br /> <br /> A tormenting novel about reality living in northern England working class grabbed my heartfelt feelings and refused to let go for several weeks after I finished. I was full of tears, repulsion, shock, anger, sympathy, and suffering when I read about women in Union Street. Fine. A novel that I sometimes felt I couldn’t read anymore, but I’m a novel that I just couldn’t write down. Depressing yes, but absolutely fascinating. <br /> <br /> Movie. Oh my God. Hollywood took the truth and reality of Barker and showered it with a layer of powdered sugar. Great movie, inspirational soundtrack, great performances, a tale of hope and romance ... yes. Union Street Adaptation ... no. <br /> <br /> Union Street women and their stories are combined in the image of the Funds, their stories are affected, but many are discarded. I agree that some of Barker's stories are sensitive questions and too terrible for mass viewing, and that a film with about 7 leading characters is simply not practical, but the content is not my main problem. The essence and real intrigue of the novel is lost - darkness and rain, broken windows covered with cardboard, and the graphically described stench of poverty is replaced by the sun, beautiful houses and William's shimmering point. <br /> <br /> If you liked the film because of its positivity and hope in the face of “reality”, I advise you to read the book without hesitation, without first preparing yourself for something more like the Schindler's List .. but without a happy ending.
