Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. When did Hollywood ever make a successful film that attacked Republicans? Why they do not study. Dixie chicks do not have. These left-handers live in their elite bubble, interacting with each other; not paying attention to the fact that most of America is much more to the right than they are. <br /> <br /> The best Hollywood productions are not partisan and rarely political. <br /> <br /> Dan Akroyd Cheneyâ€™s imitation was bad. <br /> <br /> I would have thought that Kewessac could find the best films. <br /> <br /> It was not funny.
