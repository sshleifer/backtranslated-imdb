Somewhere in his popular science book DANSE MACABRE, Stephen King suggests that one of the secrets of writing scary stories is not to show your readers what a terrible thing is waiting for them outside the door to get them. If, finally, the door swings open and a ten-foot-high beetle bursts through it, the reader may be a little frightened, but he will also think: “Well, I can handle this. At least it was not a hundred feet tall. ". There is nothing more frightening than what is hidden, invisible and unknown, just on the other side of this tightly closed door, waiting for you to grab. <br /> <br /> “The Hunt” is so completely mistaken that the director Jan De Bon more or less begins his film, metaphorically opening this door himself and shouting: “Look, everybody, look! This is a ten foot bug! Isn't that scary ?! ”The law of diminishing returns immediately takes effect. By the end of the film, the director, so to speak, jumps up and down, insanely knocking on his CGI pots and pans, and hoarsely shouts: “Look, everybody, look! Ten hundred feet tall beetles! ... And now, here and a hundred thousand mistakes in height! "<br /> <br /> The filmmakers apparently believed that special effects alone could compensate for all the other shortcomings in this undertaking (and there are many). They cannot and do not. In fact, no matter how impressive they are special effects so persistent and intrusive that the distant viewer begins to look at them - in admiration or irritation - instead of plunging into the story. <br /> <br /> For me, the nadir of the sheer stupidity of this film comes when the statue , from which "blood flows" out of his mouth, tries to drown Liam Neeson (like a dock Torah Marrow) in the fountain. The filmmakers clearly did not know what to do with this supposed idea as soon as they got it, so they just beat Neeson in the water, waving their arms and soaking up in themselves. The next episode is a kind doctor, apparently wiped out and, hmm-ha, forgot everything about the annoying incident. Roman Shirley Jackson seemed stunned by this ridiculous scenario of a low-intelligence adolescent stunner committee who thought that the way to scare people was to make each effect bigger and louder: “Ok, then letting yte make the ceiling look like a creepy face and sank down on it ... and all these spiky things, like, lured her into a trap in the bed. "<br /> <br /> The only saving grace of HUNT is that it finally becomes so terrible that it is actually funny. By the time Owen Wilson (as Luke Sanderson) fell to the floor, and then I went to the “Magic carpet to go to death”, I almost fell to the floor, laughing. <br /> <br /> Poorly built, insane Grotesquely heavy, incredibly incredible and filled with awkward dialogues and meaningless scenes, this senseless ghost is an example from a textbook on how not to shoot a horror movie.
