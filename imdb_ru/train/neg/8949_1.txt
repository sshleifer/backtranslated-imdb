A few weeks ago, I read the classic novel by George Orwell, 1984. I was fascinated by it and thought it was one of the best books I read recently. Therefore, when I rented a DVD, I was intrigued to see how this adaptation is measured. Unfortunately, the film did not even come close to creating the atmosphere or the development of the characters that Orwell did so skillfully in his book. It seems that the director thinks that everyone who watches the film read the book because he is not trying to demonstrate WHY the characters act and feel what they are doing. John Hurt, the main actor, is fooling around to the end and barely plays to the end. We will never know what he does, why his love is forbidden, what the political climate is and why the main character wants an uprising. This book cannot be made fair in the form of a film without proper narration and explanation of the political system that oppresses the characters, and the fact that they are absent is the greatest drawback of this film. In addition, John Hurt was a terrible choice of actors, he looked about 15 years older than 39-year-old Winston, whom he was supposed to portray. On a more positive note, however, the rest of the cast was well chosen. It is a pity that they were shot in such a badly adapted film with the wrong leading actor. Brian O.
