I see what the director was trying to do, but he didn’t hit the target. The main actor was really good, but editing around his moments takes you out of it. Camera work, that is, lighting and exposure, is a kind of amateur that I could forgive if the direction was smoother, but it is not. The sound was a bit strange, and it also takes you out of the movie. I can see that this director will be a little better in the future, so don’t immediately, but don’t expect the DVD movie to be almost as good as 28 days later or something like that, keep your expectations low. and you will get more of it. At least it was only an hour and a half. Oh yes, and besides what you played, it was pretty bad if you asked me. But I'm a snob at the movies, so take it for the fact that it's worth it.
