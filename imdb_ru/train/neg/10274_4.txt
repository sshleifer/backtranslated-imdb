In Texas, seven friends meet in a bar to celebrate Halloween night before they go to a party. Meanwhile, they call on the radio station "American Nightmare" for fun and confess their inner fears. The serial killer who listens to their confessions makes their nightmares come true, killing each of them in a sadistic way. “American Nightmare” is a strange low-budget film, which has a terrible start: without any preliminary explanations, a woman kills two couples in an isolated campsite, as if it were Friday the 13th. Then the story goes to a bar where seven friends celebrate Halloween. From this point on, the story has enormous potential, and the unknown cast has very reasonable characteristics, also showing beautiful breasts and naked bodies, as is usual in this type of production of C. However, the end of the script does not provide any explanation for the murder instinct and the motives of nurse Jane Toppan, creating the feeling that the budget was over before the survey was completed. With a better start and conclusion, this strange story will be a good movie with a low budget. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Agony” (“Agony”).
