Someone here actually compared this movie in a sense with noon. Now this is a real piece! I'm a big fan of Sinatra, including some of his acting roles, but maybe the only person who could play this role would be Don Notts. First, as someone pointed out, Sinatra simply does not have a physique for a western imitator of a bad guy. He is just too weak at the moment of his life. Perhaps he was about the same height as, say, Odie Murphy, but Murphy had a rather strong constitution. Sinatra is a large talking little child that no one should take seriously. <br /> <br /> This story is not inspiring and not trustworthy. I do not want to spoil it, but I think that the end and how the citizens react in this story does not make any sense. Another thing is that these people constantly allow themselves to be completely "bad guy." It's just a small town, so I do not attract attention and do not understand why people allowed themselves to dominate in this way. <br /> <br /> There is a “love interest” in the story, and if I understood correctly, she was upset when the main character refused to recognize who he was, so that some other bad guy would not kill him. Now there is true love for you. 'Stand up for oneself! Tell him your name to kill you! Lol Stop you killing me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the main premise of the film is not good enough, and no matter how they tried this story, it had no logical way, except in the trash, Want to know why it’s not in the video and never not shown on tv? The critics apparently did it in 1956, and they were right - this film is pretty bad. I would almost argue that Sinatra paid someone to get him as deep as six. <br /> <br /> Do you want to see a good western where the city stands against the bad guy? Try Tension at Table Rock or At Gunpoint - two really very good westerns with this theme. Johnny Concho - Johnny Stinco. Frank, you were the greatest singer ever - but you did not participate in such a film.
