Frank Sinatra was far from an ideal Western actor. He was a great actor, “From here to eternity” and “A man with a golden hand” is a confirmation of this, but he did not have the physique of a western hero, you recognized him as a city guy. But he tried to do his job well in Johnny Concho, the fact that the film failed at the box office was not his mistake. I blame two factors on this: a) the story was too unusual, especially that Sinatra behaves more like a villain than like a hero throughout the film. In a genre where people, as it were, expected a certain template to break away from it, the film must be very good. b) the story is not convincing, it is hard to believe that the whole city will allow Sinatra to do whatever he wants, just because they are afraid of his brother. Also, when a person shows him a special holster, which opens from the side, so that he does not draw the weapon, you are surprised that if this makes him invulnerable, then why didn’t the shooters accept him? I think that this film should not have been made, because any film with Sinatra is worth seeing, and despite its flaws, it is still pleasant.
