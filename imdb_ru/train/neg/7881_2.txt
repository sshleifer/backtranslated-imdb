This film is a portrait of half-spastic teen Benjamin, who has to attend a boarding school because of his lousy marks in mathematics. Previously, he did not get the best experience in life and had serious problems with self-esteem. After a hard start at his new school, he starts making friends, falls in love with a girl and makes some American pies for teenagers. <br /> <br /> In addition to some elements of comedy, the film is told very seriously. focusing on Benjamin and his problems. <br /> <br /> If you don’t like this outline of the story already, save your time and see something else. If you do, please keep the following in mind: <br /> <br /> 1) Benjamin is a complete loser. Whatever he does, he does it terribly wrong, and then all the time goes to self-pity. For me, he was not such a “charming loser” to whom you can feel sympathy and laugh. Instead, he and his behavior really annoyed me, and with my own youthful years, not so far behind, I could barely look and look. <br /> <br /> 2) The film hardly tries to be realistic, and the story seems to be just from my experience of the characters simply not (except for Janosch is possible). And yes, I know that this film is based on an autobiography written by a 17-year-old child, but having experience working with German schools and German youth, I do not believe him. <br /> <br /> 3) The screening of a film about sexual arousal is really important for a film on this subject. But I doubt that teenage boys arrange a “Ejaculate on Cookies” contest, where everyone must dislodge cookies with sperm during mass masturbation in the forest, and the loser must then eat cookies that are wet with sperm. Although it amuses me a little, it is neither funny nor underscores the serious attempts of this film. <br /> <br /> 4) There is a story about the family of Benjamin and his father, betraying his wife - yet, I don’t know why he is there and where to put him. I'm just bored. <br /> <br /> I personally hated this film for having the character of Benjamin, without the message, the concept, the scheme, whatever, and the attempts to fail are dramatic and serious. However, I can imagine that some people may find it sensible and touching. If you liked “Another Sister,” you will probably like this one too. I hated both. <br /> <br /> 17-year-old boys should not write an autobiography, and if they do, it seems not a good idea to make a film out of it. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10.
