I watched the first 15 minutes, thinking it was a real documentary (with an annoyingly overly dramatic “on camera” producer). <br /> <br /> When I realized that all this was done, I thought “why should I waste my time watching this stuff ?? So I turned it off and went online to warn other people. Characters do not act plausibly. too many immature emotions. for a guy who traveled halfway around the world in war, he behaved like a child. and I do not believe that it is because "his character was very upset because of the explosions in the mall." <br /> <br /> Very trite and stupid. <br /> <br /> Have you seen the “city of the lost?” children "? A French dark fantasy film about a guy who kidnaps children and steals their dreams ... I liked it!
