I recently watched Johnnyâ€™s test, trying to find humor in it. I failed terribly. The cartoon network usually tends to make its shows enjoyable to all viewers, but Johnny Test is "entertainment" in its lowest form. The letter is incredibly predictable, and running plugs are not very fun at all. Kids will love it, that's all. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that everything is bad. The original initial theme was actually quite memorable, but for some reason they took her skeleton and, figuratively speaking, smashed it with a portable aluminum bat. This is a shame, because it was really one of the best achievements. <br /> <br /> Some characters can theoretically be very interesting. After a little work, the characters may work well together, but they are too one-dimensional. Again, this makes it easier for children to follow. <br /> <br /> The pace is also too fast. Episodes are too busy, leaving little time for clever writing. This is a real shame, because there are so many interesting concepts in the show. On the other hand, the fast pace will not allow children to lose interest, and this is really a whole audience. <br /> <br /> In general, the show looks very good on paper, but just does not succeed in being funny or interesting. This is a show that I like, but I am not capable of that. Just so much potential that is not realized. Kids will love it, but that's it.
