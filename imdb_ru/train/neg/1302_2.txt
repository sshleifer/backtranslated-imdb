This film is similar to any other Dutch film, so if you like films such as Turks with Fruit and Blonde Doud. then you may be fine with this (even though these two have much better stories and actors) Zomerhitte becomes strong enough, but even one good scene ends up having nothing to do with the storyline. There is a lot of nudity (but I and others just could not find this girl attractive), the dialogue is ridiculous (as we did much to irritate other viewers), and some scenes are so random that it is rather an unintended comedy than anything else ( a random scene in which an owl snatches someone's eyes ... it has nothing to do with something, and is referred to it only once in a sentence saying: "You heard what happened ... I was here") . the only reason I gave him 2 is because some of the places they are in look good ... that's all. And the reason I saw it was because we went to the preview (here in Holland, we have a strange preview system, you pay less money than a regular movie, and you donâ€™t know what the movie you will be watching. All you know is that this is a new film that is not yet in theaters). My advice: stay away from this movie if you really want to watch a good Dutch movie, see temmink or zwartboek.
