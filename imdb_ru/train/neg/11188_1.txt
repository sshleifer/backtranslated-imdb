This is really the worst movie I've ever seen. Ever Period. I actually paid Â£ 3.50 to watch this smoking movie. An incredibly boring, poorly acting, horrible script, often incoherent and too many scenes that seem to have nothing to do with a common movie (for example, when priest partner Heath Ledger was nailed to the wall by a ghost ... what's the point in this scene ? Answers on the postcard, please ...) <br /> <br /> I should get a medal for keeping this film for the whole time. I would prefer to make a strong blow to the groin than watch this movie again. <br /> <br /> This should be thrown into the bottom hundred IMDb. I hope my 1/10 voice will help him in this.
