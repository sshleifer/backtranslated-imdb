This is exactly the Saturday matinee, which I loved during World War II. I was less than ten years old. And this is the audience for which this series is intended. Looking at it now, one must roar at his incompetence and stupidity. The budget must have been almost nothing, given the shortcuts and repetitions. Actions? Well, these are photos of the Republic, 1944. They read the lines ... and, no doubt, they had to be made convincing. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars.
