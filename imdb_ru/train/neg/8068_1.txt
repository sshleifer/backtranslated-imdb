I did not have HUGE expectations from this film when he rented it for $ 1 in the video store, but the box, at least, showed a small promise with its “killer reduction” “more blood! More sex! "There can not go wrong! Well ... needless to say, a box is a scam. How in Aida did actors and actresses of this level subscribe to such a low film? <br /> <br /> It all starts with the fact that a drunk college student leaves the brotherly home or another similar building and says something like that. useless shit for her boyfriend (?), because the camera on the bad steadicame follows her. Then some dude in a transparent plastic mask pursues her, and the other grabs him. They cut her wrists for no particular reason, and when they "cut" her, you can see that someone drew cuts with something like chalk. <br /> <br /> From there, repeat the same topic about the persecution of the girl. / killed by two guys for another 84 minutes. Add in one shot tits. This is "Surviving Souls." <br /> <br /> I wouldn’t have problems with this film if the box hadn't been lying to me on the set of the film. If I make a bad film that claims he has more violence and sex ... I want more violence and sex! One full frontal shot after 85 minutes from the chick, which is clearly androgynous and bleeding, which does not frighten the child, does not cut it. If it is a killer cut, then what is a theater cut ?! Of course, I doubt that this garbage was actually placed in theaters in the first place. Shame on the actors in this movie. I could see that they will debut here because they have not done anything before, but they were all created before it was released. I do not know whether it was filmed before they were all created, and the studio sat on the film until they became semi-loud names or not. But what do I want to know ... did they really spend $ 14 million on this film ?!
