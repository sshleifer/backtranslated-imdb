It is written S-L-A-S-H-E-R-S. I was happy when the main character flashed her boobs. It was quite difficult. Before and after this film is largely blowing. The game is similar to the electronic list, and it is well shown in the film. Not to mention the fact that the budget is so low that the same person plays in Preacherman and Chainsaw Charlie. The whole movie looks as if it was shot with a video camera, and not half a decent movie. The only reason I liked the movie was that Charlie and Dr. Ripper's chainsaw were funny. They said a lot of stupid things that made me laugh. In addition, if you see this film in Blockbuster, do everyone a favor to hide it behind Lawnmower-2. Anyone who considers this a good film should be evaluated mentally.
