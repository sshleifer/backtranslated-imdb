Hell, I thought I saw some bad westerns. Can't top it yet. Damn it, I would prefer my eyes to be stitched to use Trinity Three for crying out loud. I don't think I can watch Ben Hur again without laughing at my ass. Just very bad. <br /> <br /> But hey, if you like dumb westerns with recognized stars, look at the Shoot Out with Gregory Peck. It's just as bad, but much funnier. 1/10
