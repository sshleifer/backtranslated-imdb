I do not know what kind of film it is, director Sam Mraovich somehow messed up almost every little aspect of this film. Normally I would say that this is a film that should not exist, but this film may be the most important of all time. This film should exist for the sole purpose of being "The Worst Movie that has ever been made." I have seen bad movies in my life, but it somehow breaks down what I thought was bad into something much more difficult to imagine. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is funny, but the funny thing is that Mraovich himself believes that this is a great movie. <br /> <br /> Wow ...
