The images are gorgeous and well reflect the landscapes of Canada. On the other hand, the story was pretty boring; In my opinion, it was a love story in the forest, just like Titanic is a love story on a boat. I did not feel that the Gray Owl was a great environmentalist. I usually like Lord Attenborough, but this one was ... bad.
