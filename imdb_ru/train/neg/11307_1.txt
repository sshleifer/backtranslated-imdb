Totally stupid weapon. I think the guys dancing at the beginning of one of Stephen Segal's films intended to mock Jeff, who makes his forms, to dance music at the beginning of this stupid movie. The plot is predictable, the fights were fair, and Jeff plays as well as the sofa, which he hits with some kind of weapon in one scene.
