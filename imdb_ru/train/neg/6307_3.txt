I will give him 3 just because he showed the story we need to know about to prevent it from repeating. I agree with the comments of a gentleman from the UK. The film was pretty awful. All cliche, no real story. Historical and technical inaccuracies abound. Check out the technical specifications of DE 529 or any class Destroyer Escort class Everts, and you will understand what I mean. Now I have a black month of history in the United States, and I will be called a racist just because I say this, but the history of this ship is not that great. They did some maintenance work, pursued the "submarine", which turned out to be a ram, which they rammed. Sorry, but black people did a lot more in World War II than this stupid movie. This movie makes them look like whiners. Let the name start, I can handle it.
