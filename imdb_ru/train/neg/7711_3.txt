The heart of this film was in the right place, no matter where his brain was. <br /> <br /> “Attack” is, in fact, a fake a la “Airplane!” (two years before the fact is good.) What happens when vegetables, or in this case fruit, attack. <br /> <br /> Through all kinds of cinematic magic (stop motion, papier-mâché tomatoes on skateboards, reverse shooting, people watch tomatoes off-screen, people throw basketball-sized tomatoes at actors on the screen), tomatoes really attack all in their leafy hands. <br /> <br /> Then, it’s up to Mason Dixon (Miller) and a group of spies that I don’t want any government to support this day. Of course, there is an interfering reporter (Taylor) who appears at the worst of times, an army soldier dances and sings, Japanese scientists have voiced voices, some guy carries a parachute and a samurai sword with him ... and oh yes San Diego Chicken, than he became big. <br /> <br /> Fun is not so good. In fact, you could make up for yourself better after watching these. Some dialogs are very bad (“Please pass the ketchup” - not to say in front of the tomatoes.) And as for “Sexual love” ... well, I can't blame the tomatoes for shrinking when they heard it. <br /> <br /> What's good about this? Well, I liked the theme song and the opening credits, and there was a four-person scene at the same time that was pretty well done. ... that's all. <br /> <br /> Three stars. Not the comedy "The Assassin," but she tries. <br /> <br /> Rock on, Peace.
