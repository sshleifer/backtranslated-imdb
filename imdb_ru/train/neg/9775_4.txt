Excellent performances and artistic direction do not make a good film. This film is so gloomy and depressing that I do not feel any joy from the “happy” end associated with the union strike. Attempts at humor related to Lake’s pregnancy are absolutely catastrophic, and any film with the participation of Brother Baldwin already has a blow to it. The positive thing is that Lang is still one of America’s greatest underrated actors, he alone almost justifies this in a VCR. I give it 4.
