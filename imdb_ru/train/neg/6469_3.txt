When I was younger, I thought that the first film was really good in childhood, so I decided to watch the sequel. This is an example of why some films should not have a continuation, because the first film is usually the best, and it is. In fact, now that Ariel and Eric are married, they have a daughter who is not allowed to leave the house because they are worried about Ursula’s sister (the villain with the octopuses from the first film) Morgana gets to her. When the child leaves, she asks Ursula’s sister to turn her into a mermaid, as her mother did. This forces Ariel back to the sea to find her. Those artists with a good voice, it's just a story that you could think of. Adequate!
