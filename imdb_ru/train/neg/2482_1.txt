(Spoilers abound) This is an absolutely horrible movie. First, this guy is from the middle. I guess he made a career playing super loving dads. It was normal when he first tried to scare his son, pretending to be a monster ... but after 10 minutes they did it again! And so on, this movie moves in agonizing real time. At some point, I began to imagine that it was a few days later, until I was reminded that the storyline was only the next day ... still early afternoon! I'm not quite sure who this pair should be in real life. First of all, they are represented as some kind of Manhattan yuppie couple who grew up and gave birth to a child. But they drive an old blue Volvo. These types stopped driving Volvos decades ago. Today they drive Prius. But in 2002, I’m sure they still haven’t traveled to Volvo. <br /> <br /> Okay, then there is the Wendigo. "Mysterious Indian Man" gives the boy a little magical statue of Wendigo and tells him about her powerful magic. C'mon ... we still do ancient Indian riddles. Just to take him home, they move around each Indian statue in their tourist trap in upstate New York. American Indians are depicted in a way that has not been seen in this film for decades! Oh, and about the Wendigo. In fact, he is not the cause of horror. He does not kill the father of the child, which is the most terrible thing in the film ... he is simply killed by an ordinary hook with a grievance and a powerful rifle. Wendigo comes out at the end of the film just to avenge the guy who killed his father ... oh, but wait, it seemed that Wendigo was kind of angry at his father, perhaps because he killed a deer ... so then Wendigo he must have been happy that his father was killed ... but ... <br /> <br /> And so ... offensive, boring and pointless. No reason to watch this movie at all.
