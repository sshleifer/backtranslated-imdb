This movie is terrible. The story concerns a woman who is trying to figure out what happened to her sister. The film struggles with its personality, moving from noir / thriller to erotic, with elements of horror added for good measure. The film has a very complicated structure, for example, with frequent use of memories without linking them to the story. The plot is poorly designed, and due to the characteristics it was difficult to distinguish who is who and the role they played. Some improbables exist in many films, but the scene where the protagonist willingly accompanies the virtual stranger to his house and then agrees to go upstairs alone (to where he says he will find the phone), minus the gun she brought with her, call to the police, it was too hard to believe. Part of the cinematography is very bad: we watched on a 42-inch TV, so anyone with a smaller set could understand what was happening in scenes shot in almost complete darkness, outside of me. Overall, a chaotic mess.
