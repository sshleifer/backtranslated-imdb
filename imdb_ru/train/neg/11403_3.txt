I love horror movies, low-budget, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s ... but how can anyone think that this is a very good horror film? let's compare this with titles in similar movies about haunted houses. Ghost, changeling, radiant. or for a horror film based on similar technology, which was FAAAR better, (though still FAR from the great) Demon Seed. Well, I'll be honest .. let's compare this to the horror movies made for television! Do not go to bed .. WAAAA terrible and better done. The site in Salem, the night stalker, the night gallery, did not even go to the basement or to the hut on the farm, were much better. * SPOILERS * First of all, for such a good scene as there was a bloody scene in the shower, you have a scene similar to the opening scene ... oh boy! A garden hose comes to life to curb some frisky teens! FEARFULLY. besides, just what we understand about the house ... he apparently needs to use his video cameras to see what is happening, and this is a very emotional house. is not spirit, or demon, or essence, a house that is “possessed,” but with what? Are we led to believe that an inanimate object has learned to love Suzy / Margaret, our main character? now that i'm on the topic of suzy .. another scene that totally worried me, this poor old crazy lady comes, says that she was your nurse, pours out her heart, falls into the boiling pool, tormented in agony for 45 seconds and What is Margaret doing? Does she risk burning her hands to save this poor old woman who came there to warn her life? No, she stands there and looks! the action was for the most part better than the average for a horror movie, but the positives end there. at least a more interesting and funny horror film about an inanimate object that kills people who watch the death bed: the bed that eats. I have a feeling that people who rated it so highly either didn’t watch it from the very beginning, or remembered that they were frightened like children. this film was pretty much dignified.
