Damn, what the hell were the people who shot this film? And more importantly, where can I get some? The opening scene sets the tone for the film: a woman squirming in a circle of fire turns into a werewolf. And this is not the transformation of Rick Baker in the "American werewolf" guys. We're talking about some of the worst cosmetics ever captured here. I can only imagine that some tiny Italian is putting glue on nude Annick Borel (who plays Daniel, the main character of the film (this word?)) And asks her to roll her fur. That's how bad it is. <br /> <br /> From now on it does not get much better. Minutes are wasted when the scenery, in which the male actors are chewing, hesitates around Daniela and her condition or something like that (I don’t remember, but the dialogue is so bad that if you don’t laugh at it, you will cry). <br /> <The funny thing is that Daniela isn’t even a werewolf, she’s a nut that comes to life when there is a man next to her (understandably, as she was raped as a child), so she thinks she’s becoming a werewolf, like her ancestor introductory scene). She can not help but tear off her throat from every man she meets, and she only wants to be loved! Daniela begins to look for things when she meets and falls in love with a stunt lover who does not cause her "episodes". Look at the photomontage, one of the funniest you’ve ever seen (laughing and hugging after diving with your head through the window). <br /> <br /> Daniela’s luck doesn’t endure, as the film takes a violent turn, she is suddenly severely beaten and raped by a group of thugs who kill a stuntman. Recalling: "I spit on your grave," Daniela takes bloody revenge on her rapists. <br /> <br /> This is 100 minutes of my life, and I will never come back. But hey, this is a game that you play when you're a movie fan.
