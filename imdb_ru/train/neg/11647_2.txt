CRIME CRIME sent to Alberto De Martino; Italian crime drama, partly shot in Hamburg, Germany. An easy to forget movie. Even with a good chase after the car, this flick seems almost aimless. New Don captures a powerful mafia family and begins to fight for their lives. Unwritten laws and ethics of the mafia code make it difficult to trust anyone, especially when millions of dollars are at stake. Cruelty and violence generate the same in response. It can not be put on the shelf with real gangster epics. Just the sight of the film brings back memories of American travel. Even the popular American actor Telli Savalas cannot raise the level of this criminal drama. Antonio Sabato also stars: Paola Tedesco, Guido Lollobrigida, Serio Tramonti and Piero Morgia.
