I finally saw INCUBUS after waiting more than 20 years to see it, and, of course, it was not worth waiting for all this time to see it. Incubus is a horror film whose number is small: an invisible killer / monster rape and kill women in a small town. <br /> <br /> The film looks like this: the film begins with a murder; then blah blah blah; more blah blah blah; then another kill; even more blah blah blah; continuing with blah blah blah; another murder (amazing, eh?); blah blah blah, etc ... <br /> <br /> The film is completely predictable from beginning to end. Even the silly “big” red herring used throughout the film will not convince a five-year-old child. And I found out the secret identity of the incubus at the moment when I saw the character, therefore, when the “shocking” surprise came, I was not shocked or surprised. In fact, it was so funny that I continued to laugh a few days after watching the movie. This is so stupid! <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is so in quantity that the sequence of the “rock band” is one of the few highlights in this dull film. This scene stands out not necessarily because it is good, but because it is funny and meaningless: the movie shown on the big screen depicts a moment like a rock when a guy in red leather pants is cutting his obviously artificial long hair. it is edited with scenes of a girl who is being attacked in the restroom of a cinema incubus. The best I can say about this film is cinematography that I really liked. But beyond that, there is almost nothing worth mentioning about INCUBUS, except that it is unintentionally funny.
