This film is wasting almost all the talents of an actor in what might be softly called a “bowler hat”. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that it opens up an exciting “Top Gun”, a lot of stereotypes and unexpected situations go away from each other, until you try to choke on popcorn. <br /> <br /> In this film there are so many dead-end plotlines that I guessed that in one of them it was created by combining the rejected television series. <br /> <br /> The role of the Mexican drug lord Quinn is ridiculous, and his "colleagues" broke free from the 1970s Quinn-Martin police show. Costner's character is wooden and gives us no reason to believe that he really fell in love with the wife of Mendes. We are also not convinced that the wife is eager for intercourse and will jump the first hot body. <br /> <br /> Definitely a movie “B” at best and a huge waste of time for all participants.
