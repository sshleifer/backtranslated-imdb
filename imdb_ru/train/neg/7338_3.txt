I watched this movie, hoping to find a cute and interesting story, but the storyline was not good at all. The acting was no better. <br /> <br /> Of course, there was Shah Rukh Khan, but it was not enough to make this film “trustworthy” and interesting. <br /> <br /> I read that this film is based on Flaubert’s Madame Bovary’s novel, but I didn’t see it fit the Indian mentality. <br /> <br /> In general, we buy a film to dream and a good time, so as not to waste time and change our mood for the worst. I just can’t understand how he could get such a “high” voice on average 6.8 / 10. <br /> <br /> So this is a movie that you have to run away and ignore because there’s nothing to appreciate in that! You will simply waste your time if you do not like the “dark cinema” with a “strange and meaningless story.”
