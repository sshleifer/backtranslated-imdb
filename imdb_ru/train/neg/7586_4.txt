Summer Holiday is Eugene O'Neill's forgotten version of Ah Wilderness, and this is a well-deservedly Broadway musical adaptation of Take Me Along. With the exception of the Stanley Steamer song, none of the other Harry Warren-Ralph Blaine songs are worth remembering, and even it is questionable. <br /> <br /> It was after the release of this film that MGM released Mickey Rooney, and I don't think it was a coincidence. The film was shot in 1946 and released in 1948, so Mickey was 26 years old when he played Andy Hardy as a teenager. He was too old for a 17-year-old teenager who worked on radical ideas in the spirit of youthful rebellion. <br /> <br /> Rooney made four films for MGM from 1946 to 1948, this one, Killer McCoy, remake of Robert Taylor’s novel “The Crowd Roars”, “Love Laughs at Andy Hardy” and “Words and Music”. In all of them, Rooney played an adult role. Even in the Andy Hardy film, Mickey played the adult Andy Hardy, who returned from World War II. Why he was in this Louis B. Meyer only knows. <br /> <br /> Rooney’s poor cast makes the Summer Holidays even worse because in the original film “Ah Wildlife,” the focus is on the character of the father played by Walter Houston. And in the Broadway show Take Me Along, which won the Tony Award for Jackie Gleason, the Great played his drunk son-in-law Uncle Sid, played by Frank Morgan, and this is the central character. <br /> <br /> Gloria DeHaven joins Judy Garland as a cute and charming friend Rooney, and Marilyn Maxwell plays a show girl who gives Rooney an adult education. In the original play, O'Neill uses her as a prostitute, but it was the Hollywood Codex, so all Marilyn does is inspire young Rooney. <br /> <br /> Many really talented people had a hand in this alone, and they do their best, but the Summer Vacation disappears rather quickly in a cold autumn.
