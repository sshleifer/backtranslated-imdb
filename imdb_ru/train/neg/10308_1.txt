This is really very bad. Llamas show how a minor actor does its job. But what is worth seeing is the scene where OJ angrily grabs the guy by the throat, as if he wants to kill them, while the jukebox plays the song with the lyrics “I got evidence from you!” (Makes me want to hear the rest of the lyrics - attributed David Gregoli and Leslie Oren, but I could not find it in iTunes). Talk about looking into the future ... Too funny for words. The rest of the movie is forgettable. The score and the songs are more interesting than the script. Just continued. Which shies away from the question of why they would make a sequel at all. As I understand it, overseas sales lead to a lot of these films. Not much talks about viewing habits in the world.
