Twenty minutes after this movie, I was already bored. Simply put, these characters were pretty boring. Sometimes something pleasant happened, but then everything slowed down again. Fortunately, my patience was ultimately rewarded, and the end of this film was not at all bad. However, this was by no means good enough to justify sitting for the first ninety minutes. So, I would say that the film as a whole was mediocre, and, given all the talent of the actors, I would call it a disappointment.
