I was attracted to watching this movie because of this plot and my desire to see the horror. <br /> <br /> To my disappointment, it turned into a comedy rather than horror. The acting, the dialogue and the course of the film were very poorly made. Much of this made no sense. For example, at a party about 30 people, and they are all horrified by one person, despite the fact that they are in a secret place, and they all look like healthy young people, and the guy who threatens them sounds haggard. I kept thinking, maybe it was a parody of another film, such as “Scary Movie,” but they tried too hard to make it look terrible - an emphasis on trying. <br /> <br /> Blood and blood are also poorly made. I have seen Halloween costumes look more believable than this. A guy with a severed head ... looked clean - the missing signs of bone, flesh, blood, and even the head. A strong downward blow with an ax on the corpse should plunge into something ... it seemed that the guy was swinging a bat instead of an ax. <br /> <br /> Revealing who the main villain should have been. but contradicted other parts of the story. What was going to happen on his mind? If there was to be a turn, you should at least create it by adding mystery and uncertainty.
