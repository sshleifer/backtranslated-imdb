It reminds me of when I was a born-again believer who was going to become a minister. I never thought that I would become a minister or even finish high school, because I was almost sure that I would be raised to heaven before that happens. That was before I discovered that Christianity was a bunch of garbage. Now I am an atheist, and this only proves that the doctrine “once saved is always saved,” as Christians tell us, is no more real than elves. If this were true, then why did I leave after I became a believer, a born-again believer? Yes, I really was saved. I prayed that stupid sinners would pray with all my heart. <br /> <br /> If Christians read their Bible, they would find that their god believes rape, genocide, abortion, and many other atrocities are in order, he said. They may be surprised to learn that the word "delight" is not mentioned anywhere.
