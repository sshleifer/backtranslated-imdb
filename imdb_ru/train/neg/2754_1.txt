My original review of this film was simply the word sh * t, written 2000 times. Although it was a very accurate criticism, I felt that my review should be a bit more descriptive. <br /> <br /> I will start with the main actress; her expression does not change even once in this film, she does not show fear, happiness or depression. Her skills in body language are to look left and right and look like she doesn't know Jack. She - insensitive husk, which, I think, was too much Botox. However, her lack of facial expression throughout the film surpasses the sad love affair with the lead actor, who seems to come out of nowhere and make them go to the beach and fall in love for several hours after meeting each other. The main actor, whose hair requires more attention than he was, was mediocre at best and never made me feel that he was really in danger. <br /> <br /> The only thing that leads the disgusting action is the director, the plot and the inaccuracies in the plot. I saw a tampon advertisement with a larger structure than in this film. There is no development of character, they just seem to say and do things in which I would never have believed what a real person would be. <br /> <br /> This film would not be bad if he tried to be nonsense on purpose, like snakes on an airplane, but he tried so hard to be a serious fighter that I could not even laugh. I believe that I have a brain tumor now, when I watch this film and think through various ways that I could use this budget and the cg command to create something much better. If I bought it on a DVD, I would break the DVD into pieces, burn it, and then dissolve it in hydrochloric acid. Do not watch this movie!
