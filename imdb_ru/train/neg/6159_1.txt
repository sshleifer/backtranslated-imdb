Why does anyone who has seen this film consider it his duty to tell us if they are fencers? This point of view is completely irrelevant for any argument against this full film dog. <br /> <br /> I think sports films fall into two categories; well-made films about the human spirit and competition, as well as At the Sword. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this film could never decide what it was, a touching drama for trying to be the best in life, a charge of competitive motivation or martial arts. In the end, it did not do any of them convincingly or completely to make me take care of all this. <br /> <br /> For the record, I'm also a fencing instructor (and now I'm officially as bad as the others). But using bad fencing in a movie does not automatically make it bad. I mean Star Wars (Episodes 4-6, good movies, poor fencing). I liked these movies. But when you put a bad sport in a bad film for some reason, people think that it is only purists who consider it an unsuccessful effort. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by any comments on the lesser fencing issue. This is just a bad movie. After all, there’s nothing in this film for a fencing enthusiast, movie lover, or just someone with a pulse and three brain cells. <br /> <br /> When I watch a movie and have to think: “Man, I’d if I watched Mighty Ducks. I know it's time to get around the argument with the theater manager to get my money back and see if there is anyone in the lobby who will somehow give me back two hours of my life.
