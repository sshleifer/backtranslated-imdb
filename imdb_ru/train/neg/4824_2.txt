I wanted this movie, but many elements destroyed it for me. Using a fisheye lens and intermittent editing did not give me the feeling that I was in the world of metaphysics, but made me think that I was watching MTV for a few short minutes. Cinema was never shown, and acting was a really great example of excessive playing. I love movies that give us a glimpse of an ominous underworld, but this film could not decide whether it was a bad horror movie or even a more serious commentary on the horrors of drug addiction.
