I used to think that movies require plots or some other way to make you take care of the plot or everything that happens. This film showed me that you really don't need anything like that. <br /> <br /> I can summarize, just like that. But IMDb wants me to have more lines. That was pretty sweet. not convincing in the least. The way the characters talk in the film makes you think that this should have happened in a few days, but there is no time, and Iâ€™m sure that all this will happen in an hour. <br /> <br /> If you want to have fun, buy a gallon of milk and see how quickly you can drink it before you vomit. It would be much better to use your time. The time you will never return. Jurassic Park 3 was shot better than this movie.
