Liongate has yet to prove itself. Every movie from Lionsgate was terrible. I tried and tried to give them more opportunities, and they just keep hitting me again and again. And Cabin Fever is definitely no exception. <br /> <br /> I couldn't even pay attention to most of this film, it was so disappointing and bad. <br /> <br /> Here is the plot.
