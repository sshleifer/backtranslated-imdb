In the devastated desert of the future, humankind is terrorized by cyborg - robots with human traits that have discovered a new source of fuel: human blood. Under the command of their evil leader Yob (Lance Henriksen), the cyborgs are preparing to catch up with Taos, a populous outpost. <br /> <br /> Only one force can stop Yobâ€™s death march - the cyborg Gabriel (Chris Kristofferson), who is programmed to destroy Joba and his army. <br /> <br /> In the ruins of the plundered village, Gabrielle finds Nea (Katie Long), a beautiful young woman whose parents were killed by cyborg ten years ago. Now she wants revenge. They conclude an agreement: Gabriel will teach Noa how to fight cyborg, and Noa will lead Gabriel to Taos. <br /> <br /> Five-time kickboxing champion Katie Long has all the right moves in this speedy adventure. It delivers a lot of action. Also stars are Gary Daniels (like David) and Scott Pauline (like Simon).
