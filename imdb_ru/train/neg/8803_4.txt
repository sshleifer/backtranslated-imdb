I loved the “Lead; The legend of Ron Burgundy "and hoped that it would be just as fun, but alas, it is not. Some bits are great though. I thought that the sports guy Champ Kind, who professes his love for Ron Burgundi in a car filled with other members of the news team, was hilarious. Everyone ignores him, and he grows louder and louder, and finally kisses Burgundy, which also does not receive recognition. But overall, the story is not a gel. However, this is a noble attempt to save the unused fragments from the first film, including the whole story about some pretty cute potential domestic terrorists called “Alarm Clock”. Maya Rudolph from Saturday Night Live is one of the participants and has some funny lines, but basically this unused storyline has good reasons to be unused in the first movie. The additions on this CD are pretty good, the best two are rehearsals shot with many improvised comedies, and the false commentary with Will Ferrell and the “executive producer” that Ferrell discovers early, was not even part of the film any way, form or form. It turns out that he is “just a guy” who went through the side door of a recording studio and pretended to be a producer. These are pretty funny things that last about 10 or 15 minutes.
