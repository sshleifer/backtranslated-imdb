The truth is that the film based on the novel by Harold Robbins will not receive any awards. This is no exception. "Lonely Lady" is a pure B-picture in the budget, the cast and performance. Technically, it looks like a movie for television. The game is very uneven. Joseph Kali is especially terrible. Anthony Holland is an embarrassment. As one reviewer said about the specific work of Katherine Hepburn, her range varies from A to B. Miss Sedor manages to get to G. The rest of the cast is solid (and wasted in her respective roles). Lloyd Bochner and Bibi Besch deserved better. However, all this can be a very fun way. As befits Robbins, everything revolves around sex and nudity. If you are looking for some fun ... and you are not too sober ... it might be for you.
