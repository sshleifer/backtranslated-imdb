I'll keep it as short as possible, because this piece of shit hardly deserves a mention. Zombie 90 is one of the worst films ever made - right there, with another terrible Snaas recording - ZOMBIE DOOM (also known as VIOLENT SH! T 3). These films are so bad that everyone who participates in their creation needs to be shot. I somehow managed (barely ...) to sit through ZOMBIE DOOM - but ZOMBIE 90 is so terribly incapable - even compared to the other terrible movie Schnaas - that I had to rewind everything in the first 10 minutes. Zero acting skills, inept blood, terrible work in the style of a video camera, ridiculous dubbing ... it all goes on and on. I really can't find a single thing redeeming this garbage - and usually I can find SOMETHING redeeming only in ANY film. This is really one of the worst films ever made - you were warned ... 1/10
