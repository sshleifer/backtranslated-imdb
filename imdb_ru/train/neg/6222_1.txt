I'm not sure if users should be allowed to watch movies after only half of them have been sitting, but I’m afraid I just won’t be able to tolerate a minute. <br /> <br /> If this is an unwarranted excuse for a film not I will not have a deceased great therapist like a wheel in his grave, then I doubt that anything will work out. <br /> <br /> The excellent review above “Not a movie for Parsons fans” sums up most of my feelings. How dare (a second-rate) director and writer try to do something that they are clearly not capable of. What were they thinking about? Where to begin? <br /> <br /> SCENARIO: I thought I would get a piece of sweet bitter America. What I got was a poorly executed farce without a single cliche. Silly hippie? Check it out. Stupid fat cop? Check it out. Horrible stories? Check it out. Awkwardly written female characters? Double check. Complete disregard for the story you are trying to portray? Check it out. <br /> <br /> After a while you realize that what you are looking at is soap, and not very well written. Scene with Knoxville. Scene with an ex-girlfriend. The scene with Knoxville, who did not move on. The scene with the former girlfriend, who was a bit like the last. And so on ... <br /> <br /> DIRECTION: My friends and I decided, after some thought, that watching was like watching a bad episode with Quincy or, perhaps, with especially poor dukes of Hazzard. That's how bad the direction was. Terrible jumps, terrible camera work, clumsy entrances and exits in scenes. God, it was very worthy. And then I discovered that the director was an Irishman, whose most notable recent work is a very lousy BBC drama on Sunday night called “The Monarch of Glen” (believe me, this is the lowest common denominator of TV). And then it all made sense ... <br /> <br /> CAST: We are so critical that when some random guy from television decides to play, if he’s not so bad, he stinks, do we welcome his efforts? Knoxville JUST ONE manages to get through each scene. Poor Christina A. has no such luck. Her performance is a car accident (although I don’t know what you are doing with these lines). "Hippies" in the hearse: oh dear, dear, dear. Didn't we go further after Cheech and Chong? <br /> <br /> I could continue, but I think you understood me. I would say that, as mentioned in other reviews, no one in this film gives the devil for The Byrds, The Flying Burrito Brothers or for Graham's solo work. They did not know anything about the American road film and, of course, they didn’t give a damn about attempts to do anything with a generally recognized worthy story from rock mythology. This film was shallow, nothing was explored, and it was too unfunny from start to ... oh wait, I didn’t quite finish it. And I suggest you stay away too.
