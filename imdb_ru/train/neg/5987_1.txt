I really didn't like this movie. The plot was very predictable. Typical American plot, sorry. The guy gets the girl after all. Is there a monorail in London? Bank of London ??? The Bank of England is what it really is! - I, however, liked the look of Tracy Island and the Thunderbirds themselves. And the British were villains? (except Parker and Lady Penelope) What happened to this? Oh, and they kept saying things like “So go“ Thunderbirds ”” - but it was never known as “Thunderbirds” in the series, why is that so ?? I would like to see it converted in 20 years with a lot of British cast. I preferred the original series. Sorry!
