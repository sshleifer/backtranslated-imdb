Yes, the theme is a direct quotation from the film, and I think that is pretty accurate. I was so bored to death with this meaningless effort. All flashes, etc., that do not make sense after the first 20 minutes - this is simply a bad film making. + If you suffer from epilepsy, you would have died at least five times. Of course, all David Lynch fans raised the flag so that this type of turkey was “the best movie ever created” because it makes no sense. And when it does not make any sense, it must be art and art. Right? I say WRONG. This kind of artificial art is just a pathetic way to show that you are a good director. Anthony Hopkins as a great actor should just keep playing.
