*** Possible spoilers *** <br /> <br /> When I saw this today, I had some expectation of how it would be, not too high, but not too low. Although it was not at all what I expected, but it seems to me that the filmmakers could not decide on which film to make. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, this is somewhat mysterious. and quite exciting, but it will soon change to some funny scenes - very obvious scenes ... As I looked further, I almost fell asleep a couple of times. <br /> <br /> The ending is the funniest of all though, almost a splash / comedy ... <br /> <br /> I don’t say that he doesn’t have any good scenes, it’s just that the film never becomes “whole”. <br /> <br /> 4/10 people movie
