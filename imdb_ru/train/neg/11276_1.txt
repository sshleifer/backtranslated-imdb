I will not spend my time writing anything else about how every aspect of this film is indescribably bad. This has already been done in great detail, many times. The “plot” began as a very boring cocknichon with a wide guy / gangster by numbers and very quickly sank into a complete mess. Anyone who pretends to see some hidden masterpiece in this terrible mess is just joking. It's been 7 or 8 years since I watched him for 1 week at the cinema before he was shot, and yet I remember him as the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I’m just making these comments, and, really, the only reason I went to watch a movie was the funny fact that my brother Eddie appeared in it as the second “heavy” one on the pub scene. It was his hands that stuck the Zippo lighter in the face of Ris Ifan in a bar in “Russia” (in fact, it was filmed in the former Butlins camp on Barry Island). My brother has absolutely no acting experience - he recently joined an extras agency, and this was his first part. After watching the film, it turned out that no one needs any acting experience. <br /> <br /> I remember that there were about 8 people in the entire cinema - and that was only a couple of days after it was released. I have never heard of another movie that would be so unpopular and disappear so quickly - and rightly so. If you are thinking about renting this movie on a DVD, I would advise you to put two pounds of coins into the fire instead, until they are red hot and then put them in your eye sockets. It will probably be much less painful than watching a movie.
