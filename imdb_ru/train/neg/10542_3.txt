Detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) has big problems. The serial killer, Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober), for whom psychic psychic Tess (Tracy Griffith) helped him catch, resurrected with the First Force (.. given to him by Satan after being executed in a gas chamber) and may be the body of the weak. Somehow, Russell, who joins forces with Tess (who understands what they are facing), will have to stop Channing, otherwise many women will continue to die from his bloody hands. They will seek help from her sister Margaret (Elizabeth Arlen), who tried to inform her superiors in the Catholic Church of the First Force, but was denied access to a weapon that could stop Channing .. a cross with a blade that can penetrate Channing's Heart saves the world from his evil. She will still take it and extend a helping hand to Russell, who will need all the help he can get when Channing kidnaps Tess, preparing her for some kind of satanic ritual / ceremony. <br /> <br /> In the film Michelty Williamson, always a reliable actor playing an important role, gets a partner in the role of Russell ... so you know what happens to him. As in films of this type, everyone around Russell dies, but when he tries to kill Channing, he simply kills the weak owner of some other poor soul that he possesses. <br /> <br /> Clean occult trash .. silly from Gates to the finish. Phillips and Griffith will try, I will give it to them, but in this situation they have no chance. Kober, who, as a rule, is always always effective as a heavyweight, is really nothing more than a stupid villain, jumping in the air and throwing up rotten slander.
