Let me start by saying that Casey Affleck is a very talented actor, and I really respect his work. I would like him to be in more films that have demonstrated his talent. With that said, the film “Surviving Souls” was a very, very bad movie. Very bad. <br /> <br /> I would have to say that almost all the blame for the bad script. Affleck is a very talented actress, Wes Bentley played a prominent role in American Beauty, Melissa Sagmiller coped well, and Eliza Dushku is currently the most beautiful girl in Hollywood. I do not think that any of the actors really entered the script, and I understand why. To say that this film belongs to the horror genre is an exaggeration. He did have twists and turns, which you expect, but they simply led to nothing ... except for more confusion. I just found the ending very anti-climatic because it seemed to make no sense or really answer any of my questions about the storyline. <br /> <br /> I would like to give this film a good review, but I can't. Honestly, the only thing I think you will find scary in this film is that you paid for it.
