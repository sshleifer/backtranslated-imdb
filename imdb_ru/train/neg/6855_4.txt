Why can't a woman be a strong character in a film without having slept with a lead man? The campaign manager in this film wants to bring Tom Sellik to the White House. That's all she can think about. So why on earth did she have an affair with him? He added nothing to the story and served only to humiliate successful women. The only value of this tidbit was the sweet scene "we were all sleeping with your husband." <br /> <br /> Besides, couldnâ€™t the people who shot this film could watch the national conventions they forged? Speech between the two main political conventions only showed their complete ignorance of the process of nomination and selection.
