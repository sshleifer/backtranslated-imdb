This is undoubtedly one of the strangest films of the 70s, and he is best known for launching a decade of snowman hysteria. This is also noticeable with small strokes of madness throughout the film, especially when the dark, capricious first half is replaced with the MUSICAL INTERLUDE of all things (as noted by another user, one of the songs is dedicated to the character, Travis Crabtree, who for some time canoe, ... leaves to never see him again). Despite the fact that now it is terribly outdated, I am still a funny and scary film that should be shown to children, and anyone who likes the knowledge of Bigfoot or the village culture of the 70s will definitely get pleasure from it. My favorite part: the guy is so scared that he bounces his head through the door (!?), And the narrator explains that he lost consciousness from the "shock." Well, I would say that breaking the door with my head - most likely, he lost consciousness, but whatever. <br /> <br /> 4/10 stars or 7/10 if you like poor Americana.
