I entered this film, expecting it to be like the Matrix or Pi. Boy, I was wrong. Yes, in the film there is a poorly written, poorly played plot (with loaded animated cells and peptides). However, the real focus of the film is the “experienced” talking heads, spewing a new era that feels good between the segments of the plot. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is pretty innocent. First there is some real quantum physics. For example, it says that electrons exist both in the form of particles and in the form of waves, and that the atom is basically an empty space. However, the film makes a giant (and unscientific) leap, saying that subatomic quantum effects also occur on a large scale. Talking heads make it even further. According to them, the following is true: <br /> <br /> - When Columbus arrived in the Caribbean, the natives could not see his ships, because their minds were unable to perceive something so different. -Meditation can reduce homicide rates. - With a positive thought, you can walk on water. - Your thoughts can change the formation of ice crystals in water bottles. <br /> <br /> And this is only in the first 40 minutes! <br /> <br /> Watching the movie was torture. This film was like a film that will show you to join the cult. Having done my homework, I realized that basically it was just that. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it can be considered as an obscene comedy (although not funny). <br /> <br /> Save your time and money: do not watch this movie.
