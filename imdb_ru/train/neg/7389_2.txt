I buy or at least watch every Seagall movie. He came out with a handful of good movies, then plunged into bad stories, bad camera work and insightful persona, he almost lost me. A few films ago, he remembered how to make a decent film. Now it is forgotten again. This film is seriously dark (at any level you want to name). There are a lot of slashes and disagreements here without any visible purpose, unless they are intended to warn the military. <br /> <br /> Sigall may have replaced many of his scenes, as it was often too dark to say, and someoneâ€™s voice was used most of the time. Unfortunately, the only interesting character was a bad guy who killed his guard to escape from custody, and then continued to cause chaos everywhere. Okay, since when do we put an armed guard in a room with a prisoner? In any case, this bad guy was at least colorful and very focused. There are a lot of blood if you like this king of things. It seemed to me that the bad guys each time tore the same wound. I'm just glad that they didn't suck the blood out of their unfortunate victims. I am returning you to my resume. In fact, this is a horror film disguised as an action movie. December 6,206
