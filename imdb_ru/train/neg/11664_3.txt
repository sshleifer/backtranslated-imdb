I wanted to enjoy this movie so much. He moved very slowly and was just boring. If it was on TV, it could last from 15 to 20 minutes, maybe. What happened to the story? The great cast and photographer worked on a faulty foundation. If it is loosely based on the life of the director, why did he not make someone see that the letter itself was “free.” He then directed it at a snail tempo, which may have caused a few people who nodded during the film. Music takes off, but for another film, not for this ... for the saga “Soap Opera”, perhaps. There were times when the dialogue was incomprehensible when Armin Muller Stahl spoke. I was not alone because I heard several screens about who told what to whom. Why can't Hollywood make the best films? It had a great story nugget, but it was just poorly executed.
