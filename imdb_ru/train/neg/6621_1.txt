Something somewhere must have horribly gone wrong, just at the time when the director perceived this plot. The film, which was supposed to be a remake of one of the most beloved films in the movie, can not be used in all aspects of filmmaking. The best of the artists also could not find the settings that simply show that the film itself was a serious mistake. <br /> <br /> Editing leaves much to be desired. Direction is crap. Acting out of this world (oh my goodness)! Characters who need to look scary make people laugh at the stupidity of their dialogues and costumes. <br /> <br /> I would not have watched the movie, even if someone had paid me the cost of the tickets or even gave me a free burger with it.
