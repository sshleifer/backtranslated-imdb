I watched the whole movie to the shameful end, although I was so angry at what I saw. I felt that the director demanded attention, and the only way to achieve this is to be as disgusting as possible. Since I live in the UK, I have fallen in love with this country, but this film depicts the British youth in a worse way. You will not say anything, but avoid it, it will make you angry and hurt. People should be ashamed.
