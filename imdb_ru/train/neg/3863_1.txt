Wow. This is about as much as I can say right now. Who writes these things? Who produces these things? What self-respecting actor would agree to "act" in this material? Oh my God! I don’t know how I coped with this film, but I guess that the fact that I had 8 cups of coffee that day was a key element to keep me awake. Oh my God! It was one of the most unexpected and predictable works of cinematography I have ever seen ... and, for information, I NEVER plan to "testify" this again. <br /> <br /> I first saw the movie when I bought a DVD (ERROR # 1). I mean ... I get it, hey! Julia Stiles. I like her. She's cool. I'll watch it as soon as I get home (ERROR # 2). I tried to watch it, not moaning every five minutes, wondering when this pile of shit would end, though I did. But I did not succeed. It was one of the worst things I have ever seen. I mean ... what about the thing where he imagines what is going to happen and then returns to real life? It was rather annoying when my father did this in “Parenthood”, like ten years ago. "Jokes" - and BELIEVE me, it takes MANY to me to call them - stupid, characters banal and forgotten, the storyline is completely predictable ... in general it makes a movie that BECOMES THE HISTORY OF RECORDS! I should have thought that something was wrong when I realized that I had never heard of this movie. Most likely, it was just a DVD. <br /> <br /> For those who might think about watching this movie, I have one tip. DO NOT! For the love of God ... NOT !!! I am ashamed to have it in my DVD collection, and I can't get rid of it ... No one, and I mean that NO ONE want to buy it from me! And I'm talking about second-hand and second-hand charity stores that buy dirt from your shoes and hide it in a shop window. This should let you know how CRAP is.
