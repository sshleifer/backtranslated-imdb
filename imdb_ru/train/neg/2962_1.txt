Dinosaur movies can be fun. So can the Whoopi Goldberg films. But Whoopi And Dinosaurs? <br /> <br /> After the first 20 minutes of Theodore Rex, I came to one conclusion: this film is evil. Angry, nasty, angry and reprehensible, despite its audience. Nothing bad has been done by chance; This is the visual equivalent of a torture chamber. <br /> <br /> First of all, Whoopi doesn't make good action films (see “Fatal Beauty” if you think I'm lying), but the filmmakers don't. anyway - she's a tough cop here again. <br /> <br /> Have you seen a million movies with your buddies this week? Well, here is the number one million and one, mate. <br /> <br /> Don't you like cute, humanistic animated dinosaurs since Spielberg’s television series was shown about them? Sorry, here's another one, and he's a cop too! <br /> <br /> Are you one of those people who hate car chases, gunfights, casual dialogue, boring futuristic FX and see talented people (Goldberg, Mueller- Stahl, Roundtree) stuck in a movie that looks like tax write-off? GREAT tax deduction? <br /> <br /> And you read this review to the end. You deserve a sequel. Seriously. <br /> <br /> No stars, no none. And if they really make the continuation of Theodore Rex, Hollywood deserves an attack on a whole herd of dinosaurs made of foam rubber with clever cracks. <br /> <br /> Now I will pay for it.
