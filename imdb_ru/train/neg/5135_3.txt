I think it's scary stuffed, so it's a pity that they are no longer in this film. <br /> <br /> A group of robbers makes an emergency parachute from an airplane into a huge field with stuffed animals. One of them disappears from the prey, and the rest pursue him when he is pursued by inexplicably evil effigies. The game - hammy and stuffed animals are not impressive (when they move). On the positive side, the director gets some anxiety from static stuffed animals. Alfred Hitchcock says: “A bomb explodes under the table, and this is amazing. We know that the bomb is under the table, but not when it explodes, and it is not known. ”
