This film is very boring and pretentious. There is only one good moment when a sailor shaves Mr. Barney's eyebrow (think that a purple dinosaur is without pretense). Music is inexorably closed - it is sad that Bjork, a man with such great inner beauty, was brought to a pretentious lie in his art. The magnificence of the tea service makes a beautiful ritual empty. mythology and culture are not respected in this film, they are shot. Not only from Japanese culture, but also from another director ... (stay tuned) At the perfect moment, "art imitates life" - the crew of the ship finds a giant piece of shit. What the audience found in the theater. There are some sets that are very sophisticated and adept without a heart - then get ready for spoilers - I'm talking to you, Mr. Barney. <br /> <br /> The emperor has no clothes! Mr. Barney, you are out! I saw the holy mountain Yodorovsky. And your thin, fake BS curtain has been lifted. You stole your images, your style and your catalog of artwork from this person. Now that HOLY MOUNTAIN is released, FINALLY, let's hope that the forces that will be on the artistic councils of the world stop financing you! Poor Yodorovsky - lost the financial battle with the Beatles lawyer when he acted in Lennon / McCartney. And by the way, while Jodorowsky is a Beatle - you are a monkey! Cheap thin soulless robbery liked only frivolous freshmen from college. And by the way, I'm a director. If you are interested in making a film about reality - I will legally fight with you in the ring, defending Yodorovsky, for you, defending outright theft.
