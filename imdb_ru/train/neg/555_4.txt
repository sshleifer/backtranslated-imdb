The film is quite confusing and funny. The plot is terrible ... but on the other hand, the acting is pretty good, with a few good screams and scandal. This time, Sharon Stone is all right ... not even as good as it seems. The killings are not as bad as the first, and that is a shame. This is not the unpredictable mess that everyone is talking about. Sex is pretty vivid at times, while others are clear that it is fake (they are fully dressed). The script is weak in most cases, but the scenes with banter and disputes between Dr.Glass and Washburn are bright. The plot twists several times, but the ending is terrible. Voltage is always constant with a huge spoon, "My God!". The chase sequences are brilliantly directed, and the cameraâ€™s frames and views are impressive and lend a bit of classiness to the film, which is felt in a hurry. Sharon Stone is also a bit old for that. The pieces where we see her breasts were, first and foremost, a delight. This time they are too terrible to describe. The films themselves are pretty average, but worth it. Mainly because the film deserves some good buzz ... with the opening sequence being the highlight. Not to be critical, but if you liked the first - leave this one. Do not destroy running. You will be glad you left this stone on the stone.
