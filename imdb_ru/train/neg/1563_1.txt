I watched this film on Sundance 2005 and was stunned by how bad it was, although, based on the description of the catalog, I was excited to see it. Presumably, the "exemplary" of two high-school students filming a documentary about life in high school, he showed a bad game, bad direction, the complete absence of attractive characters in the form in which they were written, and everything around is a complete collapse. I like good movies about high school, and this is not one of them. The characters are one-dimensional and deliberately "cool", although they must be outcasts. You get the general impression that a group of people sitting around doing something deliberately making a bad film to show their friends, but somehow he got into Sundance. Mysterious.
