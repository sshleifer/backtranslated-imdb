This film was so amateur that I could hardly believe what I had seen. This is videotaped! NOT a movie! I haven’t seen anything of the kind since the beginning of the 70s, when night networks showed the movie “Horror” of the week, shot in ...... video. It looks like a bad soap opera, and this is a compliment. Some actors do their best. Michael Des Barres does an excellent job with what is given to him, namely, sexual addiction out of control. I can not say that it is a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> Nastasya Kinski, while the therapist sits in the chair almost the entire film, with very little change in camera angle. I can't blame her for someone bad blocking, but she is absolutely incredible in her role. Her little girl's voice works against her here. And I consider myself a fan of Nastasya Kinski. She is, of course, ageless and exotic, but she is beyond her reach. <br /> <br /> Alexander Paul is terribly exhausted. Each line it supplies has three exclamation points. Someone must have ordered her to scream at any cost. Why would Michael Des Barres want to have sex with such a wild obstinate? <br /> <br /> Finally, Rosanna Arquette, like a sweet and wicked wife, comes off, and is probably the most plausible of all. But this does not mean much. <br /> <br /> This must be the worst movie I have seen in recent years.
