I liked it, I really liked it. Please do not think that I am an idiot, but I must admit that I liked this movie. I expected it to be crap, it was crap, but sometimes you can relax and watch a crappy movie that you don’t have to concentrate on too much, do you? I did not expect any hidden meanings or morals, and they did not exist, but it doesn’t matter, because I only watched it for entertainment, and it entertained me everywhere. These films explain why Ben Stillers (with the exception of "there is something in Mary") and Vince Vaughn (although you write his name, I did not bother to check) work. You can watch a crappy movie, if you don’t expect too much from it, and I, for example, get up, run, maybe run, but don’t drive because I don’t have a car, Blockbuster Video or even a choice, and rent a bunch of these toilet comic movies and stay for one night watching them. Good afternoon, reader. If you don’t say that this comment helped you, then I don’t like you, if you say it helped, then God bless you, you will go to heaven.
