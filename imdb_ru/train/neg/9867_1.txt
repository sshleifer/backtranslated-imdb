I saw a screening of this before last year's Rewards season, I really didnâ€™t know why they distributed them after the end of the voting, but whatever it was, at least to expose, but the film was a messy mess. Of course, some parts were funny in the style of black humor, but none of the characters seemed completely real to me. There was not a single person with whom I could contact, and I think that somewhere I did not succeed. Of course, the plot is somewhat interesting and very undermined for Scientology, WOW! What a great idea ... let's see if it has already been mined to such an extent that it is useless. All the ordeal seems fake, from the lighting, the casting, the script to the terrible visual effects (I think it must be intentional, like everyone else, although no one laughs at you). In any case, I hope that it will be sold on DVD, at least I would not want the project, in which many people put a lot of effort, to be completely unnoticed. But it is anyway. Boring meal in this.
