“Alarmist” is so terrible that you think for yourself why on earth such an energetic actor like David Arquette agreed to be in it. It must be one of the weakest plots I've ever seen, and without any humor it borders on a tedious face. It staggers to a terrible conclusion, which seems to happen only because the director was bored and he just wanted to finish quickly to get home for dinner. Stay away!.
