Seriously, what is it? Hooper made classic films like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, then he made this terrible movie, what happened? Is he too deep in the crack? This movie is about some dude named Sam, who has the ability to set things on fire (Firestarter, anyone?), The acting was terrible, the plot was rubbish, and the special effects were extremely rubbish, they looked like something from 70 x Van Damme should be pleased that Derailed is no longer the worst movie, and what happened to the finale? he began to glow in blue, turned into a glowing blue drop, swallowed the fire of his girlfriends, and the film ended. WHAT WAS IT? BUT? When the film ended, I hoped that the DVD would spontaneously burn to save me from my pain. <br /> <br /> STAY FROM THIS FILM. <br /> <br /> DO NOT THINK, OBEY, thank me later.
