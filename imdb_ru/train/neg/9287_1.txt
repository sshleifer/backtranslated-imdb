BLIMEY! Why would anyone do a continuation of a already rancid movie? Half Past Dead was a bad movie, but at least he had an idea of ​​what he wanted to be. HPD2 has no idea who he wants to be. It simply exists on the screen for reasons that I cannot explain. Spoiler: The whole movie is as follows: Twitch (played by Kurupt from Tha Dogg Pound) is transferred to another prison where a box of golden bricks can be buried. In prison between rival prisoners, a riot broke out, one of them was shot by a guy named Cortez, and Cortez plans to escape him. During the marital visit, the bride Twitch and daughter Burke (played by Bill Goldberg) were abducted by Cortez and kept in the execution room. Burke is reluctant to make friends with Twitch, and they end up in trouble with the idiotic prisoners, learning that Cortez has his close ones. <br /> <br /> Opinion: This is the most unnecessary continuation since Universal Soldier: The Return. The script is terrible, the game is terrible, the dialogue is a joke, and everything in this film is a caricature. Look, I know that it was a low budget film, but this is not a reason for these guys not to make efforts for what they are doing. No one in this “movie” believes in the characters they play. No one in this “film” can be taken seriously as an actor. Couruptu should be ashamed of himself. His character “Twitch” is basically a puppet without a spine, who spends most of her time posing, being exhausted by Burke or other prisoners. Bill Goldberg spends most of his time pouting throughout the film, as if he were to receive a doctoral degree (a rather large dump). The fight scenes are poorly set and pitiful, and for an action movie the HPD2 is pretty boring, even when the action takes place! no one will tell you that this film is somewhat decent, it stinks and is the main reason why people despise Follwood.
