After I looked at Koyaanisqatsi two or three dozen times and loved his every second, I finally got a chance to see her sequel Life In Transformation. I was really disappointed, as he almost did not meet the high standards of the first. 90 minutes of people with baskets on their heads is not my idea of ​​a good movie. Philip Glass's assessment for this had neither beauty nor the corresponding strength of the first. Compared to Koyaanisqatsi, this film seemed slow and meaningless. The branched version of Baraka, which is the same idea, but made better. I sincerely hope that the third film in this series will not follow the example of this waste.
