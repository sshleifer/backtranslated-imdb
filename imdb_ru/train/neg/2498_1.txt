Sorry that I stated the obvious, but some films are good and some are bad. Of course, there are extremes in these two broad categories. Films like The Godfather, Saving Private Ryan and Star Wars are conveniently placed in a good category. At the other end of the spectrum, there are films that simply do not deserve to be mentioned by name. However, sometimes someone makes a really awful movie. A film that should be highlighted as a demonstration of how horrible a movie can be. A film that is more than bad. Such a film - "Girl's Journey". <br /> <br /> In short, “The Maiden's Journey” is a story about a luxurious cruise ship that is captured by a gang of evil criminals who demand a ransom from a no less evil, intriguing ship owner. Of course, there is an all-American hero aboard, complete with a chiseled jaw and a sculpted chest that saves the day. <br /> <br /> This production opens up new depths. Everything about this is bad. Acting, directing and the so-called plot are incredibly poor. In short, it is an insult to the intelligence of any unfortunate viewer. Even the American viewer will be unhappy with his shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is so bad. <br /> <br /> I will not allow the temptation to compile a list of things that angered me about this film. Nevertheless, his stupid conclusion should serve as an adequate example of what I mean. <br /> <br /> Imagine that you are an evil hijacker and are in an open lifeboat in a calm sea, you are in company with a hero who is holding a bomb. Said the hero throws you a bomb and dives overboard. What would you do? I do not know about you, but I would have dropped the bomb as far as possible at sea. Not this guy. He watches our hero float away and then tries to disarm the bomb with an unfortunate (for him) result. Enough said. Such a demise deserves a mention on the Darwin Awards website, and may also be a suitable end to the life of the production team.
