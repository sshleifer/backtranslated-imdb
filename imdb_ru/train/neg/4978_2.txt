This film lost me from an RPG crossbow (grenade launcher). It was like someone cut and paste a scene from Robocop. I almost expected Beowulf to say: “I LIKE!” <br /> <br /> I watched this because I like Chris Bruno from the Dead Zone TV series, and he played his part. He chose a strange accent, but at least he kept it the same throughout the film - unlike any of his colleagues. They continued to move to all kinds of speech from old English to modern English, sometimes in one sentence. <br /> <br /> There are already a lot of comments about how this film differs from the original material. However, even in itself, the plot of this film is not very good. It's just boring, which does not justify even a low budget. Low budget means that you need at least to have a good story, dialogue and a decent game. These things are not expensive. Instead, they spent their money on CGI with half asses and some decent costumes and decorations. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to watch this movie.
