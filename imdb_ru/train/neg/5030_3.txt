What is there in the sky? This is a plane? Is it superman ?? No no ?? This is a turtle!?! See, that's what happened with the cold war! Nothing but bad news and other questions! The Americans shoot down a Russian warplane somewhere over the territory of the Arctic, and the subsequent explosion unfreezes and literally awakens a giant prehistoric turtle named Hammer. He / she is not a very friendly beast, because you should immediately destroy everything and everyone in your path. The arguing governments are finally deciding to kill the ugly bastard with a completely new and sophisticated ice bomb, but does the Hammer have another surprise left? The damn turtle can fly! The first time this happens leads to an incredibly grotesque and fun sequence! Hammer lies on his back and looks defeated when suddenly a fire blows from his armpits and he takes off into the air. How can you not love it? In addition, there is a terrible story about an annoying child who is able to communicate telepathically with a monster, but this is not interesting enough. Flying turtle, people !! There is little to write about this Japanese (and American edited) science fiction, except that it is an obvious and absolutely shameless robbery of such classical works as the original Godzilla and The Beast with 20,000 Fathoms. Monster effects and designs are extremely deceptive, and, unlike the aforementioned films, he never manages to create an apocalyptic atmosphere. Respectable actors, such as Brian Donlevi (Quatermass Experiment) and Dick O'Neill (Wolfen), seem to be unaware of what movie they are in, and even the original Japanese scenes of unrest are not very convincing. However, Gammera's own personalized theme is pretty cool, so she gets another point for that.
