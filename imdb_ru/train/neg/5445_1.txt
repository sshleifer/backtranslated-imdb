Ooof! This one was smelly. This is definitely not "somewhere between Star Wars and Thriller." In fact, it falls somewhere between the cracks of Wham! video and Captain EO, only with a not so big budget and much more crying ugly teens. Simon Le Bon leads the front and center, while the rest of the band diligently hides the fact that they stole their entire career from the last 3 Roxy Music albums. Short clips from Barbarella do not add anything. Avoid at all costs. (However, I liked the role when they played Hungry Like The Wolf, but why was there a tiger hiding in the audience, turning into a woman painted by tiger stripes? I mean, they don’t sing Tiger’s Eye "It's a wolf! Anyway.) Duran Duran's 80's DVD video is probably worth watching for nostalgia
