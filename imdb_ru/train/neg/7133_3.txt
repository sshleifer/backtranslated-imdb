I felt that I was watching “Fast and Furious” again, but with different actors and a slightly different plot. I will say that the cars in the movie are very cool. So, if you like fast cars, then this film is likely to seem a little exciting to you. I also liked Nadia Bjorlin, because I saw her in Days of Our Lives. She is really a good singer, but too bad that she was given such lousy songs to sing in this film. I mean the songs about cars; not exactly what you would be on here by radio. Since this is a Hollywood movie, you have to tell a little about this story, but in real life I don’t think that some average Joe will meet such a hot girl like Nadia Bjorlin who can drive a race car, repair a car engine, and be vocalist. This is all very stupid. <br /> <br /> One more note: anyone who wants to bet 25 million on the race is crazy. But in the end it was cool when Natasha stops right in front of the finish line and turns Michael. Priceless. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: This film is for car lovers. So, if you like fast cars, I would recommend it.
