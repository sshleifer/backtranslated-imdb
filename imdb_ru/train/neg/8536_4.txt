This is a typical Steele novel in which two people who have experienced some kind of tragedy manage to get together, despite the differences. I wouldn't call it a spoiler, because anyone who reads Steele’s novel knows how they all end. If you don't want to know much about the plot, keep reading. <br /> <br /> Gilbert's character, Ophelia, is a woman of French descent who lost her husband and son in an accident. Gilbert needs to stop making films where she needs to have an accent, because she, an otherwise good actress, cannot really make any accent. Brad Johnson, also a great actor, is Matt, who is recovering from a rather unpleasant divorce. He is soft, persuasive and persuasive in this role. <br /> <br /> They meet on the beach through her daughter, Pip, and Ophelia initially blames Matt for corrupting the child only because he spoke to the child about art. They all become friends after this episode, and then the couple falls in love. <br /> <br /> Chemistry between two heroes is not great, although, in my opinion, the talent of these two people is not a question. They did everything possible with a predictable plot and scenario bordering on the stereotypical one. Two people meet, tragedy, big tragedy, a secret is revealed, another tragedy, and then they get together. I wish there was more to this, but in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> I wanted meaningless entertainment, and I got it with this. As for the genres of romantic films, this one cannot be memorable. The Secret Romance of Janine Turner is much better (not Steele’s book), since some of Steele’s early books turned into a film.
