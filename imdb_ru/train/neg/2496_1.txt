I would list this film under the horror film genre. I did it because I do not know the genre, which is called terrible. As the horror genre approaches the horrible, I decided to put it in this category. The game was amateur. You know who will be the villains on the first scene. The heroine is as ugly as a movie. Filmmaking students should take this film as an example for what not to do in the movies. This is so bad. Man is a bad word - it is an understatement. Villains steal ocean liner and want 10 million dollars. They want the money to be delivered to the inhabited island of Roses in the center of the Pacific Ocean. They will sit ducks after they get the money. Is there an escape plan? How stupid the director of cruises is a former policeman, a maritime seal, kung fu, I'm scared. The fun part is a way to defuse a time bomb. He says that he knows what he is doing, and he continues to pull all the wires one by one. Then he puts it in his pocket and in accordance with the film with all the links in place. Is he crazy? How angry we are who watched it funny. If you have an M-I-L that you don't like. To annoy her, rent this movie and pretend you like it. I assure you that she will surely tell your spouse that you have such bad taste and that her son / daughter married a man who does not meet her family standards.
