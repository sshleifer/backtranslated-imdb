Absolutely predictable stupid show about a man who killed his wife, cutting her while driving and claiming he lost consciousness. Why did he still drive the car? Why did he still feel able to drive a car, killing his wife alone? This question did not occur to writers. Then he tells the story of a psychologist and her unsuccessful marriage, which is associated with an unsuccessful marriage of the driver who kills his wife. The omniscient mother and one-dimensional child are added for good measure, and the whole develops into a predictable outcome and a destructive finale. Is police psychologists so easy to take? Lethal composition, with which the actors are doing everything possible, but they are doomed to failure. It is on a par with the Harlequin novel. Do not waste your time watching this, unless it is what you are aiming for.
