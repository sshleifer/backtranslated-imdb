A very unnecessary film with characters who behave so shamelessly that I really did not care which of them would get the best (or was it the purpose of the film, to portray some calm, cool people from New York?). comedy either. Act very flat and very predictable plot. I was most annoyed by the constant jokes with quotes from classic films. Dude, don't you see that the more you quote, the less significant your own movie becomes? Try to be original yourself! A small budget does not justify at all, and the new director, too. Trashy, trashy, trashy. No wonder it cost me only one dollar ...
