What a bad, bad movie! I tried to look without fast forwarding ... It failed. After about 30 minutes I stopped the film, went online to see how many minutes this disaster was. (Only 84 minutes, Whew!) It was a confusing, boring movie. I donâ€™t think anyone could be knocked down by getting hit by a fluorescent lamp, much less gutted by one !! One funny thing is that I watched the movie version of The Killer Cut. The box boldly says "More blood!" "More sex!" "More horror than theatrical release!" Clap! If this film was terrible with all these statements, I would be interested in how lame the "UN-Killer Cut" was ??? If you want to watch an excellent film about the world of the living and the world of the dead, watch any of the TV series "Night of the Living Dead" !!
