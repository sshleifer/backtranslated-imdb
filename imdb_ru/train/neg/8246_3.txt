Girls Pope Florence Lawrence and Dorothy West receive tremendous news at the local post office, unaware that they are being pursued by robber Charles Insley. In the meantime, Father David Miles receives a message (from young Robert Harron) in which the father must leave the house; so when young women come back, can they be ?? alone at home. When the vulnerable couple goes to bed in the evening, the local “Big Black and Tan Ball” begins; and the black drinker foreshadows additional danger for D.W. Griffith's dynamic duo ?? <br /> <br /> Mr. Winsley has one of the best roles in a biography, stealing a movie from the movie “Girls and Dad”. Ironically, director Griffith appears as one of the extras with a black face at the "Black and Tan" ball. Lawrence and West's "Girl Biographers" suggest the later "Griffith Girls" Lillian and Dorothy Gish, especially in Storm Orphans (1921); and they are overly affectionate in bed! The racist tone is regrettable, since the story of the robber, saved from potential victims from greater danger, is intriguing. <br /> <br /> *** Girls and Dad (1.02.09) D.V. Griffith ~ Florence Lawrence, Dorothy West, Charles Insley
