I watched the whole movie, waiting and expecting something to really happen. Maybe it is my fault that I expected evil and horror instead of psychology? Is this a strange repetition of the oedipal myth: I want to kill my father and mother, marry my uncle and create a musical theater with him? I did not understand why certain elements of the plot were present: why there was a construction upstairs, why there was this large staircase with an ideal place for someone to fall down, if no one really was going to do this, why scenes with his father why have such a good kitchen, if you are going to eat takeaway, why the boy wants to be baptized, and the parents must resist, and not vice versa. I see a lot of good reviews of this film ... did I spoil my taste because of the b-films of the 70s and old science fiction films?
