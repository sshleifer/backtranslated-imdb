It was a complete disappointment. The acting was not bad, but the production was so bad that sometimes I felt I had to stop it, but unfortunately I coped with it and was able to finish it with a bit of an embarrassing whole bad movie. Everything is good. if you're okay with stupid moral plots and don't mind watching a movie that interprets Whitman badly. If you want a fictional story, do it.
