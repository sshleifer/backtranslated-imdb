When people ask me which is the worst film I've ever seen, this one. It’s not even close to the MST3k level riff, or midnight viewing in the theater, or even as a filler for the late night of the Disney Channel. The only time I wanted to jump off a trip to Disney World (or in this case at Disney / MGM Studios) was to remove Dick Tracy's jacket from the dummy, tear it into pieces and push the guide into the throat, saying “Eat this! Eat it unholy coat of darkness !!! " I have never been so angry with the film, even with "Nutty Professor II: The Klumps" or "Flash Gordon". Do you want beautiful colors and cinema? Not here, baby. Reviewers keep saying “oh, but it’s also like a comic book,” well, for me it’s the color of Gordito after a few weeks in the sun. About as nice. Beatty wanders through this landscape, jumps and talks with his watch, himself, and sometimes with other actors, hoping that someone will tell him what time the sequel will begin to be filmed. Honestly, I saw this film only once, but my threshold of pain is a person, not God.
