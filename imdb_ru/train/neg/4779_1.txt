In 2004, I liked it. Then it became very stupid. This suggests that children are brainless. It offends children. Cartoon Network used to be great. One of the shows that I liked was Hamtaro. He managed to be interesting and creative in his approach to children's programming. The show (Foster's House for Imaginary Friends) is like adding 20 tablespoons of sugar to your Sprite. It seems that modern television producers are only interested in making money, not attracting the imagination of children and making money! Recently, my children are tuning in to old shows (60s) to find something interesting to watch. Perhaps in the absence of originality, so that television would look into its past and use children's programs from the past days.
