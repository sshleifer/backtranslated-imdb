I really wanted this film to be liked, but in the end I was bored and incredulous. The first shot is a video camera from a robot flying to a bomb, and, naturally, is shaky. But then the rest of the film remains in shaky camera mode, even in quiet conversational moments, to the point of absurdity. In the rented houses ran out of tripods and stedikamy? The fact that it was shot at 16 mm does not help, as the entire film is grainy as well as wobbly. <br /> <br /> Despite all the efforts that Bigelow makes to exact machines and equipment, there are enough glaring errors and inconsistencies that undermine the credibility of the film. <br /> <br /> - The car would not catch fire after one shot, and once the fire hit it would not be put out by a small hand-held fire extinguisher. <br /> <br /> - One Humvee will not drive Baghdad in 2004, but will be backed up by other vehicles in the event of a breakdown or attack. “It is extremely unlikely that he will be able to hit a long-distance rebel, where the bullet clearly takes more than a second to reach the target.” <br /> <br /> - I believe that the bombs were taken to designated sites for burial at or near the base, and not in a random place in the middle of the desert. <br /> <br /> - It was stated that an oil attack The tanker occurred in the Green Zone, a very safe zone in which there were very few attacks from within. The zone consists mainly of offices and palaces with a small number of residences, but it is portrayed as a dangerous flock of dark alleys and hiding rebels. Oddly enough, James never gets into trouble because of the ridiculous tactics of ordering two of his companions to go through the avenue one at a time, thereby making an attempted abduction. <br /> <br /> - Speaking of this, a team of 3 people always depicts a clearing of buildings, chasing the rebels, etc., even when there are clearly dozens of soldiers. <br /> <br /> - How many hours does the team have to look at a dead rebel hanging a window in order to understand that he does not pretend to be him? <br /> <br /> There were no frames to show the viewer what the size and location of the base was or where Baghdad was connected. I had no idea what the EOD team reported, and there were no other characters. This is what the characters need to know, so we should. <br /> <br /> Many of the “surprises” and scenes are completely predictable. Yes, it is obvious that the colonel-psychiatrist will have problems with the Iraqis he is trying to move, that the choice of cereal in his homeland will be stunning, and that the driver you kidnapped will not wait for you when you get out of the car. <br /> In the end, there was almost no character development. Renner's character has a difficult relationship at home from the very beginning, is reckless and dependent on adrenaline. He is exactly the same at the end of the film. What is the point? <br /> <br /> If this is really the best film about the war in Iraq, then it is very sad. Based on the half hour that I saw, I would recommend Generation Kill instead of HBO.
