“Laugh, Clown, Laugh,” released in 1928, shoots the legendary Lon Cheney as a circus clown named Tito. Tito has grown grown up (young and beautiful Loretta Young) to adulthood and calls her Simonetta. Tito trained a girl in a circus life, and she became an experienced ballerina. Despite the fact that Cheney demonstrates his usual excellent results, I could not ignore the fact that Tito, who is now in adulthood, has everything for young Simonetta. Although he is not her biological father, he raised her as a daughter. This kind of "ik" factor permeates the entire movie. Tito is fighting for the sympathy of Simonetta with the young and handsome Count Luigi (Nils Aster). Simonetta clearly falls in love with a young man, but feels guilty for refusing Tito (because of loyalty, not romantic love). The whole premise of the film is ridiculous, and I find it surprising that no one in the film tells Tito what a stupid old fool he is (until he shows it at the end). The film deserves attention only thanks to Loretta Young, who will have a great career. While I adore the greatness of Cheney as an actor, this whole film seems indecent and terrible to me.
