Really unpleasant movie. While the special effects of Rick Baker are quite impressive (if they turn the stomach over), he has no other redemption functions. As in many 70s films, you get the feeling that you need to take a shower and clean yourself of mucus. Characters are equally unpleasant, and the plot has no meaning.
