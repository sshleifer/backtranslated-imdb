Spoilers <br /> <br /> Well, everything is said in one line. Melville's Samurai is the original, and there are elements of Leon in it. And they are better - much better! <br /> <br /> In Samurai, Alain Delon is a lonely warrior / professional killer who keeps a bird in a cage and steals cars for his work (with so much anticipation in these scenes!). Even the end is exactly the same: the samurai is looking for death with dignity and will be shot with an empty gun in his hand. He realized that the world has changed, and there is no place for samurai in it. <br /> <br /> Delon does not kill as many people as a ghost dog. But I think Jarmusch loved “Leon” or even “Desperate” Rodriguez. And he added this too. And let me guess: will the girl become a professional, like a ghost dog (like Natalie Portman in Leone)? <br /> <br /> So what did Jarmusch think about in the end? Where is the unique, original idea in this film? <br /> <br /> I see no point in creating carbon (celluloid) copies. <br /> <br /> Rating 4/10 Macaulay Connor
