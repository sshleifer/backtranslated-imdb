It has been about 14 years since Sharon Stone rewarded the audience by crossing their legs, which distorted the minds of many people. And now, God knows why, she is back in the game. "Basic Instinct 2" is a continuation of the popular erotica "Basic Instinct" with a sexy stone and vulnerable Michael Douglas. However, fans of the original may not even come close to this, since Instinct 2 is a painful film industry, as mediocre director Michael Caton-Jones kills the legacy of the first film. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film begins when the explosion of the car starts right at the very beginning. Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone, trying to look sexy in sex) is a suspect and appears to be involved in the murder. A psychiatrist (terrible David Morrisey) is appointed to examine her, but eventually falls in love with an intimate play of seduction. <br /> <br /> And so, without further explanation, the main force that drives this “instinct.” Nothing special is explained, and we have to watch an obscene erotic film of class C. Star Sharon Stone in her first role, where she most of the time is off, partly because of amateur writing, careless direction and terribly low chemical composition. The film is full of vulgar dialogues and even more sexuality (the plot scene was shot so as not to have an NC-17 rating) than the first entry in the series. "Instinct" - insuperable I’m torture. <br /> <br /> To top it off, there’s nothing in the film that made the original movie a guilty pleasure. Acting really badly here. Sharon Stone has some highlights, but here it becomes extremely unpleasant. David Morrisi plays a major role in his worst role in life, and it never seems to make more than two expressions in the film - embarrassed and excited "Instinct 2" is a terrible way to continue the original series, which the erotica thriller managed to play very well. Paul Verhoeven, how I miss you ... <br /> <br /> "Basic Instinct 2" never sounded like a good movie, and, indeed, it is not. Some films should never come out of paper, and that is the feeling you get after watching it. It is now much easier to understand why Douglas and David Cronenberg quit their studies, and why Sharon Stone expected a huge salary for this ......----- 3/10
