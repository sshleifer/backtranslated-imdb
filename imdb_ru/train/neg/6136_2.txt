The role of Buck in the role of Kahn recalls that Bob Barker (from The Price is right) controls the country in the same way as he does his show. But in this turkey there is a lot more to laugh and snort. Kurt Thomas, as a child-faced “hero,” demonstrates some significant acrobatic skills, but not acting talent. There are a few creepy moments (mostly in the Village of the Mad Men) and some slightly impressive martial arts sequences. But any movie "Ninja" will give you much more entertainment, and you will not feel the same guilty because of laughter.
