A family traveling to their daughter’s softball league decides to take a “scenic route” and ends up in the middle of nowhere. The father is an avid photographer, and when he hears about an old abandoned show in the city, he decides to take another workaround to take some photos. <br /> <br /> Of course, this show is filled with inbreds. freaks who quickly kidnap women and leave their little son and father to fend for themselves. <br /> <br /> The only cool thing about this movie is how the family actually fights their inbred kidnappers. In addition, the film is nothing worthwhile.
