This is a good movie for kids who love dogs. He works a little slowly at an early stage, but ends if the squall is De Vil. The main plot is the same as in the first film. The bright side of an adult film is a talking bird that thinks it's a dog. The bird speaks like a man (Eric Idle of Monty Python) and barks like a dog. This is the comedy that the film needed more. Look at it in the matinee, so you do not have to pay the full price or wait until it appears on Disney.
