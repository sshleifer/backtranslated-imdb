I think this film is a tribute to the first Superman film, as it is as sluggish and painfully long as the original. <br /> <br /> After the introductory scene consisting solely of muddy intergalactic images, credits pay homage to the incredibly futuristic impressive captions of the original Superman movie. <br /> <br /> Then there is something unclear. Ma Kent sees some kind of muddy noise on the farm and spends most of his life climbing slowly to the debris in the corn field. Then Superman sneaks up on her and faints. <br /> <br /> Then we meet with Lex Luthor in a scene about the old lady's many dark close-ups when she dies. We do not see the face of Luthor until the end of the scene, an early case of the desire of the film not to leave a stone to anyone not beaten. Lex Luthor is a guy who doesn’t like Superman because he isn’t human. In addition, he probably doesn’t like people either, since the film sometimes shows a story about how Lex Luthor plans to kill most of the world's population. <br /> <br /> After a while, Clark Kent reappears on his old job (I forgot to mention, he was on a five-year trip where nothing happened). He then learns that Lois Lane is an illegitimate child and meets with Cyclops. He is so upset that he loses control of his superpower to such an extent that he accidentally breaks the frame of the picture. <br /> <br /> At this moment we see that Miss Lane is on some kind of plane attached to some kind of space shuttle. This is an important event, because it is on television. Then we learn that there are people in the control room who are watching this event. There are people who watch it on TV, and there are pilots in the cockpit. Then the film reminds us that these people take a break between them for most of the summer. <br /> <br /> When the events that led to the imminent disaster began, I apologized for drinking the soda. I accidentally entered the wrong theater and watched a film about how Al Gore is showing slides in full. I tried to find my way back to Superman Returns, but somehow I wandered into the Prairie Home Companion, which I watched twice in a row. Then it's time to stop lazing around. <br /> <br /> I went back to the first theater, found my place, and looked up to see that the impending disaster with the space shuttle on Lois Lane was almost upon us. However, it seemed to last forever, so I wandered around the theater, met a girl, got married, raised my son and sent him to college. Taking part in my son's graduate medical school, I remembered that I probably should check out Superman’s return, so I apologized and ran back to the theater to find out that I don’t need to hurry. It took about half an hour until something went wrong for the Space Shuttle. When they did, Superman saved everyone, and it was awesome. <br /> <br /> And there’s also a storyline where Superman gets really creepy and starts chasing Lois Lane and her family with x-ray vision and super hearing. Then he tries to make her deceive the Cyclops, who seems like a nice guy. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Lex Luthor is participating in some kind of competition to show all the possible behaviors of the villain until the end of the film. I forgot to bring my scorecard with me home (they give you one at the door), but I think it scored almost 100%. I hope he wins a million dollars. <br /> <br /> At this stage, everything is preparing for a big gloomy finale. I think that maybe the projector was broken because of the film, it seemed there was something like a loop for a while. I remember how muddy things grew out of the water, Superman felt bad, Superman became better, he returned to dark things, he was sick again, do not wait, he is fine again. <br /> <br /> Then Lex Luthor released his final. Bad Boy Movement: Shout at your girlfriend a little. <br /> <br /> Then Superman died and returned to life. I thought the movie was over, so I left. <br /> <br /> Ninety years later, in a nursing home where I lived, it was a bit cold. I realized that I had left my hoodie in the theater, and went after it. When I did this, I was a little surprised to find that Superman Returns was not over yet. I tried to ask some viewers what I missed, but most of them were now only skeletons with long gray beards. <br /> <br /> I sat back in my old seat and watched Lois Lane play around her house. some time. Then Superman appeared and began quoting the beginning of the film, and since I had already seen this part, I thought that I could leave. <br /> <br /> So this is my review of Superman Returns. <br /> <Oh, also, if you like jokes about people who eat dogs, or jokes that one dog eats another dog, you will like this movie. On account there are two jokes like this in it.
