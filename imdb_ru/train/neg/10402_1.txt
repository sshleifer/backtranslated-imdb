Well ... I'm shivering, the original began in 1990, and I found the film quite enjoyable to watch. however, they continued to make tremors II and III. Believe me, these films began to descend immediately after they finished the first, I mean, ass blasters ??? Now only God himself is able to answer the question “why, in the name of God, did they create another one of these dives into the trash bin of the film”? Tremor IV cannot be considered a bad film, in fact it cannot even be considered the epitome of a bad film, since it justifies something more. When I tried to sit down, I noticed that my eyes began to bleed, and I really hoped that a little girl from the ring would crawl on TV and kill me. did they really think that dressing people who looked in other films, as if they were from the wild west, would make the movie (with exactly the same events) better? To be honest, I would never offer to buy this film, I mean, there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well.
