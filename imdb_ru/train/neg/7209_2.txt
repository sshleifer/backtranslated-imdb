Once, when I was doing this cartoon, I was fond of a cartoon still in college. It had a lot of Get Smart charm. Although it had its flaws, it was quite nice. <br /> <br /> Naturally, I was very interested to see the version of the film. That was before I saw it. An epilogue that I wish it had never been done. <br /> <br /> Aside from the fact that he was completely missed (who on earth, although Broderick was even close to the role?), he simply did not get a rating. <br /> <The effects were reasonable and perhaps the only thing I liked about the film; See the live version of gadgets in action! What was missing was the story and the plot that made it funny, charming or interesting. <br /> <br /> The original was a stupid cartoon with a very frivolous attitude. It was fun. The film became grim and took FAR too seriously. If he had a serious plot or he went crazy, so that he looked like a “animated film”, he could be a pleasure. <br /> <br /> Since it exists, it should not be considered part of the "Legacy Gadget".
