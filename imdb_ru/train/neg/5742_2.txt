When I borrowed this film from a friend (fortunately, I did not buy it), on the packaging (which really looked bad and ugly) the Vampire Terror was printed. After watching, I thought that the marketing campaign was probably more expensive than the movie itself. “Story” begins when a teenager (surprise!) Is pursued by some vampires / zombie creatures. <br /> <br /> Lighting, sound and everything reminded me of my first attempt to shoot a festive video on a ten year old VHS system, if not worse. I gave the film 2 out of 10 and only because the promotional T-shirts looked cool. I do not want to deny student films or dirty films in general, but I saw Braindead, and I saw a film with a budget of $ 20 from students, which was ten times better than this nonsense.
