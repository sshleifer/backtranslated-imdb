Maybe I’m missing something because I’ve read more positive things about a Man who has deceived himself than I have read bad reviews - and I just don’t understand. I like my noirs to have a bit of style with characters who say, look and act like Humphrey Bogart in The Big Dream or Jean Tirney in Laura. None of the characters in this film have that style or presence, or whatever you want to call it. Take the main actor Lee J. Cobb. His crumpled rolled look is about as far from the fast-moving, smoothly speaking noir archetype as you will find. Or take Jane Wyatt as a femme fatale as another example. This is one of the worst cases of incorrect prediction that I have seen lately. She is simply not convincing in this role. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, she’s tired and she lacks real surprises or something new for the genre. I could have predicted the outcome of a “Man who deceived himself” in about five minutes. And this final scene of chasing a cat-mouse is simply old, boring. Ten to fifteen minutes, when nothing happened, actually destroyed any tempo that the film might have had.
