When the film began, the first 4 minutes seemed like a trip to California, I was wondering if I mixed up the recordings. Then I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw Paul Thomas in the scene with the beautiful Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This is followed by Jimmy (young Tom Byron). Aunt Jimmy (Honey Wilder) is concerned about his behavior, so she hires him as a private teacher (Kay Parker). I could do without animals, a role-playing game of a robot or incest. There is one good sex scene, between Byron and Parker, but it's not good enough to save this film. <br /> <br /> My rating: D +
