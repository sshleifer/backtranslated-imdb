Johnny Weissmuller’s latest film King of the Jungle, after 16 years as Tarzan and Mermaid, will surely disappoint all but the most ardent fans. At 44, the ex-Olympian, one of the most active "party animals" in Hollywood, had long lost the slender athleticism of his youth and looked tired (although he was in somewhat better condition than in his previous record "Tarzan and the Huntress"). <br /> <br /> Not only did Weismüller become too old for his role; Johnny Sheffield, the typical “Boy,” grew to a mature age (he was 17 years old), so he was discharged from the script on the pretext that he “left school.” Brenda Joyce, 35, appeared in her fourth of five films as “Jane” (she will provide the transition when Lex Barker becomes new Tarzan, in 1949 in “The Magic Fountain of Tarzan”), and was still as sexually attractive as before. <Br /> <br /> Produced by Saul Lessser at RKO with a small budget, the cast and crew used a cheaper work force while filming in Mexico. While the place clearly gave a Latin American look to what was supposedly the darkest Africa, veteran director Robert Flory made extensive use of the country, including the history of diving on rocks and the Aztec temple. <br /> <br /> When a young island girl (Tyrone's future power bride, Linda Christian) is rescued in the jungle river Tarzan, he learns that the local high priest (George Zucco, one of the film’s most persistent villains) actually enslaved the local population, threatening redemption from the living "God" if they do not carry out his orders. The girl was chosen to become the bride of "God", so she ran away. Faster than you can say: “This is a stupid plot or what?”, The girl is kidnapped by the minions of the priest and returned to the island, and Tarzan is followed by Jane, the colorful Spanish character “Benji” (charmingly played by John Lorenz, who sings several tunes), and the government commissioner is sent to the Deity and his priest (poor Chita is left behind). After a series of discoveries (“God” is just an Aztec mask scammer, working with a priest in the milking of the island’s rich pearls), a bit of fights and comic relief and Benji songs, everything reaches the expected happy ending. <br /> <br /> It is noteworthy that TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS has the musical score of the brilliant composer of the film Dmitry Temkin and is much better than what you expect from this movie “B”! <br /> <br /> While the film would have been a less favorable end for Weismüller’s time in Tarzan’s loincloth (he would immediately continue to play Jim Jungle, a more eloquent variation of Monkey Man in khaki), the talent involved would raise the total product at least a little above the general confusion that might be. <br /> <br /> Tarzan was going to change the situation and become much sexier ...
