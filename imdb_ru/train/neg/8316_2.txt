Cedric Cana’s films were based on characters, not actions (I think of L'Ennui and Feux rouges), so it’s very frustrating to see that this series of really experienced car chases is interspersed with some grueling attempts to give a character to Sukko an interesting actor; he reminds me of professional athletes who are carried away in movies, such as Bret Favre. This empty look looks like a really angry deer caught in the headlights. A real actor would make us think about the personality of Sukko, and not admire his skill in car theft. <br /> <br /> A bit of acting skill comes mainly from Isild le Besco, who is assaulted by a schoolgirl Succo. The interview at the police station is a miracle of mild stubbornness with a slight fear of the future mixed. Besides Le Besco, there is little to recommend this film.
