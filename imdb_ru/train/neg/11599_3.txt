The only thing that prevented this click from being a complete disaster was a couple of interesting stylish touches. <br /> <br /> (Moderate spoiler alert) The death from the comic book is derived from the Twilight scene. Zone: a film in which death comes from a cartoon. Nonetheless, they coped well with this, especially by observing how the ink bleeds and color runs out. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is another good scene with a demon motorcycle. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I was glad that I got the DVD on the cheap from the store, because it was pretty awful. I bought Soul Survivors at the same time, and both films were equally annoyed by the constant realization that you were watching a dream. However, where Soul Survivors has nothing to pay it off, or there is some sense in it, at least it had a couple of stylish notes mentioned above. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the DVD allows you to go to 8 “nightmares”, where something really happens, and this is the only way to watch it. Scenarios between creative blood moments are unbearable. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
