The following are some of the most glaring problems with this film: 1) A cliché abound. Seriously, horrible “twists and turns” are everywhere. <br /> <br /> 2) The narrative jumps in time, which would be nice if everything was good, but it is not. <br /> <br /> 3) Lame characters who do not develop as much as either remain completely static or change radically without a good reason. <br /> <br /> 4) Big problem: HORRIBLE ACTION. Moreover, from almost every person. <br /> <br /> Here are some of the best moments of the movie: 1) Leadership looks so damn good. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, there are only two types of people who will participate in this film: a) people who can sit 90 minutes of joke simply because the leadership is attractive. <br /> <br /> b) people who often think to themselves "I like a Hollywood Drake, full of cliches and replays, but if I could only watch it in Korean ..." There are a lot of good Korean cinemas, so Why waste your time on trash?
