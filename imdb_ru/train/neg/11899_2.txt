Robert Forster, usually a very strong character actor, is lost in the sea here, being abandoned as a New York family man seeking revenge on the bandits who killed his son and attacked his wife during a home invasion. A terrible thing is exploited for the thrill in the spirit of "Death Wish." It is not difficult to ridicule this dodgy trial: the dialogue is full of howlers, crime statistics are irrevocably dated, and the supporting characters are ridiculously rewritten (especially the contemptible judge who allows the accused killer to leave the courtroom). Low-rent production is despicable in its complacency, especially since the violence in our cities has only increased. * from ****
