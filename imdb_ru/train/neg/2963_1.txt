Since I began to visit this site and vote for movies, I have never given any film a rating of 1. Even anxious “Dance! Training with Barbie "received 2. There is a reason for this. <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever I watch what I consider a really bad film, I have to stop and ask myself the following question: "Is this film really as bad as a horrible, soul-sucking beast," Theodore Rex? “And I couldn’t have answered yes. <br /> <br /> I would like to give something within reason to find out what the cracker said:“ Hey! Let's redo the Blade Runner with Barney in the role of Harrison Ford! ”and decided it was a good idea to spend time and money shooting, and I also want to know what the hell they were going to sell this market if he hadn’t gone directly to the video. This is a rare monster: a film that is too cruel for children and too insanely stupid for adults. I would ask “what do they think?”, but in this case it may be unnecessary. < br /> <br /> In any case, all you need to know is that you should expose yourself to this monster only if you are one of five or six rabid Howard Duck fans, or if you are interested in seeing the an evil mad movie of all time or you want to REALLY punish yourself.
