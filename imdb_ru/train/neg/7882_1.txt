Going to the movie store to find something to watch, we stumbled upon it. At least this resume looked attractive, so we tried. And here is the kicker: the first 20 minutes are interesting! This is really nice! Oh wait, spoke too early. <br /> <br /> Somewhere in the movie, the film turned sickeningly into a fundamental, right-wing Christian brainwashing. Not quite sure what will happen, but I think the screenwriter found God somewhere, finished writing this script and did not have time to edit it, because he had a KKK meeting to chat with friends from Westborough church, and his hood was not clean. <br /> <br /> Can they warn of this? I refuse to support this religious idiocy. Just as in video games there are rating systems, films need some kind of symbol: perhaps a small cross in the bottom corner to show us that the film will deteriorate. <br /> <br /> If you don’t share the mood with any fool who came up with this story, and your Bible will be open on your lap while you watch it and plan how you will convert your neighbors, don’t waste your time. This is one of the worst rubbish that has gone out in a very long time, and radical religious nuts no longer need funding.
