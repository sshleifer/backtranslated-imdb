This is a classic bastard with a loud cast, mostly elderly people who survived their best times and time to go to bed in this film. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty depressing movie if you think about it. Stay on earth, and you will encounter illness and, ultimately, your demise. <br /> <br /> Gwen Verndon showed that she can still dance. It is a pity that the film did not focus on this anymore. Maureen Stapleton, looking haggard, still demonstrated those moves from the Queen of the Star Dust Ballroom, much more mundane 10 years ago. <br /> <br /> I only hope that this film does not inspire older people to commit mass suicide at the level of Jim Jones. How can someone be so idiotic to like it and say that it makes you think? <br /> <br /> Why did Don Amech win an Oscar for this nonsense? <br /> <br /> If seniors did an amazing thing at the end, why would a teenager be encouraged to get off the boat? Why did Steve Guttenberg jump from the ship too? In the end, he found his ladies' love. <br /> <br /> It would be a good movie if older people could find their source of youth on earth and stay there. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, with the exception of Wilford Brimley, at the time of this writing, Vernon, Guilford, Stapleton, Amech, Tandy, Cronin and the Lord know who was not there yet. The authors should have taken the script and put it together with this group.
