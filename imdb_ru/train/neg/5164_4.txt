The main plot in this film is not bad. The lady makes it big and returns to her alma mater to adore. But despite the good play of Robert Young and Eve Arden, the film is a mess. I place the blame for this either on Joan Crawford, or on the director, or on both, because her performance is simply terrible. Instead of being a real person, she makes a wonderful imitation of a deer caught in the headlights. In other words, she looks into space and has the expression "fucking stunned." After a few minutes, it really began to annoy me. Now this, of course, is not the only Crawford film that I donâ€™t like because of her performance, as she did more than just replay - in films like JOHNNY GUITAR or in many of her later films like BERSERK! My advice is to try another Crawford movie - they must have been better there.
