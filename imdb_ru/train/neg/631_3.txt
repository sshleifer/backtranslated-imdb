Amazing. This is what you would say if you watched this movie. Simple, incredible, amazing. It is actually so amazing that someone was stupid enough to invest in the creation of this monster, that you just can not believe what you see. That's what, my friends, really scary in this film. Someone thought it was a good idea to do this. <br /> <br /> Well, here is another surprisingly original story: a high school student (who occasionally seemed to be a college or a figure) has a whore for her mother, lives in a trailer park and is an “artist” who is ridiculed for his “all to another. " Well, of course, this poor ridiculous boy is eventually killed, and, here is the original part, his soul lives in a scarecrow (under which he was killed last John by his slutty mother). Then he goes with the standard murder of all the people who hurt him. Awww <br /> <br /> Here’s a breakdown: <br /> <br /> The Good: <br /> <br /> - An amazingly funny movie, even if it’s not what the clearly drunk directors wanted. <br /> <br /> This is a continuation on one disc in Wal-Mart’s $ 5.00 basket, so the price is a bit overpriced. <br /> <br /> It didn't hurt, did it? t Help: <br /> <br /> - Violence and blood do not meet standards. One person got hit in the ear of corn. <br /> <br /> - It looks like they put some effort into the music, but is it not quite suitable for the movie ?? and not so good. <Br /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> <br /> - Awful, terrible game. <br /> <br /> - Another slasher with sexy women - none of them take off their clothes. When did it stop being the staple of low-browed slashes? <br /> <br /> - A funny story. <br /> <br /> - Scarecrow spews single-row lines, because of which Freddy Krueger and Arnold Schwarzenegger blush. <br /> <br /> - A standard love story does not go anywhere and is poorly made. <br /> <br /> - It seems to some of those killed that they were chosen at random ?? you never know who it is, and then they are killed. And you only assume that they must have been expecting it. <br /> <br /> Ugly: <br /> <br /> - Extremely average payment for murder, only with a killer stuffed animal instead ?? well, all this other nonsense. <br /> <br /> - Not as interesting as Freddie Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Pinhead, Chucky, or even Angela from the Sleeping Camp series - all of them are better than this crime. <br /> <br /> - Absolutely the worst dialogue I've ever heard in my LIFE. The script is loaded with a level of lag, which I could never imagine. I am seriously here - this is a complete step beyond the terrible. Do not misunderstand me, although, damn it, this is ridiculous, but I have never heard anything like it, even in Slaughter III Slaughter. This movie makes "Jason X" look like Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> - The man who kills the boy who becomes a scarecrow: the worst wig ever. Dialogue for compliance. <br /> <br /> Memorable scene: <br /> <br /> - Where elementary school students utter their witty dialogue: “Hey, let's go, we will find small animals for torture. Yeah. "<br /> <br /> Acting: 3/10 Story: 3/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Cinematography: 1/10 Character development: 2/10 Special effects / Make-up: 5/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 1/10 ( without nudity, mother whore, girls do not wear bras.) Violence / blood: 5/10 (low quality, mediocre quantity). Dialogue: 0/10 (extremely ridiculous, impudent, excessively and painfully funny, so bad, this is good. My first rating for dialogue in any film!) Music: 5/10 Direction: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Gayness: 10/10 Insolence: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Overall: 3 / 10 <br /> <br /> Another one for people like me who like to watch pure nonsense Or a movie playlist. This is not a very good film, in general. Funny dialogues and characters do not let you get bored. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
