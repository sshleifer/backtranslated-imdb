It really does not fit the castle of Cagliostro. Lupine is not so funny, wacky or hyperactive. The scenery and music is boring, the plot is just not interesting. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this' un is nudity (only in the uncut version) provided by Fujiko. This has helped revive some tedious scenes. CoC had a formidable villain, and he created the film for some of the original scenes. Places in TSoTG are not very bright or attractive. <br /> <br /> This time Zenigata, Hemon and Jigen do not even provide decent entertainment. As if they were just fulfilling a contractual obligation, appearing. <br /> <br /> DVD has full-frame Dolby Stereo sound. It has a decent amount of add-ons, including quite a lot of trailers. But one curious thing. There is no chapter or timecode selection on the disc displayed on the player after it is installed. Although you can still go to the next scene number using the remote.
