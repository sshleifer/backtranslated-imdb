Cowboys can leave you a little sore in the saddle. Definitely not one of Jones' best movies. Don't get me wrong, there are always good places in any John Wayne move. And this one has its share. But in general, the picture is moving slowly and simply does not meet the expectations that might be. Bruce Dern does the villain's outstanding work again. Roscoe Lee Brown - another bright spot in the film. The kids in the movie were average, but they could play better. It would be a good movie for movie lovers from eight to fifteen years old. <br /> <br /> It would be a good family move to watch with your children. Just keep in mind that there are a couple of scenes that you might want to take a look at before letting the young see it. But most of the children I know have seen a movie like this. Maybe it's because they see children of their own age who do all the adult work.
