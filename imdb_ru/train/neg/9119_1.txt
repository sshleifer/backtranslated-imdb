I actually saw this movie in the cinema in its original version. It was painful to see Peter Sellers embarrass himself so much. The story was incredibly lame and difficult to understand, and the ending was ridiculous. It was just sad to see how the mighty fell. I will not say that I am a big fan of Peter Sellers, but I really liked the Pink Panther TV series, and I felt that he played very well in the TV series Be There. But this film should never have been made. From what I read, he tried to produce this film against the advice of others. Good, but it still does not justify the studio actually producing the film.
