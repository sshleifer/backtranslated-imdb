My friends and I entered this film, not knowing what to expect, but hoping for the best. When we left, we were only a little more informed about what the plot of the film was. Although this is not the worst movie I've ever seen, I definitely do not recommend spending my money to watch it in cinemas. Maybe ask a friend to rent it for you (it’s not even worth the rent) if you really want to see it. <br /> <br /> When the film is so confused that you have no idea what's going on until the last five minutes, there really isn’t much that can be said in its defense. The acting was decent, more than you expect to get from this film, and some of the shots were good, but it was all bogged down with a plot and a bad script. <br /> <br /> This movie was actually so bad that as soon as it came out, I went and bought a ticket to watch a good movie, just to clear my mind. I recommend that all of you just skip the first step and go see a good movie instead.
