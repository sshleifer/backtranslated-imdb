Each generation fully believes that it lives in the end times. This has been true for millennia. And films like this one feed on it. How did they get the great Orson Welles to tell about this train wreck? This is a documentary about the bible prophecies of Armageddon. He tries as best as possible to link the prophecies with what was happening at the time when he was created, making it clearly outdated and somewhat silly. <br /> <br /> It seems like the reenactments are coming out of the “Unsolved Mysteries”. “But without high production values.” People had to be embarrassed to take part in it. <br /> <br /> In short, the film is outdated, stupid, reactionary and useless. Well, if you want to laugh, but not enough to actually look.
