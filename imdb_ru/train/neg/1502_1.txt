The Ballad of Django - A Wandering Movie Mess! These spaghetti westerns are just a collection of scenes from other (and much better!) Films, supposedly related by Django, telling how he brought in different criminals. Hunt Powers (John Cameron) adds nothing to the role of Django. Skip this one, unless you MUST make every Django movie, and even THIS may not be a good enough reason to watch it !!
