The play by Lillian Hellman, adapted by Dazell Hammett with the help of Hellman, becomes a curious project for getting out of the sandy Warner Bros. Paul Lucas, repeating his role on Broadway and receiving the title of best actor Oscar, plays the anti-Nazi German underground leader fighting the Nazis dragging his American wife and three children across Europe before seeking refuge in the States (across the Mexican border). They settle in Washington with their motherâ€™s rich mother and brother, although the boarder living on the estate is immediately suspicious of newcomers and spends a lot of time at the German embassy playing poker. It seems that this drama will take forever to find its focus, and when we understand the essence of the material (wise, honest, direct refugees teaching stupid, dizzy Americans, how the world suddenly changed), it seems a little patronizing - the viewer is literally put in the place of relatives, where he lectures. In the third act, Lucas has a few speeches that undoubtedly earned him an Oscar, but he seems to do most of the picture, except for entry and exit, entry and exit. Like his wife, Bette Davis proclaims like no one else, and opens her eyes wide, but the role does not give her much color. Their children (all with divergent accents!) Are alternately humorous and annoying, and Geraldine Fitzgerald plays no role in the role of the worn wife (and the angry texture she brings to the role seems completely wrong). The intention here was to tastefully, tactfully show us only that a person (of the Second World War era) could be German, which does not make him sympathetic to the Nazis. We get it in the first few minutes; the rest of this tasteful, tactful film consists of exposure, defensive opposition and, ultimately, compassion. It should be a rash mixture, but instead it is rather dry and inert. ** from ****
