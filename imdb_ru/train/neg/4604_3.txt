I have to pat my back for watching this movie because it really was painful. Is an incapable artist becoming a fully capable killer? This film was full of absurdities, which, if I mentioned them all, I would give the film. Norm Peterson, he's George Wendt, really needs to be in a rut to agree to make this movie. The game was deplorable, and the story was even worse. As a sensible and rational person, I could not understand where the writer came from and where he went with this film. There was a clumsiness on the part of each protagonist, there was a series of unfortunate and ridiculous events, then the film ended. One absurd act after another with a dialogue does not make a film, it only makes talkative of a train wreck.
