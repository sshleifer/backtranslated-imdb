I absolutely adore the book written by Robin Klein, so I was very excited when I found out that a movie based on the book was being prepared. <br /> <br /> But I was very disappointed with the film when I saw it because it didnâ€™t reflect what I liked in the book - absolutely ridiculous Erica and an interesting world view. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning of the film, I realized that everything was wrong. not the way I imagined in the book. So, I just went for a walk. I think it was not so bad. Miss Belmont was completely different from what I imagined! I did not think she would smoke and drink - Jean Kittson, who plays her, is very funny! <br /> <br /> By itself I thought that the film and its actors / actresses succeeded in it. work, but, alas, I am such a fan of the book (one of my favorite books of all time) that I could not help but feel disappointed = P
