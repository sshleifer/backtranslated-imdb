Nobody goes to the cinema like The Hills Have Eyes 2, and does not expect the second coming of Citizen Kane. The same is true for most low-rent horror films, especially those that Roger Ebert called "The Cinema of a Dead Teen". The Hills Have Eyes 2 can definitely be attributed to the film “Dead Teenager”, only here teenagers are given the appearance of military trainees. <br /> <br /> Some argue that “this is just a film” when dubious facts are raised in a film review, but I have always firmly believed that all good fantasies must be implemented into reality to be effective. In “Hills have eyes” 2 we must believe that the main characters are military people at training exercises, but they look and talk like schoolchildren, resting in the desert. The dialogue is terrible and often vulgar. Although the films are almost incomparable, I continued to imagine that these "soldiers" were in a platoon and shudder with fear. <br /> <br /> Very little about the heroes who recall the soldier, except for rifles and fatigue: radio broadcasts are conducted as teenage telephone conversations; The colonel refers to the private as "hey, asshole." And no one seems to have any idea what to do, or any sense of command structure, when something starts to go wrong. I think of the soldiers in James Cameron's Aliens, a movie about pure fantasy, and how even these futuristic marines behaved like real soldiers, despite their fantastic situations. Fantasy is rooted in reality. <br /> <br /> I try to start watching a movie like 5 on a 10-point scale, and from there judge its strengths and weaknesses. You must allow assignments for the material; "Star Wars" can not be as good as the "Godfather" on an equal footing. But both are excellent examples of their type. <br /> <br /> In this respect, although Hills Have Eyes 2 is a rather terrible exercise in amateur and immature writing, in this respect it is only slightly worse than in the typical Dead Teenager. Movie. On the technical side, the film seems to have a decent production cost and is pretty well made from this point of view. Scenes that are meant for shock, or that are meant to cause urgency or suspension, usually work. So, although watching the movie “The Hills Have Eyes 2” may indeed turn out to be worse than death, the horror film is probably much worse than the appeal. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing for those who love this type of stuff without the usual baggage of fans, or those who are not inclined to think that every film they see is either the best or the worst of all time. If you don’t "get" horror, especially a kind of Dead Teenager, you are unlikely to have a good time with it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
