This "film" is trying to follow the genre of low-budget, manual camera filming, which proved to be very effective and successful. <br /> <br /> This one fails and HOW. <br /> <br /> It's amazing how many so-called "awards" were plastered on the cover with this piece of garbage ..... it makes you wonder what these critics were on when they really presented it .... <br / > <br /> Words cannot describe how horrible this movie really is. Seriously, this is BAD. <br /> <br /> I watched it straight after 20 minutes straight, almost continuously. <br /> <br /> From garbage lighting to horrendous directing, grainy visual effects and muffled sound, and Of course, not forgetting the ABYSMAL acting game, it was a completely and very pathetic piece of so-called filmmaking. <br /> <br /> This is serious, NO redemptive qualities - in general. Save your money and watch a decent low-cost horror movie, there are a lot of things - Dead End, The Blair Witch, REC, and many others. <br /> <br /> Avoid this trash at all costs. DO NOT waste your money or time on this piece of garbage, pretending to be a real movie. <br /> <br /> Take into account all other comments! You have been warned!
