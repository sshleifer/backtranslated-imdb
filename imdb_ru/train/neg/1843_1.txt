Wow. Just awful. I was a fan of the original film, and was reluctant to sit on part 2, 3 and there was an improvement. 4.5 and Freddy's Dead were pretty bad. But NOTHING is as bad as Freddie's Nightmares. Freddie acts as the host of Rod Serlinges on this anthological series. <br /> <br /> I can agree with how Freddie became one highlight after another, but at least in the films Freddie’s appeal wore films, but here it was so poorly made, they looked like school productions from horror series. Poor actors, if you really want to call yourself, that after this show, obviously, were exactly what they paid for. I'm pretty sure that this is a stop for two types of actors. Some are just starting out on the Hollywood Staircase, a brand new one is ready to accept any part, so that they would be postponed in order to assume that they were offered porn work last week, or experienced actors, on their way down the Hollywood Staircase are ready to accept any part that will put from them in order to accept this work porn they were offered last week. <br /> <br /> I am pretty sure that Dana Plato was a guest star, but she was already dead by the time it was in production. <br /> <br /> Paraphrasing Nancy's line in the original book “Elm St”: “Whatever you do, try not to fall asleep while watching this.”
