This film was quite interesting ... I had to watch it at a lesson about India in college, but the synopsis says that this film tells about one thing when there is not a lot of cold and hard information about these details. This is not quite true for synopsis until the very end, where they casually try to tie all the elements together. The blood factor is excellent, however. Even at the very beginning you want to look away, because the blood is quite intense. Watch this film only if you want to see some kind of cool blood, because the plot is thin and will make you feel sad that you have spent time listening to it. I have seen rumors on other sites that this film is based on real events, but you cannot find any information about it on the Internet ... so basically this film was a waste of time watching.
