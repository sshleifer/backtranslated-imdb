I just saw it at the Venice Film Festival, and I can't decide on that. We were never allowed to get close enough to any of the characters to take care of them. It may be that this is the point that we are all in our “own bubble,” but these people did not make me worry about them or shock them with various fates. For more than an hour, the characters were not well developed. Much time was devoted to factory equipment personnel (forklifts, conveyor belts, shovels); and slightly eerie-looking dolls with surprisingly realistic eyes, which most of the characters earned a living, were somehow more interesting than living people. An interesting experiment, but somehow it did not work out.
