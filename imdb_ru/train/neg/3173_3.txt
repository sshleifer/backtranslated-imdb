This film is similar to the play entitled “The Spirit of Bliss”, written by Noel Trus. The plot of the ghost wife and medium is closely related to the work of Trus. I'm surprised that films of this kind do not recognize the concept of the original author. I understand that the public may not know that this is a fake, but it is. <br /> <br /> Sad. These films are very expensive to produce. I cheer up when the script is original. I am even encouraged when this is an innovative way to produce work that was previously released. Some samples were mentioned (for example, Topper, etc.). <br /> <br /> I understand that films are still a relatively affordable form of entertainment. However, I do not like it when the taste of the public is taken for granted. In this situation, the taste of the public is overlooked. <br /> <br /> I look forward to a better movie. <br /> <br /> In this case. I rather see the game.
