I heard about this movie and knew that it was not very good. But I started watching the movie (on my channel) and became interested. It can be a truly great, dark black satire on today's morality in the media. The little features at each contest were good. This is something that I do not want to miss. But when the so-called show begins, everything becomes implausible, cheap and rather stupid. This is where the author should have added something that would make people think. But instead, he wrapped up and suggests that people are so stupid. <br /> <br /> The end is so bad that I give it 1. Even if the film promises to start.
