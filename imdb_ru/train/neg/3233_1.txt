Come on people, you can not be serious, another case of advertising, when it is not completely! It's not even scary and not scary and not corrupt - it's just a terrible amateur video program created for the next party to put the girls on. <br /> <br /> The blood is incredibly bad, even the eye The scene does not make me want to vomit, but just makes me want to take a camera and hit those guys on the head. The girl just lies there with a rubber face, not moving at all. Instead, it would be more fun to use a real doll. <br /> <br /> One season “I'm a celebrity, get me out of here!” is worse than this one. Do not waste your time or money.
