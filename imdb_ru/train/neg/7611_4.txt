First preview 2/28/2006 - 4 out of 10 (directed by Sydney Pollak): - The DVD version I watched titled “3 Days of the Condor” - So the CIA drama is full of laid-back performances, making for a very laid-back movie. The premise of this story is that about 7 of the 8 members of the CIA research team were killed by the character Robert Redford, code name = Condor, which was left. Who killed them and why? This is what Redford is trying to figure out while trying not to be the eighth victim. Along the way, he engages character Fay Dunaway, initially because he needs a place to hide, and then she eventually helps him after a short love time. This is one of several innocent guys on the run, but there’s not much waiting. Flat presentations do not help, and the end does not close the agreement for the audience is also sufficient. Despite having a good director in Sydney Pollak and a group of classical performers, the story and the performances are not what they should be, and therefore the film is not what it should be.
