Anyone who has watched Comedy Central around midnight in the past few years has probably seen an ad for this movie. I first saw an advertisement for this film back in 2001. It seems that it can be funny, but I was not going to dial the number on the TV screen and order it without seeing the movie in the first place. I thought that I would wait until the film was available for rent on Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> About a year and a half later, I was on Tower Records and in the heap of “DVDs for less than $ 20” there was a copy of this film. Seeing that the DVD was only $ 6.99, I decided to buy it. I went home, put the disc in the DVD player and waited for laughter ... and I waited some more. Laughter was not. <br /> <br /> I would have to agree with almost all the comments on this page, when I said that this film was terrible. The patient, desperately tasteless, poorly written and directorial film "Underground comedy film" - a disgusting piece of garbage and, in my opinion, the worst film of all time. No stars.
