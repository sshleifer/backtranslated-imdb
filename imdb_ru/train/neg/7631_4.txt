I am not going to comb the obvious St. Petersburg failings of TLPS. Instead, I will look at the positive aspects of this overvalued celluloid pygmy film. <br /> <br /> 1. Peter Bogdanovich managed to make a film that can be sustained in full. This fact alone places the film high above all and to the very top of its unconvincing filmography. <br /> <br /> 2. Bogdanovich showed how surprisingly generous some lucky ones can be by sharing the fabulous body and chest of Kibill Shepard (his then girlfriend) with his male audience - and not only once, but twice. Brava! The undoubted highlights of this cinematic festa del siesta. <br /> <br /> 3. TLPS hardly has a scene without stereotypical country music painting in the background. (Peter tried to make the obvious conclusion that the film was happening in the deep south of America (as if it was not obvious), so he beat off that moment again and again ...) How could this advantage, you could ask? Well, when the movie finally ends and the monotonous country-style music finally stops massaging your tired eardrums, you begin to experience a strange excitement: “The movie is finally over!” This is pure joy. <br /> <br /> 4. The film gives all women who look like hope Cloris Lichman. I hope that they, too, can one day wrest a much younger and, possibly, even nice guy. <br /> <br /> 5. Biography Cloris Lichman (which, as I understand it, is not technically part of the TLPS) instills hope in all such similar women that they too can one day win the beauty contest Miss Chicago. (Provided that they have enough money to bribe the jury.) <br /> <br /> (You think I'm joking that Cloris won a beauty contest, eh? Let's see her biography, and then see who has the last laugh ...) <br /> <br /> 6. The film was shot in black and white, which saved us from looking at the face of Cloris Lichman in his original, not natural glory.
