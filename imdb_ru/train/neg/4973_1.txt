I stopped five minutes later, when Beowulf was given a double-shot automatic crossbow with sights. Not only did crossbows not have telescopic sights, but Beowulf defeated Grendel in hand-to-hand combat. Not helped, and a terrible, wooden acting and eternal darkness, which plague all the original films of Sci-Fi. Only a few minutes passed before I felt my bile rise, and decided to see that instead I love Lucy, and that is all I want to say. But you can also just understand that this is a film for television and skip it right now. <br /> <br /> Parody.
