I can't describe how awful this movie is. Am I the only one here who finds the way to his revival completely disgusting? Rohan’s men look 100% fake with their badly dyed hair, which doesn’t even closely match what the actors look like. The orcs looked awful. Why is gandalf walking with strong limp? Why can't they pronounce things correctly? Saruman is not Aruman. There were others that sounded like the awful pronunciation of Tolkien's * sp * characters. Everybody and everything, I'm glad that the studio that did this pulled the cork out of the sequel, it was just a terrible terrible adaptation. Go see the hobbit caricature for Tolkien’s best cartoon. Hell, even the animated version of ROTK is better than this dribble. 2/10
