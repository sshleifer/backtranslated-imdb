I basically took this film because I saw a brilliant remake of Zatoichi Kitano Takashi and was in the mood for another updated story of a samurai in which Asano Tadanobu also starred. These two films are different worlds. Zatoichi added humor and depth to his characters and spoiled the traditional samurai clichés. Gojoe goes to the deep end in a different direction. <br /> <br /> First, I hate films in which other characters inform viewers about what the main character looks like, instead of developing it during the film, “You can't decide whether you are a monk or a warrior, ”says almost every character in the presence of Benkey, but this inner turmoil is barely transmitted to the character himself. Instead of character development, we get bloated, boring, bloody battle scenes. Asano's character is not developed, and even he looks as if he is bored and he does not know what he is doing there. I know that he usually looks distant and cool, and this is part of Asano’s appeal, but this film doesn’t help him. <br /> <br /> Many camera movements cause nausea. There is a scene that goes on forever, in which the camera revolves around the main characters, until my wife and I felt vomiting. The ending is ridiculous and quite anti-climatic. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that really good samurai films are not made in Japan with such a budget. The colors, the scenery and the costumes were magnificent, but everything else was a waste of time. I would prefer to see one of the versions of this kabuki myth.
