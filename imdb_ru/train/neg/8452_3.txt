I commented on the film for the first time because I felt that if the right people read it, they can wake up and do something about it. Over the past few months, ABC Family has launched a new movie format. I have seen the last three and enjoyed them. They were busy and did their job. My wife loves these movies. I was looking forward to seeing "See Jane Date". The trailers looked and sounded great. Unfortunately, this is one film in which the book must be ahead of the efforts shown by the authors and musicians involved in this project. 2003, source (everything is bad), the assessment was as interesting as a trip to the elevator in a department store. It was intrusive and did not add any emotional content to the film at all. It worked against that. I work in the film and television business. I like being entertained. This is one case where I kept thinking whether it could have been worse. There were lines from another decade in the script, and I know that these women can play, but you will not know about it from this film. To add to the overall experience, the end made me shake my head. Advice to Disney, ABC, ABC Family executives and producers: under no circumstances hire a composer or music director to shoot any of your future films. They have lost touch, and they need to understand what the words “modern”, “today” and “current” mean when describing a romantic comedy. The world passes by you. In general, a huge disappointment from the guys from Von Zerneck-Sertner and ABC Family.
