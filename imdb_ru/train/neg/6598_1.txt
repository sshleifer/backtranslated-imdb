This "film" is a parody. No, wait - an abomination. NO, WAIT - this is without a doubt the absolute worst film ever made with your favorite characters created and created by other actors. <br /> <br /> I thought “Inspector Clouseau” with Alan Arkin (!) Instead of Peter Sellers was ridiculous and blasphemous, but even dared to “remake” Stan Laurel, and Oliver Hardy - a dirty and dirty guy. <br /> <br /> Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy were dead, respectively, from 1957 and 1965. Why someone could even think that the appropriate updates for L & H would be in the person of Bronson Pinshot, and Gaylard Sarten would be beyond me. I tuned in completely, expecting to be scared and confused, and of course I was not disappointed. Anyone who is involved in this pitiful idiotic shame should be enchanted by everything related to Hollywood and filmmaking. AVOID THIS FILM AT ALL COSTS - YOU SHOULD BE WARNED.
