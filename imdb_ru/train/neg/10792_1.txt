This film offers only the most stupid talk. In fact, I most likely could not have imagined how meaningless the film was, how synthetic the dialogues could be up to an hour ago, but then I saw this video again. In the film, which does not depend on a powerful script, one can expect, at least, a good game and tasty conversations and even humor, but in this film they are not enough. You heard me that they lack them all. I donâ€™t like any thing in this movie. I hate this. I'm sure someone will do that too. the name is intended to give the target audience some thoughts about nudity and so on, but it fails even with nudity. I don't know how, but I was afraid to watch this thing for an hour or so, and I definitely recommend that you not do it. the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. If someone invites you to watch it, ruuun awaaaaay saaaaaave your liiiiiiiiife
