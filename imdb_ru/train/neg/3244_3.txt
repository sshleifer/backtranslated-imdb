The effect achieved in this story about a psychiatrist who is associated with fraudsters is so well brought up that I must assume that this was the desired intention. The sets are artificial, and I never felt like watching a movie. It seemed that the actors simply read their lines and did not answer each other. Although the film contains elements of early noir (except color), the approach is so exaggerated that I almost have to conclude that this is a parody of the genre. <br /> <br /> Given that the presentation was not appealing to me, I at least expected an interesting story. I am usually quite slow to learn when it comes to storylines with plot twists, but you could see what happened here in the first fifteen minutes. By the time “Gee, I forgot $ 80,000”, I thought to myself that this is really funny. For a psychiatrist with established experience in gaming addiction, behaving so foolishly is impossible. If at some stage she behaved like a normal, intelligent person, the whole story would have collapsed. <br /> <br /> This wooden production left me alone.
