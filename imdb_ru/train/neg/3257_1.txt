After watching the movie, I had the first question: is it ironic or not? After reading a few comments about the character Doc Savage and the comic, I realized that this film should not be ironic. So, the story tells us about the American-American superdoc saving the South American republic from evil. Sounds like a typical story. But this one comes in such an unreal way that it becomes ridiculous. The obligatory final bout shows the worst martial arts performance I've ever seen. The film may be interesting for budget designers as a bad example.
