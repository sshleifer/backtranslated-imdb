I watched this movie when I was a young guy, full of fierce hormones, and he was as sexy as I had ever seen - or had ever seen. Perhaps it was not a great movie. I think it is not. I don’t really remember this to tell you the truth. I remember only sexual chemistry between Crosby and Bean. No woman in ANY movie has ever done this for me, like the incredibly sexy Katie in this movie. I have not seen him since I first saw him on TV in the 70s, and I don’t think I want to see him again, because I am sure it will be a disappointment - my hormones are not so raging and I become more exhausted over the years. However, when I recall the scene in the shower, I still remember how great it was when back. <br /> <br /> Added later: after watching the movie, I found it dangerous to return home. What was once erotic is now rather tamed. Older women and young men still work for me, but not as much as before, perhaps because I'm not 12 years old anymore. This older woman is younger than me. In addition, the lack of professionalism of all this was not perceived by my twelve-year-old mind. <br /> <br /> Moral: sometimes it is better not to revise the past.
