One of the most stupid films of the 1940s, unbearable homely haunted comedy with music starring Kay Kaiser. Kayer, the leader of the orchestra and radio star (and the eternal mediocre fraternity in college), was a kind of predecessor to Spike Jones, picked him up for his guests and willingly supported him by a cheerful troupe of musicians. He is hired to a birthday party in a gloomy mansion, where poison darts brought from Africa are framed and hung on the wall. Shindig is surrounded by a creepy judge, a terrible professor, an ominous swami, lots of giggling women and bad enough jokes to fill three pictures of Bob Hope. Songs (Jimmy McHugh and Johnny Mercer) - nothing can boast, and none of them are overly confident Kaiser, reinforced by his "elbow in the ribs", which turns 1940 a year ago to ten years. * from ****
