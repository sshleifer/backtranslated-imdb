Just bought a VHS for this film for two dollars, I wasted my money! Hey, I dig Adam "Batman" West and Tina "Giligan Island" to Louise, but hello! This third directorial production is a remake of a dozen other biker films; A crazy bunch of biker psychos enters the city of Hick, beats everyone and everything, and then wins a dashing hero in a man. Adam West looks like a hero, but he lacks a cape and its Batman form. Sorry, just not the same. Tina L. looks very nervous and scared of the whole show, but at least we know what happened to Ginger when she was rescued from the island ... LOL! Bikers are a variegated group, and the famous ones have ever acted again, or at least they shouldn't. Hell horsemen is hell to watch!
