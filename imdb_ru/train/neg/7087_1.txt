I wouldn't write comments online, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Not only is it filmed as a soap series (“Young and Restless” are really filmed by professionals compared to this), but it also has terrible cuts. It has no effect. It is full of useless trash. <br /> <br /> Here is an example: the guy wants to kill the main character because he was fired because of him. So (after a lot of crap), here they are: the guy puts the knife in the throat and says something like "You're dead now." Then the main character says: “If you kill me, you die. I told the police that you were threatening me. ” So (the killer) the guy says (he is about to cry): “Oh no ... the police follow me !? !! Oh my God". <br /> <br /> Remember: this is just an example. I really can't believe this film really exists. So: if you want to watch the worst movie ever ... come on, I recommend it :)
