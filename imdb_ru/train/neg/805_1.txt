Robert Wagner is the evil chief of Digicron, a telecommunications company with a virus that kills people. <br /> <br /> “You say that a software virus has become a real virus that can kill people - this may be medically possible, but impossible from my system. <br /> <br /> “I need to write some new virus software of my own to intercept it - it may take some time” <br /> <br />. but not for software, but for killing people. <br /> <br /> Do not miss the moment of love “I am in Virology” and, perhaps, the first in the history of the film with the death of death from the braille keyboard.
