they have sex with melons in Asia. Good. At first I doubted this, but, seeing the wayward cloud, I changed my mind and finally made sure that they have sex with watermelons, with people, dead or alive. no safe sex, of course. (terribly ugly) lead man shoots a lady in his mouth after he is dead. never heard of hiv? don't guess. <br /> <br /> The rest of this movie is mostly boring, but also incredibly disgusting. in fact, in some places it was so disgusting that I could not tear my virgin eyes off. sex with dead people! How gross is it? and what is the message behind all this? we need water, we need melons, we need to be dead to have sex? sorry but it stinks!
