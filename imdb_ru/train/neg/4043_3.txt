The film begins with a promise, but drags on in the world of sepia distance and alienation. We were left hanging, but there was nothing left but languid shots of serious and thoughtful male faces to enjoy. Of course, there is no rope up the wall to help us climb. It's a shame, because the concept is not devoid of merits. <br /> <br /> We can only wonder why a loving couple - no less than a father and a son - should be so alienated from the real world that their own world is preferable when claustrophobia beyond imagination. This loss of presence in the real world, too obvious and unnecessary, contrasts with the fact that his son entered the service in the armed forces. Why not a circus, so that we could at least appreciate some color? We are left with a grim sense of loss, but unfortunately, without enlightenment, which is confusing, given that the film seems to be about some form of achievement that is inaccessible to all of us.
