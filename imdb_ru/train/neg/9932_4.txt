Dan Durya, quite a decent actor in a B-film who made many twins in the 1940s, can't do anything about it: a young man is accused of killing an unhappy married singer; when he is sentenced to death, his wife decides for herself to decide the case with the help of the husband of the dead woman. After the dazzling first shot, the film quickly settles into the B-film formula. It certainly looks good, but the turn is colorless and the cast (including Peter Lorre and Broderick Crawford) is a bit harsh. Based on Cornell Woolrich's novel, and passable for single viewing. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
