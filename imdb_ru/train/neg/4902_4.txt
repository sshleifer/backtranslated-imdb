Almost in the same league as the rather brutal Yonfang Color Blossoms, Spider Lillies makes a point of reference in the fact that you can create cutting-edge cinemas without any restrictions or even great difficulties. This is a Taiwanese film that is becoming a threatening pace novelty today, but more than this tidbit, we can find very little in the way of noteworthy. <br /> <br /> You should know that supposedly Spider Lillies is also a lesbian story, but in every aspect it is nothing but a plastic trick that you can lure into easily seductive and credulous. In several ways, we repeat the recently released Taiwanese edition of Eternal Summer. Then it was gay men who were undergoing treatment; now we have the same thing with women. “Zero Chow” is, for your non-existent edification, a story that is likely to reach fifteen years of age. They coped with some positions in the art house, but in the end it led to the most senseless, just uninteresting raids. <br /> <br /> Hong Kong angle is manifested in the form of Isabella Leung (Bug Me Not, Isabella, Diary), here on the sport of her most glance look not yet. Although Isabella in Spider Lillies is somewhat cute in her previous work, she is sluggish and absent in most departments. Either her heart didn’t understand it, or the whole field of lesbian drama did not quite attract her feelings. <br /> <br /> She works as a tattoo artist from Taipei who is shy, a hermit and is responsible for a mentally retarded younger brother. , played by John Shen, which, fortunately, provides the film with a one-of-a-kind thematic redemption function. Isabella's character, strangely named Takeco, but presumably originally from Hong Kong, is soon associated with disgruntled youth Jade (Rainey Young from the fondly recalled Meteorite Garden). The latter lives with her grandmother and has a whole list of complaints due to the fact that she was left by her parents and life in general. Of course, the grandmother's component works well and touchingly, but otherwise, Jade, in the role of the protagonist, is just as motionless as her colleague, Takeco. <br /> <br /> Two women share the past and a lot of inadequately covered fear, when Jade works as a webcam girl, while Takeko supports her father’s legacy with a unique tattoo of Lilly's spider adorned with her hand. Jade also wants to acquire this particular design, which leads Takeco to explore the inner sensations of the problem through flashbacks and a rather minimal conversation with cool Jade. <br /> <br /> Well, if there is a small discourse to write a home base, at least the communication is unforgettable? In a word, no. They kiss and pretend to fulfill the abomination close to the end, but, as Eternal Summer recently reminded us, in light years, the gap between showing sexual content and what ticket buyers think they are going to see is sexual content. <Br /> <br /> This cynical expectation is building the fate of the spider Lily. With this weak plot, hooliganism and the complete absence of relics that can be taken away from the theater, this view makes Color Blossoms look good, if you think about it. At least there we have some Theresa Cheung breasts. No, Spider Lillies is not an AV masterpiece, and it should be excluded from the playlist of even the most mundane and timid film festival GLB. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly for pseudo-indie release, even the soundtrack and cinematography do not create moments. inspiration This is just as good, as it greatly facilitates the passage of Spider Lillies. Believe us, avoid it, and you will not miss anything good. <br /> <br /> Rating: * *
