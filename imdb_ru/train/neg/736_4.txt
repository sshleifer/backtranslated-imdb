Twenty years ago, a five-year-old boy, Michael Hawthorne, witnessed his father kill his mother with an ax on an empty road and later committed suicide. Today, Michael (Gordon Kerry) invites his girlfriend Peg (Stacy Grant) and his best friends Chris (Mick Agnew), Jennifer (Emmanuel Voigier), Lisa Ann (Kelly Benson), Ned (Brandon Beizer), Mitch Maldives (Philip Rhys ) and Trish (Rachel Hayward) spend Halloween at the cottage with their grandparents on their farm. He asks his friends to wear costumes that represent their greatest inner fear, and together with his Indian friend Crowe (Byron Main Moon) they will hold an ancient Indian festival using Morty's (John Fedele) carved wooden dummy, which will eliminate their fears. forever and ever. Michael's biggest fear is to become a serial killer like his father, but something goes wrong, and Morty turns into a father, killing his friends. <br /> <br /> Fear: Resurrection is a disappointing and meaningless trait. a film that uses an interesting concept of eliminating each friend’s greatest inner fear before he grows up, but in a dirty scenario full of cliché. There are several exaggerated speeches, for example, Miss Betsy Palmer; others are very weak, but overall the game is good. Unfortunately, there is no explanation why the dummy is activated; moreover, despite being surrounded by close friends, the group does not feel pain or sadness when each one of them dies. A slow pace for more than fifty minutes could be used to create a better dramatic situation. At the very end, Michael demonstrates the charm that interested his father, whom I had not noticed in this story. I do not know whether the previous link was edited on a DVD released in Brazil, with a duration of 87 minutes. Special effects are very reasonable for a B-film. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): “Fear 2: Mind the Noite de Halloween” (“Fear 2: One night of Halloween”)
