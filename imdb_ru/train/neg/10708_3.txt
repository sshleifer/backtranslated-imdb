This film had the potential to be really good, given that some elements of the plot were borrowed from THE HIDDEN sci-fi action movie. And Dolph always gives some silly appeal to his roles. But someone somewhere really threw the ball at that. <br /> <br /> Dolph plays a monk who kicks ass (!), who travels to New York to find the key that opens the door under his monastery, in which the Antichrist is imprisoned for 2000 years. He must fight the minion, which is a spirit that jumps from body to body just as hidden and Jason goes to hell. The minion naturally needs a key so that he can release the antichrist. An annoying female archaeologist goes on the trip, and together she and Dolph are being pursued by the obsessed bodies of the minions. <br /> <br /> If I make this sound funny, forget about it. The pace is very awkward and sluggish, at best, acting, and the battle scenes are bad. Dolph walks around in his role and speaks some of the worst conversations in his career. <br /> <br /> The cheese factor really begins to appear at the end, when the minion fights with an army of monks with machine guns in the monastery, but the rest of this film is a snoozefest. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I really wanted to love this.
