Veronica Mars's biggest mystery is not the one she had to face on the screen. <br /> <br /> Rather, the mystery is why this constant disappointment of ratings is still on the air. This week marked the nadir for Veronica Mars: she took 146 out of 146 shows in the big 6 (Big becomes soon 5). Yes, you read that right. Veronica Mars was beaten by every show of the now-defunct WB and every show in UPN. It was beaten by all shows on Fox and, of course, all shows on ABC, CBS and NBC. <br /> <br /> Now let's say, hip-hips hypers: but it was a replay. But everything that was on TV this week was largely a repetition! It is incomprehensible why CW chose this proven disappointment of ratings, as one of the few shows that it was saved from UPN. <br /> <br /> Obviously, something is happening behind the scenes. Favors are exchanged and affect trade. <br /> <br /> Sorry to be so cynical, but what other explanation is there? The line “Veronica Mars has potential” is clearly dead because she had two years to establish herself and could not do it. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is the influence and influence of Joel Silver, but, to be honest, I'm at a loss for some reason why someone decided to spend their influence on a bad show that the viewers don’t watch. <br /> <br /> Great mystery and very unfavorable debut for CW.
