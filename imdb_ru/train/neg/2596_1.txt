Oh my God! I kept waiting until this movie “starts” ... then I waited until it redeems itself ... and when it didn't work out, I just sat there, stunned that: 1) it could be so bad, and 2) that I just spent a couple of hours on just nonsense. I had faith that Drew might not have made it bad from the film ... and boy, I ever lost my faith! Do not worry about that! Drew tried, but the film was poorly written, badly acted, and just badly thought out! I can’t believe that such a bad script was ever funded. He had a million chances to actually do something with this idea (the word “concept” is too big for this film to claim it!), And this NOT JUST JUST! This is just a pity! When another reviewer came to the conclusion that this is not the worst, it confuses me! Because believe me, if it got worse, I would have cut my wrists before finishing!
