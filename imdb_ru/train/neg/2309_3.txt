I have a high tolerance for the strange, but to be honest, some films go far beyond the strange - so much so that they hurt your brain. This is such a movie. Attempting to understand it or even explain it is impossible, and I think that the film is best understood during drug use - it is so incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a very cute Japanese cat animation. However, suddenly there are tons of distorted and sometimes disturbing things - it makes me wonder if I lose something in translation. Nevertheless, even if this is so, why should we relate to the images of a magical stunt involving the dismemberment of a lady with the mind, a bowel movement, vomiting, animal ignition in fire, etc. It all really seemed random and rather terrible. Oddly enough, and I do not know why, some see this as a brilliant work. I just don't get it.
