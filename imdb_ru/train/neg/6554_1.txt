I would not give this film a rating, it is not worthy. I only watched it because I'm a Pfieffer fan. I love her and will watch everything she does. Even in this mud, she did not disappoint. Each scene in which it was located, made the viewer watch ... in anticipation of ... something, but nothing happened. He had good storylines, but they suddenly ended as soon as it started. Some other characters had the potential, but nothing happened. <br /> <br /> Pfiffer was 29 years old when she was making this film and was the cutest. The wardrobe and set were surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> I can watch basically anything, and rarely come across a movie, but I can't find something in it that I like, but it was stupid. I donâ€™t understand <br /> <br /> The worst thing about all this is that at the end there was a big hanger for rocks. He had a final scene that woke you up and said: "Wow, this film finally goes to some place and then the commercials." Sadness for good. <br /> <br /> I agree with the review, which said that .99 would buy 3 cans of cat food, and it would be more exciting to watch my cat eat. Well said. In fact, this comment was more interesting than the film, because it sums it up so well. I also spent 0.99 cents on this dud.dud.dud.
