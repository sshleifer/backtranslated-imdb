This film is a good example of how you can sell a film through media manipulation, which is nothing more than a funny TV comedy. In Puerto Rico, the daily newspaper with the widest circulation constantly writes about the wonders of this film, almost silencing everyone else. Coincidentally, the newspaper with the second largest circulation belongs to the same owners. The weekly newspaper “Claridad” is the only newspaper on the island that analyzed the form and content of the film and pointed out all its flaws, cliches and poor writing. <br /> <br /> Just because the film makes part of the audience laugh with light and obvious jokes, and because you can recognize the actors and the scenery, it does not make it an acceptable movie.
