This film had the potential, and I was ready to try it, but there are so many temporary problems that are so obvious - it's hard to swallow when you are treated like such an idiot. <br /> <br /> In the movie “Rise to Strength” the end of the sixties. Carlito's path unfolds in the mid-to-late seventies. To make this film realistic, it would have to be installed in the fifties, if not in the late forties. <br /> <br /> “The power” has no signs of Gail (Pennelope Ann Miller), no signs of Kleinfeld, no signs of Rolando, with whom Karlito allegedly ran into his “flourishing”. None of the main characters in the original movie was in this movie. It is assumed that we believe that Carlito met all these people over several years. <br /> <br /> On the way to power, Carlito ends up walking along the beach talking about his retirement to paradise, which he wanted to do. in the original movie. In addition, the prequel creates the characters Rocco and Earl - what should happen to them, since they are clearly not in the way of Carlito? It is also difficult to understand how Carlito could have a relationship with the Italians, whom he has in the original film, watching the events of the Rise to Power. Where is the talyluchchi in this movie? Between these two films, probably seven years, and five of them he spends in prison. It is like trying to insert a square plug into a round hole. <br /> <br /> Obviously, no one was interested in telling a good story, and that they were more interested in earning a few dollars by making an ordinary gangster movie. and throw a character named Carlito Brigante into the story. The film had good moments, but I think it would be better to leave this film alone than to try to make it a prequel to the Path of Carlito. <br /> <br /> If you are determined to see this movie, the only advice I can give is not to think of the movie as a linear prequel. Think of it as spaghetti westerns with a Clint Eastwood man without a name, in other words, two films that have the same character, but are not necessarily related to each other.
