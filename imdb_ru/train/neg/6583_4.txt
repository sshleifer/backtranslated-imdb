An interesting idea and storyline that didn't quite work. <br /> <br /> When you watch a movie, you will probably feel as unhappy with the ending as I am. I really didnâ€™t know who to support the film for, Tei Diggs looked bored as a detective, the rest of the characters seem so one-dimensional and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> If the victim Alicia (Mia Kirchner)) we were more like a sweet girl, we might be pleased to see the plot unfold, and the criminal was brought to justice. The problem was that she was as shitty as the other girls, turning from a cute girl into a cunning opportunist. I can not understand the moral meaning of this film, and as a detective and thriller, it does not work.
