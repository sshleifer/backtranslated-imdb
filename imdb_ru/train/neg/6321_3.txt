I can not imagine that someone, after a million years, would want to see this movie. Not because it was one of the worst ever made (was not), but largely because he is about 20 years old and so-so from the mainstream. I tried to find out where I had seen the actor before, and it surfaced. So, yes, the child stops playing in the little league, because he does not like nuclear bombs, it attracts the attention of the mainstream media and a quick solution to the Cold War. The end. Of course, fantasy, but one so stupid that will make John Lennon blush. Since terrorism has replaced communism as “ism”, which scares the hell out of us, this film really has no meaning except for (an inaccurate) look back in those times. Writing, acting and cinema are also undeveloped. The reason I rated him as high as I was was because I watched this movie about 50 times when I was 5-6 years old, and I still have a place for it, but now I understand that he is not quite mustard. Thus, if the law of large numbers remains in force, and someone finally decides to check out this film, realize that there are much better ways to spend time, but also much worse. (For now, I will refrain from the tirade of John K.)
