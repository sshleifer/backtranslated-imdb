This is complete and absolute rubbish, an excellent example of what a BAD film looks like; it cannot please anyone, even fans of b-films. Do not repeat, do not waste your precious time on this piece of garbage. Bad game, bad direction, terrible (but I mean really terrible) script and a complete lack of idea what entertainment is (any form) I bought a DVD for 3 dollars, I swear I could almost pay someone took him. Burning would not be enough for what this film did to me. I like bi-movies, killer toys, strange lagoons, but far from it. Do you know those films that are so bad that they are funny? Not even. Just old pathetic.
