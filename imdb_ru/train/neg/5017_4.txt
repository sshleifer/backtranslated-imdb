I just finished this movie ... I saw it on a shelf with a video, and, being a fan of Nick Stal, I just needed to rent it. Honestly, he probably should have stayed on the shelf. The idea was interesting, and there were some pretty clever turns, but somehow I guessed almost all of them before they appeared. And the film just went too far in the end, in my opinion ... if you worry about watching it, you will understand what I mean! <br /> <br /> A positive thing, Nick Game Stahl was great (especially considering what he worked with). Eddie Kay Thomas was good too, but he always plays the same type of character ... too much Paul Finch from American Pie, which I like. <br /> <br /> And finally, the worst part of this film should be the unemotional performance of John Jones ... I think that a beautiful face is really important in Hollywood.
