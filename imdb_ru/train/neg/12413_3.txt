I'm not going to say that this film is terrible, because I have seen worse, but it is not even half decent. <br /> <br /> The plot is very confusing. I could not understand what was happening and where things were going. When the movie ended, I was left scratching my head. I traced the loans to the end to see if they had anything after them that could clear up the situation, but when the loans ran out, it was. I felt that I was shaking from one weak point of the plot to another throughout the entire film, with little or no transition between them. <br /> <br /> Character development is very superficial. I could not understand when someone was angry or had anger at someone. I could not tell if half the characters had to be drunk, stoned, mentally retarded, or they simply had a bad actor to portray them. This film seems to be based on stereotypes (to its credit, they are difficult to avoid when you make a film about a singer in a rock band), which MUST facilitate character development, as many other films have already illustrated the suffering of a child who has been mistreated or tested a heroin addict trying to get in order. Stereotypes are easy to portray, which explains why so many bad films tend to abuse stereotypical characters. In this film, on the other hand, stereotypical characters are used to the left and right, but then they try to make them as incomprehensible as possible. <br /> <br /> Another problem with the characters is that they seemed rejected without explaining the reasons. I think this is normal, because so little time was spent on character development, that I really had no opportunity to learn any of them, so I never missed any of them. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, Sadie was singing. It's horrible. The music that supports it is not a laureate, but it is usually drowned out by the squeals produced by Sadie’s vocals. I swear there is one moment in the film where she sings a song for at least 10 minutes. I seriously thought I would have to turn it off during this howl. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is confusing. Characters are poorly developed, actions in Georgia are wooden and tough, Sadie’s character is transferred from one bad situation to another, without any background or explanation. The music was unbearable, and I can’t think of a good reason to watch this movie if you don’t have a craving for cinematic pain.
