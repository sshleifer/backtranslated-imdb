A bloody maniac with cannibalistic inclinations rapes a woman. He was shot dead by two policemen, and then he was resurrected from the grave because of some kind of satanic rite committed by an evil heresy. The hunt for women continues with this zombie demon. The sacrificed infant returns from the grave and again wants the maniac to die, but only with the help of the police it will come true ... <br /> <br /> A bloody 65-minute mess ... Excited zombies, a doll - children, S & M, corrupt and perverted policemen, repentant heretics who seek refuge before Jesus Christ, and three text screens at the end of the film, explaining to us what happened to the surviving policeman (yes, we should know!) ... Two decent shots are not can save the situation. I have seen the worst horror films, but this one was also pretty bad. Recommended only for very stubborn fans of the genre.
