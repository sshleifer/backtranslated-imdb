Reflecting on the fact that the main character of Bubble appears at the end of the film, I recall the “Machinist” of recent years with Christian Bale. The only difference between the two films is the literal physical weight of the characters. <br /> <br /> An underestimated but quite realistic depiction of the life of a small town. The name is a reason for reflection. Perhaps we, the viewers, are the ones who participate in “Bubble”, since we are not given any winnings in films in 90 minutes. Audience reactions were often complacent and judgmental, which clearly indicated how detached people could see any thread of humanity in characters so alien to them. These characters are those who are called George W. for a second term. <br /> <br /> A sober look at how reality TV has spoiled our sense of reality when viewers switch to their feet to exit as soon as the role of credits. This film has its merits and deserves consideration for not speaking directly.
