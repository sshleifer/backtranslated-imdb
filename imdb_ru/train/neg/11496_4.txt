acting / controlled documentary on one of the darkest places in Guatemala. portrayed as fun, safe ... but a sad place where a bunch of sex workers play on a football team who’s gathered seems no more than a week away! The main goal of the documentary is to prove that society pushes off such “workers”, although solutions for these poor women are never achieved, except for the fact that the people who documented it made them a kind of “stars” the title says so) in exchange for using this documentary, similar to a reality show. this, however, has its own documented reality ... but, unfortunately, this has nothing to do with the storyline. I would not agree to see it again; but I would recommend it for general cultural purposes only.
