I'm a fan of Matthew Modina, but this film, which I stumbled upon a telegram, is absolutely meaningless. I see that the screenwriter and the director were the same, so there was no one who could check out her worst instincts. There are no surprises, original lines and original characters. Golden Fish was basically the most responsive character. What a waste of all this acting talent. Given how expensive it is to shoot in New York now, I have to wonder how it was done at all. And if you're wondering why I watched it at all, it appeared after the film, which I like on cable, and I left it while I was working at the computer. This is not a very demanding picture!
