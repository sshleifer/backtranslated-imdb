Starring an unknown cast, who seems to remain so, this “film” is another cheap slasher film that amazes me with how it was released. In particular, I have no problems with horror and slasher, because they are my favorite. But when they do IT BAD, it really requires a monkey, and it's no wonder the genre is so hard. The story is as cloudless and without any imagination as possible when a bunch of people in a cabin in the woods were beaten by this zombie / ghost guy. This is not the story that sucks the most, it is a disgusting acting and dialogue, home directorial quality and a terrible soundtrack. Not to mention the ludicrous effects and some incredibly lazy films - these morons are outside in clear daylight, but we have to believe that this is night ?? What the hell was the director thinking with this move? What, he had only one day to take it all off? Was he afraid of the dark? (It's fun to see a cop walking in a clear daylight with a torch, which, however, looks like black tar) <br /> <br /> I think the positive side for the actors is that they look like people working in the local supermarket so that, at least, they could escape from this film without even noticing. I am sure that one of the "teenagers" plays bingo in a local pub, but she is 40-45 years old. <br /> <br /> Anyway, good for a laugh, but it's just another waste of time and film.
