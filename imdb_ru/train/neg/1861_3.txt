You know what movie you get into when the main character of a serial killer is transported to an electric chair (something like a bakery), only to collide with a prison machine (and I'm not shooting it up) a genetic engineering tank truck. The mucus that spills out melts it and merges its DNA with snow, creating our main character, the killer snowman. <br /> <br /> However, my favorite part of the film is a shot taken over the shoulder of a snowman who beats some poor thing, in which his hands look suspiciously like a pair of white tack gloves. <br /> <br /> Mmmm, damn ...
