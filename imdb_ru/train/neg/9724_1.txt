Poor Tobe Hopper. He shot the classic horror of all time "Texas Chainsaw Massacre." Since then, all he did was terrible. This is probably the worst ... and it says a lot. It's about a man (Brad Dourif) who is able to make things (and people) catch fire ... or something like that. Hardly an original idea (does anyone remember “Firestarter”?) This is a real mess ... literally EVERYTHING is done wrong! Pathetic acting game (even Dourif!), Original script, loud production values, crappy special effects ... all is BAD !!!!! Must miss ... not even good for a laugh.
