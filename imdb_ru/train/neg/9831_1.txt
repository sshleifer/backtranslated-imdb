I tried to watch this movie without being able to really watch it, because while it must have a “good” message; the problem is that it is obviously created in accordance with one specific interpretation of the Holy Scriptures. Interpretation, in my opinion, will mislead many people. In addition, I am a movie maniac, and acting in this film was completely unacceptable. Never before did I want to get a negative score for rating a movie. So, if you want to be constantly preached by those who have no authority, then by all means get this film. This comment is also a warning for people who love or love fiction, because the name will deceive many people. It was a bad movie, because the main idea had opportunities, and these opportunities were wasted. The only quality of the film is that it made me understand that the character in The Time Machine probably had to show a little more moral outrage about the strange behavior of those who are in his future.
