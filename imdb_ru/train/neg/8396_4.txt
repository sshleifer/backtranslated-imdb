... but I also saw better. <br /> <br /> The story here is predictable - the film crew is trying to shoot a horror film in the place where the killings occurred. Three assumptions what happens. This is not a complete bomb - the actors are pretty good with the professionals John Ireland, Faith Domerg and John Carradine, who perform better. It's pretty well done - for a low-budget movie. Just do not expect nudity, curses, blood or blood (the film has a very soft rating of PG). I have never been bored - everything is fine when I look at a quiet night. I saw it on video - it was a HORRIBLE imprint - very dark, and some scenes were impossible to see. Yet I did not hate it, and it does have a cool end that surprised me - basically nothing happens until then, so it takes you by surprise. Worth seeing, but only if you are the most complete horror movie.
