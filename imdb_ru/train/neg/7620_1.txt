I rented this film because it sounded quite interesting, but to my horror, this film was the worst I've ever seen! I read a comment from Gumby 8, and it should be part of a team or film crew. If Gambi-8 is not a 4-year-old child or some crazy cult member, no one in their right mind would think that this film has potential at all. <br /> <br /> I could not believe the comments Gambi-8. <br /> <br /> Quote: “From the inspirational animation of“ Dune ”to a fast tempo ... this film makes the eye move and works so well that re-viewing is not unexpected.” <br /> <br /> Animation is the only aspect of the film that was interesting, and the fact that the movie makes the eye move is good, because you keep looking for any type of wait. I mean, give me a break, Halloween was shot with a budget of $ 100,000 and a painted mask, and also, by the way, became a cult classic. As for "re-viewing is not unexpected," I think he made a typo. <br /> <br /> Another quote from Gambi-8, the only fan: “Acting is also the strength of the film.” /> <br /> With all due respect to the actors, their play is nothing other than the talent of Robert Napton. <br /> <br /> The catchy slogan: “Beware of the hour between twilight and darkness” <br /> <br /> This is because in this film there is no twilight or darkness. <br /> <br /> MPAA rating "Rated R for some violence / blood" <br /> <br /> The only blood you see is some kind of red paint on a sheet over a dead body that you never see. As far as I know, it can be a bunch of grass. <br /> <br /> Summing up, I saw the horrors of the 50s, 60s and 70s. I saw what I thought was absolutely the worst, and some were very good. The director of this film either did not make any attempts, either slept, or took acid. In any case, I think the actors deserve a round of applause for trying to save a very bad director job. I would give this movie a rating of .5 for the movie "B".
