I ordered a film from Korea, because I was additional in it, and it was interesting to see how it came out. <br /> <br /> After seeing it, I can say that I am ashamed that I had some part of it. I am ashamed not only for myself, but also for everyone who participated in the creation of this mockery of the British “comedy”. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning to the end, the film is predictable, tedious, boring, monotonous and Reliable to such an extent that several times I really do not believe my eyes from the screen. While you’re not actually watching a movie, it’s hard to imagine how romantic and non-comedy a comedy can be. <br /> <br /> This is not only a bad story, but a poorly made film. In one scene you can see a runner or assistant director showing when S.A. wiped. I will post more details on this in the Fools section. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, he really caused me emotions (disappointment, rage, embarrassment ??)
