This film is pure guano. Mom always said that if you can't say anything good ... but even mom would say that I had to contribute to warn others about this film. <br /> <br /> I can guarantee that this is a film that Jeffrey Rush wishes would just go away. I hope that Greg Kinnear fired his agent from the gun for giving him the script. After this, Ben Stiller is probably praying for someone to say: "There is something else in Mary." I have always been a fan of Wes Studi, thanks to everyone that you consider saints, that he wore a mask in the film, so maybe people will not identify the film with him. <br /> <br /> Everything starts promisingly from a stylistic style. faking the cinematography of Batman movies, and then just losing something ... like a coherent storyline and half decent effects. <br /> <br /> Jokes are telegraphed an hour before the highlight, and even then they do not work. If you want to see a spectacular parody of the world of comics, see “Chasing Amy” <br /> <br /> EXECUTE! DO NOT PASS FROM "SECRET MEN"!
