There are a few encouraging words to say about it, but I can mention that Matt Dillon is trying hard to do something out of nothing, as well as a lot of divided screens and graphics that are worth it. Since most racing films suffer from the fact that car lovers are not so smart, we end up with such films. <br /> <br /> Lindsay Lohan, who was so surprised at “Evil Girls”, should make the best decisions about what role to take, Here she can only fail. <br /> <br /> Children will only be entertained slightly, because they try to please adults more than children (although they are still rather stupid). Those whom I saw in the theater were not interested in a couple of minutes. And as a family sports film, it's terrible. The best moments are at the beginning in the dump, creating some feeling, and later in the car-hit festival, creating some tension. If you develop a car as a central character, you must develop it better than here. After several mandatory racing scenes, you have the best: the ability to leave the multiplex in your car.
