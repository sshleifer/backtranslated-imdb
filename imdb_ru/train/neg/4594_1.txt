I had numerous problems with this film. <br /> <br /> It contains basic factual information about quantum mechanics, which is good. Although quantum physics has been around for more than 50 years, the film presents this information in a grandiose way, which seems to say: “Aren't you just amazed by this!” Well, not really. These are no longer earth-destroying revelations. In any case, I was already familiar with quantum theory, and the fact that particles should be described by wave equations, etc., is not new. <br /> <br /> However, the main problem I encountered in this film is the way these people use quantum theory as a way to provide a scientific basis for mysticism and spiritualism. I have no serious problems with mysticism and spiritualism, but quantum mechanics actually have nothing to do with these things, and it should be kept separate. The people they interviewed for this film start with the ideas of quantum theory, and then take a leap to say that just by thinking about something, you can change the question around you, so we must think positively in order to have a positive influence. on the world. and make our life better. The arguments are completely ridiculous, and the conclusions do not logically follow from quantum theory. For every so-called “expert” they interviewed for this film, there are many theoretical physicists who would completely disagree. They would rightly point out that the unpredictability of the subatomic world does not support the mystical ideas about our spiritual connectedness. <br /> <br /> It bothers me that people are going to watch this movie and eat it completely because it leaves them with a nice positive feeling. The main idea of ​​the film is based on a complete misinterpretation of quantum theory, and it is just as bad in its arguments as any attempt to justify organized religion with similar pseudoscientific arguments. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> Oh yes. At one point, one of the “experts” said that since throughout history most of the assumptions that people made about the world turned out to be false, so the assumptions that we currently hold about the world are also likely to be false. BUT? It absolutely does not follow. And even if this is so, I do not understand how this helps his argument. I mean that if his ideas ever become general assumptions, then I think we will have to assume that they, too, are false, based on his own reasoning.
