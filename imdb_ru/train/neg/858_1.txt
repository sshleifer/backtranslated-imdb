I hate this movie! It was ANYTHING, like a book, and only thinking about it drives me crazy. If you are watching a movie before reading a book, then yes, this is a good movie. But King's book was AWESOME, and this film was not like it. I mean, the general meaning may be similar, but most aspects of the film are completely different. The ending for example! So it's very intense in the book, and Danny and Wendy run off a second before the hotel explodes. but in this horrible version of the movie, Jack seems to be leading them through a dumb labyrinth ... yes, there is no labyrinth in the book and there is no reason for that. The other part that pissed me off is that Jack is just killing Mr. Halloran! what the hell, he's basically the hero of the book, and they just kill him, as if he's not important. Overall it was just bad that the film was so unusual.
