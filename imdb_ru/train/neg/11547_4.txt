what the hell is this? Rangers of power against Freddie? It was watchable and as good as the first film at the beginning, but from the side when the main characters get superpowers in their dreams, he became childish. This shit should have been rated as PG or PG-13, not as R. I expected to see some very mature things, but it was only for 1/3 of the movie. The rest for small children. Plus he is too focused on Christianity. I know that Freddie is a demon, but there are many religions that struggle differently with demons. Why should this always be Christianity? It is full of orientalism and is filled with the superiority of white men / westerners. Do not look at it, show it to young children who love rangers.
