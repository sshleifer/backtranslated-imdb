Karl Panzram lived an amazing life and wrote his memories on scraps of paper, perhaps for the only person who ever did anything selfless for him. The book by Thomas E. Gaddis and James O. Long, The Panzer: Murder Journal, published for the better part of a century after Panzram’s death, gives the historical context of the first-generation American story that he ran away from home. to go west and be a cowboy, to be caught, thrown into the boy's house, repeatedly running away and again and again thrown into prison, subjected to torture and rape. As Panzram grew huge and strong, he sought revenge for what was done to him badly when he traveled around South America, Europe and Africa, and it didn’t matter what kind of people he raped, robbed or killed, because we are all equally useless. <br /> <br /> In this film, thin James Woods is a coarse naughty boy, the mean son of a bitch Karl Panzram, who in the movie is "drunk", overly dramatic and emotional, and who never mentions the joy of sodomizing men and boys. The film does not tell about anything else, especially about him, the traveler and the professional prisoner (for example, robbing former President Taft or releasing Oregon from prison if he gave the word to return). In short, I do not think that Karl would be too happy.
