After watching the many Next Action Star reality shows, TiVo taped this horrible deception for me. For some strange reason - and I can only blame myself - I watched it all, hoping that there would be something unique in the whole film. After such a big fuss about “Midas touch” by Joel Silver with the help of militants, he may want to make sure of his alchemy. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the only atoning value of the entire film was Billy Zane, and even he could not get the note out of the crapper. Having said that, Zayn's performance fluctuates by about 2/3 of the way, as he seems to not even know what else to do except how to look smug. <br /> <br /> Can't blame him here, though. The inscription, frankly, sucks. Let's take ideas from Rat Race, State Enemy, Terminator, Midnight Run, and any bad fiction film you can think of and just rephrase it. And who had the brilliant idea to have two sequences of chasing the bridge in a row? <br /> <br /> Sean Carrigan, the “man of the hour” in “The Star of the Next Action”, shows all the strengths and weaknesses of the casting. Directors mention throughout the series. John Sean plays one note very well, but he tries hard to carry the weight of the film. Frankly, we never think that we don’t care whether he lives or dies about halfway through, because Kerrigan is not in a position to give viewers a reason to even love him. His stupid, but lucky routine is aging, because in reality there is nothing about the character for whom to root for. <br /> <br /> But Carrigan is a dream compared to the wooden, hard Corinne van Rick de Groot. Howard Fine really told her to pretend to be the Terminator in the first half of the movie? I do not think so. I expected her to quote Arnie. Her “performance” character can only be compared to the dramatic depth of “Freddie Got Fingered”, although not so well developed. The camera loves her in dark, dark limousines, but in the harsh daylight her behavior sucks all the energy off the screen. Jeanne Bauer showed a more natural life in her five-minute role than Corinna at any point in her screen time. <br /> <br /> In the end, Sean has a rough appearance to ensure good leadership in the cast, but he shouldn’t have to be left alone. It was just too big a task for him. Jared Elliott's Next Action Star colleague may have been lucky or unlucky with a more dynamic characterization, but this is hard to say, given Jeff Welch’s flimsy scenario. Someone must take the iMac Welch away from him before he hurts himself or anyone else. And finally, Van Rijk de Groote was simply surpassed and was beyond her reach, even for such a full blow. <br /> <br /> Joel Silver should be embarrassed.
