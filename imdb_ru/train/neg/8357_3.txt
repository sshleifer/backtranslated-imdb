Man, oh man! What a piece of dirty filmmaking! But this feeling of guilt comes from my childhood, although I donâ€™t want to admit it. They showed this movie on my main cable system all the time. Where I grew up in San Jose, California (right on the border with Cupertino), our cable system had such a thing as Channel G. And they basically showed the same movie over and over and over and over. Wanda Nevada was one of those movies. I fell in love with young Brooke Shields and loved her languishing adventures in the Grand Canyon in the 1940s. The script makes almost no sense, the direction is bad, a few highlights - the appearance of Henry Fonda, a lot of bad dialogue, that's good, and a good song, Carol King, played for the last credits. Maybe you should be stoned to truly enjoy this movie. And everyone knows that there is no gold in the Grand Canyon!
