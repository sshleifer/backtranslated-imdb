We can start with a wooden game, but this film is a disaster. I grew up in New York and can say that this film offends anyone who is familiar with society or people. I am not even a defender of culture and I discovered that this is a Hollywood piece of garbage, corresponding to its fictional, ridiculous culture and language, which anyone who looks at Sainfeld knows inaccurately. This is a huge waste of time and, even worse, not very interesting, since the result is obvious, and the scenes of confrontation are ridiculously bad. Who acts this way? No one. <br /> <br /> The author’s name sounds Israeli or something like that, but it is clear that he has no idea about the subject he writes about. Looking at his biography, it is shocking that he lived in New York and wondered how much of a real connection he had with the community. Even mediocre films, such as Stranger Among Us, are better and closer to the truth than this idea. Reading the titles of this guy, it is not surprising that he wrote scripts for all films of class “C”, in which stars appear in one way or another. shocking. Maybe he knows someone, because this script is even lower than the nominal for a bad film by Dolph Lundgren.
