First of all, the reason I give this film 2 stars instead of 1 is that at least Peter Falk gave his usual fantastic performance as Lieutenant Colombo. He alone can get 10 stars for trying to save this completely useless attempt to make a film. <br /> <br /> Initially, I was all excited when I read the comment of one author, who Andrew Stevens in this film gave "the performance of his career." I was ready to throw all sorts of insults at the person who made the above comment. Then I thought to myself what else did Stevens? So, I checked and you know, this person was absolutely right. For the 17 years that have passed since This film was made Colombo, it is obvious that every Of the 33 projects that Stevens has participated in since then, it was a complete shit, so itâ€™s doubtful that anyone even saw the rest of his career. <br /> <br /> If you like Colombo, look at the rest of the 69 titles before watching this one. Do yourself a favor and save the worst for last.
