I read the novel Reaper Ben Mezrich a few years ago, and last night I accidentally saw this adaptation. <br /> <br /> Although many years have passed since I first read the story, the differences between the novel and the film are huge. Very important elements that made it all believable, just written out or replaced by bad ones. <br /> <br /> If the plot seems interesting to you: go and take the novel. It is much, much, much better. <br /> <br /> Still 4 out of 10, because it was difficult to stop watching because of the big main plot of Ben Mezrich.
