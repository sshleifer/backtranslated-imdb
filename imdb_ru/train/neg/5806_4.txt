Nowhere near the original. This is a fairly exact copy, not contributing anything new to the story. But the direction is very bad. Basinger is weak - without good direction. Baldwin is just second league compared to McQueen. I watched it just out of curiosity, being a big fan of Pekingpa's masterpiece, and I got what I thought. Almost film B with the second acting and directorial skill. I was not even disappointed, I just do not know what they were trying to do. This remake is not trying to play with the original material, it is not a homage, and he really lacks a really good actor of his era. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of a bad photocopy of a wonderful photo. <br /> It's a waste of your time. Save yourself 2 hours or see the original (again :)))
