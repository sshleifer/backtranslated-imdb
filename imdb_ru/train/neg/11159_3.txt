I saw this movie in the preview, and I must honestly admit that I do not like films with Meryl Streep. This picture was the worst. Half of the theater did not return after the halfway break of the film. I can not blame them, if it were not a true story, in the second half of the picture there was absolutely no need. Shortly before the film was released in time for about ten years, I myself expected the appearance of titles.
