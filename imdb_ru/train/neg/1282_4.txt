Here is one of those films spoiled by the demand of the studio about a happy ending. Conflicts that stretch over years are resolved in a few minutes. It would be much more interesting to introduce a tone of ambiguity. Talented Barbara Stanwick suddenly turned from an independent and assertive woman into a compliant woman whom she had suppressed all her life. Brent, as usual, is all right, and there is a funny situation when Gig Young plays a character named Gig Young. Someone mentions "Gig Young", and then someone appears, but Gig Young, the actor! Although it is worth looking much lower than it could be.
