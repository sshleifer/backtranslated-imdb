As a spiritualist and not a Christian. I thought I was really going to hold on to my faith, but what a burden I am a seer. I thought the film would have excellent arguments, but it received only one-sided views from atheists and Jews ??? And who are all these street people with whom he talks, who do not know the back of the head. Where are the theologians, priests and all that, from which he could argue. Not pensioners who wrote books and graduated in 1970. Personally, this DVD was a waste of time and wasnâ€™t worth my time to check whether the facts are correct or not, or whether I should or should not believe it, because the antichrist told me so. Please think that he has come to the conclusion that he will not find God, because his own ego and demons have overcome him. No, I'm not going to say that the film was stunning to help the atheists reading this feel better. But if you really want to show the world that you care for us, poor souls who believe in Jesus, seduce us with your value, not because you beat the drums.
