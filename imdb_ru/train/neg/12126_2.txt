Here again is another Diane Lane film, where she cheats on her husband. Is this the only role she can play? This time it happens in 1969, and she cheats on her husband with a blouse. I am not surprised because it is very predictable. Then her husband gets angry and throws milk. I would not be surprised if she slept with a milkman. I would not be surprised if she, too, slept with ice cream, because this is a very boring movie. Then, after some splashing of milk, she apologizes and again sees the blouse. Duh. Then, while she does this to him, her son is stung by wasps. My mother always told me not to throw stones at the nest of wasps. This baby mom didn't have time to tell him that, she was too busy with a blouse.
