I'm not sure why I like Dolph Lundgren. I think that when I see it on the screen, I feel that anyone who works hard can succeed regardless of talent. This is a good feeling for all of us who lack talent. Some other reviews indicate how foolish the detention is, but many do not pay attention to the positives. <br /> <br /> Any film where at least one annoying teenager is killed cannot be bad. Why do so many teenage films always have to include stereotypical teenagers? Are there any other teens? Does every group of teenagers have one evil black guy? One genius nerd who nobody likes? One depraved girl who is very friendly and (in this film) pregnant? One disturbing antisocial white child from a broken home, with which everyone agrees, is talented (but what kind of talent is this?). And one laid-back black guy who is in tune with the Universe and so cool that all the other neurotic children trust him. Then add a pair of common supplies of any color. They do not speak much, but at some point they will be shot. <br /> <br /> Detention would be better if the bad guys blew up the school. Preferably with writers inside. The dialogue is bad, and the plot is even worse. When the bad guys (and the girl) finally hijack the wagon with drugs, they get into the wagon and get it right. They take the van to school because they want to repaint the van in the school paint shop, but they still can't repaint the van. By the way, it would be easier to just put all the drugs in another car, two cars, another van or truck and drive away without repainting the police van. They also never move drugs, sell them and do nothing with a big bill. <br /> <br /> For some reason, they decide to kill the children and the teacher (Dolph Lundgren), although when the villains seize the school, no one will know about it, because it is after school. A handful of people still in school have nothing to do with painting vehicles, so why chase them? <br /> <br /> Anyway, the best part of this film is that all the villains are armed with numerous machine guns, and they continue to find teenagers (including the guy in a wheelchair), and they continue to shoot hundreds of bullets. in adolescence and usually miss. At the end of the film, bloodshed occurs. Every time someone is shot, there must be at least three hundred bullets fired by this miss. The tricks are pretty bad. <br /> <br /> I read one of the reviews, which says that the budget of this film is 10 million dollars, and I am amazed. When I watched the film, I thought that maybe Lundgren did it as some kind of charity work for some film school where he is a teacher. Maybe this film was an exam at the end of the year. It was a test, but I passed.
