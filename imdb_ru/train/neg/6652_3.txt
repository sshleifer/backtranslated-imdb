It was a strange film about little-known lives in New York, centered on the main character (Brad Pitt title title), who considers himself a musician Ricky Nelson, except that he does not have a real talent, <br /> < br /> It's pretty funny to watch until an obscene and tough New York woman with a terrible accent enters the frame. It ruined the movie for me. It must have been Katherine Kiener, who usually plays hard women with a trash mouth. <br /> <br /> Hairstyle on Pitt - exaggerated "Pompadour" - it was interesting to see. I can imagine how Johnny Depp plays this role better. A final note: it is strange to hear a film made in 1992 (except for the Woody Allen film) with a monophonic sound.
