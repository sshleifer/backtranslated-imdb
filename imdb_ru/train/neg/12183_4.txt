Christ. A sequel to one of the most placating films of all time, at least he has the propriety to skip songs (except for the repetition of the intolerable “Tomorrow”), but continues the tradition of nausea and unfunny. This time Annie and her friends go to London and fall into the conspiracy Joan Collins to blow up Buckingham Palace or something like that. The film has a strangely silofantic attitude to the character of the same name, which is at odds with how annoying it is: every time a little rogue squeals "Jumping lizards!" I could feel my teeth turning into powder. The darkly photographed, slushy and stupid film has only one catchy line (“Take Me Down, Stupid Genius!”) And the fact that recommending it is not original.
