I actually went to watch this movie in the theater, but what a waste of time and money! Bad behavior, I'm sorry, did not help me enjoy this rather sticky scenario. <br /> <br /> Some friends advised me to go see this movie, because James Redfield, the author of the book, was very actively involved in the script. They really enjoyed the book, so the film had to be perfect. Well, maybe my hopes were too high, but I absolutely hated this film! It was predictable, too sweet for me to really leave, I had to vomit, and the worst would be the continuation! Do the world a favor and stop this disgusting crusade.
