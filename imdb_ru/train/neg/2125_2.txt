If I had not been forced to watch this for work reasons, I would never have gone through the first 10 minutes. And even then I admit that I quickly went through the parts. The 63-year-old version was significantly better in all respects. Yes, I read that this book is more true to the original play, but how wise it was to change the script in 63 year! He is too long, he pulls, the songs that are in this version, and not in the version of the film, are boring and inconceivable. The version of "Kids" in version 63 was very funny and a true classic of sarcastic parental humor. In this version, Kim is too old and Konrad * is absolutely terrible * to contemplate (when someone ripped off his shirt, I closed the door with disgust ... the director of this version has no idea what sexuality is.) This Konrad cannot dance, can not sing (he can not even stay in harmony) and just disgusting. If Elvis Presley really was, his career would have ended before it began. As for the other actors, I waited for Alexander to drop his wig, when he danced, and Daly had already ceased to play the role of mother. Watch Stapleton's performance in the film version to see the same role correctly played by someone who understands the comic time. This TV version is a waste of one's time.
