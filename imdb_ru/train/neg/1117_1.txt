I don't know what this film is about, really. It is like a student art school project. They never say why the world is dark, but it is always dark, except for seconds a day. There are long, interrupting shots of insects of all kinds for no reason. The fact that there is little dialogue in the film is as meaningless and meaningless as the images. A black woman enters the apartment of the protagonist. Somehow she got pregnant overnight, and then got a shot in the head. The main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon, after which a white naked woman appears. I have never been so amazed at how bad and meaningless a movie can be. Honestly, I would like someone to watch this so that they can tell me what they are thinking about. But I would not wish that level of hell to anyone else.
