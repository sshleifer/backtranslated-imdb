It is absolutely impossible to understand what the producers of this terrifying adaptation tried to do. <br /> <br /> A group of top quality actors in the lead role (with a few notable exceptions), which give pretty good results. performances. Penelope Kate is beautiful in the role of Aunt Louise and no less good in the role of Joanna Lumley in the role of Diana. They all do well with the scenarios that were provided to them. <br /> <br /> So much for the good. The average will include sets. Nancherrow is nothing more than the house described in the book, although the bizarre house they use for House Dower is remarkably similar to it. Then it is clear that House Dower is too large. In the later parts, the authors decided to return the whole story back to the UK, presumably to save money, although, having a little imagination, I have no doubt that they could recreate Ceylon. <br /> <br /> Now badly, Script. This is such a terribly bad adaptation, it is difficult to find words to condemn it. Edward does not die in the battle for Britain, but survives, blind. He appears for a short time and then commits suicide - why ?? The day of love has turned from a young woman completely in love with Gus, into a sensible farmerâ€™s wife who can give up love with her life with a barely noticeable tear (less emotional than Brief Encounter). Gus, a man obsessed and passionately in love, is ready to give up his love without complaint. Walter (Mudge in the book) turns from a petty unfaithful husband into a devoted family man. Jess turns into a psychologically upset young woman who doesn't want to talk. Aunt Biddy still has problems with alcohol, but now without any justification. Dower's house is occupied by an army for no apparent reason other than a very short scene with Jess, who is afraid of armed soldiers. While Miss Mortimer's bosom is extremely adorable, I could not see their show moving the story forward several times. Delightfully named Nettlebed becomes a worldly Dobson. The word limit does not allow me to continue the list. <br /> <br /> There is a sequel (which I lost all interest in watching this nonsense), and I wonder if any changes have been made to create a sequel to the story. It is hard to imagine that Rosamunde Pilcher would approve of this grotesque perversion of her book; apparently, she lost control when rights were acquired.
