America. The land of freedom, hope and dreams. It is a nation that, since independence, has sought to bring democracy, prosperity and peace to the whole world for the benefit of all mankind. However, there are times when it is impossible not to wish the Americans to simply remain on their side of the Atlantic. <br /> <br /> This “film” (and I use this word with some reservations) evokes these feelings with particular purity. This vision of hell follows the adventures of Kelvin, the strange jewel thief, who was created by attaching the severed head of Marlon Wayan to the body of a two-foot dwarf. Unintentionally throwing a large diamond in Vanessa’s purse, a career woman who does not want to have children, Calvin realizes that in order to get a diamond, he must intrigue himself with her. Thus, like any normal man, Kelvin dresses like a two-year-old and parks at the doorstep of a poor woman, where Darryl, Vanessa’s bloody husband, finds him. <br /> <br /> Darryl inappropriately falls in love with Calvin's disguise, despite the fact that the “child” has a full set of teeth, bristles, a tattoo, a scar from a knife, and sexual intercourse of 16 years of age. old. Even more absurdly, Vanessa also does not see Calvin's past children's clothes and is actually trying to breastfeed the little pervert. However, this miserable attack on the soul of humanity is trying and cannot find humor in rape, scatology, sexual abuse and pedophilia, in a dishonest attempt to turn itself into a part of the “family fun” that Wayana's brothers are drawing into. nauseous amount of feelings and spoiled morals. <br /> <br /> The brothers are trying to undertake the Freudian rehabilitation of their thief rapist, showing that he has a “bad father”. Darryl's repeated penetration into the crotch allows Calvin to develop the love relationship between father and son, which he and Darryl have always dreamed of. As if this was not ridiculous enough, Calvin’s attempts to attack Vanessa somehow convince her that it’s selfish for a woman to pamper herself with a successful career, and that instead she should spend her life as a homebody. who spends her time alternately squeezing children and preparing for her husband. <br /> <br /> In this film, the Wayan brothers mixed their coarse and distorted form of humor with the clichéd sentimentality that infected most of Hollywood’s recent work. In addition, they are characteristic of the current generation of black comedians, who are responsible for transforming African-American humor into a poor and pitiful shadow of themselves, which is overly indulgent in joking jokes and gross sexual predilections. By law, these two should be prohibited by law to shoot something that even remotely resembles a camera. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the current artistic and moral bankruptcy of American cinema means that by this time next month they will undoubtedly be making two sequels and will be earning millions of dollars in tasteless trade deals.
