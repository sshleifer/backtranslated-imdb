The premise, although not entirely funny, was uniquely ridiculous. What MUST have happened after the second encounter with Tritter was that Tritter should just be wasted. House hires some guy and deprives Tritter's physics. In real life, Tritter would be harassed, an episode with a rectal thermometer would be exposed in court, which would give a reason and an opportunity, and the lawyers of the hospitals would make stuffing from Tritter and the specific department in which he worked. He will be in jail just like anyone who is involved in the pursuit of House, Chase, Foreman, Cameron, Wilson and Cuddy. A lawsuit would have won House a tasty settlement enough to provide him with a vicadin until old age. While Tritter was somewhere behind the wheel of a taxi, trying to rehabilitate himself, doing good for people for two years before people fell for the fact that they had seen it all before.
