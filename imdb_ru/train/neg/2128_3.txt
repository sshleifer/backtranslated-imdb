Needless to rework, and it can not come close to capturing the charm of the original. Extreme length causes more than a few parts causing a yawn. This version is ridiculously politically correct. The film lacks style, and, basically, it lacks talent, not only in acting, but also in directing, scenery, costumes, etc. - everything is lower than nominal. He has a blatant disregard for the details of the period. Vanessa Williams - the only cast that shows any talent, Tyne Daily is not so bad. They should have left quite well alone. Singing ranges from good (Vanessa Williams) to bad (all others). See the original 1963 version and skip this one. There is not much to recommend.
