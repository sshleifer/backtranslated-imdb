You say me? (1987) is a pretty bad movie, in which some dude starred whom I had never seen before, or since the main role is played by a guy from neighbors who is trying to become an actor. He has a lot of problems with Taxi Driver, as he tries to use this technique to make it big. When he learns the harsh facts of life, he does what everyone else does, changes his image! He goes from a good guy to surfing, man for the night. His friend cannot believe this change (but he scores with Faith Ford and gets a cool paid concert). Can this young punk keep his street reputation by making him big? <br /> <br /> This is a real lame film that tries too hard to include too many things at once. An interesting idea that falls apart due to poor performance. Who knows, maybe someone will pick up the ball and run away, because this time the filmmakers felt it. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on this movie. Unless you want to see the hot Faith Ford and young Bubba from Forest Gump. <br /> <br /> xx
