I have never been a big fan of Taiwanese filmmaking, unlike Korean, Hong Kong or even Chinese. A strong acting quality can hardly be found in them, as is clearly shown in this film. I don’t consider myself a hard-to-reach audience, as I’m actually a fan of indie films. However, this film shows a weak plot and a slow pace. I was lost in the middle as to where the plot was going. The game, of course, does not do it better. Acting Rainy is not true, because she "replays", trying to be fun and sweet. Although I must admit that it is nice to look at her. Isabella Leong, on the other hand, plays a more appropriate role as an embarrassed, sad, sad, highly restrained character. In general, I find this film a disappointment.
