When I went to see this film, I had rather high expectations, because I thought that Steve Carell could not be mistaken when he made such wonderful films as “The Leader”, “40-year-old maid” and “Little Miss Sunshine”. Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I’ll start with what’s right with this film: at certain times Steve Carell is allowed to be Steve Carell. There are several moments in the film that make me laugh, and this is almost entirely due to the fact that he has room for maneuver to do his thing. He is undoubtedly a talented person, and it is a shame that he signed up for what, in my opinion, was a complete train wreck. <br /> <br /> With this out of the way, I will discuss what went horribly wrong. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Dan Burns, a widower with three girls, who is considered as an advisory column. He prepares his girls for family reunion, where his relatives gather for a while with each other. <br /> <br /> Family is at the top of the list of things that make this movie awful. No family behaves like this. It is almost as if they were transported from Pleasantville or left it to Beaver. They are a caricature of what we think about the family when we are 7 years old. It comes to the point that it becomes unpleasant and simply frustrating. Touch football, crossword puzzles, family bowling and talent shows - this is not how people behave. It's almost nauseous. <br /> <br /> Another big disadvantage is that the woman for whom Carell falls in love. Watching her in her first scene with Steve Carell is like watching a victim of a stroke trying to rehabilitate. What I suppose should be unique and original in this woman looks a bit backward. <br /> <br /> It makes me think that this movie is happening on another planet. I left the theater, wondering what I had just seen. Thinking further, I do not think it was a lot.
