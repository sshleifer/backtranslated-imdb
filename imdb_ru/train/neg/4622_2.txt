Not surprisingly, this film has never seen the light. The exit time was terrible. By the time of the release of the film "Hong Kong" has already "jumped from the shark", so who would have paid the money to watch some censorship clips from the original show of the series? And the clips of the show are just a small piece of Chuck Barris’s miserable 90-minute cheekbone about how hard his life was as a show host. Did he really expect us to feel sorry for him and his spoiled life of a millionaire? Did he really think we even wanted to KNOW about his life? (Obviously, as he later wrote his strange autobiography about his career as a CIA employee.) Did he not think that the oath of all, everywhere listening for him, would remain fresh for 90 minutes? Or does the network manager pursue him at every turn? It could work as a plot for a 30-minute episode of a comedy series, but not as a feature film. Nevertheless, it was nice to see Rip Taylor again, Gina Gina, and the Unknown Comic (although they only included his most vulgar procedures to make the movie “sharp”). And, as someone else noted, this is the first significant part of Phil Hartman’s film (although it only lasts a minute). Please note that his name is written in the credits Hartmann, this is the name with which he was born. You cannot miss his voice and facial expression, even if he is much thinner and younger than in the days of SNL. Ed Molinaro (Blues Hill Street) also has a tiny role; one of the first after leaving the soap world.
