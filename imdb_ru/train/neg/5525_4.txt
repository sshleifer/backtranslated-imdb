The problem with family dramas is that outside of television films on channels like Lifetime, most people don’t want to watch them. And those who do watch tend to be sensational about current or current issues or issues in the news (or recent news). Films that explain or explore the human condition are not popular. Especially with a young audience, which will be Miss Lohan’s fan base, or with young people, which makes films not only popular, but also financially successful for the studios. <br /> <br /> The particular problems I encountered in this film are the cartoons of some of the characteristics. It was a little guilty that all the actions of Lohan (car destruction, drug use, etc.) were related to what her stepfather did to her. Although not incredible, the audience will swallow a little. In addition, other aspects, such as what she gives a young boy Morman, oral sex, or that she actually becomes a good assistant to the vet, who, by coincidence, has something for her mother, and so on. D . All these elements simply did not really help this film. It put it more into the comedy element of the situation trying one of their “special dramatic episodes” than it did for a fully-implemented, well-written feature film. <br /> <br /> When you watch a DVD and listen to a comment, especially for various alternative endings, you can really see all this clearly focused.
