What do you expect when there is no script to start with, and therefore nothing the director can work with. Hayek and Farrell, Donaldson and Kirkin are good actors, they simply have nothing to say or react to. Even the earthquake was pretty poor. And I don’t know how closely the film follows the novel, but two of them have a Jewish girl coming out of nowhere, just to show that Arturo has a good, warm heart, but some stereotypes mean nothing. And he even buried Camille in the desert, instead of returning her to Los Angeles for a good Catholic burial, where he could at least occasionally bring her flowers. Pathetic. And a set of L.A. was ridiculously graphically created. Something good? The window in his apartment seemed real, the curtains, the sounds, the wind. And Donaldson is always great. It’s been since the days of the kidnappers of the body or the night of the living dead, depending on what it was.
