Without effective indulgence in the supernatural or poetic motivating nuances of humanity, this entire creative team must hope for the effective use of its average, non-original elements. "Party of the Five" became manic, and then genetically inevitable, and there is little interest here, because the special element, which is not a murderer, is Wes Bentley's second-class soulless actor. In fact, all actions are deep in the skin. Despite the fact that dark-haired women are attractive, seductiveness is kept to a minimum. There is no nudity here. Also lacking enough buckets of blood. All sensations are kept at a teasing safe distance ... an unfortunate fact, given that the director's name is "butcher." Only the soundtrack, the buzzing alt-country alarm and the intense oscillation of the score provide any tangible tension. Sometimes some static narrative compositions add attractive low angles that make the malaise worse ... but for a movie that calls itself horror, I didnâ€™t even flinch. Perhaps a greater emphasis on social rejuvenation due to blood consumption, scenes aimed at changing geometric shapes outside the square, and a constant emphasis on playfulness due to family malice or traps that must run away from sympathetic characters to avoid their dilemmas might improve my mind, but it was not a good start to my tour through horror.
