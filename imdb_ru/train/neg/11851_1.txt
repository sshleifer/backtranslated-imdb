It was a disappointment - not a single nuance of the original. The British seem capable of making a truly disturbing film without any excessive history of the American version. The original series combines both eerie stories and subtlety of performance with great attention to lighting and settings. I watched the show many times and still delighted. <br /> <br /> Another bad adaptation along the line of the terrible adaptation "Cracker". Connect to BBC America or BBC Canada and watch for such delights as "The Awakening of the Dead", "Ghosts", "Silent Witness" and Judge John Deed. Check out the original “Touch of Evil,” and then find “Wire in the Blood” to learn more about Robson Green's truly understated and elegant performance. Hollywood should take a look at this actor!
