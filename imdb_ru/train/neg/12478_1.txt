I had to give this movie 1 because it’s so bad, but don’t think that I didn’t like to watch it, because I was laughing and laughing, and I even had a few questions. Thus, half the time I laughed, half the time I said: “What the hell is going on?” Or “why would anyone do this?” and so on. What I liked most was the horrible effects of fog, the 80s-style nu-scene / battle / dialogue / nu-scene, and how warrior swords flutter in the wind as they ride horses. And there are some shit model effects (they don't have to be real trees, are they?) And I still don’t understand this guy they find in the cave, what the hell is he? My friend told me about these films, and I thought I would try, and I liked the film, because people like Ed Wood films, I don’t really like what the film was supposed to be, I look at it in my own fun of the way. So don't let this distract you if you really thought it was a fighter, I just liked it for other reasons. It is much, much worse than Evil Dead, so it can make you think that you are wasting your life watching it (which occurred to me several times). I suppose that for most people, it’s best to drink a few drinks, chat with friends and laugh at this movie. Maybe it's a little rough, but I don't think so, rent it, and you will see. Hey.
