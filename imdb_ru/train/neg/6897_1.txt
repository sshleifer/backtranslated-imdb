I can see where the directors went with this. But they have not reached their goal. This is supposed to be a tribute to spaghetti westerns, albeit in a kind of mythical modern time period. â€œBut, unfortunately, he fails in his attempts. He does not have that coarse realism, which is known for spaghetti-westerns. Characters are not vile. and desperate enough as their Italian western counterparts. And, if these two points fail, they lack the humor of a successful parody. In fact, it seems that they intended to make a serious film, but when they were finished, they realized that they were so far behind that they should not be taken seriously. Unfortunately, they also missed the mark of humor for a mile. Very bad movie!
