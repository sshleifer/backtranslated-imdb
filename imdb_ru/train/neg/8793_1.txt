For those who decide to watch this film or not, and read these comments for understanding, I first propose these four words: do not waste your time! Chungking Express was removed, oddly enough, quickly, and it seems to have been conceived by someone standing in line at the Hong Kong Burger King. I can not remember ever watching a movie with a set of such one-dimensional characters trying to make their way through the script of this ordinary! This is an absurd effort with a philosophically absurd dialogue (a person enters his flooded apartment and offers a stunning revelation that “tears can be wiped with a napkin, but water takes time to wipe”). It also shows that the same character has a deep, meaningful connection with his towels, soap, stuffed animals, dirty laundry, etc. Shaky, wandering, manual camerawork was another annoying feature that I could do without. And if this is not enough to make you vomit in popcorn, we hear the old 60th song "California Dreaming", in which moms and dads again and again scream over the soundtrack during a particularly long episode. <br /> <br /> Quentin Tarantino was responsible for bringing this loser to America through his company Rolling Thunder Productions, although I cannot understand why a person with his talent would be worried. It is known that he said: "I am happy that I love the movie so much." However, many of us hope that he will concentrate on pleasing his audience with new worthy discoveries in the future.
