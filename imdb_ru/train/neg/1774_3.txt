Well, I watched this film for the first time, for example, at 9:00 on Cinemax, a few weeks ago and thought that he would be awarded. This film is a little more important. I mean, the monster mother only shows her true form at the end of the movie. I'm going to "That's it? Why she doesn't show it briefly a little earlier in the film. The story is that mother and son feast on the blood of young women. Wouldn't it be better if they just continued, you know, killer fun killing a couple of young women, and then instruct the sheriff or cop to find out and find the old one, to kill the monsters to save the young woman / women and kill another 1 or 2 people ? I think it will be so much better. It also sucks because the son is the main character, and he is killed first. Why not get rid of the mother first? Also, how does she have power at the end of the film when she starts killing people? She said it herself, she was too weak. What the hell was wrong with Stephen this time? I can never ever deny acting in any movie of any actor, after all, they try their best. If it were not for a good game, I would give this movie 1/10. 3/10.
