It was interesting to watch the progress, thinking that it could be a diamond in its raw form, but the only thing I found was bad writing, terrible direction (the sequence of frames does not pass), although the director could say that this is what he is It looks very boring and immature) anyone who has 2 VCRs could make editing, and there was a low-budget video in the warehouse. I would say that it was not even as simple as a mini-digital video. <br /> <br /> There are several easy ways to correct a movie with a director’s, for example, by editing, etc. But it is obvious that he simply doesn’t care. This film has invested as much effort as a ham sandwich. This can be done better, but it will mean extra work.
