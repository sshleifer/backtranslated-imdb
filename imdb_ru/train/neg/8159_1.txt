This is due only to the first movie in the title. The plot has nothing to do with the first one and the whole film stinks !!! I have no idea what they are thinking about, but this film is so bad. Avoid this at all costs, the first film in the series is acceptable as a slasher, like the fourth, but this and the third is rubbish!
