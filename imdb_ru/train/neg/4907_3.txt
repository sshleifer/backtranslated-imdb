SPOILERS THROUGH !!!! <br /> <br /> I read the book "1st to die" and wanted to see if the film followed the book, so I watched it. For the most part it was done. There were minor differences (for example, the location of the last scene of violence), but there were few of them, and for the most part the film remained true to the book more than most movies. <br /> <br /> This may be a mistake - although the film was perfectly shot, especially with Pyltz and Bellows, the book did not impress me. Or let me take it back. I started to be very impressed, gradually became more disappointed and by the end I was completely dissatisfied and felt almost bloated. There is no difference with the film. And that's why. <br /> <br /> There is no “payout” in a book or movie. I rarely read who did this, the thriller that created such disappointment with its final resolution, and I hoped that the film would be a little different. <br /> <br /> In general - (he did it, NO, she did it, NO, they BOTH did it) - it wasn’t interesting, not exciting and more confusing, annoying and depressing everything else. Add to this the love for life of Lindsay dies at the end (after HER's illness clears up and she cries in his grave) ... and then shrinks where she treats suicide .... then suddenly she fights for her life with a REAL villain who was cleared after his arrest .. but it turns out that he and his wife were in it together .... HELLO !!! All this has now become "COMMON HOSPITAL" instead of the good old thriller. I felt deceived and ripped off the book, and watched a movie (I must admit that he caught my attention - the acting was very useful for a television movie) - hoped that he would not follow the book he was shooting. <Br /> <br /> I still think that the film can be watched and for some reason does not leave the same bad taste in your mouth as in the book (or maybe I just knew what would happen ) But I have to say how this Solved story was not well done at all.
