Although Robert Knox Benfer has his fans, I am not one of them. His films are sinister and amateurish, and just not very funny, unless you are 14 years old with an underdeveloped sense of humor. <br /> <br /> He is of course not famous, as his immature fans would like you to believe, chasing people on Wikipedia or filling out votes to vote here on IMDb. Of course, he was not profiled by any of the major media, which says a lot about his “glory” and his work. <br /> <br /> Benfer does have some limited animation skills, but he needs to run away from his young sycophants and learn how to write some funny stuff before they take him seriously as a real artist. At the moment, however, he's just a kid with a camera, and it shows.
