I warn you not to be seduced by the names of Bigelow and Red. _Undertow_ is meaningless and uninteresting, and made me often think of Twain's phrase about wanting to drown all the characters together. When someone raises the category of the worst films ever made, I don’t think it’s like Plan 9 or Killer Killer Attack; it's like that. What a waste of time - my own and everyone associated with this film.
