Disappointing movie. <br /> <br /> This story showed that our main character is Chrissy, a “young”, rather gloomy, drifting person who does little. In fact, she does very little to advance the story, so I was not surprised that the emphasis shifted to her relatives. Too bad Chrissy seems like an interesting character. <br /> <br /> The story was predictable and sometimes felt quite articulated. Thus, the question now arises: when will we see the Campions, Jacksons and the innovative Tamahori project with compelling, cinematically narrated stories that will inspire rather than entertain for two hours? <br />> Technically disgusting filmed movie.
