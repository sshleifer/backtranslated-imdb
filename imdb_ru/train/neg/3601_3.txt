Was it a foreshadowing when Tori complained that her first boyfriend treated her like a robot, and then her new boyfriend (the murderer) turned out to be an artificial intelligence developer? I think so. Scenes that make you scream with delight: an abundance of montages, a striptease in kimono (what do you call it when you're seductively wearing clothes instead of taking it off?), And a painful battle on skis! Definitely tune in to the beginning and the end, but you can take a sandwich during the second act, when the whole plot takes place. Is it better than CO-ED CALL GIRL? Nope Does tori ever get to heaven or even out of snow? Nope
