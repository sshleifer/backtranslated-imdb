This is so bad, so very, very bad. Acting is the biggest joke in history. I didn’t even bother to see it, I did it in 20 minutes, and in the end it was just as disappointing as it was in the beginning ... I really don’t understand the taste of people, I’m a fan of horror films and I am not picky, but I have limit! Maybe it was a quarter of a star better than the beginning of Khost, but that's all. Therefore, I recommend not to spend 15 minutes, which you can watch. I mean that acting is best done by monkeys. And the older brother with the parental role is just awful. Don't they pay for the characters in the C-movies? No, I have to say that this is not the first time that I think a horror movie is bad, but it is absolutely one of my last ten films, and it will be interesting in places with the Portrait of a Vampire, Lake Hut, Khast!
