I am a Puerto Rican, and this is one of the worst documentaries I have ever seen. You can see that people on it do not know. They know little about Puerto Rico and its culture. They claim to be Puerto Ricans because they come from Puerto Rican descendants, but they probably know less than others who are not from there. As they speak, you can see that they contradict themselves. If you want to see a real one, and I mean a real, authentic documentary from Puerto Rico, then you should see Mi Puerto Rico. This is a serious, real documentary. Not like this piece of junk. Rosie Perez based this documentary on herself. I thought it should be about Puerto Ricans. They keep repeating that I did not know. Well, that's the only thing that they got right to this so-called documentary. I hate to see such a piece of garbage, which is done using the name of the island. It knocks down standards.
