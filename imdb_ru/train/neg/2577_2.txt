This story had a different angle that intrigued me, enough to buy a previously viewed VHS, invisible. That was a mistake. <br /> <br /> In what could have been a very good story - about ill-maimed people in the hospital and their various personalities - quickly turned into a very profane soap opera with incredible characters. <Br /> <br /> We have “Bloss” (William Forsyth) - a racist, racist, white man who speaks obscene language through every second sentence and is so disgusting that they didn't call him by name. With him is a lot of fun. Then there's Raymond Hill (Wesley Snipes), a quick-talking womanizer. Snipes must have liked these fast-talking, “fashionable” arrogant roles, because he played in some of them, for example, in “White people do not jump.” Then there is sweet Helen Hunt playing "Anna", this wonderful caring, loving person who has adultery with the lead character of the movie "Joel Garcia" (Eric Stolz). <br /> <br /> Yes, it is a warm, pleasant to the touch material. It just makes my heart melt, watching these lovely people. But, if you are one of those who like sloppy characters portrayed by sloppy people in this sloppy movie ... you might like it very much! Add a dose of Hollywood political correctness, and that’s it! What more could you want?
