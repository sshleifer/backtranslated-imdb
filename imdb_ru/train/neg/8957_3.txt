Incredible. Is it dumber than this? No chance. Stupidity in this film would disgrace even Ed Wood, De Palma and Wu. If in the first part of the series there was a mediocre dialogue, and in the second - a bad dialogue, then in this part there was a rude dialogue. Amazing. But this time, the story also fell to the level of dialogue. Despite the actions and dialogues, I liked the first two films, but Cubic Zero will surely kill the franchise. The utterly idiotic conspiracy obviously springs from the peror of the frustrated left extreme. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I wonder if such leftists even understand themselves how anti-democratic and dictatorships they are. In this film, they clearly target the US ?? democracy. Why are they not aimed at Korea, Iran, Syria, China, Zimbabwe, etc. In anti-war films? Of course, in most of these places such a cube will hardly ever appear, but this is irrelevant. This is obvious: the authors of such garbage really admire such regimes, whether they know about it or not. I would even say that ANY, who all the time adamantly criticizes US foreign policy, is based on anti-democratic beliefs. <br /> <br /> Back to the film: besides the fact that it is so contrived that it is not even funny, the film has many obvious illogicalities. For example, for some reason, two people who control the cube, did it for a while and did not notice the pain and sadism that the project entails, but the first one than the other suddenly turns against the system! Anyone who has any idea of ​​human nature will see through this idiocy. Or how about this daring character, a one-eyed evil bureaucrat who speaks like he's in Mel Brooks's bad comedy. In fact, as soon as this creature appears, the film loses ALL seriousness and, therefore, every chance of being exciting: it really becomes a comedy.
