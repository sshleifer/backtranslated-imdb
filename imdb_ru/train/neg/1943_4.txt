What a let down! It began with an intriguing puzzle and interesting characters. Admittedly, this was advancing at the speed of a snail, but I was still captured and kept watching. <br /> <br /> David Morrissey is always a good value, and he was Surann Jones good leaders. Muslim aspects were very interesting. We were excited about possible terrorist ties. <br /> <br /> But then Morrissey's character was killed and all the air left the balloon. The last episode was boring, boring, boring. It all turned out to be a very small beer, and the entertainment was incredibly weak. <br /> <br /> Five hours of my life for this? My advice: make sure the paint is dry.
