Istanbul is another of those expatriate films that Errol Flynn has shot in the last decade of his life, trying to support his family and avoid problems with the IRS. This is a remake of the Fred McMurray-Ava Gardner film "Singapore" a decade ago. <br /> <br /> Unlike this studio product, Istanbul has the advantage of this wonderful cinema, located right at the sight of the Golden Horn. But Errol Flynn, who is exponentially aging in front of the camera in every film, was too old to play these action / adventure games anymore. In his scenes with Cornell Borcher, there really is not enough persuasiveness. <br /> <br /> As for Cornell, she plays Errol's former lover, who has amnesia due to the trauma of salvation from the fire. She does not remember Errol and is now married to Thorin Thatcher. <br /> <br /> But Errol has some nasty people led by Martin Benson and Werner Klemperer who are looking for a few diamonds that have fallen into his possession. We must deal with them. <br /> <br /> The best reason to see Istanbul is to hear Nat King Cole sing and play the piano. Most people today do not understand that Cole was an experienced jazz pianist, they only think of him as a singer. In fact, he was the first pianist, singing was an afterthought. <br /> <br /> Istanbul is a common action / adventure film for those who are fans of this type of film.
