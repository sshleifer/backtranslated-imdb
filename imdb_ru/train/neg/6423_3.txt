The first 30 minutes of Tinseltown made my finger hang on the remote, ready to roll over to look something else. The assumption that the two writers, lucky, lucky, to live in the “dustbin” for storage of things, was a little funny, but painfully boring. <br /> <br /> The representation of the character played by Joe Pantoliano, a big guy from the cinema who lives in the park and sleeps in the toilet, inspired hope, and I decided to give him a few more minutes. And then a few more, until Kristi Swansons introduced herself as an aspiring director and a frontier nymphomaniac, adding some spices. Her strong acting skills raised her presence above and beyond only a very pleasant eye patch. <br /> <br /> In the end, the obvious low-budget impact on the film with poorly filmed scenes, a tangled pace and the processing of some moments with the farces. Some of my favorite films of all time were low budget, Whithnail & I, who also dealt with two guys with a dream, but not for their luck. <br /> <br /> However, for my money, the actors save Tinseltown from the archives of the Awful Cinema and almost drive him into the archive “could be a cult film”. I laughed out loud at some scenes involving the character Joe Pantoliano. In particular, the penultimate scenes in a terribly clichéd, but still funny, rich, but spoiled house of characters, where the story unfolds towards its final moments. <br /> <br /> I see how Tinseltown was a great theatrical production, and although the filmmakers did their best to translate it into celluloid, it simply did not work, and although I laughed out loud at some scenes and one movie, I I think that the first 30 minutes have dulled my feelings and expectations from such. To some extent I would have laughed at something. <br /> <br /> If you don’t get stuck on brand new coffee coasters, don’t pick it up if you see it in the shopping bucket.
