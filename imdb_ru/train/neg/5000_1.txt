This is probably the worst excuse for television programs, because, oh, I don't know WHAT IS NOW? Nothing happened in this ridiculous "series". Although Britney and Kevin themselves mostly take pictures of them, you wonâ€™t get any details about their personal lives. Basically, they just make silly, joking conversations and act like white trash. Listen, I love Britney's music just like the next baby, but this show is just pure filler for a nation so dependent on Britney that they watch her trimming her toenails (yes, this can be a real episode). Thank God, these two broke up, because they were HORRIBLE stupid together. This show is TOXIC!
