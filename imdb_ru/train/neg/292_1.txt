I saw it by chance when I showed on the cable: “I liked it,” because I thought that Sandra was quite a funny thing that I remembered. The only facial movement that I had throughout the entire movie was stunned when I had just experienced the terrible film that I had just experienced. <br /> <br /> The man who said that this is one of the funniest films of all time, please specify one line, only one scene, which is even worth laughing. <br /> <br /> She is a much better singer than I remember her, but I didn’t want to watch the concert hall. <br /> <I think this is a film that really tries to love, because they think they should, and they don’t watch it objectively.
