I am probably one of the few viewers who do not recommend this film. The thought is mind-boggling, like all the work of Ang Lee (each frame looks worthy of a print), I was very disappointed with the incoherent pace of the film. It really has been too long. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds during the era of the Missouri Civil War and talks about a young man (Redell), who joins the wild forces of the Bushwackers, a kind of renegade sympathizing with the Confederation supporters who are conducting geurillas. Type fights with the Jayhawkers, their allies. He and his close friend, Jack Bull Chilis, played by Skit Ulrich, join the group after Chile's father shot at close range, and his house was burned, presumably by JJHochers. The story is about the adventures of Rodel and Chile and their interactions with other victims of the war, including the former slave fighting for Bush hackers (Daniel Holt, played by Jeffrey Wright), and the widow of war played by Jewel. <br /> <br /> It seemed that every time a movie develops a story to an interesting point, it turns into some other plot and leaves things undeveloped. For example, agitation among Rodel's group, caused by the fact that the former slave Holt participated in the confederative case, is briefly shown through some conflict regarding propriety and protocol, and then until it is filmed in the film. Young villain / bully Bushwacker hates Rodel and turns a lot of fear and violence against him, but we never know why. Some of the characters never appear on the surface; I think this is because the film covers too many of them, and also takes a lot of the story. <br /> <br /> Historical details were excellent. I liked to look at housing, furniture, clothes, etc., and I thought that the main actors did a wonderful job of humanizing the characters, although I stumbled upon the dialogue a bit. Unless, of course, you really dislike history or are you a big fan of Ang Lee, try this one.
