“Maladolescenza” looks like a dark fairytale with its children's main characters, the decor of the forest and the discovery of the castle ruins. Yet, in essence, the film is an unusual psychosexual study of adolescents. The film begins with a sequence of dreams, in which the not so subtle metaphor of Fabrizio’s struggle with his menacing dog is used. The film tells about his psychological persecution of Laura, the girl who promised her love for him, and his possible romance with the equally evil Sylvia. The psychological complexity of the film really gives the film dignity, but there is no doubt how far the film exploits its nude body and sex. The appearance of the film depends more on its great places, and not on the special cinematic prowess, and there is no doubt that the greatest advantage of the film is a terrible soundtrack, supplemented by a children's choir. With its strangely fabulous quality, the film is interesting at best, but nevertheless pales next to the surrealistic and brilliant "Black Moon" by Louis Malla from the same era. Of course they deserve the arts against the pornography of the discussion, in contrast to many forbidden films, Pasolini “Fat” or Larry Clark “Ken Park”, for example, a film quite unremarkable from an artistic point of view. The cinema seems to be gradually losing its ability to shock, so perhaps you should admire Maladolescenza for maintaining this power thirty years after its release. However, the shocking value is the only reason why the film is remembered. <br /> <br /> The film has its own defenders. But so is Nazism.
