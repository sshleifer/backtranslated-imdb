In this short story, the city man and his wife made a strange life when he began to wear his old mother-in-law's old red trouser suit. <br /> <br /> I continued to watch, hoping to understand why it was done, or why other reviewers found it ridiculous. For me it was a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Not everyone has the same taste, but this is clearly not for me.
