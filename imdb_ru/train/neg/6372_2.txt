Don't worry. A little prosciutto can go a long way, but all we get is pure ham, especially from Dunaway. The plot is one of those bumper car episodes ... the vehicle bounces off of the other, and everything changes direction again, until we just puzzled, wondering if there was ever a plot. Gina Phillips is actually good, but it's hard to play against the mystified Dunway, playing Lady Macbeth, lost in Brothers Marx's Duck Soup. Ah, Raven ... now there is an actor. And there is a relative who just lies and lies down and looks ghostly. Or Dr. Dred, who is full of darkness and has no working means. I am one of those suckers who just need to watch the movie to the end. "Crow will never be again."
