Rarely such a stunning cast is so much lost. Griffin Dunn, Rosanna Arquette, Illeana Douglas, Ethan Hawke, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken and John Turturro all jumped on board, only to be torpedoed by a scenario that seems nothing more than a Hollywood joke. Attaching Martin Scorsese’s name to this was probably a draw, but the end result is much less than the sum of its parts. The nightmare reminder went horribly wrong, every scene seems more far-fetched than the next. “Find and destroy” is nothing more than abstract, stylish, self-deprecating nonsense, and the whole film is clearly boring .......... MERK
