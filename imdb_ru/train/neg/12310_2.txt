Steve Martin should stop trying to make remakes of the classic comedy. He absolutely does not fit this part. Like the sad remake of "Out Of Towners", this film does not make sense. As someone would have thought that Steve Martin might even come close to the beautiful performance of Jack Lemmon, outside of me, and the same is true for this film. Dan Ackroyd could play Bilko better. Martin is great when playing his own original characters, but unsuccessfully trying to recreate other people's classic works. This is a sad statement when the funniest part of the film is contained in the first line of the credits, when the movie is over. The line "Manufacturers gratefully acknowledge the complete lack of cooperation from the United States Army" was almost the only line that actually made me laugh. If you want to see the real Bilko, get the original episodes of Phil Silver. This is guaranteed to make you laugh, unlike this mistake, which should never have happened. I put this movie in the same category as the aforementioned Lemmon classic and Psycho remake. None of them should have happened.
