I was happy to watch this movie for free, since I work in the hotel business, and this film recently entered our movie library. I have nothing against low-budget films, but in this film there is a terrible acting game and direction. How can you make such a movie? The director should be on the black list, and for all the poor actors it certainly does not jump into a career. Please make sure you do not watch this movie, the acting is lame, the camera and the direction are terrible. There are only a few films that deserve to be called "LOW 10". Another example would be the "Dracula 3000". People who make money with this film should donate it to charity, so at least it serves a good reason. <br /> <br /> In this case, I would look at it another 10 (or at least one more time).
