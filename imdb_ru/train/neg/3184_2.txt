In any case, JD did not impress me, and Final Justice (which I hadn’t seen before the airing of MST3k) was no exception. Not that the character was less attractive than Mitchell: just Geronimo ("Call me" Geronimo ") less like." <br /> <br /> In fact, everyone suspects that Mitchell and Ultimate Justice are all the schemes of Joe Don's revenge agent trying to kill the star by causing a heart attack. <br /> <br /> Joe Don must have found a new agent, because now he has switched to “comic relief” in the James Bond films. The problem is that it is difficult to tell the difference between his comedic characters and his "serious" characters in action films like this one. <br /> <br /> As for the plot ... mind, what plot? They repeat the same scenery so often that you will think that you watched Groundhog Day 2. Presumably, the fact that they continue to use the same scene of Geronimo’s exit from prison should be some kind of comic relief. Mmm, yes, whatever. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the landscape in Malta is quite magnificent, so for me it increased to 2. Lik returned Maltese tourism for a couple of decades.
