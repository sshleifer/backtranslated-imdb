Literally every aspect of this sci-fi low-budget film falls into categories that have been classified for its predecessors, contemporaries, and those who follow. Bad special effects, a weak plot, a ridiculous amount of blood and blood, annoying and meaningless characters, everything that you can expect. "Attack of saber-toothed" tells about a new resort where owners of genetic engineering are developing Smilodon cats for an attraction. Cats run away and start killing people, the guy leading the show wants to save them, not warn unsuspecting visitors about them, and there is a group of visitors and some staff who rebel and plan to kill cats. <br /> <br /> In terms of special effects, a film about the average achievement, given its budget. Sabretooth is portrayed through bad CGI. It is surprising, however, that cats look more realistic with a detailed, detailed snapshot, and not in longer, more distant shots where the CGI is better hidden. Their attacks are recklessly bloody and unpleasant. As expected, they attack, tear off some hands and feet and leave quite a bit behind. This is one of the reasons why the film goes crazy. <br /> <br /> The plot and characters are just as awful. We have guys from college who come to the island and plan to hunt for rubbish. And take it very, very seriously. Even before breaking private property, interfere with security systems and steal. Why are they so serious about the simple game? Did I miss something? Was money involved? Or were they sent to do it? I don't know, I could hardly follow the film. But it seemed to me that they just did it for fun. Despite this, they have gone too far for the ordinary. <br /> <br /> Attack of the Sabretooth is a very bad movie. Even for a low-budget sci-fi movie, this is a very bad and cheap example. It will tire most viewers to tears, may be attractive to some, and make you laugh and laugh all the time. And keep in mind, this is not a comedy, this is a cheap horror film, so it should not be funny.
