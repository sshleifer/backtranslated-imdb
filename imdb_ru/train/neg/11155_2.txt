The only reason that I even watched this was because I found it in my local library (and I will ruthlessly scold them for spending public money on this), and despite the abundance of boobs and asses, it didn't take long to realize that the fast forward button was my friend. The terrible direction, the work of the pedestrian camera, occasionally poor or almost passable action, juicy effects and one of the worst scenarios that I felt dissatisfied with what I saw (as it was terribly crippled and disfigured) in a long, long time. In fact, the best laughter comes from the “Making ...” feature, in which the poor fellows associated with this mess in HDV try to justify their unsuccessful attempts, as if they are working on something special rather than something that will not be completely forgotten next week. Wait! Except for the fact that someone lured Tippi "Birds" Hedren from all the people to participate with Kane "Friday the 13th" Hodder! How it happened, I never know, and, frankly, I do not care. Look at your own risk and do not say that you were not warned. This filmmaking is in its pretentious, thirsty worst. He gets only 2 from me because I have beautiful naked women, and even then, barely.
