I think I have seen the worst films, but this may be because I'm so exhausted by how standard these bad horror films are. The monster killer is really very bad, mostly a guy in some kind of green suit. The situation with the film "B" is much worse, but do not think that for a second it was something stellar, damn it, no. He did have a plot with content, but he was still pretty stupid. Basically, it's just a bad low-cost horror movie. But at least it's not as bad as titanic, this film sucks eggs, this one just sucks. In this film, the blood looks really fake. Here is one complaint about the horror of the new milliuma, low-grade blood, looks stupid. A good horrible death scene with really fake blood is so stupid. At least there was a good shower scene.
