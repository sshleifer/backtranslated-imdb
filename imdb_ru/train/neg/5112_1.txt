Awwoohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh? Lhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ago as to ... Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh August ... That as heartbreaking and all that some unlucky family is adopted by ABC / Sears and their house is "being repaired." At this humanistic appeal ends. I liked it at the very beginning, but now this show has become disgustingly excessive. <br /> <br /> Ten families in need could be given relatively luxurious homes with lots of goodies for each family that every episode of this show spends money. People in Habitat for the sake of humanity must shake their heads in disbelief. For example, is it necessary for a healthy sixteen-year-old boy to have a jacuzzi in his bedroom or is his bed covered in hydraulics "Low Rider"? Does mom really need her decrepit, unworked and rusty old pickup truck, rebuilt and “spoiled” by some of the best tuners in California? The new one would do the job quite well, and probably for a third of the price. Do people need sixty-five inches plasma screen in every room at home? And then the question arises of who pays the increased real estate taxes and utility bills. Even after Zaniakov left for “Makeover,” someone still earns his living. I doubt that friendly people from social services will see humor in all these bounty. <br /> <br /> This show is nothing more than grabbing ratings for ABC and a silent commercial for its sponsors.
