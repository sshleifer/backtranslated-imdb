Although, I must admit, I laughed at this film more than the last few comedies that I've seen. <br /> <br /> The budget was supposed to consist of pocket changes of actors. Production values ​​are so low that in fact it was fun to watch. It reminds me of a monster robot consisting of a guy in a gorilla costume with a cardboard diving helmet. <br /> <br /> In one of the scenes of the unfortunate victim cut off an arm and a leg. God, it's hard to believe, but the scene of the Black Knight of the Holy Grail was more realistic. I kept wondering why the victim did not start shouting "No one will pass" and "This is just a wound from the flesh, I was worse." It was one of the funniest scenes I saw last year. <br /> <br /> “Gladiator / demon” was also a stitch. Between a terribly cheap suit and the defiant look of a guy in it, the end result was hysterical. <br /> <br /> Indeed a film that is bad enough to be viewed. Looks like you saw a slow car wreck on tape. <br /> <br />
