This film was made for television, so, considering this, I am not going to break into it as much as in the full-length film. The scenario is not normal, but in some places it may be slightly humorous, regardless of whether it means or not. Acting for the most part is excessive, but this is true for many low-budget films. <br /> <br /> However, I really didn’t like this film, since 90-95% of it was filmed, but in random places it will take 5-10 seconds when the footage is filmed on video. You can say because there is less contrast, the colors are less bright, and the frame length is 30 frames per second, not 24 frames per second. I'm not sure that maybe these scenes needed to be shot later, and at the time they didn't have the money to film (in any case, I suppose, that is why), but it disorients and really makes the film look trashy. what it should look like. <br /> <br /> In any case, I definitely saw the worst films, but I definitely wouldn’t say that I liked this film, and I cannot recommend anyone to watch it.
