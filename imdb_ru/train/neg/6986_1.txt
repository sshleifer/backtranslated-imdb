I can not understand Al Pacino. I watch him in the film “The Godfather, Scarfeis”, “The Way of Carlito” and I think that I am watching one of the greatest actors in the past thirty years. Then I see him in the film “Two for money, on any Sunday and revolution,” and I wonder what the guy thinks. <br /> <br /> I came across the “Revolution” a few nights ago and thought that I would invest in the next two. hours on it. Here's the news: do you want prisoners to talk? Make them watch it again and again ... they admit to everything. <br /> <br /> I will not rephrase the plot, because there is no consistent plot, but this happens during the American Revolution and Pacino plays an uneducated peasant who does not want to interfere, but ultimately does. Although he has no money, no education, and he dresses like a caveman, a very hot Natasha Kinski falls in love with him for no apparent reason, since they have only two minutes of communication. <br /> <br /> Frankly, if Al Smith appeared in this film instead of Al Pacino, it would ruin their career. The script was terrible, but Pacino's demotivated speech and a clear fake accent made it even worse. The role of Donald Sutherland was ridiculous. I really can't describe it. Natasha Kinski - the main character, but in the film about 5 lines. In fact, no one says much in this film. <br /> <br /> One of the most ridiculous premises in the film is how Al Pacino and Kinski have this strange dexterity to continually collide on the battlefield. This is like the whole Northeast Starbucks. "Hey, it's funny to see you here again, on an OTHER battlefield 100 miles from here ... see you in a few months." <br /> <br /> I need to give this IMDb star, since there is nothing here for a negative evaluation.
