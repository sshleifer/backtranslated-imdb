This is similar to what other Dracula movies always do, Dracula’s minions are always on Dracula’s side, which disappointed me in the final. Regardless of whether a person wants to remain a vampire or not, I would like to see something similar to the first film in which the minion fights against his master. It is much more interesting (since you can almost predict the course of history) than either the priest or D. win the game (we need amazing stories!).
