I put this film in a hotel room to entertain my children in the morning when we went home, because I collected all their toys. (Toddlers don't like to watch Regis and Katie Lee or Look.) My four-year-old child seemed to have a funny scene, but she said that the rest was “too stupid.” This is FOUR YEARS guys. Anyone older than, say, nine years old is more likely to want to kill his TV set than to let him play himself. <br /> <br /> To say that this film is bad is the same as saying that the Holocaust was a small mistake. There are no words about how ridiculous and utterly awful this “film” really is. The game is bad, the plot is stupid, and the script is pathetically unfunny. Since this is supposed to be a comedy, the fact that you can't even laugh at the badness of a movie makes it worse. Bronson "Beams" Pinchot is the worst with some strange fake accent (as far as I can tell, the Irish-Pakistani Bronx-cockney-Cajun), but all the characters are terrible. I haven't watched the real Laurel and Hardy movie for ages, but I KNOW they MUST be better than that. What is the point of destroying a classic comic duet with ... this? <br /> <br /> Outcome: derivative garbage. Avoid at all costs if you do not have the bizarre fetish Bronson Pinchot. 2/10
