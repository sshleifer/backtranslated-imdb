Steven Seagal seems to be moaning a terrible film, shot almost entirely in close-up to hide the complete lack of budget and resources. The choice of technical flaws — silver F / A-18 and F-14 taken from an aircraft carrier for an air strike, and wonderfully disguised F-16 for an actual strike — would give this film more confidence than it deserves. Suffice it to say that the most interesting thing about the film is credit credits, which disappear and then disappear as a result of lightning-fast cleaning, which, apparently, is available to all Final Cut Pro users. By investing all his creativity in his own debt, Michael Keush falls into the same category as Marcel Mando.
