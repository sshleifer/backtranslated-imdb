I will say so much - this director deals with images in RAW format ... that most of us are not ready to face. Images of sex, suicide, murder, and people who “liberate themselves” constantly bombard the viewer, which makes me wonder if the director tried to bring the concept of liberation or liberation. Although I do not think that I will ever be able to see this film again, I will say that the director has a good eye. The film had some really good shots and “image moments” (fans, wire fish in their hair), but the story made me need more (strictly because we were left to ask ourselves “what the hell do we just see?”) . <br /> <br /> Note: If you have a tendency to vomit or vomit, do not watch this movie.
