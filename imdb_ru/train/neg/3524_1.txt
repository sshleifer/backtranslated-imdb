This is one of the worst times I've seen a movie in a long time. It's so terrible that I don't know where to start, or even if it's worth it. The plot is a real problem, and I feel sorry for “Sly” because it puts a decent job for its part. But this plot ... Oh, dear, dear. I especially like how near the end he manages to jump from the foot of the mountain to the top while the helicopter is on the way. It only takes him five minutes to climb a day or two! I could go on: but it's not worth it. Besides the dismal discovery (which even a five-year-old child could predict the outcome), everything else is crap. Sorry guys, but this is about as bad as the movie.
