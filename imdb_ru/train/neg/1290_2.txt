This film lasted two and a quarter painful hours. Someone, please tell me what was the point? <br /> <br /> I mean, I understand the historical setting. It is assumed that we are talking about a mixed group of confederative Bush hackers (terrorists?) On the border of Missouri and Kansas, which takes revenge on all supporters of northern countries and abolitionists during the American Civil War. But apart from the unreasonable violence in this film there was no special meaning. Perhaps it was a political statement? Is this war really nothing more than causeless violence? If it was what was done, then it was done pretty well, but I do not think that was the main thing. I think that the producers really thought that they were shooting a decent film here, but as far as I understand, there was no conspiracy. It seemed that I was watching a paperback come to life, with characters similar to what you would see on the covers of such novels. <br /> <br /> This film should be burned along with some cities of this gang. set on fire!
