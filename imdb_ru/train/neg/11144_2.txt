This click reminded me of those lame “erotic thrillers” that I had not gone to bed before and looked at Cinemax when I was 13 years old. I would call this flick softer, since there is simply no simulated beat and grinder. However, there is a mass of nudity - the first scene at a strip club, we see Keysha Kane Hodder (or at least a trick), and then an inexplicable scene of a 10-minute lesbian dance in the middle of the movie and nude. a female werewolf that looks like they robbed a Munster for a suit. Rejoice 13-year-old boys. <br /> <br /> In addition, the werewolf transformation scenes have the worst CGI I've seen in recent years. Images are similar to frames from the Resident Evil video game in terms of quality. The wolf is too bad to be explained, and, despite the poor quality of the costume, too many times. <br /> <br /> Story and action don't make sense. There is some strange story about werewolves and hybrid werewolves - the dark wolf is the last, but from what I can say, hybrids do the same thing as all werewolves - look like humans, turn into wolves and kill people. The Dark Wolf is trying to find a mate for itself, but, oddly enough, it cannot find a mate, but it can smell someone it touches. Once again, these skills turn out to be less than useful, since the Dark Wolf kills several people whom its target has never touched, never met, or even seen, as far as I can tell. The comrade does not know that she is a werewolf, and she is struggling with transformation or something similar. <br /> <br /> You might think that it would be difficult to spoil a simple movie about monsters, bad like this one, but, well, they did, Do you want a quality low-speed werewolf, rent Dogs soldiers want tons of T & A, this is your movie.
