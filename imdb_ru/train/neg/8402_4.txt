Three Stooges in a full-length western comedy musical? Perhaps "Rockin 'in the Rockies" was supposed to combine the short comedy Stooges with the western musical in the matinee; if so, then it was a nice way to part with saturday afternoon. Jay Kirby (How to Grow) is a handsome young hero; and Mary Beth Hughes (like blonde June) and Gladys Blake (like brunette Betty) are beautiful women. Hoosier Hotshots - harmonious band; their songs are quite melodic; nevertheless, it is the 1940s, not the 1950s, so the film is not exactly “rock”. There are a few laughs; but Stooges's humor is more restrained than usual. The talking horse is also underused. <br /> <br /> **** Rockies (04/17/45) Vernon Kees ~ Mo Howard, Larry Fine, Curly Howard, Mary Beth Hughes
