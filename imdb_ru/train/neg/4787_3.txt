This post is certainly interesting for fans of TV shows (like me), but itâ€™s still mostly incomprehensible. The plot is confusing, as is the sequel's sequel. Of course, some striking effects, but we will never know what all this really means. <br /> <br /> Try to see the version of the working paper "NC-17", which contains the cut blood for re-evaluation. "R".
