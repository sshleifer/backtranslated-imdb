If you are going to try to create tension in a film, it is always useful not to create it beyond exhaustion. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Butcher Brothers have not yet understood this. <Br /> <br /> This film sucks, unlike most of its characters, which (if you don’t get it, they are vampires in the first few minutes, and then you are ashamed) prefer to collect abundant reserves: “no one knows where I’m I am the type of cheerleader and homosexual drifter who are comfortable and with fast food rushing past their isolated door. <br /> <br /> The only piece of originality in the plot is how these vampires become vampires in the first place, but everything else is ridiculous and sloppy. <br /> <br /> Forced to regularly raise sticks (as opposed to stakes) because of their tendency to fill the basement with bloodless corpses, they are not really too light, If they fed their victims, they could manage their own little blood farm , and this would reduce the mortality rate, which would allow them to calm down and become pathetic. <br /> <br /> Why manufacturers found it necessary to introduce incestuous twins and a homosexual older brother, I am not sure. This added a zero to the plot, which was regrettable, considering that there was not a big plot to begin with and there was no shock value. <br /> <br /> No one ever said why my parents died, unless of course this was explained during one of my frequent tea breaks. Obviously, the social worker had to be warned about the family for one reason or another, but again, the viewer had to write his own reason. <br /> <br /> The only well-rounded character was a younger brother who looked like Pugsley from the Adams family. In fact, he was too rounded, having the appearance of a child who inadvertently wandered from the class of “Weight Watchers” into a very bad horror film. Oh god he had. Never mind the road, there is another donut with a tasty blood center.
