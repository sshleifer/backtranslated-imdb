The fact that someone under 10 years old does not mean that he is stupid. If your child likes this movie, you better check it out. I am constantly amazed at how many people can be involved in something so bad. This “movie” is a showcase for digital magic and nothing else. The letter is terrible. I do not remember when I heard such a bad dialogue. The songs are terrible. Acting is below normal, but then the actors were not given much. Who decided to hire Joey Fatone? He cannot sing, and he is ugly as sin. <br /> <br /> The worst is the obviousness of all this. As if the writers tried their best to make all this as stupid as possible. Great children's films - evil, intelligent and full of wit - films of recent years, such as "Shrek" and "Toy Story", Willy Wonka and "The Witches". But in the constant shock of Americans, more and more flock to the water, like “Finding Nemo” (yes, that's right), the recent “Charlie and the chocolate factory” and eye-catching trash like Little Red Riding Hood.
