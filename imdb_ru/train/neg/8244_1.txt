I think this film was supposed to be shocking. But the only way it is truly shocking is how shocking it was done ... and just like that. This is a half hour torment. Even more for the viewer than for the characters in the film (five girls). <br /> <br /> Of course, the main characters get their bloody figure in a bad way, which, in general, is good, since this is a horror movie. And I (usually) like horror movies. I have no problem with violence in such films as such. However, all the violence in this film has no end. This is not a spectacle, except that it is just a grotesque. It's so sad that it even gets boring, and very quickly. <br /> <br /> The worst thing (if you didn't say anything bad about this movie) was that they tried to copy Blair Witch. The project, shot with cheap hand-held cameras. But (again, this too) does not serve the purpose at all. In Blair Who, of course, there is an explanation, namely, they are with a camera looking for Blair the witch. There is no other explanation in this film, except: “Hey, yes, we wanted it to look like Blair Whitch !!” The sound in the film also causes depression. Girls scream so hysterically that many times you can't make out what they say. In addition, no effort was made to make something better, sounding or different. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a soundtrack, as bad as the others, and different from cheap euro. Home for the worst ugly hard-rock ... <br /> <br /> My advice: do not look at it under any circumstances.
