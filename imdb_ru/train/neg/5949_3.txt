There are cases when foreign films are being reworked in the United States that fall on their faces, but there is a downside here !!! This is a terrible remake of the British film "Wide Awake" in the USA! <br /> <br /> "Wide Awake" is strange, but interesting and fun! "Liam" on the other hand is just weird. I have to pay tribute to Liam for one thing, and it makes clear that I made the right choice in changing my religion!
