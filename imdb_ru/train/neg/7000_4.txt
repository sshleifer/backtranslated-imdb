Hollywood, the home of deception, glamor and the quest for profit, is hardly guided by spiritual values, and it is therefore not surprising that his attempts to explore the spiritual life are subtle and often stupid (it is better to go further â€” to films by Bresson, Dreyer, Rossellini and Bergman, to study images of spirituality) . "Strange cargo" is no exception. This strange hybrid of adventure film, love story and religious parable makes it easy to understand what he is trying to convey. It seems that the figure of providence and salvation will correspond to Verne (Clark Gable in his most audacious manners and self-confidence) and Julie (Joan Crawford, snarling and spitting out any other word in an attempt to become the queen of tough ladies) is funny at best. Is this the patron saint of the Star System at work, comparing the enemies of the ego, before sending them on to further hard labor for the M-G-M party? BUT. , there are good support performances and exciting visual moments: dark prison barracks; the fleeing boat in the moonlight or against the backdrop of a picturesque cloudy landscape; Julie walks along the promenade when the wind rises; Julie and Monsieur Pig (Peter Lorre) agree on Verne's freedom during a storm; an unusually ennobling gay-prison affair between two convicts. First of all, this is a worthy and independent performance of Paul Lucas in the role of Hessler, a murderer who can appreciate the merits of Cambro, but still turns away from him. At the most exciting moment of the film Essler, leaving Cambro, stands outside the cabin. We hear the wind through the jungle, we see shadows on his face that convey a moment of fear and self-doubt. Then he goes into the night. At this point, Hessler reaches ambiguity, depth, and existential power, which cannot be reached by any of the other characters. The secret of the film is that his deepest sympathies are connected with Essler?
