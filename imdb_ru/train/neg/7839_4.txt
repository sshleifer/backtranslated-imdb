Serge Farnell very accurately criticized this film in the review of “Rwandan Night” (www.lanuitrwandaise.net). <br /> <br /> Critics who show how France was behind the whole situation faced by the United Nations in Rwanda. <br /> <br /> UN soldiers were in a dangerous situation, while French soldiers were warmly welcomed by the forces of genocide. <br /> <br /> On the eve of the ten soldiers of the UN were killed genocide forces. <br /> <br /> This is why UN soldiers decided to protect their lives by driving French trucks. <br /> <br /> Thus, they abandoned Tutsis, which is unforgivable of course. <br /> <br /> But we must remember that the French soldiers organized this situation.
