Stephen, what you did, you hit a new low. This is strange, since the last shadow man Stephen was the director of the same director who took off this garbage. The shadow man was good, it was devilishly bad, so bad that it wasn't even funny. Stephen is hardly in the film and feels that he is in a cameo role, and when he is removed, he is still called the half. As for the action well, let's just say that the wizard from Oz had more action than this garbage, there is hardly any action in the film, and when it finally comes, it becomes boring and sad to shoot so-called fighting scenes . Seagal is unlikely to kill anyone, unlike his more films, where he goes into the army of one person, that is, in siege 1 and 2 and exit wounds. the plot is so confused with so many holes in the plot that sometimes it does not create scenes. flying rage better be good what a shame i spent 5 pounds on this trash 0 out of ten luck next time
