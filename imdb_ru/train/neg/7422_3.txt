Well, I can't get into the plot, but it's just me, maybe. At times sluggish camera movements, however, this film has acquired a charming vintage quality. From time to time it is genuine and interesting with an episodic chase with the participation of poorly dressed ladies, which was nice. The climax is confusing and incoherent, but still ... wrong, thanks to Stella Stevens. <br /> <br /> Tricks are interesting, especially because of the Las Vegas background of the 70s. In the end, there are several sharp camera movements that make me wonder for a long time. But I donâ€™t think I'll be chasing the DVD, just for now.
