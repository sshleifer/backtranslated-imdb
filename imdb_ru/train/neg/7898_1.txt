When I saw this movie, I could not believe my eyes. Where are these funny creatures, trash dolls with big, pointed teeth, really had to be scary? Or where they are meant to laugh (I sincerely hope so). If you look closely, you can even see the strings controlling them (itâ€™s better to drag them around the screen). Everything was rather funny than scary, and I had a good time watching the film, because I was amazed by its complete inability to have only one good role. This is one big joke from beginning to end, and I believe that this film belongs to a new category: so incredible stuff that you will laugh from beginning to end. (I will not even try to comment on the action or everything else)
