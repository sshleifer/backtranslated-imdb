I'm sure it was one of those "Wah!" The sights of 1982, when Epcot opened, but now it's just stupid. Movie message - cliche. Circular vision is disorienting. And this terrible song at the end loses. And I really want them to fix the seats. After such a big walk, all you want to do is sit down for a few minutes. And when you hear that there is a movie to watch, it sounds pretty glamorous! You have fun when you sit down, right? WRONG! You stand there for more than 18 minutes, leaning against a small railing. Disney has to create a new maelstrom, like an attraction, to revive things and replace this boring, dull film. NOT FUNNY. Skip this. In fact, skip Canada altogether if you donâ€™t eat there. Moving straight to the UK.
