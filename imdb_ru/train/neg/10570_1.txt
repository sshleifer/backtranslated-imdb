Do not let the MPAA fool you with its “R rating for extreme violence”, there is simply no extreme violence in this boring game. I was expecting a bit of a cheap rambo 3 action that promised the trailer, but it’s just boring, pointless rubbish with tons of lame slow memories that don’t make sense. TO AVOID!
