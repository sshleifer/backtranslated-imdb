Philip. Film K. Dikiana. And worthy in this regard. Better than salary (woo) and this abomination called “Minority Report” (Spielberg). But let's face it, the end of curling and cheese was too much for me. Halfway through the film, I began to fear such an end, and, unfortunately, I was right. But this does not mean that the film is not worth its time. No, absolutely not. The first half (as many have already commented here) is awesome. There are some parts in which you begin to doubt whether the director intended to convey a message that showmanism is very important in the future (we will do such things on trivial things, because we CAN), or is it just busting But there is paranoia and feeling out of touch. Not bad.
