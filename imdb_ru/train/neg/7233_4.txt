I feel like a genius; I feel like I'm the only one who saw this fake movie. I watched it three times, once with comments, and I was annoyed by all the close-ups, all the time when the screen was just obscured, and, worst of all, the film never decided anything. Yes, the priest dies, but in reality he was not at peace with the city, which brought him so much grief, or with himself. This and he was an idiot. If it were not for Peter Cowie's commentary, which explains not only the film, but also the book from which it came out, I would not have been able to digest it at all. I like French films, but this is a film that was completely absurd. <br /> <br /> The diary of a village priest is shot in a beautiful black and white photo, but this alone cannot save this deadly boring joke. Scene behind the scenes of extreme close-ups, where the characters do not say anything until the camera turns off and does not turn off, do NOT create an interesting or relevant story. The way this film has ever become a classic is stunning: it reminds me more of the Emperor’s New Clothes. <br /> <br /> Yes, Claude Leyda’s speech is emotional and challenging if you are a sadist, but this film remains I feel empty because in general this is a weak impression of the Catholic priesthood, which is a shameful and inglorious institution of corruption. The triumph of a young priest over the countess's pride is a weak scene, but 90% of the film will enthrall you with their sad self-analysis and a window into the melancholic thoughts of the young priest. This priest does not look so modest as just pathetic. <br /> <br /> I don’t speak or understand French, so I was looking forward to when I would do it in English to help understand. film. Well, English SUBTITLE is sometimes impossible to read / read, and the text rolls so fast that I couldn’t read a lot (and I’m not a particularly slow reader - I just finished Dostoevsky in 3 days). <br /> <br /> I really wanted this movie. I try everything that is “chosen” from the Criteria Collection, and yet I cannot understand why in many ways this one deserves some sort of critical approval. However, I sat through this entire two-hour film, eager to feel some kind of sympathy for the main character, and it never materialized. He only seemed to be a victim, not a fighter. And for that I say it is smelly.
