Robin Williams and others had good performances, but the film was generally boring and very disappointing compared with positive reviews. <br /> <br /> I thought that C could become a serial killer that tires people to death: an unhappy guy in Ugly clothes pulls his victims around food courts, quoting Oprah and reading his medical history until they beg him take them off. <br /> <br /> I think that the film mainly attracts egomaniacs who think that strangers are interested in their photos. I expect most retail workers to take a break from customers.
