I love these actors, but they were wasted in this film. <br /> <br /> I can only wonder what they think, agreeing to this nonsense ??? <br /> <br /> Debra Winger just called in; Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard were caricatures. Some people thought it was deep. Well, if you liked Breaking the Waves, you'll probably like it too. I hated both. 3/10
