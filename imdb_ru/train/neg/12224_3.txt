Barbara Streisand leads this major Jewish story and is shot in it. <br /> <br /> To get an education, Babs enthusiastically disguises herself as a boy, which is not the most difficult thing, since she already looks anyway, boy. In her new school, she meets many male classmates who have no difficulty believing that she is a boy. <br /> <br /> Do not miss the best of the many moments of unintended humor, when Babs friend thinks she is a man, but presses him to the ground, sits on him and gently looks him in the eyes ... <br /> <br /> Mediocre film; An ominous story about nothing particularly interesting.
