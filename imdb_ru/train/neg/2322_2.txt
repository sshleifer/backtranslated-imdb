I was looking for a video store all over the place to find this film, being a huge Elvis fan, and I found it a great disappointment. Kurt Russell had most of the “Elvis movements” down, and the imitation of the voice was great, but the Elvis voice dubbed in singing simply did not work for me. the voice did not always coincide with the voice of Russell, and it was difficult for me to get lost in the plot, because it bothered me that it was noticeable. In addition, there were so many strange discrepancies in the film that people who know little about Elvis probably consider them to be facts. the songs are sung to them before he recorded them in real life, when he got his first guitar wrong, I am sure that his brother Jesse Garron was buried in an unmarked grave, and not with a headstone reading Jesse Garron. I know it was just a television movie, but they missed important events, such as The Return, and pulled out some scenes for too long. if you want to watch a good movie in which Elvis is portrayed in his lead role, “This is the Way,” or another Elvis concert. to hear and see the real Elvis preform is the only way to truly see his talent. (Brilliant statement, I know, but still ... come out and find a good Elvis film.)
