Lolita is a rebel, and she will share little stories about sex between fantasy and fantasy with our wide eyes ... Well, this production of Surrender Cinema is not very good: a very bad game, terrifying music and storyline any story and any line. BUT, the sex scenes are pretty well made, lots of lesbian scenes, and Jacqueline Lovell, as beautiful as The Exotic House Of Wax, offers us a very nice final and very hot strip show. Only for Lovell fans.
