The golden era of Disney cartoons was dying by the end of the 90s. This Quack Pack show should not even be considered an offshoot of DuckTales, because the show hardly had anything to do with DuckTales. We are talking about the teenagers Huey, Dewey and Louis, who create problems for their uncle Donald and speak hip-hop lingo, and they are fully dressed in contrast to DuckTales. I prefer little adventure nephews from DuckTales. There are people in Duckburg, and ducks are the only animals living in Duckburg. There is no mention of Scrooge McDuck. The stories are repeated, the plot is boring, but the animation is good. If you want a lot of farce humor, I recommend it to you. If you want the best Disney show, see “Dark Wing Duck” or “DuckTales”.
