A terrible movie with scattered bats about the Ramones. Your comedy format of the 1970s / 80s is worse than the cool kids who took over the school with some fancy plan. This movie is terrible. The plot consists of a girl who enjoys the Ramones and a school that seeks to fight against their despotic administration. Forget about this movie and watch something like Wild Zero starring Guitar Wolf if you want an entertaining movie B. Terrible game, terrible letter, terrible conspiracy with the stamp of approval by the Ramones, who probably needed some money quickly so they would say yes to this film This is the only logical thing I can think about, because this film is blowing.
