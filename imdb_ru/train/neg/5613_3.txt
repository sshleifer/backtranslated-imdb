In my opinion, this film does not promote any new thought. It seems to me that you need to take a spear in a spear, not looking to the side! the director seems to have an agenda! Duh! I believe that his rational absence is missing; there seems to be no room for an alternative look. For example, I am usually on the side of a skeptic, but this film lacks credibility, since it relies on the fantastic observations of a man / woman on the street. indeed, if you want to create a reliable alternative to a creed that has been held for more than 2,000 years, you should make more effort for the other side to express their beliefs. I'm not sure, but at the beginning of the film it was like an attack on the Christian faith, for example, I am a non-believer, but I admit the beliefs of others and would not like to make fun of them, but I tried to understand and tolerate.
