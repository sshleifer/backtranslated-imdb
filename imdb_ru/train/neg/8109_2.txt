*** It contains spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I didn’t like this film at all. <br /> <br /> I found it surprisingly boring and rather superficial, regardless of the importance and depth of the topics offered: given that in the end we have to die, how should we approach life? "Easy" way, like Thomas; In a “heavy” way, like Teresa; or should we find ways not to answer this question, like Sabina? How important is loyalty in a relationship? How much professional life can be disfigured for our loved ones? How much should we be involved in the political life and social problems of our country? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I did not read Kundera’s novel, but after I was let down by the film, I will certainly boring from the start. <br /> <br /> I disagree with most of the positive comments that have defined the film as a masterpiece. I just see no reason why. What I see is a lot of flaws, and an example is given below. <br /> <br /> 1) Three main characters are thrown at you, and it is very difficult to understand what motivates them when they make their choice. <br /> <br /> 2) “minor” characters exist only to fill in the gaps, but they add nothing to the story, and you wonder if they really are necessary. <br /> <br /> 3) I didn’t do something like how Thomas was imitated. Nothing is good for him. He is so selfish and selfish. In a sense, he is not a man. But when his self-confidence fails, and he realizes that he depends on others and is emotionally connected with someone, I do not consider this interpretation to be reliable. <br /> <br /> 4) It is very unlikely that an artist such as Sabina could afford her lifestyle in a communist country in 1968. In addition, all three main characters are very successful in their professions, which sounds strange to me. a) How can Teresa easily become such a good photographer? b) how can they succeed in a country where there are no all economic incentives that usually motivate people to succeed? <br /> <br /> 5) The fake accents of the English language spoken by the actors are ridiculous. And I'm not even a native language. In addition, the letter that Sabina receives during her stay in the US is written in Czech, which I find very inconsistent. <br) it's not even hard to make him look good. <br /> <br /> 7) I found the ending kind of trivial. Teresa and Thomas are finally happy in the countryside, far from the temptations of the “metropolis”, far from the social struggle, their fellow citizens living away from their professional life live in a car accident. But they die, realizing that they are really happy. So what? If they had died unhappy, would the film have a different message? I do not think so. I thought it was a kind of cheap trick to please the viewers. <br /> <br /> 8) The only thing that is unbearably easy in the film is how the director portrayed the characters. You see them for almost three hours, but in the end you have nothing left. You do not feel sympathy, you do not belong to them, you stay there on the couch, watching a series of events and scenes, about which there is little you can say. <br /> <br /> 9) I hated "Stop music in a restaurant" (a scenario that some comments highly appreciated). Why is Sabina so strong a reaction? Why does Franz agree with her? what you find out is that Sabina has a very bad temper and a strong enough personality. That's all. What's so special and unique about it? <br /> <br /> After all these negative comments, let me say that I like two scenes (which is why I gave two). <br /> <br /> “Photo session of naked women”, in which The envy, jealousy and insecurity of Sabina and Theresa are presented. <br /> <br /> Another scene is the investigation after the occupation of Prague from the Russians. Theresa's pictures taken to let the world know what is happening in Prague are used to identify people taking part in the riots. I find it quite original, and Theresa’s sense of despair and guilt is beautifully portrayed. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a tiny chance that the film was intentionally “designed” in such a way that "Thomas "Are going to like it, and" Theresa "will not see it. If this is so (although I strongly doubt it), then my comment should be radically revised.
