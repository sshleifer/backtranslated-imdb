While some performances were good — Victoria Rowell, Adrienne Barbo and two Italian girlfriends come to mind — the story was lame and derivative, the emphasis on the girl’s race origin was treated at best clumsily, and relatives were mostly depicted as stereotypes not like real people. . I felt embarrassed when I grimaced at many moments that were supposed to be funny. I can hardly understand why the local newspaper here at SF said that it was a good film and it’s amazing that WHO published a brilliant review here on IMDb. Very disappointed in this film and crazy, I actually went to the theater to watch it, because of the mistaken connection with Garden State, which is much funnier, more inventive and touching than this one. I must especially mention the emotional climax in a church that was so wooden and in number that I was almost gone, and some in the audience actually DID. This was followed by a silly climax to the cemetery, which I saw 10 minutes before it happened. I really do not like being misled to waste my money so uselessly.
