A typical action movie is a formula: a good cop gets tangled up in a mess of crooked police and Japanese gangsters. <br /> <br /> Good results — decent results, some fleeting moments of laughter, and some honest action sequences — plus the opportunity to meet the gorgeous Daniel Harris, who uses much of her eternal typification as a rebellious teenage daughter. <br /> <br /> ** of ****.
