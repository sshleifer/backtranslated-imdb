This movie is a mess. I am surprised that it even has a theatrical release. Without Robin Williams, everything would go straight to the video. This is poorly written. This is badly directed. Worse, he took an interesting topic and turned it into a funny and boring thriller, in which there is no thrill, no tension, no inner or emotional logic. Especially after the first half hour the film turns into a series of funny scenes. so much so that the audience with whom I saw it, laughed at it. Save your money. The trailer is completely misleading - it is not annoying and does not cause thrills - in fact, the worst crime of the film is that it is just boring.
