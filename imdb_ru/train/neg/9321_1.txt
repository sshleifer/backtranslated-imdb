I made this film about 4-5 years ago and was instantly disappointed. <br /> <br /> I wanted to watch a slasher film, but in the end I had a fecal look. The game was like watching dry grass. I saw how best to play in an erotic film ... <br /> <br /> The idea that a crazy killer came out of nowhere confused me. How was it a horror movie? <br /> <br /> The production value of this film was ridiculous at best. There were no scares. It seemed that a high school student got a new video camera for Christmas. The plot was everywhere, if one exists. If you are bored looking for a bad horror movie to rent, skip this one There are much better bi films there.
