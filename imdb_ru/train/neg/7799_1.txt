What, in the name of God, happened here? How can you create almost cheap fakes from the Redneck Zombies? Did 90s zombies ever entertain anyone ... anyone, or even make a profit in dollars? But basically, what happened here? <br /> <br /> Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence was directed by a madman by the name Andreas Sznaas who specializes in earth-shattering blood films such as "Goblet of the Mountain" and "Anthropophage 2000", and some of them contain profanity in headlines. In the blood section, this is not much different from the rest. Although the level of ineptitude ... well, amazing. <br /> <br /> Zombies '90 Extreme Mora is as bad as the Living Dead by Peter Jackson, think about it. <br /> <br /> Too specific a story - a waste of time. A chemical accident causes the dead to return and eat alive. The concept has never been considered this way. The effects of blood are a whole new minimum. Just a Z-class nightmare. I cannot say whether it was originally funny or not, I doubt that the dubbing in English was very true to the original script, but strange things happened. All this just reminds me of the introduction to the movie “Troma”, taken on video, except that it lasts much longer. <br /> <br /> I only saw one movie that was worse than that, The Chooper. <br /> <br /> To prove that Andreas Sznaas is a real director, I highly recommend Nikos Impaler. If you think you have no standards in what you are looking for in a bad movie, try Extreme Pestilence. but you have been warned. It takes nerves of steel to get through it all. But if you are here for blood, then you may be able to survive it. Besides this, there is no atmosphere, no, and I mean WITHOUT a budget, no entertaining value, but basically, no pride. Show pride, snaas. 1/10 <br /> <br /> Updated 7/5/09: After several views of the Zombie '90, my opinion changed, or I think I just understood it now. Zombie '90 is hilarious, so never mind the harsh words, although Extreme Pestilence still deserves only one star.
