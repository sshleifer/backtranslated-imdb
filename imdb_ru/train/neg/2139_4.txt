I really wanted to like it, but in the end, this is a poorly filmed movie with too little laughter. <br /> <br /> Politics is aimed at us, it will offend Republicans, but this is what it is intended for, This in itself gives me a reason to laugh. <br /> <br /> The problem is that it looks like it was done by REAL haste (after about a week). And it contains a silly story about some bimbo singer, who seems to be completely off topic. <br /> <br /> Turiqistan is obviously Iraq, or Afghanistan, or any other number of countries with which the US has fallen since then. 50s. The humor is a bit dark (people with amputated limbs dance with prosthetic legs made by Tamerlane corporation), but he is at his best, especially when corporations are cashing in on reconstruction (“light democracy”!) <br /> <br /> Like a lot of satire criticizing USA, it seems terribly difficult and difficult. I guess it goes against such propaganda, so you have to hammer over people to make a point. Who knows. I prefer more pushing, winking - a bit of subtlety. But it's just me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I could watch it again, maybe I missed something. <br /> <br /> I hope that the letter "W" is more on the mark.
