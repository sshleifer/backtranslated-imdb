The film, released in early 2000 with MELA and two disasters. It is very sad to start the millennium with such nonsense. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be coming to the 70s, but it looks like the unintended comedy of 2000 <br /> Some classic pearls from the movie: Paresh Rawal I donâ€™t understand, laugh at his role or cry. The reason: he goes in search of his mother in the village, the worst part is when he understands the secret of Anil, he keeps this secret in his stomach. which becomes big and makes him look pregnant, I remember as a child my teacher told me the same joke, Urrf !!!! As a child I laughed at it at the time, but here? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a joke, I can not explain. We have Anil in a double role (one older and younger), and Rekha plays the elder wife and Raveena the youngers. We also reject Harish while Shakti plays the son of Aruna Iran, who fights with the worst wig. <br /> <br /> The direction is outdated, looks too old in the junior role and too young in the older role, but Rekh's good effort is adequate, Ravina is also okay Harish bad Shakti Kapoor is terrible Aruna Iranian
