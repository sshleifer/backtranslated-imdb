What seemed so curious to me in this film - I saw the full 4-hour version of the road show, how strangely it is impassive. For the film about two very charismatic people - Castro and Che, involved in a gigantic political struggle, he is almost completely devoid of emotional fire. The scenes between Benicio Del Toro and Demian Bichir (who is at best a second-level actor with a slightly high voice) have no drama or depth and basically boil down to what Castro says Che: go here, go there, do this and that, without explaining what effect or use this action will lead to. Where else is the cast, who has the necessary strength to play Castro - Joaquim de Almeida, but he stepped aside in a secondary role in the film. Second half. Without the tension or passion you expect to fire these people and their followers, the film becomes a boring epic film about epic long bearded men running through different jungles, screaming and shooting without a particular goal or goal. Several reviews that I read showered praise on the work of director Stephen Soderbergh, almost completely ignoring the actors. (In fact, one spent more time talking about Soderberg’s new digital film camera than on the plot or the actors, or on the fact that it was entirely in Spanish with English subtitles.) It's strange, strange to do since a) Soderberberg was only a hired weapon in the film and b) is nothing more than a competent work, with John Kennedy Oliver Stone not seen in a black and white directorial work, when Che visits New York. If you can imagine reds directed by Andrew McLaglen instead of Warren Beatty, you’ll get an idea of ​​the boring competence of this film.
