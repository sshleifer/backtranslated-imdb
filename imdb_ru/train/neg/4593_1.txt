As a student of physics, I recognized many professors idiots and other so-called experts in this field. Continuing my studies, I will learn more and more about real physical experiments and about people who are doing everything correctly. <br /> <br /> Then my friends tell me about this “physical film” that they want to see. Without knowing anything about it, I am excited, hoping that the information will be presented well. <br /> <br /> I did REAL quantum mechanics; this is not true. <br /> <br /> This film begins with the basic assumption that everything that happens to a subatomic particle can happen and happen to you if you just open your eyes. Let's think about it for a moment. <br /> <br /> Our bodies are made up of about 10 ^ 30 such subatomic particles. This is a million billion billion billion particles! The more “mysterious” quantum effects of only two particles can destroy each other with a 50% probability. When you add more and more particles to the mixture, it becomes almost impossible to get a large net quantum result. To tell us to believe that this is a true assumption, without any rationality behind it ... this is just silly. <br /> <br /> My friend is also a physicist, and I counted 3 facts during this film, But they were presented in the most misleading manner I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I cannot say so much about the neural part of the film, since I did not have any medical training. It seemed as if there was a little more truth in him if we recall my days in biology, but I cannot say. <br /> <br /> At least this film had a redemptive quality: the dancing peptides (or something like that) actually had a scene. Not to destroy the priceless plot that drives this film, but the main character goes to the wedding, where she sees all the different types of personalities “controlled” by their peptides *, and then the movie ends on the dance floor, where we are united between dancing people, sometimes surrounded by CG peptides, and completely by a CG scene filled with dancing peptides. At that moment, the film tried to tell us how we are “addicted to emotions,” so we treat the full song of this hit, “Addiction to Love”. <br /> <br /> This scene was redemptive, because anyone who could go through this scene and still be serious about this film ... well, you must "open your eyes."
