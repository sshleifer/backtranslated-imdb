Maybe I'm really getting old, but this one just missed me and the old Funny bone completely. Surely there must be something wrong in this Irish (it's me, Schultz!). Lord, Lord, what would I give to see the light! First, the manic energy, skill and wit of Phil Silvers were, in any case, an integral part of the education of comedy and general life education. Although it is possible that the series entitled "YOU NEVER GET RICH" (1955-59 *), could get on the CBS television network with someone else in the lead role of a sergeant. Bilko, it is very difficult to imagine any other actor / comedian in business dressed in stripes of these master sergeants. <br /> <br /> Such a vivid identification is inevitable, although it does not look like the way in which a typing of a nightmare is destroyed in a career. that it turned out for some other guys, such as Clayton Sea ("The Lone Ranger"), George Reeves ("THE ADVENTURES OF THE SUPERMANN") and Charles Nelson Riley ("UNIT OF UNCLE CROC"). <br /> <br /> One of the main obstacles to the successful adaptation and renewal of such work, beginning with the 1950s television screens and films from the 1990s, is our collective memory. Not sure what percentage of the audience remembered Bilko’s character after seeing the initial race and the early resurgence of syndication, and their number was undoubtedly significant; even most young people have seen Bilko restart lately. It was obvious that the new film and the source were miles away; or even light years apart. <br /> <br /> In order not to be considered a completely square old grunt, let's consider some other points. <br /> <br /> Right here, today, the 14th day of November In the year of our Lord 2007, let me swear and confirm under oath that I am a fan of Steve Martin for almost 30 years. In addition, I enjoyed the wit and talents of Bilko '96 Co-Stars Dana Ackroyd and the late Phil Hartman. In the end, it was the talents of such guys and many others, graduates of "NBC; s Saturday NIGHT" and "SECOND CITY TV", who made the last quarter of the 20th century laugh. But BILKO rework; it just did not click. <br /> <br /> It’s possible that if the film was shot as a service comedy (they always liked it!), but without the Bilko Show names and giving it originality, it would be Crabby more appreciated by older guys like me . <br /> <br /> So, we already had so many sitcoms and cartoons that have recently turned into films, what next? How about someone starring in the series “Sergeants of DOUBLEDAY & AMES”, devoted to the Second World War of Hal Roach, and in the first animated series “CRUSADER RABBIT”? Remember where you first heard it! POOL SHNITZ!
