Watching this movie made me think constantly; why do they make such a problem due to broken brakes? There are a million options for slowing the car! In the movie “Speed,” the writers least thought about the good reason why the car couldn't stop ... <br /> <br /> There’s not much good about this movie; all the usual narrative clichés appear, the actors are very bad, the story is as leaking as a sieve, etc. This makes this film a waste of time and money. <br /> <br />
