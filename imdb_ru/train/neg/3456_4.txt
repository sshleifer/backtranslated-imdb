Everyone in this film tells Raffi Carruthers how talented she is, how wonderful she will ever become, etc. I think they are just good. Even Kimble Rendall, who shot this film, shows more talent than she does. "Next Jane Campion", they call her; and, even if they are not considered overvalued, they have so much in common. They both make films. They are both women. They are both Australians. (Well, give or take.) <br /> <br /> Yes: this is one of those films in which the character is considered brilliant, and we just need to swallow and take it. But I will say this for Carruthers: she is sweet. -And fascinating. No, really. Here are some thoughts about her lack of talent: <br /> <br /> (1) Part of the directorâ€™s talent is to communicate with people. Why does Carruthers so phenomenally poorly make his team even notice her? I believe that in order to make it easier for everyone to leave the set and be killed. <br /> <br /> (2) Why is this one of the most inconclusive images of a film set I have ever seen? In the end, it should have been shot on a REAL film. How could they be wrong? If the Rendall film set was half the size of the ruins, it is surprising that he finished his film altogether. <br /> <br /> (3) Art director Carruthers set himself the task of creating a completely new film. The horror film of the 1980s. Great chance. I doubt that this can be done these days. I suspect that Rendall - a real and more talented director - set himself the same task, realized that this was impossible, and agreed (sigh), knowing the parody instead. Of course, a parody is not enough for a parody. As soon as the actors and the film crew set foot in an isolated mansion, the film simply spends most of its time doing poorly what the horror films of the 1980s did ... well, not so bad. <br /> <br /> (4) And yet, and yet ... the film does not begin with a parody, but with honest kindness from the horror of the 80s, starring (this is too good to be true) Molly Ringwald. This styling is much better than anything else. (This is a bad sign when you discover that you want you to watch a movie inside a movie, not a movie.) However, it was also shot in the late 1990s. Perhaps it is still possible to make the horror of the 1980s. You just have to give up parody knowledge and VALUE. <br /> <br /> (5) I never thought about what the teenage horror of the 1980s would look like if all the heroes had Australian accents, but now I know. And oddly enough, I'm glad I know. A need that I never knew was satisfied.
