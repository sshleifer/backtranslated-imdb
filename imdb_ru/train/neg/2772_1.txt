Warning Spoiler. I have to agree with you, it was almost there. It was such a bad film, about such an interesting and true story. It had such a promise, but the game was ridiculous at best. Some sets were beautiful and realistic. Others are something of a theme park. I found myself laughing while watching serious scenes. I really wanted this movie, but I couldn't. The best part was the fight between friends, which ended with the death of the “king”. I liked the punishment of queens. And finally, the last shot made an excellent picture. There are so many best movies to watch. I do not recommend it.
