Belmondo is a tough cop. He goes after a big drug dealer (he is played by Henry Silva, usually a great villain - see “Sharkey’s Machine”; but here he is clearly duplicated, and because of this he lacks his usual charisma). He goes to the dirtiest places in Paris and Marseille, asks for some names, beats up some people, finds out names, goes to dirtier places, asks for more names, beats up more people, etc. The whole film is blow by blow after blow. It seems that the people who did this had no other ambitions than to create the French equivalent of “Dirty Harry”. Belmondo, who was here 50 years old, performs several good tricks from the start; besides them, “Le Marginal” is a cruel, episodic, banal, shallow and unforgettable police film. (* 1/2)
