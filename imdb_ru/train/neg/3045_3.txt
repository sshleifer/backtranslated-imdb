Believe it or not, I have my own DVD-copy of this “film”, which I bought at Walgreens for a very big dollar. I'm still not sure that it was a spent dollar or a dollar by stupidity. <br /> <br /> Pretty amazing scenery and costumes. Obviously, a lot of thought and effort went into their production. The scenography is very Mexican by stylization. I really liked them. And Santa is impressive. One of the most impressive sant of cinema. <br /> <br /> I assume that the original intent and purpose of this film was to be something inspiring and fun for a children's audience. But, anyway, it comes across as quite abnormal. In fact, I am amazed at how abnormal it is. <br /> <br /> Maybe English dubbing makes it so crazy and weird. One of the reasons why I prefer to watch movies in the original language in which they were made, and using English subtitles as a duplication often gives an unintended oddity. Children's voices were at least duplicated by real children's voices, unlike women pretending to be children, which sound very, very strange. <br /> <br /> Did you know that demons in hell spend their free time dancing around doing ballet in their longjons? You didn't? I, too, until I watched this movie. Everyone learns something new every day. <br /> <br /> Is it worth watching this movie? Now it's a cast. I cannot, with a clear conscience, recommend it to anyone, since this is rather strange in its own way. However, his unintentional quirkiness is worth watching. You decide what you are going to do. I do not know ... for myself, it made me feel embarrassed when the demons are constantly doing interesting ballet movements. This is just wrong ...
