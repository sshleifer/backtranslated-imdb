While most of the film is very amateur, the kosher killing scene is played out, but not true. Kosher law states that the animal must be conscious when the blade touches its skin. The kosher slaughter scene is accurate, as anyone knows who saw it or saw Peta’s film showing the kosher slaughter in which the animal’s throat was cut and the esophagus was cut while he was still alive, conscious, and obviously suffering. We must remember that the story is written by the victors. Is it even allowed to THINK that maybe the Nazis were right? <br /> <br /> Doesn’t it mean that the Nazis outlawed this vicious religious massacre, and the Jews still practice it even today?
