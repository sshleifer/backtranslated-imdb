I gave him 2 just because Natassia Malta (as the vampire Quintana) looks sooooo sexy in this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is very little logic in this movie, but just like most science fiction vampire flicks. Perhaps the film tried too hard to break away from traditional vampire stories. Unfortunately, this has gone too far and made the whole story not only unwise, but also ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Too much blood and too many scenes in which I was bad. A good movie about vampires should be more meaningful so that you donâ€™t have to see a lot of blood - we all know when a vampire jumps to the person he / she is going to do, what the vampire will do. A few moans or screams are all that is needed to describe the scene (for example, the one at the end, when Quintana tries to wake Rose sexually, all he needs is a few moans, the rest is your imagination). Anyway, it's just my personal taste.
