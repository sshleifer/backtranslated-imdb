From time to time someone suddenly looks at me a little to one side and asks: “What about SNITCH'D”? I immediately know that they have a case of barely hidden entertainment + horror. You see, I was a filmmaker in the film. <br /> <br /> Let me explain some points about this "interesting life experience." <br /> <br /> Originally SNITCH'D was called ONE HARD HIT. I met James Cahill in July 1999, a day after I wrapped up the TRIANGLE SQUARE, a great little 35 mm function that, like many indie functions of the era, was not spread, despite the festival awards. It has become the eternal victim of SAG's small print. notorious experimental feature of the contract. But I was distracted ... <br /> <br /> Although I was in shock, and when James asked me to make my own small gangster film of 16 mm with a budget of about $ 25,000, not wanting to break the pace, I took it. In the end, CLERX, EL MARIACHI ... I also believed in a myth then. <br /> <br /> Let's just rank this as a “film school” for many participants, including me. SNITCH'D was shot dead for two weeks in August 1999 in Aliso Viejo and Santa Ana, California. Cahill taught high school drama in the last city (yes, he is a drama and English teacher ... consider THIS while watching a movie or even observing the use of an apostrophe in the title), hence the place and the cast. <Br /> <br /> The cast of the meteorological girl Morning News on Channel 2 in Los Angeles, as well as the more impressive debut of Eva Longoria, who had just arrived in Hollywood and was like me, were seen in his cast. I want to get a movie under her belt. I have to say that her professional commitment, dedication and “let's do it” attitude inspired me and were an omen of her stellar glory, which is still to come. <br /> <br /> SNITCH'D suffered from poor optics, lack of light or electricity, several boom operators, and unreported offline delivery for duplication. None of this overshadows the actual content, which speaks for itself. <br /> <br /> In any case, by 2003, the film was sold to distributors (as I understand, without loss), who for some unknown reason did not have Eva’s pictures on the box (by then she was a growing, working name) , but who managed to get a clear picture of what seems to be an authentic Hispanic gangster, to give SNITCH'D confidence. Since Cahill's other passion is antiquarian publishing, he seems to confirm that he can really judge the book by its cover ... as many have chosen this DVD based on its cover. ----------------- A year later, Eve, who is now on soap, and I met with James for one day to make a simple short film that he composed, "DIVIDE THE SECOND" which I think has never seen a single play, despite the festival intentions. <br /> <br /> 6 years later I was hired to make another Cahill film called Juarez, Mexico. I thought he developed the process; my participation depended on the casting, the script and the control over the team, and the resulting film really looked promising in the daily newspapers, because it was ... a cheap detective story about the massacres of girls in Juarez; Despite the statements here and elsewhere, the film has NEVER appeared at any festival or anywhere, although Cahill has repeatedly stated that the film has distribution, and just waited for its release to coincide with the release of two studio shots on DVD and one the same theme, VIRGIN OF JUAREZ and BORDER CITY.
