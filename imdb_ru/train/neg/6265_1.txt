I was the director's nephew. It took me years to get a copy of this film, and I can confirm that this is truly one of the worst films of all time. My uncle doesn't even have a copy of it (I asked). I look forward to bring him a copy. <br /> <br /> Currently, the average movie rating is 1.9 / 10. As far as I can tell, this should put it somewhere in the mid-30s in the “bottom hundred” of IMDb, however, having only 206 votes, it has not yet been posted. The film didn't even get the respect from the bottom 100 titles. <br /> <br /> In any case, I give copies of the film to family members this year for holiday gifts. Best / worst gift?
