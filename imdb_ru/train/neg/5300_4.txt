I am one of the millions of Colombo drug addicts in the world and just watched this episode from which it all began on the British 5th channel. It is interesting to think about what emerged from this so-so film, and I can only be surprised whoever noticed the enormous potential of Colombo and added all the minor touches that make it such a wonderful and classic series. However, this particular film is not as good as the rest (with the exception of the embarrassing final episode and the patron of the British episode). If Colombo were made in accordance with the original "pilot", he certainly would not have lasted too long, and he would not have been watched and loved around the world. In this film, Lieutenant Colombo is elegantly dressed, drives a regular car, has a partner, does not talk about his supposed relatives, and looks quite aggressive. There is also nothing like that between Colombo and the "villain". Watchable, but only to see how Colombo started.
