Simply put, this is a simplified and one-dimensional film. The title “Rise to Evil” should tell you that it will not be an attempt to be something deep or to do something with the character of Hitler. Most likely, from the first minutes of the film, in which we see how little Hitler looks evil, and the evil music plays in the background, we get an idea of ​​Hitler, who presents him as a cartoon serial supervillan, apparently torn right from Saturday morning TV . The film really wants to prove that Hitler was evil, but does anyone need a film to convince them that Hitler was evil? Ultimately, making him such a one-dimensional evil character is both dull and confusing (one has to wonder how an inept, psychotic character in the movie Chill ever persuades the nation to follow him or to be called the man of the year). This film had an excellent opportunity to take a figure that committed some of the most terrible actions in the 20th century, and try to penetrate into his consciousness. Instead, he simply says: “Hey! Hitler was evil! Just thought you would like to know ... again and again. It is a great irony that the film is still under attack for presenting a very sympathetic view of the character. Give me a break.
