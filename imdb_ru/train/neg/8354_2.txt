Any film in which Brooke Shields surpasses the Foundation will be both an anomaly and a horror. Shields are really bad, because they are youthful, inexperienced and obviously not well managed by their partner. Peter Fonda is bad because, well, because he is bad. I liked him in Uli's gold, years later, but, Lord, he is terrible here. Not that anyone else was good. There is not a single performance (except for the amazing cameo of Henry Fonda) that would be even bearable. I have never seen a movie with so many bad performances. In the case of Luke Askew, the main villain, it is clear that this is due to poor dialogue and leadership, since he has done a good job in the past. But his partner, played by Ted Markland, is an awkward ham. The letter is just damn terrible, and the actors cannot be blamed for the terrible things they have to say. But they say them so badly! Editing and direction worse than a pedestrian. Snapshots are held for too long without any dramatic reason, or cropped before the effects of the scene can be realized. This picture was much worse than I imagined, and would have been completely forgotten (and probably not even made) without the participation of several well-known names. One bright spot: the cinema in the Grand Canyon is amazing, capturing all the beauty of this area in such a way that even Imax shooting on the big screen is not entirely successful. And finally: either this is a bad version of Paper Moon with an attractive pair of father and daughter types, or a bad version of Pretty Baby, with a much more unpleasant romantic relationship between forty and something and a 13-year old. This suggests more of the latter than the first, and, therefore, quite alarming.
