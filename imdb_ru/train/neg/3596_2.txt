To be as honest as possible, the Devil's Toy (or Blood Curtain, or Vampire Ecstasy, or the Curse of the Black Sisters, or ????) is a bore. Does the film have a good premise behind this ?? the resurrection of a long-dead vampire through the descendant's body with the help and assistance of a group of women dressed in black ?? but the penalty is terrible. There are excellent, long moments of screen time when literally nothing happens. Characters just stand around. There is no secret, no waiting, no plot to take care of. The game is just awful. Most of the acting includes a group of women with the worst appearance who dance naked and look at the camera. They do it repeatedly. And some small story seems to be designed to expose these less attractive women so that they can participate in the dances. Although it’s not as bad or meaningless as a dance or plot in something like Orgy of the Dead, it’s close.
