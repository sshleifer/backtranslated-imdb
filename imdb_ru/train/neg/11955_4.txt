“Visitor Q” is an unsuccessful attempt at a black comedy that focuses on what could be the most dysfunctional family in the world, including physical abuse from beating to murder, from stroke to homophobia, from a nursing mother who cares for her husband and adult daughter and The film is so outrageous that it received some critical evaluation and created a small cult of followers. However, with the quality of home video and thoughtful production, "Visitor Q" just does not stand up to curiosity. Genitalia are blurred, and sanitary devices are clearly visible, makeup is terrible, and everything else is amateur at best. Waste of time. (WITH)
