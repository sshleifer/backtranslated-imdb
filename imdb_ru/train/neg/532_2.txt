Just PPV'd it. I don’t want to spend too much time on it, since most of the posters here show it better than I ever could, but I really wanted to say a few things. <br /> <br /> I didn’t know exactly which was funnier: Redgrave chased tiny moths and stumbled over a nurse; Closely crying that her "precious" boy (whom she and Mr. decided that he was a drunken loser) turned into a murderer; that deaf-mute Ann chatted with Peggy Lee; or the terrible CGI of Crypt Annie Keeper, looking at her younger self! <br /> <br /> I never bought Danes as a younger Redgrave. I did not buy Richardson and Collett as sisters. If the daughter Meryl Streep wants to become an actress, it is better to ask her mother to give her a few lessons! I had no idea why any girl (or Buddy) could fool herself for vapid stud du jour Harris! Ann's daughters are the same tearful and frivolous, like her, Luke is a backward idler, and I have not rotted about anyone! The evening gives Chick Flix a bad name!
