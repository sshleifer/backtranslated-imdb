I passed this title 15 or 20 times, being in a blockbuster, looking for something worthy to watch. All I can say is that they were all half decent films that night when I decided to make it. <br /> <br /> I pay tribute to the fact that they are on leaps and bounds better than the "Dracula 3000", but in fact it is quite easy to say, since it did not have a Caper Van Dien in it. Other things that he lacked in the peaks were: an interesting cast, an interesting story, good dialogue and originality, but I believe that you cannot have everything. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS AHEAD *** Wrong team Vampire hunters (one of whom was a vampire ... go and figure it out) flew from the colony to the mine into the mine, trying to destroy all the vampires found. The crew consists of: a daring, unimportant captain (who dies early), his voice-over, but still inexperienced first mate, the aforementioned vampire hunter (not a typo), a cowboy mimic and REALLY, REALLY muscular Asian commando, a "tough guy" woman .. It sounds almost like the cast of MTV "The Real World". After the captain dies in a violent confrontation with a crowd of bloodsuckers (and, as it turns out, lovers of subtle parts of human anatomy), his first mate takes possession of ... blah, blah, blah ... everyone hates him .. blah, blah blah ... I could continue, but as I said, this is the same storyline that was used in about a hundred other “films” of the genre. <br /> <br /> The effect was cheesy and why Michael Ironside was outside of this film. The vampire hunter (still not a typo) was pretty hot, but of course, if you expect her to show more than just splitting her, look elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I cannot say that this was the worst film I have ever seen, because I actually rented “Star Troopers 2”, but I will wait until this film is released on scientific -fi channel.
