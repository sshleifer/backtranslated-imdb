Jameson Parker and Marilyn Hassett are the most incredible pair of screen since the days of John Travolta and Lily Tomlin. The direction of Larry Pierce fluctuates uncontrollably between the black farce and the Roman tragedy. Robert Klein definitely believes that this is the first, and his selfish performance in a secondary role emphasizes the complete lack of balance and chemistry between the players in the film. Usually I don’t want to allow myself to become so ascorbic, but The Jar Bell is one of my favorite books of all time, and I’m literally going crazy from watching what they did to him.
