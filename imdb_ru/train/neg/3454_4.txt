The director is trying to be the same as most post-screaming slashers, a horror deceiver who tried to be smart, referring to other famous horror films. Now I don’t collect Scream, because Scream is a very good horror film that perfectly combines horrors and comedies. Cut fails on most levels. He has his own moments, but in general he simply will not work, not even as the film “so bad is good,” just below average. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes or so is fine and set the story pretty good, except for the fact that Kylie Minogue can't really act, and ironically, she stuck out her tongue, go and figure it out. Go ahead some time, and a group of film students want to finish her film, which is obviously cursed. And, as you probably predicted, one by one, the actors and the crew are slowly taken off the masked lunatic. <br /> <br /> A non-original story, a bad game and a predictable ending are some of the following elements. In the film, many links, from "Creek" to "Texas Chainsaw Massacre." This is also not smart, it seems that the director wanted to feel smart and cool, mentioning other famous horror films a la Scream. For a slasher, the minimum amount of blood and lack of nudity, which is a huge negative, when it comes to slasher, which is not so much work. Actually, I have to support this film, because I am Australian, and we are not so good when it comes to horror (although we have our own gems), but Cut is definitely not one of them. <br /> <br /> However, it continued to watch me for about 90 minutes, so this is at least something good. I would not recommend it to anyone except hardcore slasher fans who can appreciate what this film is aiming for, but if you are looking for a good film, stay away. <br /> <br /> 2/5
