I never understood the appeal of this show. The game is bad (Debra Joe Rupp is a noticeable exception), the plots of most episodes are commonplace and boring, the dialogue is weak, the jokes are not funny, and it hurts to try to sit at least half of the episode. In addition, the connection between this show and the seventies is very unusual, with the exception of the style of clothing and scenery and the background used for the show. It seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old unfunny, clichés, like modern sitcoms dressed as portraits of a show from twenty years ago, in the hope that it will get some nostalgic viewers or something like that. “Happy Days” and “Wonderful Years” use the same technique much more efficiently, and in fact it is a pleasure to watch, unlike this terrible, pitiful excuse for the show.
