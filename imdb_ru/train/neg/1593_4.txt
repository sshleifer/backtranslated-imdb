Many of the main characters of the 1969 Hideo Goshi film "Hitokiri" (the murderer; he also "Tenchu" - heavenly punishment) were real historical figures (in the "western" format of the nominal order): Ryoma Sakamoto, Hampeita Takechi, Shimbay Tanaka, Izo Okada, ____ Anenokoji. The name "Hitokiry", a historical term, refers to a group of four super-swordsmen who committed numerous killings of key figures in the ruling Shogunate Tokugawa in the mid-1800s by order of Takehi, the leader of the "Loyalists." (ie, ultranationalist, pro-imperial) faction of the Tosa clan. What was this fight about? Unfortunately, you do not recognize in this film. Indeed, "Lesson brilliant history"! <br /> <br /> No, Gosh is much more interested in showing you the usual bloody cutting and dicing and (for an absurd length) the internal torments of the not-so-bright killer Of Okada than in revealing the real story. Sakamoto, for example, was a man of historical importance, considered the father of the imperial Japanese fleet. The closest Gosha to the lesson of history is the scene in which Sakamoto, whom Takechi considers a traitor to the loyalist cause, comes to Takehi's mansion to try to influence him ideologically. He begins by discussing the international political situation with foreign warships in the ports of Japan and Japan, which is too militarily weak to defend against them. Want to know more? Sorry. Gosh interrupts this potentially exciting lecture in the middle of a sentence (!). So much to inform your audience about a turning point in Japanese history. <br /> <br /> The film made me completely confused about the goals of both sides in this fight. For two and a half centuries, when the shogunate held the central power in Japan, he was an institution designed to prevent social change, to preserve the feudal relations of society. He was afraid of external pollution, both ideological and technological. In accordance with this spirit, he outlawed firearms, those “leveling” tools in Europe and America with which the peasant could resist a samurai. During this period, the Emperor was nothing more than a spiritual figure. <br /> <br /> But in the cities that stood in neutral zones between the fiefdoms, a new class of merchants, landowners and artisans was developing - a class known in Europe by the French name bourgeoisie. Inevitably, when this new class gained momentum, it irritated many frontiers of feudal society. As in Europe, the king (emperor) became a central figure in the bourgeoisie’s struggle for power against the feudal aristocracy. But political leadership does not always fully understand the interests of the class to which it serves. When the outside world arrived with a blow in 1853 in the form of the “Black Ships” of Admiral Perry, the ruling elite of Japan was in crisis. Their armed forces could not compare with these foreigners. In addition, they heard about the chaos that the British and French imperialists inflicted in China. What should Japan do to save itself from the fate of its weak neighbor? Surprisingly, some elements inside the usually isolationist shogunate tended to open up trade with foreigners in order to get some of their advanced technology. This is the point of view represented (hardly) in the film Sakamoto. On the other hand, the ultranationalists loyal to the Emperor, represented by Takechi, believed that they could hold foreigners by force, if only they could prevent another faction from “selling off the country”. (Sounds familiar?) So the murder of the key figures of the shogunate is fine - and we are leaving. <br /> <br /> Takehi's motivation was for me the biggest mystery of the film. Gosh suggests that he fights mostly for his personal development, and not for the loyalist cause. Can we accept this to represent the tenor of the loyalists in general? (Does it bother you?) <br /> <br /> Several reviewers positively compared this film with Goyokin, which Gosh shot the same year. But where Goyokin is a crackling, tense, adventurous yarn with a hero worthy of sympathy, Khitokiri is far from convincing and does not have such a hero. Sakamoto could be the hero of this film, but we are not allowed to know him - not what he means - well enough so that he can achieve this status. <br /> <br /> Considering his remarkable results for the five previous Kurosawa films, Masaru Sato points here were very disappointing, sounded like something rejected from the episode "Bonanza". <br /> <br /> Barry Fried
