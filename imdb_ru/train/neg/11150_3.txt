I watched this movie alone, in the dark, and there was a full moon outside! I didn't do it on purpose, it just happened. So all the elements were in this movie to scare the hell out of me !! Well, it is not, in fact, I wanted to turn off the DVD player only after 8 minutes, but I thought, let's give it a chance, unfortunately, I did it. The acting was terrible, the only one with a decent acting was Samaire Armstrong. The plot is not original, if you are a horror fan, this is the same thing that you have seen many times before. Some scenes do not make sense at all, and you just have the feeling that the director wants to extend the film! Monster was the biggest disappointment of the film. The (scary) scenes looked as if they belonged to the horror film of the 80s, when technology was not enough, but then some good films were made! I was surprised to see the name of a large production company at the beginning of the film, I thought, could they put some money into it and make it worthy? !! I could not agree more with the estimates that the film received, this is also my rating, 3 out of 10.
