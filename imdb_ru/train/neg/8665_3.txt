This is a low-budget horror / creature of Roger Corman. DinoCroc is created when the manipulation of prehistoric genes fails. An engineering crocodile first kills one of its own, then acquires the taste of a man and becomes a rapidly growing terror after escaping. None of the characters have a depth, but then they are not the focus. We get only a few glimpses of a huge bipedal descendant of a dinosaur and some of the best “killer” scenes in a small budget film. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is an idiotic character trying to use three dogs for bait and herself becomes a crocodile. There was nothing left on the pier except the ankles. Without real outstanding roles: Jane Longendecker, Bruce Weitz and Charles Napier. The most pathetic is Matt Borlengi and a nasty professional crocodile hunter Kostas Mandilor. I was impressed by the alluring Joanna Pakula, as the respectfully fearful Dr. P. DINOKROK is redeemed like a shard of pickled cucumbers.
