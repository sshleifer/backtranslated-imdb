I was fascinated by how really bad this film was. Should the viewer learn something or think about something here? What happened to the pumpkins? Should I have been impressed with the motel shots? Does it matter that there are garbage bags on the roof across the street from the hotel? Why the narrator unsuccessfully mocks the people with whom he interviews (it is so obvious that he edited the really informative parts of his interviews in order to mock). The best part of the film was an interview with a film professor who tells us how bad this film will be before it ends. <br /> <br /> I'm really amazed. I believe that the creator is trying to become an intellectual or trying to impress the intellectual community.
