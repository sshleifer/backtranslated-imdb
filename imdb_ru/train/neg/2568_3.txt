Dear me ... Peter Sellers was one of the weirdest talented actors. But his choice of films, say, after 1964, was very unfortunate. It seems he did not understand how to use his talents. He would be better off working with more Kubricks in the world of cinema than with the people he did. Of his later films, only Optimists of the Nine Elms and Be There have impressed me with those I have seen. <br /> <br /> However, the Boultings and Sellers have made several films before. it hardly sounds so bad - I still have to see "Carlton Browne" and "Heavens Above!" - at least in terms of using sellers to a certain extent. But “The Girl in My Soup” is a really bad movie and a terrible choice from the point of view of Sellers. In his films of 1955-64, one can usually expect at least some very ingenious turn and always enigmatic conviction in his roles. Here, Peter Sellers is trying to play a typical romantic role. It's almost sellers playing Niven without fun. He, of course, does not convince, does not try and does not create an interesting character. He had to leave such roles to clever masters, such as Cary Grant, and focus on those intriguing dramatic and comic roles for which he became famous. <br /> <br /> Hawn and Sellers do not really create any genuine chemistry; This is a difficult, ingenious novel, similar to that which is made by William Powell and Myrna Loy. It looks very artificial, all over - I know that this is a characteristic feature of Danvers, that he will give dry prey, but he is not much different from this, which convinces. Sellers also have a very nice way to play "charm" ... this character really has no depth, and it really doesn’t evoke the sympathy or interest of the viewer. Sellers makes movements in such a way that it is impossible to imagine, recalling the magnificence of his running, iconoclastic performance in Lolita. <br /> <br /> There’s really nothing to say about the plot, direction or characters, frankly, they leave little or no impression. This is truly one of the most anemic, complacent, confused and slightly boring films I've ever seen. The inability of the "vehicle" for the undoubted talents of the Sellers <br /> <br /> Rating: - * 1/2 / *****
