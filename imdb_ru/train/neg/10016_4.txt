Dragon Ghost was one of many 50s films about how hot teens face the supernatural. In this case, the teenagers cannot pay the rent for their party and will be evicted. They have nowhere else to go, and they choose a haunted house. As you may have guessed, as soon as they appear, strange things begin. And at the end there is a turn. <br /> <br /> There’s nothing in this movie that you haven’t seen in other movies, but it’s good fun nonetheless. My favorite character was a parrot. Well, let me rephrase that: he did not speak like a character in the Quentin Tarantino film, but he said something we don’t expect from a bird. The film is clean, but harmless.
