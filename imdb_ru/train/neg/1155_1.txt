Never before has a movie made me write a review, but it was just awful. I was stuck with him, trying to figure out what it was in this film that caused Snoop to choose him as his first serious role, but, frankly, it was a bad choice. I made a good book, but it certainly didnâ€™t work for me like a movie. I found her incredible, she lacked the atmosphere, and I found that many scenes are terribly unnatural. The musical maestro, whom he may be, but a serious actor who makes a film is not an actor. Dylan McDermott and Rose Byrne were bearable, but not enough to lead a weak conspiracy with a weak dialogue. Maybe I just completely missed the moment, but for me it did not fit into any genre, it did not cause sympathy for the characters and did not create any expectation, in fact I found myself praying for the end and suppress a deep desire to hit all three main characters!
