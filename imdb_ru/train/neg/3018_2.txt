What do you get when you mix a bunch of clichés with a purposeless career and a group of characters that you don’t care about, and an unsuccessful attempt to create an attractive visual style, an even bigger piece of cliches and a weak sense of humor and a really big budget? Why do you get one of the most unbearable films that you ever made! I mean, of course, Domino. <br /> <br /> Here are some things that people can say while watching this movie: <br /> <br /> “Wow, wow, the storyline is out of order, it wasn’t done a billion times before. And much more skillful than in this film. "<br /> <br />" Wow, look at all the flashing lights and grainy texture of the film and develop transitions! The director is trying so hard to portray things and create a visual style! It is a pity that neither one of these effects adds nothing to the film or does not make sense in the scenes in which they are located, and it’s also too bad that most of them seem annoying! "<br /> <br />" I heard this dialogue in about twenty thousand films before! "<br /> <br />" I saw about thirty thousand films in this scene before! "< br /> <br /> "That too!" <br /> <br /> "Uh, they didn't reveal this" plot twist "about half an hour ago? should this be amazing?" <br /> <br / > "If this film has to be showing a" cool chicken "that walks around, kicking ass ... why does she not do that? <br /> <br /> “I can’t believe how extraordinary this dialogue is.” <br /> <br /> "How long is this thing? I feel that I have been watching it for more than four hours." <br /> <br /> "I have no idea what just happened, but I also don’t feel special motivation to try to find out. “<br /> <br />“ Is it already finished? ”<br /> <br />“ I want my money back. ”<br /> <br />“ Songs in this soundtrack sounds so wrong here. ”“ <br /> <br /> “The irony is that all the curses they use actually distract from everyone’s impact.” <br /> <br /> “UGH.” < br /> <br /> And finally: “I may have to end my friendship with a man who I endoval me this movie. " <br /> <br /> In general, this film is a failure in almost all aspects. Avoid watching it at all costs. If your house is on fire, and this film is being played in the only non-flammable room, you should seriously consider burning it alive instead. <br /> <br /> (If I sound bitter, it's because I just spent more than two hours watching this movie, and I didn’t like it very much.)
