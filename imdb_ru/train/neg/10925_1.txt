At this very moment, I argue about whether I should finish watching this “crazy” movie at all. They had a rather interesting idea with a buried set of films, and that was all. So far this incomprehensible mess has no real story. There is a buried set, some kind of wolf with a wolf's head, running under amok, an amulet, and a group of evil actors attacked by a wolf, in masks, whatever that may be. What I would have missed if I had the common sense to get rid of this nonsense is a chase with mistakes in the dunes, some really bad CGI, some incredibly stupid dialogue, more bad CGI, and a hero fighting logging paper. In addition to the original idea, this film has absolutely zero redemptive qualities. My mistake to continue watching. - MERK
