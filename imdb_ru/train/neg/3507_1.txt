With this film, the Miles brothers reached a low point in human interaction. Remember, you who used such words as “masterpiece” while watching this movie, that these Mails creeps didn't just go to the Hamptons, but made a movie for some eccentrics. No, when they found these two poor, wretched people, they had to finance their project (and imagine what they said to people to sell the project). Then they became friends with two extremely vulnerable women. There is no consensus, no real agreement. These pathetic Malys smiled, kissed their ass, did everything they could to make Beale cooperate, and then exploited them as viciously as before. I would like to think that these hustlers sometimes had thoughts about repentance and guilt. But the process of creating the film, given the preliminary planning, the actual shooting and then editing, took a lot of time, and their goal did not have the conditions for the actual attitude to Beals as people. Operational film created by the most disgusting people. Over time, their cinematic reputation was seriously tarnished by what they did here. Their reputation as human beings is achievable. This is what people will remember them as. Grotesque crooks.
