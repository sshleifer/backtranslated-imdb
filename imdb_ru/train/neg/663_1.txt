Imagine the scenario - you are in the cinema only because you are in Washington for the weekend, it is raining and you are done with the museums. You think you can watch a Sarah Marshall movie, what a trailer looks like, and you don’t need to use your brain. Is it sold out. Options? - Work in a bank, in Bruges, on a leather seat or on the prom night. You've seen Bank Job (an amazingly decent film about robberies) and In Bruges (again, not bad), so you have two left. You don’t like to watch Clooney or someone from the office running around in a 1930 football uniform, so you're going to the prom night, right? Wrong. You charge $ 8.50, go to a stranger on the street and ask him to hit you in the face for $ 8.50. It would be money spent. <br /> <br /> Actually, it’s more like a comedy than horror, a thriller or something that should be. If I financed this film, and they showed me that, as a final option, I would not know whether to laugh or cry. Probably both. Insulting someone else's intelligence ... my roommate laughed loudly for most of the movie, as for acting, they could also use robots (or possibly dogs) in roles, they would be more realistic. The detective should be possibly the worst actor I've ever seen (Ben Affleck and Hayden Kristansan (I hate his game, I don't care how you write his name), you are relieved about your title <br /> <br /> So, in the end, “not good”
