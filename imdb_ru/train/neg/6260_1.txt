Batebo, you are a big fool. <br /> <br /> This is the most important nonsense that I have seen in a long time. I just stumbled on it on TV late at night and it hurts me to watch. It really hurts. How to do something like that ?? Awful, terrible, terrible! OOOOOO ..... The toilet flushes itself again! Scary toilet! Scary toilet! Scary toilet! 1992 does not seem to me so long ago, but observing it makes it seem like 1952. I mean his horror. Please do not waste your time on nonsense! <br /> <br /> A scary old black man tells them not to build a swimming pool in the yard. Fearfully! Fearfully! How does this material get done ???
