I gave Timecop a perfect 10, I gave 1 <br /> <br /> This is a very boring story, and it has little to do with the original Timecop. Many of the Timecop items were written off, and instead they added new stupidities. This story unfolds in 2060 (if I remember correctly), but for some reason time travel is now more dangerous not ... only the first one is great ... and generally not many action scenes, and they are all rather short <br /> <br /> At some point in the story, a character travels in time about 5 times in a few minutes ... no need to wait, do it twice ... <br /> <br /> In short: do not waste time on watching this movie is not worth it
