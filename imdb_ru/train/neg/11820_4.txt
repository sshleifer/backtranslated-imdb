I saw it on DVD (it’s known as CORRUPT in this format), and the ad on the case really criticized how the character of Frank Harvey Keitel is so similar to the one he played in the movie “Bad Lieutenant” in this tough and powerful police thriller ". "The case did not mention that this is an old Italian film. How old is Theo? Well, when a character plays music that he does not put on a CD player, he pulls out a large plastic plaster, puts it in a kind of rotating plate, where a kind of mechanical The hand touches the pancake thing, forcing you to listen to music. Do you understand my thought that this is an old film? The DVD case did not make it clear that it was a film shot 20 years ago. It is also a film with a bad production cost, like many italian films masks cursed under American. With the exception of Keitel, the actors are terrible, although Johnny Rotten’s performance is strange, not horrible, cinematography is static with image and sound quality, giving the impression that I was watching a fourth-generation pirated copy ( if this is a very bad print of the film), and the worst of all is Ennio Morricone’s score. <br /> <br /> All this is a pity, because CORRUPT does have moments. This is by no means the greatest psycho-thriller ever created, but he really interested me, and, as always, Keitel showed himself as a policeman with a cruel psycho. It is a pity that the rest of the film did not meet its high standards.
