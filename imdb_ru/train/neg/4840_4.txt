This entire film was supposed to last 45 minutes - maximum. Although an interesting concept / theme, it really did not develop as a story. As soon as the initial idea of ​​the brave (stupid?) Expert in bomb disposal (cowboy?) Is presented, and this happens very early in the film, everything else repeats. Characters were not investigated, and aspects of location and politics were ignored. There was some good understanding of the horrific difficulties faced by troops in such a foreign environment, and the difficulties in distinguishing between friend and foe. But the way in which the apparatus acted, pulled the faith! Separate performances were good, and special effects were adequate, but not sufficient to overcome the main lack of content.
