A good cast (with one serious exception) makes its way through Epstein's smart light satire. Mansfield has never been better or funnier than she is here, paired with Walston, a veteran who is determined to become a congressman to leave the war. He and his friends, including the suave cheater Grant, go to San Francisco on vacation and have the brightest party in town, while trying to escape from service through industrial tours. The only thing in this film that is not adorable is that Suzy Parker’s performance in one note as Grant’s love interest, which takes up too much time from the film and slows down in the second half. Walston and Mansfield have good chemistry; the trick is that she is determined to make love with every soldier (to fulfill her duties in military affairs, of course), but he is married, but nonetheless loves his wife. They steal the film without any problems from Grant (who is having fun here in the first part of the film, when not paired with his non-acting partner).
