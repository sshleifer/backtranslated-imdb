In this film there was not a single saving factor. My friend and I love action movies. Especially the fighting scenes (Bloodsport and Kickboxer were awesome), but this film was not interesting. Five minutes of action followed twenty minutes of talking and "angry" facial expressions. The main character is a restless character who has seen the battle and therefore has to look seriously constipated all the time. The army violated its bowel movements, improving its military equipment. The music is also not very good. They are fighting for rap and hip-hop in the streets because these guys are thugs. The rest of the soundtrack is the usual background noise for low-budget dramas. <br /> <br /> Everything in this film is a classic B-style. Actors hand out their lines, as if reading them from a cue card, and the lines themselves should be set on fire and left to burn in some kind of rotten Hollywood alley. The film is called Honor, but there was no honor in making this film. It was just a waste of money, and wisely spending money is what I consider noble. <br /> <br /> Go and look at Felon. Battle scenes and situations are more real.
