First of all, I would like to point out that Sam Neal is nowhere to be seen in this film. What a movie without Sam Neal. Has anyone seen Event Horizon. D-Wars had a potential dragon movie that drives lizards with rocket launchers, sounds cool, but unfortunately not. No, not Sam Niel, no good movie. I recommend borrowing 5 dollars or so to rent a D-Wars and add 10 to these five, and buy a Sam Neal film. Obviously, to present this, I need to have ten lines of text, so hereâ€™s a list of Sam Neal's films, which I recommend <br /> <br /> - Jurassic Park - Peace of the Dead - Hunting for Red October - Event Horizon - No Three Parks of the Jurassic period - <br /> <br /> In general, D-Wars is a bunch
