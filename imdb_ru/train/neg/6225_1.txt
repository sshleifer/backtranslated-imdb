I doubt it will ever be a cult film. I loved Graham Parsons to be sure, and I did not expect much from this film and got even less. What could be clever and touching was polite. It was devoid of music that made Graham and had more filler than cheap dog food. There was no background on Graham or the colorful people of that era. The shown characters were not familiar to me even as a fan of Graham and all versions of his “adventures after life” that I heard. Rock and roll is full of fairy tales, good ones too, but they need to be taken with salt. They can be great stories, even if they are exaggerated. However, this film took a good story and turned into a prank. The theft of any dead body and the ensuing consequences should never be a boring story, but they somehow made it boring. I feel like stealing every copy of Grand Theft Parsons, going into the desert and burning them all.
