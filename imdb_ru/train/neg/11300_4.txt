1st viewing 05/27/2009 - 4 out of 10 (director - Harold Young): The 3rd film "Universal Mummy" is about the same as the first two, in terms of the final result from the point of view of the viewer. The story is similar, and the results are ho-hum. This time, the scene of the story is the United States, as a new follower of the Egyptian priest sends a mummy to our country in the hope that he will be able to revive him to kill the descendants of those who opened the original tomb. This time, the mummy is played by Lon Cheney (which is of little importance because he is not really asked to play a lot for this character). The new priest becomes the morgue keeper in the city and sends his mother to do his dirty deeds after feeding him with sap of tanna leaves. Again, the girl interferes, as the priest falls on one of the descendant's fianc√©s and wants her, yes - to be immortal with him (haven't we heard this before?). The plan, of course, is foiled, as the townspeople hunt the mummy with torches (like a Frankenstein monster), and burning the creature ends the story ... how do they get the sequel ?? I think you will learn with the following in the series ?? or not.....
