The first thing that attracts attention in “For Ever Mozart” is the lack of plot summary in IMDb. The explanation is simple because there is no plot, script, plot, or anything that might remind the film’s minimal structure. Jean-Luc Godard is one of the most overvalued and pretentious filmmakers, and this nonsense nonsense is one of his most hermetic films. I believe that none of them understood what the story was about; but there are intellectuals who are trying to justify or explain this dirty film, and it is fun to read their reviews. <br /> <br /> My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Couple Semper Mozart” (“Forever Mozart”)
