*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** When I saw a preview of this film, I thought it would be at least a somewhat delightful storyline. But, like most of the original super-station films, I was left disappointed. This trusting family eventually drives through this “deserted” city to slow down and discovers that this video camera shows how these people do everything they need and discovers that they all eventually disappear, the family goes through all mysterious stages and never discovers and does not show what the hell is pursuing them. There are more of them than I can count, and they explain nothing about what is happening and how. It ends when the family gets into a car accident and gets posed or brainwashed or something (which is never explained). The next thing you know, you hope that they somehow find out how it all happened, but it ends, leaving you in complete disarray.
