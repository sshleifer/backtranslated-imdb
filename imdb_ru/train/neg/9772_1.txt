Too many incidents of violence. <br /> <br /> The film moves from one scene to another, and in almost every case violence breaks out. <br /> <br /> Now I’m not the one who is shocked by the violence and I’m missing something in a film without a fight. But please, not one by one. My reaction was not shock or horror, it was: "Here we are again." Between the scenes of violence there is some semblance of a story, but I completely turned off two thirds of the way through the film, and could not wait for the end. <br /> <br /> If this is the best thing that directors can do, find something else related to their pitiful life, such as making shoes or delivering mail.
