Waldemar Daninsky (Paul Nashi) goes to Tibet and is bitten by the Yeti, which causes him to become a werewolf. He was accidentally killed after he attacked his changing wife and her lover, and was later revived by a female scientist, Dr. Ilona Ermann, who uses him in mind control experiments. Later, Daninsky discovered an underground shelter, populated with fancy objects of the failed experiments of the doctor. <br /> <br /> Hearing about our death from colleague John Kitley, I rummaged through my collection to watch a suitable film. In my fight, I discovered that I have not one, but three (!) Copies of the Wolf Rage. The film has a dubious quality video, the sound is duplicated in a mediocre way, the cinematography at times resembles a farce style. And in the American versions, two love scenes are removed. Frankly, without a remastered, uncut copy, I did not get a proper film in all its glory. <br /> <br /> This film claims to be the fourth in a long series about a werewolf, Count Valdemara Daninsky. I suspect this is true, but you will not know about it from the film itself. The plot is confusing at times, and there is no indication that this is a sequel. If you read the plot stories on Wikipedia and compare them with what is printed on the box, you will see that I am not alone in my confusion. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the filmâ€™s flaws can be forgiven if we understand the hell of the production it has gone through. For many years, it was only released in 1973 due to problems with finding a distributor. And Nashi said in his autobiography that director Zabalza was an incompetent alcoholic and that he hated working with him. These are not really easy accusations, and I have no idea what Zabalza should have said on his own behalf. <br /> <br /> Most likely, sooner or later you will encounter a low-quality version of Rage. Wolf Man ". It is presented in three packages and boxes, so you can accidentally purchase it and not even know it. What really should happen is the American uncut version, with a decent sound and video mix, and love scenes returned As far as I know, this does not exist. Let's pay tribute to the legacy of Our Paul and bring his films to a wider audience at the level of quality he deserves.
