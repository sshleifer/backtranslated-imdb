There is nothing new for me: 4 hours of people die again and again on the same hill. The cast was stellar, but unfortunately, the producer / director / editor / God is cheating. He had to eat a modest pie (if not for his own sake, but for the people who died in Kargil), hired one of these brilliant Bollywood directors, hired a real screenwriter, hired a real editor, hired a musician who was not connected with him in a way (and who seemed to be listening to some kind of bad version of Apocalypse Now about some cheap Indian drug), hired a real professional team, threw out all the fireworks and told the real story. Unfortunately, he, like the bumps of the Indian army, made decisions that were terrible for his actors, and terrible for his audience. We all died again and again. <br /> <br /> Please do not do this again, sir! Sushma Kathmandu, Nepal <br /> <br /> ps: The next time the Indian director decides to glorify the Gurkha regiment, I suggest hiring more than one Nepali to represent the team. Of course, there are many Nepalese men working in Bombay - the last bill ranged from 40,000 to half a million people.
