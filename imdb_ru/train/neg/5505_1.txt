Shazbot, this is confusing. In fact, here is a list of 100 that is embarrassing: 1.) a failed return for Christopher Lloyd. 2.) Jeff Daniels basically played the same role that he played in the lively remake of 101 Dalmatians, which was not too juicy to begin with. He probably has a funny way to advertise his Purple Rose Theater ... 3.) Disnefluff. 4.) Another disappointing reminder that Wallace Shawn - for Disney is the same as Jet Li - for Bob Hoskins in "Unleashed". 5.) Ray Walston, the original Martian from the series, played a small role (read “cameo”) in this film and died of lupus two years later. Conjuncture? 6.) terrible special effects. Seriously - terrible. 7.-100.) This damn conversation, a farting costume, voiced to an annoying degree by Wayne Knight ("Newman!"). My favorite scene? HA! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ... That's it! You are You prankster. Well, let's end this review with a minute of silence for the painful death of this franchise, and if you want, you can quickly pray that Disney will not forget this parody and do something stupid, like the adaptation of the movie “Mork and Mindy” starring Tim Allen ............................................. ..... .......
