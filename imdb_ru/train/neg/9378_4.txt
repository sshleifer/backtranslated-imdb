This is another production in northeastern Florida, filmed mainly in close proximity to Fernandina Beach and Kingsley Plantation. I was rather surprised that the company was able to capture the main street of Fernandina Beach for as long as it was necessary to achieve the street scenes. The film is good and pretty bad. Tami Erin is cute, but replays. Eileen Brennan replays even more. Good for small children or for those who like fluff in large doses. 4 from Miller-Kino formula.
