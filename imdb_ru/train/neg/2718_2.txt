This is the least scary movie I've ever seen. How a drop can eat anyone is the biggest mystery of the film. The drop moves so slowly that it can be avoided. The blob has a lot of luck meeting a typical woman from a horror movie who, instead of running away, costs half an hour to eat her. If you have not seen this film, I recommend you to make it, it is too funny to take it seriously.
