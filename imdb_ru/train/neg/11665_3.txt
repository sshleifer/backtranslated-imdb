I really liked the film, emotionally, intellectually and visually. It contains no violence, no sex, no drugs, no special effects, and does not need a drop of them, all the time holding my attention with visual images, stories and interspersed with wise words. <br /> <br /> However: [1] some accents in a foreign language made perception and dialogue difficult; [2] there is an unnecessary abuse of abusive language (especially the F-word, which is the only reason this film received an R rating). [3] The film is balanced with humor and emotion, but most of the emotions that keep you throughout the film, with the exception of the last resolution in the last minutes, are unpleasant due to the exaggerated long-term dysfunctional response of some characters to the loss, living too long in the depths of bitterness and depression. [4] I will not recommend this film because of the 5-second background narration, which did not add a single bit to the character to which it was applied, or to the film - it just turned me off to the film and stuck in my Brain through the film and then: the mother of the main character of German origin, when he watched the old films of the Second World War, "secretly rooted for the Germans." There would be no "local color" or art, if the Nazis won the war. I donâ€™t know a single German today, except radical skinheads who think that the world will be better if the Nazis win the Second World War.
