The script for "Scary Movie 2" was simply not ready to go. This is a problem with the film, which is obvious to both the actors and the audience. Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans, and many actors are funny people; and therefore the film is not entirely without humor. To the credit of the film there are a few funny moments. But in general, “Scary Movie 2” is not even close as clever and funny as the original. <br /> <br /> The first “Scary Movie” was a funny minute movie. He turned the smallest subtleties of the slasher genre into comedic gold. The humor in "Scary Movie 2" is just as heavy as not original. They even miss the obvious opportunities for parody. Two movie stars are former Beverly Hills 90210 actors, and it was a show that asked to parody! Ultimately, Scary Movie 2 is like a bottle of wine that was discovered too early. The script needs a lot more time for aging. 2 stars out of 5
