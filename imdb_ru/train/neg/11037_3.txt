I like the episode in which Jim becomes Greenman. It is great! When Jim throws this little man through the window, his expression is priceless. Then when he starts to address the priest on behalf of his wife, only to find out that she has become a P-woman? Great writing and great cast, as well as great acting make it a must-see. I am trying to find a specific photo from this episode. I would like to use it as my avatar on the bulletin board, because I think Greenman is hilarious. Anyone know where I can download Jim's photo, like Greenman? Can anybody point me in the right direction to find such a photo?
