A typical Italian film about the 70s coming of age, original and good music, but with some quirks, an interesting but not fantastic photo, a bad and sometimes confusing plot line (for example, the role of a wolf dog and where does the boy come from?) With a bad dialogue, pleasant atmosphere . <br /> <br /> The reason he is still (relatively) well known and in demand is probably nude scenes (including the typical 70s pseudo-coitus) with an 11 and 13 year old girl. with an older teenager (Eva Ionesco and Laura Wendel) - from a socio-political point of view, it is interesting to see how these ideas of very young adolescents were considered acceptable and normal throughout Europe (and the USA) 30 years ago. whereas now it is more than a taboo. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the bullying of one girl (Laura) by two other characters and her discovery of gender, a fairly accurate representation of the aspect of teenage life. The character of Eva (Sylvia) does not develop to the very end of the film and already seems very well versed in erotic art - for her there is no “adulthood”: she is a very vain young girl who already knows about her sexual charm, but in the end it’s just that the film ends crying like a little girl, she really is still there. The boy is a very contemptible hooligan, and Laura is a very naive and weak victim.
