I saw a lot of Guy Maddin films, and I liked most of them, but this one literally gave me a headache. Editing by John Gurdebeke is too frantic, and apart from the sequence of demonstration of power, showing a line of heads snapping at one object, nothing prevents the actors from communicating with the audience. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I didn’t like about this film was that it seemed more brutal than Maddin’s earlier work - although there were always dark elements in his films, his sympathy for the characters gave Films have a primary sense of humanity. It looked more like rudeness for the sake of rudeness. <br /> <br /> Since I need to add more lines of text before IMDb accepts my feedback, I’ll mention that the actor who plays Guy Maddin copes. very good at expressing his facial expressions.
