I felt that Rancid Aluminum was a waste of two hours, the storyline was thin and confusing, the prestigious composition of the players had some terrible dialogue and extremely dubious accents. The filming was somewhat experimental in some places, and although it was obvious that the director was trying to convey, it only complicated the observation. One of the most annoying aspects of Rancid Aluminum is the excessive use of the narrative in the film, almost like the whole plot is dictated by the audience. The best performances had nothing to do with acting. In fact, probably the most convincing speech came from Dani Bera of all people, although admittedly he plays a stereotypical office secretary. Do not watch this film under any circumstances, unless you need a reason to catch up with your lost sleep, and certainly there are better ways to spend your hard-earned money.
