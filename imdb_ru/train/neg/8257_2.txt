“Gentleman’s Game” uses a country club golf game to illustrate the teenager’s discovery of honesty, prejudice, and other life lessons. Several times I thought I knew where this film was going, just to be wrong. Unfortunately, I'm not sure that the filmmakers ever knew where it was going. The defining moment in this film is probably the scene in which Gary Sinise scoffs at “Karate Kid” and refutes any suggestions that he is going to become a teenage golfer mentor. In some ways, it is refreshing that this film refuses to follow most simplified and overloaded film formulas. However, too much of this is still made up. In an instant, people drop all claims of politeness, or cannot adhere to what they believe in, or are exposed to something far less respectable than their place in society suggests. Unfortunately, often there is no resolution of these moments. And except for the fact that the club serves as a backdrop for them, there is no real continuity or connection between them. It's a shame that the writers and directors could not save the best film, especially considering some talented actors and potential in the production.
