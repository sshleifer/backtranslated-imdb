An innocent man (Steve Guttenberg) arranges one night with his boss's wife (Isabel Huppert). She notices that a woman (Elizabeth McGovern) is attacked outside, but she cannot call the police because it will destroy her marriage with Gutenberg's boss (Paul Shenar). Thus, Guttenberg, an honest citizen, who he is when he discovers that another woman was attacked and killed nearby only half an hour later, comes forward and claims to have witnessed the first attack, simply intending to transmit the information transmitted to him by Huppert. Well, as they say, never give false witness against your neighbor. <br /> <br /> This simple attempt to help the police catch the killer quickly turns into a perversion. When he meets the first close victim, McGovern, she immediately tells about what happened, but agrees to remain silent. But then Guttenberg finds himself in court, had to identify the heavy (Greenquist), and we cross-examine to find out that he WILL BE NEXT and unable to identify objects at a distance, not to mention persons. (Not that it mattered, because, after all, he never saw creep.) The plot becomes almost labyrinth. Guttenberg leads the main suspect when Huppert is also killed. <br /> <br /> He barely escaped arrest and found no opportunity now to sympathize with McGovern. Guttenberg and McGovern hatched a plan to catch the killer. She will serve as bait. They will go after the legendary sneaking up to one of his wretched ghosts, and McGovern will act like a doxy, to which the killer is attracted, just to make him try to kill her. But everything will be fine, you know, because Guttenberg will not only keep a close eye on her, and he will not only warn the police a few minutes after she enters this dive, but she will keep a bank of clubs at hand - just in the case. <br /> <br /> I ask you, the alert viewer, does this scenario unfold according to the plan? Elizabeth McGovern has an extraordinarily interesting bone structure. From time to time she seems to have a whole lower jaw and a tiny mouth, but she is bright. Steve Guttenberg has hair on his head, that's all. Otherwise, he is as helpless as the character he plays. If Isabel Huppert can act, it is not obvious in this film. The killer is so shaped and well-groomed that it looks as if he wears one of those deformity masks in the Twilight Zone episode about greedy heirs. <br /> <br /> Wasn’t the director of Curtis Hanson "LA Confidential"? It was a well-done piece of work. Here everything seems clumsy and contrived, right down to small pieces. Just before the inevitable violent climax, a uniformed cop is brought in to delay McGovern’s rescue, and the scene is confused by the observation. Dick Olsen plays the role of the last customer. He is a neat guy and always reliable. Paul Shenar, like a cuckold husband, has a striking face that seems to have been created for the scene, and he does an excellent job with his work. <br /> <br /> The same hinge where McGovern attracts the attention of the killer, where she plays billiards with a pair of hairy monkeys shot dead in a bar on the Carolina beach in North Carolina, not far from where I lived. As the interior is arranged, it is clear that this must be a dangerous and dirty immersion. In fact, it looks more elegant on the screen than it actually is. <br /> <br /> In general, this is Hitchcock’s territory, and it causes tears in his eyes to imagine what he would do with this story.
