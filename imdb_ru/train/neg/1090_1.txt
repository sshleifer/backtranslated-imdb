it was the most meaningless film I have ever seen, because there was no plot there, and the actors seem to be indifferent. 90% of the film had absolutely no plot, I laughed so hard that my ribs ached. The battle, where the old men, when capturing Robert Duval, was funny. At the director's level, the creation of a noir film does not include many episodes of rain and meaningless close-ups of the main character. This is an unsuccessful attempt to create a noir-thriller, and instead pushes the viewer away from incoherent scenes. seeing that it was based on the “manuscript” of John Grisham, I do not consider this one of his books on the adaptation of the film, since there is not a single unknown and attractive storyline in the form of films such as “the firm” or “the creator of the rain” .
