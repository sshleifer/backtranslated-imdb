When I first heard about Down To Earth, I was very excited. I'm a pretty big fan of Chris Rock, he was especially funny at Dogma. But this film was a disappointment. The performance of Chris Rock was far from as good as his past performances, and the film was just very poorly filmed as a whole. <br /> <br /> First of all, Chris Rock. He plays the whole movie like a regular comedy. Obviously, this works beautifully in scenes where he was supposed to stand, but in the rest of the film this is not the case. Even when he talks to another character, he seems to think that he is trying to make the whole room laugh. He has a few funny moments, but they mostly occur during scenes of a standing scene (no wonder they decided to make his character a comedian). As for the rest of the cast, they pretty much exist to just give Rock someone to talk to, no one stands out. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film was poorly directed. The film basically has one joke: the old white guy behaves like a young black comedian. Although I prefer movies with more than one joke, it could still work and was pretty funny. The problem was that we saw too much Rock and not an old white guy. It must be funny, because this white guy tells Chris Rock's jokes, but in most cases we just see Chris Rock, so it's not so funny. A few scenes in which they decide to show us a white guy talking like Rock are actually funny. If he had been shown more, the film would have been much funnier. <br /> <br /> In general, a few moments of laughter cannot be compensated for by the fact that “Down to Earth” is poorly played, and ill-directed. It was quite a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10
