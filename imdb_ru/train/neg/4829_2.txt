As an ordinary film fan, I can't say that I enjoyed watching it. It's not too emotional for a drama, not too exciting for a thriller, not too fast for action. In addition, some moments of the film are hardly credible. Well, I understand, the soldiers lose their sanity a little, but it’s hard to believe that a person risks his life, steals a car into the center of a hostile city and, when the professor’s wife screams, runs off without asking a question (in the proper order). It would be terribly romantic if it was an animation or so, but it must be a SERIOUS film about the war ... There are several such episodes, so the whole picture gives the impression that this is just a preview of the film and this requires considerable work . <br /> <br /> The filmmakers wanted to create an image of an emotional, brave soldier, but all these “twists” of his psychology seem simply unnatural. <br /> <br /> This picture left a question in my head: WHY? Why did they give him an Oscar? Why SIX? And IMHO is the most exciting part of the film :)
