This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen. The storyline is weak - I could not even follow it. Acting game. The sound track is annoying. Attempts of humor are not. Editing is awful. Credits are even slow - I would be ashamed that my name is associated with this waste of the film. Do not waste your time even thinking about this attempt to act.
