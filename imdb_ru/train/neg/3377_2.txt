The Broadway musical "A Chorus Line" is probably the best musical in the theater. It is about the experience of people who live for dancing; the joy they experience and the sacrifices they make. Each dancer auditions for a role in the Broadway choir, but what comes out of each of them is stories about how their lives led them to find a breather dance. <br /> <br /> Film screening, however, does not reflect either the passion or the beauty of the stage show and is probably the worst adaptation of the Broadway musical, since it is lifeless and devoid of any kind of affection for the dance, whatever. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake was made in that he transferred the work of the director to Sir Richard Attenborough, whose leadership offered only the right touch and step for “Gandhi”. Why would anyone in their right mind ask an epic director to direct a musical that takes place in a rather narrow place? <br /> <br /> Which leads us to the next problem. "A Chorus Line" takes place on stage in a theater without real decorations and limited shifts of costumes. This is the least catchy of the Broadway musicals, and its simplicity was its glory. However, it is badly translated into movies, and no one thought that this would be so. For this reason, the film should have immersed us in the lives of these dancers and should have left the theater and the listening process. Singers could offer their songs in other environments and even offered memories of their first ballet, jazz or audition class. Heck, they could dance on Broadway in their vivid imagination. However, not a bit of imagination entered into the creation of this film, since Attenborough’s complete indifference to the dance and the show itself is evident in its inadequate direction. <br /> <br /> Many scenes are completely awkward, as the dancers tell their story to the director (Michael Douglas) whether he wants to hear them or not. The character of Douglas is capricious in choosing the one to whom he expresses sympathy, and who has no patience. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the filmmakers pretended to be true to the nature of the play, some heretical changes were made. Very beautiful “Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love” - a terrific scene number that brought the dancers into their youth - was removed and replaced by the terrible "Surprise", a song so bad that it was nominated for an Oscar. Adding insult to injury, “Surprise” simply retells the same story as “Hello, love,” but without wit and pathos. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to watch this movie, unless you want to learn a lesson from what NOT to do when transferring a Broadway show to a movie. If you want to see the film version of this show, then the closest thing is the brilliant Bob Fosse "All That Jazz". While the daughter of Foss is in the Line of Chorus, he is Foss, who should have been involved as a director. He would know what to do with this material, which deserves much more respect than this sad effort.
