Oh, dear lord. This movie ... It was awful. I am a HUGE fan of horror movies. And most of the time, horror films that other people say are bad, I like it. The actor who played the Scarecrow was awesome, I will say it. But this plot was terrible. It did not make sense! He had too much blood and an unnecessary (and disgusting) sex scene in the beginning. I really think the director was trying to be “shocking” or something else, but it just worked out terribly. To add to the heap of purulent crap that they called the plot, the actors (except for the stuffed animal) are terrible, and I cared so little about them that I soon forgot who is who. In conclusion, this film made me sick. If you can avoid watching this movie, please.
