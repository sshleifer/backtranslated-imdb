The main reasons to see Red Eye are Rachel McAdams, who demonstrates stellar performance, and Jaima Mays, who is great as an assistant to the hotel manager. On the other hand, Killian Murphy overeats so much that he becomes cartoonish. The rest of the film is riddled with holes in the plot, which I will discuss in more detail. <br /> <br /> Please do not read further if you do not want to know what is happening! <br /> <br /> Here is a brief overview of the plot. Character Rachel McAdams (Lisa) runs the hotel, in which the new stubborn director of the National Security Service plans to stay that night. Rachel returns to Miami from a funeral, but sends calls from her assistant until the plane leaves. In the meantime, someone is near her father's home, Joe (played by Brian Cox), ready to kill him if Cillian Murphy (Jackson) calls. All Lisa needs to do is call the hotel and move the director’s room to the one where the Jackson cohorts are planning to launch a guided missile (from a fishing boat) to kill the director and his family. <br /> <br /> So, here are some of the plot spaces or absurd coincidences: <br /> <br /> 1. Jackson finally convinces Lisa to make a call, and in the middle of the phones in the plane lose touch. Lisa tries to imitate that she is calling, but by coincidence the guy across the aisle from Jackson also calls and starts knocking on the phone to show that he is dead. Jackson catches the phone and takes the phone from Lisa. <br /> <br /> 2. At some point, Jackson strikes Lisa in the head, and she, of course, is knocked out ... but only for 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> 3. Jackson catches Lisa writing a note on the mirror in the (extraordinarily large) closet, and hits her a little. Miraculously, the only one who hears something is an 11-year-old girl, whose word, of course, is not taken into account. <br /> <br /> 4. Lisa strikes Jackson with a handle in her throat when the plane lands, steals his cell phone and madly rushes to the exit, arranging a passage between the seats and 18 rows of standing passengers. Despite the fact that the passenger knows that a handle is stuck in his throat, flight attendants oblige Lisa, opening the door to the jet lane. <br /> <br /> 5. Well, all this is reasonable (if not very likely). But that's where it gets really stupid. Lisa gets into the terminal at Miami airport, and there is no cell phone signal (all major airports in America have excellent cell phone reception). <br /> <br /> 6. She runs through the airport, chasing Jackson in hot pursuit, and none of the guards even detain them. <br /> <br /> 7. Jackson, who lost Lisa at the airport when the train drove off from the gate to the terminal, lost part of the voice from the handle in his throat, but he can still be understood. However, he did not bother to call his man outside of Joe's home. (PS: there is no train at Miami Airport, but the one they showed is very similar to Orlando Airport). <br /> <br /> 8. Lisa steals a car and drives off. Of course, this time when she goes to call, the cell phone says "the battery is low" and soon turns off (when will they stop using this meaningless plot device?). <br /> <br /> 9. While the phone was still saying “the battery was drained,” Lisa got to her assistant just in time to save the Director and his family from the guided missile fired by a fishing boat to the room’s window. on the 40th floor where the director was located. Of course, they expect that we will not notice that the hotel is surrounded on three sides by the ocean, so probably the rocket could have been launched in the first suite, which negates the need for the whole plot of Lisa-Jackson. What is the story here? Was the original director's room on the 38th floor of one of the only rooms in the hotel with a lousy view? However, everyone leaves just before the rocket hits. <br /> <br /> 10. Lisa goes to Joe's house to save her father, only to see the killer outside. Although she knocks him off his feet (as he shoots her), slamming her jeep into the house, it seems that none of the neighbors notice or try to enter. <br /> <br /> 11. Jackson arrives at Joe’s house and knocks him out (we don’t see how ... maybe another headache). Then he explains to Lisa that he has not killed his father yet, because he wanted his father to see Lisa die first. For the rest of the movie (about 20 minutes), Jackson pursues Lisa throughout the house, and she resourcefully fights with him. Of course, the real killer (that is, the one Jason Statham can play) would end up with Lisa (or, for that matter, with anyone who is not an experienced killer) in the first 30 seconds. During this chase, Jackson at least once stepped over Joe, not bothering to kill him. <br /> <br /> 13. Finally, Jackson is victorious, and he is going to kill Lisa, when (you guessed it) Joe will shoot him. <br /> <br /> So here's my suggestion ... tell Wes Craven to stick to his horror. Or maybe he should get together with Michael Bay (who led the equally stupid "Island") and create the "Red Island".
