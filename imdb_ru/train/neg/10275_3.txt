The premise is amazing, and some of the actors, in particular Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rupp, are charming ... but this film is almost imperceptible. The music sounds as if it comes from a free online site, and the lyrics are written with rhymed vocabulary open on your lap. Most of the singing is not a secret. I think that they may have filmed accapella singing and inserted music for it ... The dialogue is really stupid and banal. The film works best when it actually speaks about real estate, but unfortunately it often turns into silly farcical plots. I found that I was checking my watch in the first twenty minutes and after 40, thinking “when will it ever end”.
