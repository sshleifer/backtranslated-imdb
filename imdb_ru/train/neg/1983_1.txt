Oh, come on people give this movie a break. The only thing I liked about it was ......... Sorry, I still think. Oh yeah!!!! When John Wayne came and shot the bad guys. Oh, sorry, not that movie, I thought about the movie of better quality. Let me see now, I'm still trying to protect it. Oh, yes, there was a chick that was from Clueless. Do not overwhelm Stacy Dash. I mean, we all make mistakes. But boy, Stacy, you did a plain one. <br /> <br /> Hey, one thing that was never done in the west, even in the female composition, they actually hung the woman on the gallows. It may be western first. Despite the fact that her neck had to be broken, and she survived the ordeal, nevertheless, you must give the director some effort to first try western. In addition, I have never seen a woman who was prowling from a horse in any western region, although this did not happen in this film, I just thought that I would give the director another idea for Gang Of Roses # 2, which should be done right away after Ed Wood Monster Bride # 2. Perhaps this is what the creators of this film were striving for. Originality, especially with the participation of all African women and the Eastern shepherd. <br /> <br /> Hi, if the creators of Gang Of Roses want to continue this mess, you can have a jargon like "Hey, don't take away about my housewives" and "talk with your hand, baby, talk with your hand" . You might also have a deputy marshal like a surfer dude who says something like: "This shootout was a FULLY RANDOM person, completely." You know such things.
