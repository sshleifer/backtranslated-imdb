as always it is an inaccurate picture of the homeless. In the early 1990s, television lied a lot about those involved in panning, and made everyone look bad, and claimed that we all earned more than $ 100 a day, when $ 20-40 a day was much closer to reality. when someone drove past the place where I held the job offer sign and offered me a job, I actually went and took the job if I was physically able. Less than 2 years, and most of the time kept in the bank, and still left himself 10-20000 dollars in cash games worth 1-2 dollars and 2-5 dollars in the casino. I usually always win and I can win well, if I only have a bankroll. instead, I win about $ 1000 a month - everyone plays minimal purchases because they don’t want to risk losing it all. I was only homeless, because I didn’t want to risk spending all my money and going broke, sometimes I had more than 1000-2000 dollars in socks when I was sleeping on the street. Anyone who wants to talk is contacted by sevencard2003 on Yahoo Messenger. I confess that I was different from most homeless people, although due to the fact that I never drank smoke and did not take drugs. I am no longer homeless, now I’m in government housing for $ 177 a month, I get SSI and I win most of my time in online poker. mom and sunflower worked hard to get me ssi. I am glad that my days, when I slept under the stage at the casino conference center and slept at night, worried about being caught by the guards, finally ended. if this film crew had chosen me, they would have finished much earlier. It is a pity that they do not choose whom to choose.
