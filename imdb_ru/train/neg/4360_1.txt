First let me say that I had to think a lot about writing a commentary on this film. The best view for this kind of cinema can be just silence. The film is addressed to housewives and grandmothers. This film tries to look “authentic,” and the characters should be considered “real people.” The Italian never thought that the characters could be "real": these are just "low profile" stereotypes. This gives a very disguised view of what life is in the Italian countryside. The plot is weak (plot? What plot?) And the humor does not make anybody older than 12 years laugh.
