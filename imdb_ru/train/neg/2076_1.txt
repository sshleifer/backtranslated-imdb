Well, I have to say that this is probably the worst movie I have seen this year! The jokes were very rude (I did not expect it to be like a PG movie) (Rated PG in Canada), and they were not funny! With this great cast, I at least expected a good game, but I didn't even get it. I am a big fan of Rein Wilson, and for the first time I was extremely disappointed with his performance. Neither the characters of Luke Wilosna, nor the character of Uma Thurman are at all pretty, and I really would not give a damn what happened to any of them. I did not expect this at all, since in the past I really liked other films of this director (for example, “Six Days, Seven Nights”). This film did NOT cost $ 10, but cost me, and I highly recommend you not to watch this movie. , I guarantee that you will, like me, ask to end this film.
