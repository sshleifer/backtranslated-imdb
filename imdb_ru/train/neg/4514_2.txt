The problem with the book “Memoirs of a Geisha” is that it had Japanese surfaces, but under these surfaces it was a way of thinking of an American person. Reading a book is like watching a magnificent ballet with great music, decorations and costumes performed by cattle dressed in these costumes - the characters were so far from Japanese thinking. <br /> <br /> The film is not about Japan or a real geisha. This is a story about a few American misconceptions about Japan and geisha, filtered through their own ignorance and delusion. So what is this movie if it’s not about Japan or a geisha? This is pure fantasy, as many people said? Yes, but why then turn it into an American fantasy? <br /> <br /> There were so many missed opportunities. Imagine a culture in which there are no Puritan hobbies, no connotations of the sin of sex. Sex is natural and normal. How is sex handled in this movie? Right. Like it was dirty. Closest to the sex scene in the film, Sayuri wrinkled her nose and wincing her face for five seconds, as if a man trying to sit on her threw a handful of cockroaches at her crotch. <br /> <br /> Does anyone actually enjoy sex in this movie? Nope It is said that one character is erratic, but all that we see is that it pushes away her lover, because, it seems, she does not want to be caught on something dirty. This typical American Puritanism has no place in the film about the Japanese geisha. <br /> <br /> Sayuri liked her first delight at some old hooligan after her cherry was auctioned off? Nope It lies there, like a cold piece of meat on a cutting board. Of course, she should not enjoy it. And this is what I mean in this film. Why couldn't they give her something to enjoy? Why should all sex be sinful and wrong? <br /> <br /> The chairman behind Mameha was the secret patron saint of Sayuri, and therefore he stood behind the auction of her virginity. He could fake an auction and win it himself. Nobu did not even bid. So why did the chairman let this old bully beat her and, stinking from the stinking old man, clasp her naked body with her fingers? Can any woman ever forgive a man for this? <br /> <br /> Let's try to figure it out. Being behind Mamehy, the Chairman took the debt for training the geisha Sayuri. To repay his debts, the Chairman sold Sayuri to Dr. Krab. Through Mameha, the Chairman sold the sexual services of Sayuri to this old crank so that the Chairman could make some money on her. The chairman was not her patron. He was her pimp! A little romantic love story. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is great, but it looks like the beauty of a very attractive, seductive transvestite, whose voice, appearance and every touch excites. But under this very feminine surface lies an ominous secret. Under the wrong Japanese film surface, there is a sinister secret lurking that the heart, soul, spirit and core of this film are completely American and male. Not the best thing if it tries to be different from lies, distortions and terribly wrong ones. <br /> <br /> Some contrasts between Japan and MOAG: <br /> <br /> Japanese style ?? Exquisite, elegant simplicity. MOAG style ?? Peking Opera. <br /> <br /> Japanese geisha ?? Hair swept. MOAG geisha ?? Loose hair, which probably spoiled in a thick paste of white makeup. <br /> <br /> Japanese shaved ice - the Japanese are pretty strict about the seasons. Shaved ice is a summer treat. MOAG shaved ice - The chair buys Chiyo, a young Sayuri, played by the marvelous Suzuka Ohgo, this treat during the cherry blossom season. This thought made my body shiver from the cold. <br /> <br /> Japanese geisha ?? Trained and experienced artists. MOAG geisha - sluts. <br /> <br /> Japanese wind chime - Used in the summer, because hearing the sound that it makes, thanks to the breeze, the Japanese feel somewhat cooler. MOAG bell - doorbell! If a person stood in front of someone else's house and made noises with the sound of wind, they would consider him crazy, not an entrance. <br /> <br /> Japan ?? Emphasis on group-oriented human relationships. MOAG ?? "I want my life" American individualism. <br /> <br /> Japanese traditional dance ?? Exquisite elegance. Almost geometric and mechanical accuracy. Moag dance ?? Martha Graham goes crazy with LSD, wearing a not very favorable white Japanese burial shroud. Performed by a geisha down the gangway in a place that looks like a strip club? Ha ha ha! Strip club, where they spent most of their research geisha? <br /> <br /> Fire in Japan? Inciting or even inciting fire is worse than killing, because it represents such a terrible threat to the community. Fires can break through these wooden villages, cities and towns, destroying hundreds or thousands of homes and killing as many people as possible. Fire from the House of MOAG - A great addition to the battle scene, but there are no zero ramifications, and because it is no longer needed, uncontrollable fire miraculously extinguishes itself. Technically, the film ended here, because at least Sayuri would be ostracized and join her sister among those whom she had never heard of before. Arthur Golden and Rob Marshall should be exiled there. <br /> <br /> Enough. The film stinks.
