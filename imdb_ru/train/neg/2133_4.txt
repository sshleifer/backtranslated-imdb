First things first: I'm not a conservative. And although I would never call myself a liberal or a democrat, I have been against the war in Iraq since day one. I think it’s safe to say that John Cusack and I will probably see a glance at politics, in fact, I’m sure that we would have become friends if we ever talked about what wonderful documents Adam Curtis had for BBC. My point is this: do not discredit this review, thinking that I am not part of the choir that Cusack preaches in War, Inc. There is no doubt that the WI policy is adapted to my demographics, but the problem is that the tailoring is of poor quality, and the film created by Cusack in collaboration, the producer and the stars, is worse than the cheap costume. <br /> <br /> As the saying goes, "the road to hell is paved with good intentions." Cusack, his co-authors, director Joshua Seftel and even the actors involved in this, no doubt, intended to make the anti-war film as cool and funny as in the Robert Altman film M * A * C * H, unfortunately for the viewer, as a result they proved to be as unfunny and unreasonable as Michael Moore's Canadian bacon. <br /> <br /> The current state of American politics, foreign policy and military "efforts" is already absurd and, as a result, tragic, pathetic and, unfortunately funny - just watch The Daily Show and see for yourself. The bottom line is that you can’t write such fun stuff as what the Bush administration provides us with on a daily basis, so why try to compete? <br /> <br /> The main problem with WI is that it feels like it was putting together in a hurry. To do this, Cusack essentially cannibalized Grosse Pointe Blank (one of his best films), changed the setting and scored ideas from the collected works of Naomi Klein on the shopping list. Most of these ideas hit you in the throat in the first twenty minutes of the movie, and what makes them so disgusting is no joke, no joke, or deliberately obvious references to Halliburton, the neo-cons, and the American occupation of Iraq. smart or funny. The authors are so blinded by their own dogma that they felt that simply by referring to these problems, the film would be fun and disruptive. The problem is ... it is not. By now, these ideas have become yesterday’s news, and if you haven’t lived or swayed or blinded by ignorance, denial, and sheer stupidity (read: right-wing Christian), these jokes are insultingly simple. <br /> <br /> It is possible that WI will work if it is more detailed, disruptive, offensive and full of detailed research / views on the profession. In fact, the jokes and spectacles are all superficial and so bad, with such a small grace, refinement or satirical wickedness, that they only made me moan. Homer Simpson once said, “This is ridiculous because it’s true,” and The Daily Show proves it every night; However, War, Inc. proves that just because it's true, it's not funny. Bottom line: hyperbole is not required when it comes to fomenting US politics / neoconservatives ... this is a pretty big joke. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
