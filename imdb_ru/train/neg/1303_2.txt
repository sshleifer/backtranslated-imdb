It is assumed that Edward Montana's "Tattooed Stranger" will play as a crime thriller with a small film noir mixed in for the fragrance. Instead, it is a bad acting, reckless look at a low-budget and boring movie. The plot is absurd, and the actions are painfully tough and amateurish. John Miles, who had a rather subtle resume in the industry, is grinning and disgusted everywhere, and everyone else is acting with the same inspiration as the characters in the government-created film about driver safety. The film anticipates such shows as "Leave it to Beaver" and "Father Knows Better" in his unnaturally useful view of New York in 1950. Why the viewer does not even manage to see someone smoking a cigarette until they give an interview to some beautiful woman in the doss house in the middle of the film. The only thing that the film has for this (besides its brevity) are excellent shots from the shooting location, coordinated by William Steiner. The low-budget film works in favor of the cinematographer, since the viewer is offered well-designed footage of New York interiors and expansive exteriors. If you do not want to enjoy the movie to select the settings and camera angles, I advise you to watch almost any other movie.
