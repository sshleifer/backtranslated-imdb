First of all, I want to say that I am a Christian (and that I work in the film and television industry), so I understand what it is like to work on a full-length film, so in this sense, the support of filmmakers. I am for positive, inspiring messages if they correspond to the nature of life (that this is a fallen world and that does not always work ... even for followers of Christ). I am glad that others have such a positive reaction to the frank Christian message; for me it was just that the performance is where the film fell on his face. The film lives and dies from its history, and here you have one-dimensional stereotypes, plenty of exposure and spontaneous changes in the character's behavior, which are at least inexplicable. I believe that the film does not necessarily hit you on the head with its message in order to understand the essence. I'm sure the Kendrick brothers. will improve with time, and that their storytelling methods will also. Perhaps they could send someone's script as their next project. <br /> <br /> * Sports films are not exactly my first love, but good (Hoosiers, Field of Dreams, etc.) Can inspire in many ways. If you are interested in a movie rated PG that inspires, take a look at Stephen Soderbergh's “King of the Hill”. All truth is God's truth ...
