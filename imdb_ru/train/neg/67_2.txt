From the very beginning, the political theme of this film is so obvious and cruel that the outcome is quite predictable. Any good scripting tutorial will advise layering of characters, the inclusion of arcs of characters and the structure of the three actions. In this film you will not find any of this. Police villains, and therefore shown as petty, incompetent and underpants. The creators of this film never think that the police can be a decent citizen who believes that joining the police is a good way to contribute to the well-being of society. <br /> <br /> The viewer has no opportunity to make up. his or her opinion about whether Ned Kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain. The film begins with the fact that he is arrested for stealing a horse, but we have no idea about his guilt or innocence. We see him going through the prison door, but we only know that he was inside for three years, when we hear it much later in some kind of dialogue. <br /> <br /> In this film, there are many shots of Ned looking at the camera with a serious expression on his face. I found the film a real deal to watch. This is the direction for modern films, and it no longer allows me to watch movies.
