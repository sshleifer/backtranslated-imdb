I took this dvd in store dollars. The DVD was 2 for the rack for 1 dollar, but since Michael Madsen was in it, I thought that since I had never seen the movie, I still bought it. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I do not dislike the movie. The film played more like a documentary or a religion advertisement than anything else. I found that the director’s use of memories did not add to my storyline. I would prefer to view the storyline in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I won’t throw it away like one of the other commentators, but it can take quite a long time before I look at this movie again. <br /> <br /> Who knows, since it was Michael Madsen’s debut in the movie, he may have some archival value in the future.
