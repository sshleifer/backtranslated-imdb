I think that Michael Ironside's acting career should be over if he has to star in this kind of low-budget shit. Of course, he could have done better than wasting his time on this garbage. <br /> <br /> This film could be much better if it had a good budget, but it was shown repeatedly throughout the film. At the outpost, there is one scene that looks like the outside in front of the train station, and I bet that it was. <br /> <br /> There is one scene that gave this film 3, and it shows a spaceship landed and took off over a lake surrounded by forests. It was well done, but the rest of the film, forget about it. <br /> <br /> There is another scene, similar to an engineering factory, to which I bet, and not like a space outpost as the character says it is. <br /> <br /> This film is stupid, has a serious budget, does not make sense, and God help Mishal Ironsayd.
