I don't know much about filmmaking, but good films have to tell a story ... your characters have to start and complete their journey. In “The Last Exit to Brooklyn” they may, but this is not at all satisfactory, and I do not mean a happy ending, just ANY end. <br /> <br /> The last exit to Brooklyn, established in 1952 in Brooklyn during a very cruel working strike sets in motion a series of plot threads. Most of them involve the most incredible characters who have ever walked around the screen of the film. But The Last Exit to Brooklyn cannot lead these stories to any conclusion ... it leaves some of them hanging endlessly or turns into some kind of strange stratosphere for an “artistic” ending. <br /> <br /> Two cases and contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> A sad transvestite character (an important character in the film) who is hit by a car and killed. And this is all for him in the film ... he is gone forever, erased from the memory of all ... no reactions from his friends, enemies, lovers .... nothing. <br /> <br /> In another topic, a stupid, ignorant, and secretly gay strike leader who was rejected by labor, his gay lover and discovered by neighbors thugs, were trampled by gangsters. The final beating scene shows the streets of Brooklyn, and the street lights are very, very similar to the streets of the Nazi death camps ... and the scene stretches again and again ... and the camera shows the body of the Labor leader, and he was crucified ..... ppppuuuulllleeeeeez. And, of course, it is for him too .... erasing the brain ..... disappeared. <br /> <br /> Bottom line .... no matter what the reviewers originally said about this film in 1989 .... This film is a depressing piece of dirt. Avoid this. And if you are not warned, it really deserves an NC-17 rating for an enormous amount of physical, emotional, and sexual cruelty ... don't even let teens look.
