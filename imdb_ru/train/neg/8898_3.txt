Can a fake landscape ruin a picture? You would not think so, but this is actually for me here. Listen, I have a lot of films of the classical era, and I know what I need, except for, for example, drivers, driving fixed cars in front of the screen, etc. But most of this hockey business is associated with fighting scenes. Having fake landscapes, fake mountains and flowers shot behind the scenes, as seen in Brigadune, after some time becomes offensive. <br /> <br /> With regard to musical entertainment, it is always subjective. What songs one person loves, another may not be so that there should not be a big part of the evaluation of the film (does anyone like the songs). I could have blown up this film for its banal songs of the 1950s, dances, romances and characters, but it was the 50s, and many people liked such things. Musicals were very good in the 50s. I liked the 30s and 40s with great cranes. By the 50s, I didnâ€™t have a crane, and this new material that I can handle was it. Does that make this a lousy movie? Not. It's just that movie that didn't really bother me. <br /> <br /> Despite a good cast, a good director and high expectations, this film was bombed at the box office and with me. I should like it more, I am a dreamer myself, and this is a good part of this story. I am not a cynical type and a good city and good people who make me feel good sounds awfully attractive. Then why can't I connect with this movie? Part of this was also dance. I don't care what will replace the dance on the screen. But - no - the thing really turned me off, what kind of statement. There was no Scotland, no highlands, just a hockey background, so that it looked like that, and it turned me almost from the very beginning. Score one point for today's realism, in which they most of the time "go to the place."
