my friend bought a movie for 5 ?? (it doesn't even cost 1 cent) because they wrote it was like an American pie. but we'll soon find out that the American pie is still far from this shit. it's not even a comedy, it looks more like a really really bad documentary. not only the story is bad, the picture and sound also sucks. they inject alcohol, chickens, gnomes and drunk teenagers. and the result is a catastrophe. if you see this movie, do not buy it, it is better to spend money on something else, and better. if you are going to torture yourself, then do not invite your friends, unless you really hate and want to get rid of them.
