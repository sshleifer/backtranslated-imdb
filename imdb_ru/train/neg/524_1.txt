The "40-year-old virgin" exists in a world that I do not understand. A world in which an employee of an electronics store can say to his boss "f *** off" and broadcast a video of his bare ass throughout the store, and not get reprimanded. A world where it is really funny to be drunk and crash into other people's cars. A world in which the boss seems normal to rape his subordinates. A world full of raging and abusive stereotypes of ethnic minorities. And the world without any funny jokes! I am absolutely shocked by the seeming chorus of the audience who liked this film. I thought that each scene was like a bad sketch, “Saturday Evening Live” - not very funny from the very beginning and went beyond the bounds of sensible thoughts. The waxed scene on the chest continued FOREVER. <br /> <br /> Characters, except Karella, were completely on one note. And the romantic elements were completely far-fetched, especially the stage where Keener finds porn in Carell’s apartment. It was just unconvincing. <br /> <br /> And I also found the Aquarius sequence completely annoying and excessive. I hated, hated, hated this film!
