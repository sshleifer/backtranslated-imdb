I just want to start by saying that this is the first review of the film I made online. I felt the need to warn people about this film, because it is truly one of the worst films I have ever seen. After reading the interview with the director, he says that he respects constructive criticism, so I will try not to beat the film just for the sake of it and express my opinion on why I consider it so disastrously horrible. <br /> <br /> 1. Actors. I know that great fans might not have been taken into account in the budget, but since Nicholson had been working in this industry for more than ten years, he probably knew some of the actors who were at least average. <br /> <br /> 2. Incredibly shit makeup and special effects. Again, the budget clearly interfered with what was originally planned, but after many years of work on makeup, there is no excuse. <br /> <br /> 3. The obvious similarity with the hostel. Despite the fact that he was not distracted, he certainly is trying to cash in on the success of previous films. The only problem is that Roth knew where he was going and how exactly to get there ... <br /> <br /> 4. Music. Nothing scary and not haunting, not even sickening, just annoying. <br /> <br /> 5. The overall scenario. The whole dialogue was forced and terrible! In addition, the stories about the theater and the guy who comes to save them were weak and almost like an afterthought. <br /> <br /> 6. Editing. WTF. As rattles, and not in a good way. Nuf said. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I would like to hear the director’s thoughts about my post (he, no doubt, frequently visits his pages on IMDb.) causes a friend ... what you were thinking about. Of course, at some point during filming or editing, you realized that you had a Yolu turkey in your hand ... I'm sorry, I don’t want to be harsh, but you should have more talent than this, I hope your The next function is a movie with greedy balls. Better, I hope the practice will progress. <br /> <br /> But for now, avoid it like the plague. I want my 81 minutes ago with interest. (At least I did not pay to watch it.)
