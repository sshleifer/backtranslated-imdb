This is really a terrible clone of "LOCK STOCK" with a star cast and a terrible scenario. I have no idea why so many of the best British actors subscribed to this stuff, they must have been bribed. The storyline contest always goes on forever and ever, and if I hadn’t paid good money for it, I would have turned it off in 10 minutes. Not the worst movie I've ever seen, this honor goes to the truly pathetic, used bogroll from the movie “(I use the term freely) half a life) but this garbage is almost there. Definitely one of the worst 5 films I've ever seen. Such things remind Hollywood that they have no monopoly on really awful movies.
