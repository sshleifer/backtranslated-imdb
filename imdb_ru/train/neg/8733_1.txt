*** Possible plot spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I love Dennis Hopper. I question why he took on the role of a police detective in 2000. This movie sucks and I'm going to tell you why. <br /> <br /> This is about a small town that is going to get a contract for the sports arena. One hitch: there is a killer at large, and this is bad for business. The mayor makes a deal with the Irish Mafia to find the killer and make sure he never gets to court. Det. Ed Delongpre has other plans. He wants this guy to be caught too, but he is on the level and believes in the system. He wants the system to do its job. <br /> <br /> This could be nice. It could be exciting. It was terrible. First, they call this guy a serial killer. No error There are certain criteria, and none of them fit here. Bad guy killed 5 children on the first day, and I think it was 2 children on the second day. This whole film covers a 48-hour period ... It is unlikely that the Serial Killer action. I don't care what perverted motives they give him in the end, the serial killers do their work for a long period of time. They do not just suddenly kill 7 children in two days. This is fun. <br /> <br /> Well, this irritant aside, the game was terrible. The only name here was Hopper, and he is the only one who even came close to doing his part. Unfortunately, he seems to be recruited for me, and I think that he is doing a lot of psychological games much, much better. It simply was not a good vehicle for Hopper. This did not allow him to do what he does best, that is, to act terribly. The point is not that he did poorly, but that I saw how he coped much better. <br /> <br /> The guy from the Irish Mafia, Johnny Gault (Tom McCamus - “A Long Journey to the Night”), who responds to their investigation is too hard. Contradiction? Not really. He is trying to play a cold, hard lover, and he does it to such an extent that the character is just wooden. Boring to max. He did not scare me. He did not cause any emotions, except boredom. I can't tell you how many times I checked to find out how much time passed before the end of this film. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that it resembles a film made for television. , If you know what I mean. Low production rates, low budget, reuse of scenes to save costs. Just yes yana? But I feel that comparing it with those is an insult. <br /> <br /> Derek Vanlint was both the director and the filmmaker in this project. He bit off more than he could chew. I can't help but feel that Hopper must have taken this role as a personal service to a friend. This is the only reasonable thing I can think of. This was Vanlin's first work as a director, the third as a cinematographer. I hope this was a learning experience for him. <br /> <br /> I won’t spoil the final if you decide to torture yourself with this, but I want to say that they all threw the ball here. ..all bunker. In a scene that was supposed to be emotionally agonizing for a detective, it was just ... good ... blah. I did not see the slightest anxiety that could accompany the full gear changes that this guy did. Very disappointing. <br /> <br /> These are 100 grueling minutes and an R rating for violence and language. No child under the age of 13 will be interested in watching this, so do not worry. In any case, it does not suit anyone. heh <br /> <br /> Skip this. You will thank me later.
