Kevin Spacey is very talented, but, unfortunately, direction is not his forte. I had high hopes for the film before I rented it, and perhaps that is why I did not like it so much. I admire Spacey’s attempt to make a film that happens mostly in one small place, but it’s not an attempt that matters. I found the film boring, boring and stretched. There was nothing special about acting. Gary Sinise has done better, especially since he is conscious in most of his other films. Skeet Ulrich was disappointing, but it was one of his first films (I enjoyed how young and plump this star Creek looked). The only thing that impressed me about this movie is the one shot from the car accident on top. The center line of the road was perfectly centered, and the camera moved along the line and passed by the wreckage. However, this picture was a very “ordinary suspect,” and I assume that Spacey got the idea from his earlier film (which is very good of you). If you want to see a stunning film that takes place in one small place, see Hitchcock's Lifeboat. Perhaps Spacey was watching this before filming it.
