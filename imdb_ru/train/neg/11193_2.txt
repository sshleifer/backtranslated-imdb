Well, I didn’t have high expectations, but this film went down into the depths that I couldn’t imagine. <br /> <br /> A priest from a little-known two-person order investigating the death of the founder participated in the story. Order of the Sin Eater. The devourer of sins allows Catholics to find salvation outside the power of the Church and is another immortal in a film with a lot of longing. Never mind that it makes no sense since a Baptist can give you salvation .... we will go on. <br /> <br /> I will mark the plot without any special distribution: the priest goes to Rome with his friend to explore. He brought with him a mentally ill person (I do not invent this) who shot him during the excision and who loves him (no explanation given to anyone), a drunken Irish priest and Peter Weller in the role of the cardinal. They get to Rome, find some creepy children who do nothing in the film, meet with the anti-daddy S & M related to slavery, whom a drunk Irish guy knows (not explained) and who gives information by killing people (oh , he is a bad guy, so he has an industrial / techno soundtrack) and then ... hm, seriously, I'm not sure. the plot twists around. Hit catches a cold with the Sin Eater, flies to New York with the Sin Eater for the night, and then something else happens, and then (everything from the camera) the anti-pop hits and the movie ends. <br /> <br /> 1 hour after the beginning of the film, it’s really interesting if anything happened. By the end, something happened, but you cannot be absolutely sure that it matters, and since most of the drama happens either before the move or off-stage, you really feel deceived.
