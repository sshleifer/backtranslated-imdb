This film was shown in the trailer as a comedy. This is an extreme tragedy. It made me ache in my stomach. I hated it. I think that if they want to make such a film, they must be courageous enough to reflect the true intentions of the film in the trailer. I would not see this movie if I knew. I think the trailer should reflect the theme and intentions of the film. I'm tired of this. I really wanted to have a funny comedy, and I am very disappointed. A few days have passed, and I still feel a bad taste from this film. I have never been more disappointed in the movie, and I never wrote comments about a bad movie. I really think that a real deception was involved in this trailer, because if they had shown the true intention of the film, no one would have seen it.
