First, this is a low-budget film, so my expectations were incredibly low. I guess most of the people who watched this movie just wanted bloodshed, and, in fact, that's all there is. <br /> <br /> Story? There really is not one. This is mostly seen, but in China and generally much worse. Cast? There is no point. Special effects? Absolutely awful, in my opinion ... There were circumcisions, and the blood was often completely unbelievable because of the quantity, spatter, color, texture, etc. <br /> <br /> I believe that the purpose of this film was brutal shock movie. Now he had a lot of potential with a larger budget, but bad scenarios, poor communication, a terrible game, what seemed like videotaping from a video camera and just incredible “bloody” made this film truly awful. <br /> <br /> There. If some films deserve to be tried, even b-rate films deserve some of the features (for example, the bloody tracks were the most recent ones I saw against reviews that were worth it), but it was just awful. I hope that people reviewing this film will read my comment and decide against it. <br /> <br /> I’m all in cruelty and shock, but total unrealism and truly terrible acting make a terrible experience. Save your time / money and risk something else, you will not be disappointed.
