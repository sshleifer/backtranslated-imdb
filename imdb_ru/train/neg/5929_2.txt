The people who praise this film are real disappointments - I hope that, at least, Leonard will get a good income from this, as his savings were stolen by the manager a couple of years ago, and now he is over 70. . In the beginning, Leonard himself says that he is not sentimental towards his past, and then for the next hour and a half the film emphasizes all the worst sentimental elements of Leonard's songs. This is so bloody FRAUD with its endless close-ups of over-excited singers. Cohen's interview done in large video clips, and I so wanted to see the middle or long frame of his whole body! I didn't give a damn about the performers' comments, especially those bloated ego guys Edge and Bono. None of the performers in this film wrote a single song as well as Leonard's own music, and if you think about it, and you have any doubts, listen to them. This would be an acceptable PBS special, perhaps for showing at one time. But I even doubt when I get a DVD with this. When Leonard’s semi-performance “The Tower of Song” is finally shown in the film, it is destroyed when Bono takes a verse. Even the occasional good performances (Anthony, the first number of Rufus, Traitor Martha) are spoiled by the context of the rest of this rough ball. Forget about it and buy the latest Leonard album, if you want to give him his due.
