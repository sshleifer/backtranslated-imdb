I saw bad movies, but it took n ***. It made no sense, and all the characters swear every two seconds, oh, and I think everyone has a low sperm level. It's good. Welshman plays swear words. A chic English guy plays an obscene crook with a disgusting voice, and some smaller lights play dim pies. <br /> <br /> And there are some Russian gangsters. Oh, yes, someone has a gun and maybe he is talking trash, while he has a lot of drugs. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like the plague.
