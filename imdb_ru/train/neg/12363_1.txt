This is one of those films in which, apparently, tried to ride on the passion for martial arts. Kind of like Billy Jack, I think. However, although Billy Jack had one noticeable scene of martial arts, there is not one in it, except for the fact that gentlemanly fights and rough actions are like that. We meet a star who is said to have learned judo in the marines. I was in the marines, and although they are fairly well known in boxing, I really donâ€™t remember any emphasis on judo. As a result, the antagonist, James MacArthur, refers to judo when he offers an excuse why he, the national champion, was so easily defeated. Lame.
