It was one film that I always wanted to watch, when it came out, the promo was conspicuous, and Govinda in a negative role was a surprise <br /> <br /> But the film is not so good <br /> <br /> He has a lot flaws <br /> <br /> The start is good and everything goes well before the murder, but the film collapses when the romantic path begins between Govinda and Karisma and the subsequent songs <br /> <br /> Then the turn that Govinda and The taboo is in love, leaves more doubts and shortcomings, and then why does Govinda turn into a rich criminal from a poor rural resident? <br /> <br /> The last memory is also prolonged, as well as the whole conflict between Govinda Carisma and Tabu <br /> <br /> H Chandra is disappointing. The music is fine, Bahot Hobsurath stands out. <br /> <br /> Govinda tries to play a negative role and succeeds in this, although Karishma is sometimes too overdoing, but sometimes irritates with her screams. Taboo is fine. Nirmal Pandey still does not know the difference between a loud cry and acting rest. Y
