Put aside the repetition of Dr. House, which I missed, and the desperate housewives (the new ones) to watch it. I don’t know exactly what this film was pursuing. I never thought I'd say this, but I want my 15 minutes of fame back. <br /> <br /> Script, Direction, I can not say. I recognized the stable of actors (the usual suspects), but I thought that Herbert Marshall was a great addition, and sat down for a good stupid film. Boy, I was wrong. Dullesville. <br /> <br /> My favorite parts are: where the “office girl” does with the 029 keys and puts cards into the sorter 087. LOL @ computer. I would like someone to identify the next device - 477? It was even before the time of this dinosaur. <br /> <br /> And we, dinosaurs, do not have much time.
