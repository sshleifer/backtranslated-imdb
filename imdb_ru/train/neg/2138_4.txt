War, Inc. - Corporations go to war in the future and use the lone assassin Brand Hauser (John Cusack) to do their job against competing CEOs. Dark comedy, making fun of both the military and corporations. It was often difficult to understand exactly what was happening. I kept waiting for things to make sense. Madness has no cause or method. <br /> <br /> Cusack considers him the “spiritual successor” of Gross Point Blanca. Those. war is more or less fake. We again see Cusack as the killer, defending * the spoiler * man, whom he must kill when he seizes his conscience. Honestly, John Cusack looks pretty believable, killing half a dozen guys relatively easily. Short fights look good. The rest of the movie is gone. It's all bizarre, often bordered by the bizarre. War Inc is not fun enough to be a parody, and too cheerful that someone even thinks about what the idea of ​​a movie might be, which I suppose could be the heartless way corporations, such as military groups, compete and plan without consensus how they affect ordinary citizens. Interesting, but satire just doesn't work, because it's not funny, and there's no heart at the heart of the movie. It is assumed that we do not care how the war affects the shell of Cusack's character, and not on the millions of lives torn by war. <br /> <br /> John Cusack does a good job. His character tries hot sauce shots and drives the smallest private jet, but oddities are meant to replace character traits. Marisa Tomei, as a romantic journalist girlfriend, is taking a nap. There really is not much chemistry between them. Hilary Duff tries Russian accent and does not fool herself. Joan Cusack just screams, whines and wigs. Blech Ben Kingsley may have to get Oscar back if he doesn't play a decent game from time to time. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> This is not a horrible movie, but at the end you have to ask: "War, what is it good for?" Absolutely nothing. C-
