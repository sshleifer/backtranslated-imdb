Sitcom "League of Gentlemen" tells about the life of several bizarre inhabitants of the fictional village "Royston Vasya". Different scenes are connected to each other by a common installation. <br /> <br /> In the first series, in the form of a sketch, the main story is devoted to a new road that will be laid through Royston Wasi. Consequently, more foreigners visit the small city. But Edward and Tubbs, the owners of the "local" store, which is actually located far from the city, do not like foreigners. Whenever a visitor enters their store, they kill him. In my opinion, some scenes are tasteless and not funny at all, for example, when a couple absorbs two engineers who want to build a new road. Edward bangs and Tubbs dances half-naked around the victims. <br /> <br /> Moreover, Pauline lives in Royston-Wasi. She works at a local employment center. Although Polina hates the people with whom she has to work, the woman does not want to lose her job. Therefore, when an unemployed man is interviewed as a firefighter, she does not allow him to leave, because he is not yet ready to work. <br /> <br /> Then there is Barbara Dickston, a transsexual, a taxi driver who is very keen on the details about "her" sexual conversion. <br /> <br /> In addition, a veterinarian, Mr. Chinnery, always kills animals and does not treat them. In one case, he comes to the farm and leads to the living room, where the dog lies in his basket. The farmer goes outside. Assuming that the dog is a sick animal, Mr. Chinnery puts him to sleep. A second later, the farmer opens the door, holding a sheep in the hand of a “real” sick animal. <br /> <br /> A few more residents - the husband and his wife, visited by their nephew (his friend was killed by the store owners, by the way). The pair is very neat. They have, for example, towels of different colors. Each color represents one part of the body. In addition, they have thousands of keys marked with different colors and precisely classified. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the actors play very well. Playing women, the scenes become funny. Costumes are suitable for actors. Tubbs is wearing a scarf, and some crazy characters, like Edward, have unappetizing black teeth. The series has a lot of dark humor, typical British. Scenography reflects the mood of the series. The village and all the houses look gray and ruined. Around the local store is often fog, which increases the threatening effect. Even the village sign is ominous: “Welcome to Royston Wasi. You never leave. <br /> <br /> Although I think the actors are doing an excellent job, this type of show is not to my taste.
