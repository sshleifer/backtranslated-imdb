Words let me down. <br /> <br /> And this is not often. <br /> <br /> If everything was done correctly, it could have been a great, funny parody of a sci-fi movie, but unfortunately it wasnâ€™t that way. Rarely in the field of drama, so many competent actors have so vainly fought with such script-luncheon dogs. I can only approve of the comments of the previous reviewer - go clean the bathroom. Actually do ANYTHING other than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Positive aspects: Lucy Beeman's nose. Cons: everything else. <br /> <br /> The most appropriate line: "This is not going anywhere." <br /> <br /> If only every plastic surgeon could meet with such a fate.
