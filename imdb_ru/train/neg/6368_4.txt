This is the last time I shoot a video without registering in IMDB reviews. “Limey” was directed by Steven Soderberg, who also wrote a really awful “Night Watchman” with Evan McGregor and removed such trash as “Out of Sight” with talented Jennifer Lopez. Terence Stamp is a wonderful actor, and it is a pity that he dragged himself into such a bad movie. There is a lot of confusing editing that seems to have been the last-minute solution to fill the gap or the story, the shooting, and just common sense. This movie does everything wrong. What were they thinking about?
