I'm a fan of B films, give me a genetically mutated bat and I'm in heaven. These films are good for making you stop thinking about everything that happens in your world. Even a stupid movie In usually makes me laugh, and I will still consider it a good thing. Then there was Hammerhead, which was so terrible that I had to register on IMDb so that I could warn others. First there was the science of creating a shark man, which the film barely touched. To interest the audience, they simply made sure that the blood every few minutes. During one attack scene, the camera moved away from the attack, but you saw that, apparently, the blood bucket was thrown by the stage hand, so that you knew that the attack was bloody and the person was probably dead (what incredible special effects). Returning to science, I thought that it was very interesting that the female subjects were kept naked, and the test equipment required that they be controlled through the breast tissue. In any case, this film had a bad plot, a terrible story, and I'm sorry to say that the acting was pretty bad. Even William Forsyth, Hunter Tylo or Jeffrey Combs could not save this bitch.
