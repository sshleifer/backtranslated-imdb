The wrong family goes home for the holidays and leads to murder and unrest. Cruel sexy Milligan he has the most homemade. Slightly better than home movies (like most Milligan films), this is a journey in the style of the 1960s debauchery. Notable for abundant naked body and sex, this film is not sexy and not disgusting, now it plays more strangely (although it is definitely appreciated). The film suffers from its uneven composition and cheap production (no one was ever sure where the money went to his films, since he was always ruined). This is a bad, bad film that should not be watched, except as a finalist of Milligan or because some beautiful people are fooled around him.
