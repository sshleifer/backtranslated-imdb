I have two good things about this film: beautiful scenery and Peter Falk perform well (considering what he had to work with in terms of dialogue and direction) However, nevertheless, I found this film extremely tedious. Watching the paint dry out would be more interesting. It seemed much longer than 97 minutes. Starting with the introductory sequence, where everyone is talking to each other, and Paul Reiser repeats everything he says on the phone, the film is annoying. The film is filled with clich√©s and jokes, not to mention endless instances of an audible swelling from Falk. In addition, the director seems to have difficulty deciding whether to strive for laughter or tears. There are some sequences that touch, but they are all played for fun. If the schmuck, sentimental and "cute" like you, you will like it. But if you were hoping for something more meaningful, watch another movie.
