I like Chris Rock, but I feel he is wasted in this film. The idea of ​​reworking Heaven Can Wait is beautiful, but the filmmakers have been following the plot of this turkey too closely. When Eddie Murphy reworked Dr. Dolittle and Nutty Professor, he completely redone them - so they became Murphy's movies / vehicles, not just cool remakes. That is why they were successful. If Chris had done the same thing, this film could be much better. The little laughter that comes when he performs his standing routine - so that he might as well make a concert film. It would also be much funnier if the white man whose body he inhabited was a truck driver or a countryman. So why does Hollywood continue to do things like this? Because people go for it - because they like Chris Rock. So give Chris a decent script and give us the best movies! Do not tinker with films that were not so good from the start!
