........ and very bad at this !!! How long did this train derailment last? 14 episodes or what ?? Now I understand why. <br /> <br /> I bought the “Serenity” episode on Amazon Unboxed. This was my first purchase, so it was free. This is the ONLY good thing about experience (incident ??) <br /> <br /> I will not really comment on the game, as it was, I think, quite new people who really did not get the job down right now. At least, I have never seen them before in any major show, in the theater or on television. If I did that, I easily forgot them. <br /> <br /> But the special effects were absolutely terrible. True, this is not quite a multi-million dollar project, but the original Star Trek worked better than this one, and it was THIRTY-FIVE YEARS back. I especially laughed at the bad guys ship (reapers or something like that) when he was chasing a funny-looking Firefly with smoke coming out of an engine resembling a gigantic rocket model. I fully expected that I would eventually see Wiley Coyote at the top, chasing Roadrunner. MODERN jet / rocket engines don't even make it so bad. <br /> <br /> And this was not even the worst. In the shootings like "Wild West" I had a question, do I really watch a science fiction film or a film "Gene Autry". <br /> <br /> Regardless of the hype, do not waste your time ... I did ... all 80 minutes with something about the disaster called "Firefly."
