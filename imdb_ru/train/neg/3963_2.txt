How many damn times should we see a ghost pass by and peak in mirror image? It has been made in two dozen films lately and four dozen times in this changeable, poorly made film. There were only two bizarre moments to appreciate ... when ghosts invaded the personal spaces of two characters. Speaking of characters, the game was as flat as a diet stake in 64 ounces. a cup from which I drew it. Side characters could be taken from various Scooby-Doo cartoons. There was a friendly, elderly sheriff. There was a strange eccentric living in deep forests with an Alabama whirlpool. Many characters without development. Initially, the most disturbing was the image of the murdered child. But instead of investigating the murder of a child that would be interesting, they simply let us know that she was dead, and it was difficult for her parents to reconcile her death with society and with each other. When they get to the cabin, the scenes rarely merge together ... with glittering images of a dead daughter inserted here and there. Oh ... and the terrible sounds too overdone. You know what I mean .... creaky doors that open by themselves, crickets in the forest, poison of poison. Ooooohhhh. I have not seen this before. Again, you will see again and again an amazing opening door in the film. NOTE TO DIRECTOR: a scary scene is scary only if it does not repeat every 5 minutes in the same movie. Think about it before calling out "this is a wrapper!"
