After seeing a dozen episodes, I decided to abandon this show, since it unrealistically depicts what mathematical modeling is. In the episodes in which Charlie predicted the future behavior of people using mathematical models, I thought that my profession was joking. I am not a mathematician, but a chemical engineer, but I work a lot with mathematical models. Therefore, I will try to explain to the nonprofessional why what is shown is close to the “invention” of fairy tales. <br /> <br /> First, choosing the right model to predict a situation is a difficult task. Charlie Epes is shown as a genius, but even he will have to spend a lot of time looking for the right model, in particular, to try to guess what someone will do or where he will be in the near future. People are unpredictable and random, for them there is no simulation. Isaac Azimov even wrote about this in the 1950s. Even if there was a model for a particular type of individual, it would be probabilistic (stochastic), which means that it has good chances to make a wrong prediction. <br /> <br /> Secondly, to assume that for someone or the situation is found, the parameters of the model must be known. These parameters are constants of equations, such as the acceleration of gravity (9.8 m / s2), and it is often difficult to determine them. Again, Charlie Eppes had to be someone outside of genius in order to know the right parameters for the model he chooses. And after the model and parameters are selected, they must be checked. Oddly enough, this is not the case, and by a miracle they correspond to the situation that is predicted. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, not only numbers, but also scientists almost always neglect a very important aspect of modeling. -fi movies: the computational effort required to solve these models. Try to force Excel to solve a complex model with many equations and variables, and one of them will find the fulfillment of hercules work. Even if Charlie Eppes has the right software for solving his models, he may be stuck on hardware that will be terribly slow. And even with the right combination of software and hardware, the model decision can take several days. He resolves them immediately! I could use his computer in my research work, I would be very happy. <br /> <br /> Like drama, this is not the best performance. The characters are somewhat stereotypical, but not even ridiculous, as in the theory of the Big Bang. Crimes are boring, and the way Charlie Epps solves them sometimes makes the FBI look rather incompetent. <br /> <br /> For some non-professional show can work. For others, the way things are handled is swallowing!
