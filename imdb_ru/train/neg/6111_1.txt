This is if she did not allow her husband John Derek to take up her career. Numerous Playboy's spread and bad films, like this one (in particular, this one) directed by John, destroyed the impulse that she had and made her the subject of many jokes. In the 1980s it was assumed that you could put a certain person in a certain movie, and it would be box-office gold. John decided that if Bo would be filmed in a film where she would be naked most of the time, people would crowd in theaters after the hype. Maybe if the film was good, maybe. This version of Tarzan must be the worst of all the interpretations of the jungle lord of Burrow, the slap in the face of the book of characters and the heritage of the film. Tarzan is actually an afterthought, because the film is, first and foremost, a remedy for Bo's chest and Richard Harris's remarkable acting skills (remember, the couple worked together at Orca).

Bo's body can take you so far. Miles O'Keefe, who played at least Tarzan, would have continued his long and pleasant career in the B-film, and Richard Harris may leave that behind after his recent triumphant performances, but Bo and John Derek never recovered from this fiasco The future collaboration only between the two served to show why his directorial career and her acting career died first. <br /> <br /> And how did the orangutan get to Africa?
