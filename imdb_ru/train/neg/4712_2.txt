This show is perhaps the biggest, ugliest, most common steam heap that I saw in children's programs, which really became successful. The main character, Johnny, although I understand that he should represent an ordinary child, is not cute and is not even tolerant. The jokes are unconvincing, exaggerated (that is, the gag "Wow! I did not see what is coming." Come on, it was not even funny the first time. It is not even cute), and there is no form of primitive wit or inspiration. And finally ... it's just ugly to watch. While children are not particularly critical of artistic talent, they still prefer eye candy. I can not stand to watch the show, because in a sense, the artistic style is just ... rude. Disgusting, in fact. Just slack. <br /> <br /> I simply cannot accept the fact that now there is so much airtime. Although I understand that nostalgia can be a bit irrational, and I should not pin my hopes on her return ... I really miss old cartoons. Bring back Dexter's Lab, Girls-cool girls ... anything but this crap. I think it's just wishful thinking. <br /> <br /> Simply put, I advise you not to waste time on this show. I believe that really good cartoons may appeal to big children. And it does not cut it.
