From the very beginning to the end, this is the most emotional film about NOTHING I have ever seen. The characteristics and interactions between the title character and the character Martha Kller are pure torture. Hippodrome as a trick of metaphor is so exaggerated that it borders on clich√©s, but director Pollak views every turn of the stud as if it were something very important. <br /> <br /> It may be worth replaying some scenes in the MSFT3000, such as Pacino, who is in contact with his inner woman, for silly values. But even such an occasional humor is hard to find in this common turkey.
