Wonderfully, this is actually quite watchable. I mean, this is bad. This is really bad. But while the original was so bad, it ruins my life, it's so bad, it's a little bad to entertain. That's right, rather weak praise. Production values ​​are rotting in all directions, the acting is painful, and Romero's satire cannot decide which side of the environmental fence she is mocking. Internal logic fades into the background from heads pushing themselves out of refrigerators, the incubation time of a virus varies depending on the “plot”, bullets work against zombies or not, zombies have the power of speech or not. The mountain, of course, is a draw, but the framework is so biting that annoying. The dialogue sounds as if it was translated by the same computers that use the manuals in the instructions, and the scale of the zombie infestation is not implied by any ingenuity of Romero's films. It all ends in a terrible synthesis. Absolute trash.
