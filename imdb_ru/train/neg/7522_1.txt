Wow ... where to start ... took it to Big Lots for just $ 2.99. These are three dollars that I will never see again ... never ... and for what? I will tell you. An hour and fifteen minutes of boring, boring, boring chat and longing for college, which seemed more suitable for the movie "Lifetime" than the horror show on the box. (Let the market droids who developed it burn to hell for all eternity). Watch out for this with a small amount of cheap blood (not even good blood, notice ...) and a plot twist at the end that comes out of nowhere and has no meaning. Terrible, terrible, terrible ... <br /> <br /> Were there any redemptive qualities? Well, on the Joe Bob Briggs scale there were six breasts, but this is hardly worth my three lost bucks. Without them, it could happen on Sci-Fi, say, at two or three in the morning ... <br /> <br /> Bmoviefreak
