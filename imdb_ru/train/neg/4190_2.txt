I saw this film a few months ago in a city that appeared in a film like Greendale, and this is the only reason I went to it. Another resident who was there just emailed me a re-ad because the first one was sold out and people were rejected. His editorial comment in his forward is a good summary: <br /> <br /> “Yuk”. <br /> <br /> If you are not a fan of Neil Yang or do not live in or near Greenndale (if you know the latter, you know the real name), skip this movie. This is basically an ego trip for the director. It has no noticeable plot, the music is just fine, and too much text is not clear, which makes it impossible to keep track of what small pieces of plot can be. <br /> <br /> I do not need to insert a spoiler warning, because there are no surprises. <br /> <br /> I would give 1.5 / 10, but this is simply because I see how the locales turn into a movie. It did not cost 6 dollars. I could rent a camcorder and ride Greenndale and make the best movie myself. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch * a good * movie with environmental messages without a plot, go to Koyaanisqatsi for rent.
