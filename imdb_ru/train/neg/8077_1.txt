I saw this movie a long time ago ... fortunately, it was free. I must be one of twenty people who saw this film in the theater. I don't remember all this, but I remember that I was incredibly bored, the plot did not make sense, and when I left the theater, the only thing I could say was, at least, now I know which worst movie I ever I saw it was. I was just incredibly worried about one thing: if they can make the temperature approaching the sun low enough for people to survive, why can't they lower it to a comfortable temperature instead of being hot and sweaty? How stupid do they think we are?
