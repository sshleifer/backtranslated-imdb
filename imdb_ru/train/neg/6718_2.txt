I wanted to watch a movie because of an article in a film magazine. It was not recommended by the critic. The storyline is different, and I'm sure it could be a good movie if it were in good hands. Directing and acting was terrible !! I had the feeling that I was watching a movie in which amateurs were filming. Although the film began promisingly, it was getting worse and worse. I think this is a non-original movie with inconvenient characters .. I still think it's worth watching, as I have not seen the movies Exposing gay porn. Do not keep your expectations high, then you will be very disappointed. * outside *****
