The plot is simple: an old man who lives on the main road in the forest, one day he sees a man killing a child in the forest. The digging software follows the old manâ€™s attempts to convince the police that what he saw was not his imagination. However, every time the old man directs the police to the place where the murder takes place, a problem arises, since the corpse cannot be found. Soft For Digging has a miniature dialogue that reflects most of the scenes in the film, an elderly person who lives himself in the house. During the film, I discovered that I was scared twice, namely, when the dead child suddenly appears before an old man. The rest of the film, I must admit, did not attract me; I found the pace of the film too slow. Limited dialogue was not a problem. However, the development of the story and its conclusions after watching the film took too much time. I feel that more could be done from relationships, ghostly meetings, with the child and the old man. Alone in the woods at night, insecurity in one's mind can lead to some terrible situations, children are always scary like ghosts, see Dark Water.
