Given that many horror films are based on the premise that one or more of the main characters do stupid things at some stage, the girls in this film collect gold, silver and bronze at the Olympic Darwin Awards ceremony. A mentally retarded baboon would have made a better choice than they, and at the same time would have shouted much less often. <br /> <br /> If you like movies with a grainy picture, intentionally amateur cinematography (I'm 92 years old Grandma owns a video camera with the best results), extremely bad sound and no noticeable plot / narration, then this is your ideal movie. Also note that you should like the following: women scream for no reason, women cry for no reason. In fact, the mind and logic in this film is not so much. For example: “We have to find Stephanie.” “Yes, I can't believe I talked to her like last night.” “She called you last night?” “Yes, she wanted to talk about some kind of date that she was asked to” “ WHAT? Why didn't she tell me? ” For example, a serial killer with a shotgun and a lot of terrible weapons is chasing our girlfriend, but I have a problem with the fact that she did not tell me that she was going on a date. <br /> <br /> OK, so the budget is low. This does not mean that you should make it look like half the budget. The Grade is interesting because all - with the exception of one - the tracks were written and performed by the authors / directors of the film itself. In fact, it might seem that the entire budget was spent on sampling the track The Duskfall, a death metal band from Sweden. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing thing in the whole film is the end, which leaves us with the possibility of continuing.
