From the very beginning of the film, I had the feeling that it was a film about another Jason from Friday the 13th. And this ... The argument that the film begins is interesting. But over time, this is just a meaningless film about a muted, supernatural, silent serial killer. I mean, he goes under the boy's bed, making no sound, no one sees him. He should have been blind after an unsuccessful execution, but he walks and kills people as before. I'm tired of this. For me, it's all the same. <br /> <br /> In other words - unreal. Too many mistakes and confusing information. <br /> <br /> Well, the scene with a woman with a low tide looked impressive, but only at first glance:} For this and for the intriguing intro 2 stars.
