Want a great recipe for failure? Take some plot, add some weak, completely undeveloped characters and add the worst special effects that a horror movie has ever known. Let stew during the week (the amount of time likely spent on creating this garbage). As a result, the film “Corpse Grinders” appeared, in which bad films fall into dangerous and exotic low places. <br /> <br /> The film just exploded. My words cannot convey how painful it was to watch. This is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can laugh and make fun of. This is not Plan 9 from space. It is a long, boring, sad waste of time. Corpse Grinders II is the biggest waste of energy and talent I have ever seen. I repress myself when I realize that people actually took time to act in this shit, if you can call it action. But then again, when you have bad leadership, bad story writing, bad everything, acting is the last thing to criticize. <br /> <br /> This film is like a huge disgusting piece of shit that you crave to quickly get rid of being afraid that a friend or loved one can somehow see it. For my part, I could somehow destroy every copy of this film so that it would not pollute the minds of beginning filmmakers. Thank you, Ted V. Mickels, for having earned a new respect for all the films I've ever seen. You showed me what is really terrible, and why I should appreciate all these films, which are just stupid or boring.
