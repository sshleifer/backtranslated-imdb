This film is not as good as everyone thinks. the actors are low-level, and the story is very comic. I respect fantasy, but Lord of the Rings is a fantasy ... Conan ... this is a fantasy ... THIS IS JUST A NORMAL-HOW-LOWPRICE-ENTERTAINMENT ... Why they turned on this language Splatter, it makes everything worse. The only good thing is cinematography and the work of the director.
