I'm here again at your local mall (of course, because that's where high school students are hanging out !!!!!) to demonstrate how awful "BENDY POO: PROM COURIER" really is !!!!! To prove how this joke about DCOM is ... <br /> <br /> ... weâ€™ll take these four sumo wrestlers and put them in this photo booth. How ... cozy !!!!! <br /> <br /> Hello! Huuuuuuuarrrrghhhhhh !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Mm !!!!! <br /> <br /> How awful is this ????? This is so bad, Disney Channel dumps its money, once again, with these exciting, but decisive 10-second promotions, forcing viewers to think: "WHEN IT IS GOING TO BE AT ?????" And then, suddenly, when it really happens, for one, it not only got a higher TV rating than usual, but it was seen only once !!!!! Oh no!!!!! Once to all !!!!! In addition, this film is about high school and other things, and, believe me, I will not go further with what is there ..... <br /> <br /> Tell me, h ... smile !!!! ! (SNAP!) Avoid it at all costs. 0/10
