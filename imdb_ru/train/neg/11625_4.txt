With the exception of Brady's Hour of Diversity, it was one of the funniest TV shows I've ever seen. The video quality was not so bad, but the overall appearance was unmistakable in the early 80s. And Marie Osmond looks like she fought Avon Lady ... and lost a lot of time. Too much eyeliner. <br /> <br /> It was embarrassing to see how veterans Danny Kay and Eric Severeid are involved. It was even more interesting to watch Alex Haley talk about the African Pavilion at the World Showcase, which will open "in about a year." <br /> <br /> At the time of this writing, 17 years have passed, and it has not yet opened (Except the animal kingdom of Disney.) In general, despite all the flaws, this is still an interesting visual fragment of the Disney story.
