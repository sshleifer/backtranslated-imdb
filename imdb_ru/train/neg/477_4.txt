I read somewhere that when Kay Francis refused to take a cut wage, Warner Bros. they responded to her by abandoning her worst projects for the remainder of her contract. <br /> <br /> She decided to take the money. But her career has suffered accordingly. <br /> <br /> This may explain what she did in a comet over Broadway. (Although this does not explain why Donald Crisp and Ian Hunter also participate in it.) “Funny” is a word that others used to plot this film, and rightly so. Murder trial. Her loose Vaudeville career. Her success in London. Her last scene with her daughter. No part leads logically to the next part. <br /> <br /> In addition, the scenery and costumes looked like material for a B-film. And her hair! Turner shows lots and lots of her films this month. Watch any other and you will do yourself a favor.
