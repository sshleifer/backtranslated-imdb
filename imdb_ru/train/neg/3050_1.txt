Just when I thought I could finish a whole year without putting a single movie in the Bomb rating, a friend brought this notorious piece of shit to my house last night. I was afraid of the worst, knowing his reputation, and it was as bad as I expected. This is a Mexican mess dubbed in English and created by C. Gordon Murray. He has terrible sets and effects, and he has a rather frightening Santa, who does not work at the North Pole, but instead from a cloud in outer space, and who has no little elves helping him to make his toys, but rather different groups of children from every country there. The opening sequence in which Saint Nick giggles heartily, watching the monitors showing how all these children work hard, performing terrible holiday songs in different languages, seems to go on forever and without any history. Obviously, THIS Santa Claus does not comply with the laws on child labor! <br /> <br /> In the end, we get some nasty and slinky student in a red suit traveling from hell to Earth, just to make small children naughty and turn Santa Claus on Christmas Eve into a nightmare. Watching this movie is a trippy and perverted experience, and it will surely frighten young children and permanently disconnect them from Santa Claus and holidays. Ironically, the name of Jesus Christ is often mentioned in this Christmas movie, which somehow makes it more creepy in the context of all the strange things that are happening. This easily makes my personal list of the “Worst film I've ever seen,” but I’m sure there’s nothing unique about it.
