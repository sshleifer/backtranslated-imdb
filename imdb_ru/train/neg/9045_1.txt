This film began with a semblance of plot, and then abandoned it because of an endless series of random characters and clashes that have nothing to do with moving the story forward. It was impossible to continue to engage in this film. This film is a very cynical heap of garbage, made by some people with animation skills, but completely lacking in creativity or the ability to tell stories. This is a terrific bad effort from a large studio. Obviously, there are problems with morale and motivation at Disney, not to mention the complete lack of quality control and control. The fact that the management has allowed this film to see the light, speaks of their incompetence and despair. This film is on my very short list of "worst films of all time."
