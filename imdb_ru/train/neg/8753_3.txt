This film reminds me of a film about Mary-Kate and Ashley, only worse. I think that only rich sisters, although Alison is more an actress, in this film Amanda Michalka was sometimes fine, but Alison acted stinky. I think that after the high school musical they needed to come up with something better, and this was definitely not the case. The storyline was not so good, and I think they should have made two other people play Taylor and Courtney. I'm not a big fan of Alison Michalka, and this film didnâ€™t make me like her any better. I think that they are definitely tired of singing and watching this film only if you have nothing better (which, unfortunately, I did not)
