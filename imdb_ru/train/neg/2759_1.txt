Funny, laugh out loud ... and yet not a comedy. I especially liked the ambulance stopper that absorbs “dirty ass,” which then angrily screams to them: “You are dirty ass,” I mean, wow, someone's online literature pays off! The worst scenario imaginable, with plot introductions in the instant, ridiculous movement of history, the development of ZERO characters (even between meeting characters ... as if they all know and trust each other for years), a dodgy voice with echoed effects, and plot holes .. oh god, are there any plot holes !! Honestly, I am writing this without even seeing it all, but I certainly expect that the last 30 minutes or so will not exactly improve an already pitiful attempt at the cinema ... thank God, we have a good example to We forget a little bit that the film is a load ... well ... use your imagination to conclude this particular sentence!
