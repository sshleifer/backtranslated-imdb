Imagine "Big Cold" with actors from twenty with something whose characters are all unattractive, and an iguana-like lizard person stalking them, and you have an idea of ​​the stupidity of it. On the positive side, the film does not skimp on the monster show. There are no shots or night scenes where you have to imagine what he looks like; he is right there guys. Unfortunately, the design and construction is not so inspiring. A little secret might help. Keep in mind, I've seen a lot worse, but if you're going to show it in full screen for a lot of film, your monster looks damn good. <br /> <br /> Ahead spoiler !!! <br /> <br /> Oh, and there is an end of the turn with the participation of an allegedly dead brother who has absolutely no meaning. This was not a surprise, given the crappy script writing. As for the actors; Well, let's just say that it was not terribly bad, but I do not expect that we will see many of these children in future cinematic excursions. <br /> <br /> Mount coefficient: 2 out of 5; Nakedness coefficient: 1 out of 5; IQ: Minor
