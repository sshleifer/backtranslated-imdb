The trailer of this film interested me enough to guarantee the rental of the DVD. However, the resulting film is absolutely terrible! Admittedly, this is not the worst film ever made, or the worst film this year, but it's damn close! <br /> <br /> The main problem is the film, not knowing what it wants to be: comedy, adult drama, thriller, teen porn? The story is interesting, as it relates to the traps of brides in the mail, but the film is a mess. What begins as a slightly interesting “comedy” (a word I use in the simplest terms) then goes completely backwards and degenerates into a very dark and unpleasant misogynist thriller. Nicole Kidman should know better, and Ben Chaplin wasted! Like Mathieu Cassowitz and Vincent Cassel, who, I can assume, did it only for the sake of money. <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie in almost all aspects. It's not funny, it's so sexy that you can almost forgive Benny Hill for everything he did, and the dramatic elements are just disgusting. The film to be avoided, unless you should see Kidman or Chaplin in each of their films!
