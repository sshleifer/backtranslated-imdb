Idlers in this film are three friends from college Dave, Jeff and Sam (Devon Sava, Michael Maronne and Jason Segel, respectively) who are going to graduate from the university without passing the fair exam, but successfully completing it. This goes on to the very end, when the unlikely, but the cutest character in the film Nathan (Schwartzman) finds out what they are up to. Nathan begins to blackmail to make up with the girl of his dreams, because he can not do this in normal conditions. The only problem is that when the trio starts working on it, Dave falls in love with a great and kind-hearted Angela (James King) Unfortunately, this is not a brilliant genre film. Schwartzman makes watching the movie easy, as his performance is great. King's performance is average, I think she was hired to be close to her gorgeous look. Slackers resembles an American pie in a different direction. The jokes are as small as in the American pie. But aren't they all used? I think this film is a warning to the directors of the genre that they are running out of originality. In general, a few emoticons, but a terrible film in terms of acting (except Schwartzman) and the plot. * outside *****
