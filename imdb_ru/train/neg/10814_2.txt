As a fan of Jane Eyre, I was excited when this movie came out. “Finally,” I thought, “someone will turn this book into a film, following the story actually written by the author.” Wrong!!! If the casting director intended to play “Jane”, which was simple, he certainly succeeded. However, undoubtedly, he could find someone who could also act. Where was the tension between Jane and Rochester? Where was the terrible suspense of the novel, when laughter surfaced in the night, seemingly out of nowhere? Where was the brilliance of the child who flirted and danced like her mother? Finally, why was the plot changed at the end? The question is, did the screenwriters really read the book? What a disappointment
