For such a classic classic fairy tale, Grendel's setting (location) was disappointing. As a writer, I blame the script, which absolutely lacked dramatic tension. The club history rubric is useful and would give a new look at the literary classics. For some strange reason, this rubric was dropped early. To know that it was shot dead in 21 days, he says, “rushed”, and this, unfortunately, shows. Now we have to wait for the Hollywood version on the big screen. I'm talking about FX, I can tolerate a really crappy CGI, but the script has to rock, and this one was too slow, spartan and devoid of drama. I would blame the actors, but ... since I know that I am writing more than an acting game, I will choose my colleague.
