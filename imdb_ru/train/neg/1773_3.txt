Oh my God! Rarely, a horror movie got tired of me or made me laugh as hard as this one. After an energetic start with an intriguing premise, he comes down not much more than a slasher, with some supernatural and sexual manifestations. Usually the excellent Alice Krieg is wasted on this, and the plot twists are ridiculous. Do not worry if you are really not in despair. Rating: 3/10.
