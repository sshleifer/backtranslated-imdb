Jack London's life was bright enough for a dozen films about its different aspects. It is sad to say that what his life was used in the film for was wartime propaganda, which had a positive effect on some of the least attractive parts of his character. <br /> <br /> Jack London, who barely turned 40 years old. when he died he wrote some of the best stories. He wrote about what he knew, but he also wrote like everyone else, bringing with him the baggage of his own life experience. Some of these experiences would have been condemned as racism on another day and time. But it was World War II, and London was a big supporter of the “yellow peril”, as it was called at that time. <br /> <br /> Two thirds of the film tells about his life as an author, we see his years as a sailor, from where he received inspiration for the Sea Wolf. We see him in the Yukon in the miner's cabin with a dog, which, no doubt, was his inspiration for the Call of Wildlife. London was able to grasp the spirit of adventure that his own life was on paper for the world to enjoy ever since. <br /> <br /> The last third was devoted to his time as a war correspondent covering events in Russia and Russia. Japanese war. London was a socialist, but his socialism did not embrace people who were Eastern. Like several million others, he saw the growing immigration of Chinese and Japanese to our Pacific coast as a threat to white people's jobs. He defended a strict immigration policy for Eastern residents. <br /> <br /> The film puts the cart before the horse. London is represented as a man who saw, because he was on hand in the Russo-Japanese war, what were the ambitions of Japan, and for this reason he was xenophobic, like himself. In fact, this kind of atrocities that took place in World War II did not exist during the Russian-Japanese conflict. Japan had its own imperial ambitions, but everyone else, including the United States at that time. But our immigration policy, caused by pressure from our politicians on the West Coast, was an important factor contributing to the deterioration of relations with Japan for several generations. London was part of the business, not a prophet weeping in the wilderness. <br /> <br /> This film was the first independent production of Samuel Bronston, who later shot several films with a slightly larger budget than Jack London. If he had a little more money, Bronston could have gotten James Cagney or Spencer Tracy, who would both be right for this role. Instead, they got Michael O'Shea, who was shooting his second film after the Lady of Burlesque. O'Shea is fine, but, of course, there was no box office. <br /> <br /> As London covers the war, he meets with captain Tanaka, played by Leonard Strong, an actor specializing in Orients and tons of them played in World War II. From a vantage point in 1905. Strong outlines in the best traditions of Fu Manchu. Japan’s imperial goals are aimed at conquering the United States in the end. It must have gone great with the swing swing crowd. <br /> <br /> Much, of course, remains from the life of London, including the first wife. The second and only wife in this film is Susan Hayward, who appears in the film only when she is half over. I wish we saw her more. Charmian Kittredge London outlived her husband at almost 40 years of age, dying in 1955. <br /> <br /> O'Shea actually met and married the leading woman of her life in Jack London. Virginia Mayo plays a small role in Jack London, and they married 30 years, until O'Shea died in 1973. <br /> <br /> Maybe one day we will see Jack London, who will be much better than this.
