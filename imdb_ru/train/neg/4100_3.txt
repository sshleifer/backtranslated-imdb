I would say that this is a slightly disappointing film: the acting was somehow unnatural. In many cases, I simply did not feel that the facial expressions were in line with the words or the purpose of the scene. An angry (or sad, happy, upset) character must make the viewer believe that he is angry (or sad, happy, upset). This is not happening here. <br /> <br /> Authors comment suggesting that you already know that the characters were suitable. They do things and say things that come from nowhere: the character Andrew accuses his parents of sending signals to each other for dinner; then it explodes and crashes, saying to the father: “Don't touch me, damn it!”. Perhaps if we saw the prequel, we would understand where it all comes from, but there is no prequel, so we are a little aware of the reason! <br /> <br /> One strange and bizarre thing Andrew does is to go to the old stone quarry, sit on the edge and look at the "still water" below; then he put his hand in his jeans pocket, took out a pack of cigarettes and lit one. He did the same thing three times during the film; I suppose we should regard this as a kind of tormenting act of loneliness and anger? Maybe once, but three times? It could even be four times, I lost count. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there is a fact that he recently learned that he was adopted; it happens very early in the film, so there is no point in any dramatic changes that he can undergo due to this discovery. It's not entirely clear why he is so bitter or about something else. <br /> <br /> I think there is something like Lynchian in the film, but should the new director really try to scale this? is the mountain so early in his career?
