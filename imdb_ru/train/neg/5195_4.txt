I heard (and read) so many good things about Weeds that I was looking forward to hook on another great cable series (for example, Entourage, Sopranos or Mad Men), but this gradually disappeared with each episode I watched from the first of the season. (did not go through the first six episodes) <br /> <br /> The letter was unoriginal, contrived, and the black image was embarrassing. The dialogue was forced, as if the authors were trying too hard to be clever and clever. It was a rare moment when I actually made a loud laugh. <br /> <br /> Characters never evolved so much that I took care of them, they were selfish and unattractive. I absolutely HATED that adding a son-in-law (who should have been dragged off to “Catch a Predator”) and removing Hods daughter Quinn from the cast, sending her to a boarding school in Mexico, was so unoriginal and cliche I had to conclude that the writers checked viewer loyalty. <br /> <br /> Episode after episode, I liked the characters less, and I could not overcome many technical flaws in the storyline. <br /> Add to this, I heard that the second season was not so good, so I lost all motivation to continue to watch this performance. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of good casting and writing, I suspect that this show will be a problem for you, if you are, of course, not stoned, and then all bets are off.
