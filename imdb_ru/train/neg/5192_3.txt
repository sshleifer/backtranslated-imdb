It does not take long to understand why Code Name: Diamond Head did not get into network graphics. The pilot film does not have time to earn recognition, until it becomes clear how bad it will be. Maybe I missed something because the plot didn't make much sense. Based on what I pulled out of the chaotic mess, a terrorist or a thief or something called "The Tree" (Ian McShane) goes to Hawaii to steal something related to a secret weapon. The dumbest secret agent in the world, Johnny Paul (Roy Tinnes), wants to stop him. Could it be more, but believe me ?? it really doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> Action movies must have action. Suspended moments must have a wait. And dramatic moments should have drama. There is nothing like this in the code name: Diamond Head. I have seen others use the word "tour guide" to describe it made for a TV snoozer ?? and this is better than any one word description I can think of. None of the characters do not care and do not deserve care. And Roy Tinnes makes the worst imaginable conclusions. His charisma is just north of the bullet. Ian McShane - the best thing in the film, but unfortunately for everyone else, it seems he will not return as an ordinary actor. Now, if McShane were cast in the lead role, well, maybe you had something. <br /> <br /> I quickly discover that these horrible 70s films made in the movie Gawd make great episodes of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, and this doubles if Quinn Martin was involved. Very funny things from Mike and Bots. So, although I can only give the film 3/10, I rate Episode # 608 as 4/5 on my MST3K scale.
