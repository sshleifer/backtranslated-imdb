About half an hour, I remember thinking: “Hey, this could be the best achievement of Bill Rebein!”. The opening episodes are atmospheric, there are some scary moments to enjoy, and our director even refers to his notorious bastard "The Invasion of Giant Spiders" in a playful way. The idea was shamelessly stolen from William Castle's House on a Haunted Hill, when three old and extremely bored millionaires lured nine losers to an isolated mansion to win 1,000,000 dollars in a knockout game. Naturally, the participants start to disappear quickly and one by one, and the remaining greedy crutches take too long before they realize that either old people are sadists ... or there is another killer among them. The film begins and ends with a strange storyteller telling many senseless things that are irrelevant to the plot or even interesting to them, but there are some good T & A that can be admired in the first ten minutes, and this dull chatter (Shelley, I think called) really fun to watch. After the first half hour, naturally, the inevitable happens, and the “Chill” turns into a textbook “Rebein” with lagging plot twists, the dumbest dialogues in the entire history and a complete lack of excitement. There was no budget for the murder episodes, but our multidisciplinary director (?) Tries to compensate for this with endless shots of disco girls dancing and an amateur rock band. The film also has four or even five different climaxes, and none of them is a little satisfying. Maybe it was an inspiration for LOTR: Return of the King? Avoid this movie, you will live longer and happier.
