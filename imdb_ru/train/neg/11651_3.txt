Considering that this film was compiled in less than a year, its brevity can be explained (81 minutes - including the final credits, that is, about 76 minutes of the real film). But what he cannot explain is the lack of humor that the previous film had. <br /> <br /> Jokes are quick, and sometimes not even funny. The only really funny parts are the quick parodies of Nike's basketball courts, the image by James Woods of the character Max Van Sidow in the film "Exorcist" and fragments scattered throughout the film. The takeoff of Charlie's Angels, which, like the first Scary Film and The Matrix, outside the stage, mostly recreated the scene without much humor, was very unfunny. <br /> <br /> Todayâ€™s youth may not be related to the fraudulent jokes of the classic supernatural horror films of the 70s, such as The Exorcist and, possibly, the Poltergeist 80s, et. al. <br /> <br /> Let's hope that Scary Movie 3 takes some time to make parodies more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> However, the film shows more than the last of the promising young actress Anna Faris (which I admit, in the sequel seemed extremely hot). Only because of her acting and acting skills do I put this film at 3 points out of 10.
