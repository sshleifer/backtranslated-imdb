What a pity that so many of my “a” lists and good actors of “b” lists agree to make this film, but they did, and this is what made me watch it. I have never heard of this movie, but right on the cover of the DVD was Cuba Gooding Jr., and in the background, James Woods, how bad can it be? In a word Very! This film starts approx. has some twists and turns and then just lays an egg. The ending was so weak as if the writer had been recalled, and his 4-year-old son sat down at the typical writer and knocked out the final. How ironic that a movie called “The End of the Game” is so bad. These are the types of films that can move the actors of the “a” list to the “b” list in a hurry. I hope that Cuba Gooding JR and James Woods do not have this habit.
