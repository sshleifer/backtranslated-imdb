If I had the opportunity to write, star in and play in my own film, I would probably choose something about female robots with weapons. Anthony Hopkins, however, decided to make perhaps the strangest film anyone has ever seen. “Slipstream” is such a strange film that even David Lynch would probably have looked at the person next to him and would say: “What is going on?”. <br /> <br /> This is a film where, in one scene, a man crosses the road in the direction of a yellow car directed to the right, which suddenly turns into a pink car that faces left. This is a film in which the conversation of two characters alternates with random laughing people and insects climbing up the walls. This is a movie where a person starts talking about "The Invasion of the Co-Agents" only so that the actor of this particular film suddenly appears in the role of himself (and then disappears in the air). <br /> <br /> This is a film in which it was decided to throw out the need for a cohesive storyline right out of the window and use fifteen different edits, as well as to switch from black and white to color image for no apparent reason. at all. <br /> <br /> However, I have to thank Mr. Hopkins for choosing the actors in this film (some of which portray several characters). All participants are involved in their roles, even if they probably have no idea what they are actually doing. My favorite here was the thug Christian Slater in a hat that was impressively menacing when babbling nonsense and sang the American national anthem. <br /> <br /> Anthony Hopkins said he made this movie as a joke, and this is probably the best way to summarize Slipstream. This is a joke for viewers. You will observe it from beginning to end, trying to understand what is happening, and hoping that the answer will come, only to find that the answer never really happens. The highlight of this particular joke is that only Anthony Hopkins will know about it. <br /> <br /> I mentioned David Lynch before, and I'm a big fan of this director. I assume that Anthony Hopkins shares my love for films like Twin Peaks, Blue Velvet and Lost Highway. However, Slipstream is not as satisfactory as any of Lynch’s films, despite the fact that he imitated many of his techniques (although I was surprised to find that no one speaks in the opposite direction in Slipstream). This is too chaotic and random - as another reviewer noted, this is a version of a film about Alzheimer's disease. There is no doubt that there are a small number of people who can watch it and extract something from it. Unfortunately for the rest of us, Slipstream is quickly becoming an annoying and confusing experience, which was obtained only through Hopkins participation. <br /> <br /> Watch your risk.
