Just another example of why Stepan King’s books should not be turned into films. (Even Kerry, one of the best, is destroyed in adapting from book to screen.) The premise of the story revolves around a fat lawyer, always on a diet that “accidentally” kills an old gypsy woman. In court, with the help of a judge and the head of the local police, he comes out, although the accident was kind of his fault because he did not pay attention when he was driving. The father of a dead gypsy puts a curse on three, and our main character Billy (the lawyer) is getting worse and worse every day. Despite the fact that the film is mostly kept in a book and has a typical King ending, the acting was unnatural and felt compelled. We moved from one scene to another without much difference between them, like reading acts in a play. King himself starred in the film (like Dave Barry), which confirms my belief that the authors should remain just that: the authors. Leave your acting skills. Not that anyone in this movie was so good. I saw the main characters in films where they were much better.
