That is why many people are homeless. because stupid producers pay their money to make such horrible films, instead of donating if they can bother! <br /> <br /> This movie is even worse than white chicks! Little Man has a weak excuse for portraying a dwarf character as a child. The story is terrible, given that it was written by six people. The idea would still not be too bad if it were original, and not robbery of the animated series. he has funny moments, but some of them are too exaggerated, and some are just stupid. The game was very, very bad. So was the direction. Everyone who participates in this film should be ashamed of themselves. he is racist and very offensive to dwarfs. I mean that instead of showing sympathy to them, the directors laugh at them! I really hate how they do it. They see that dwarfs are like children. And for a character who is a dwarf, pretending to be an abandoned child, just to get a diamond from a certain family. This is his weak excuse to show something like that. It just wasn't worth it. Do not watch this movie. This is a huge waste of time and money.
