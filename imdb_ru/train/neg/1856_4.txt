I am so happy and surprised that this film is of such great interest! Jack Frost was my acquaintance with the films produced and distributed by A-pix Entertainment, and without exception, this company is engaged in shit! First, and this is very important, never watch this sober movie! Why do you? Unlike many other funny bad movies, this one, in my opinion, was made intentionally bad. I just can not understand how fake a snowman, so it is always shown for a short time, the way he moves is best! This Baaaaaaaaaaa movie is better than a piece of Michael Keaton's crap, because it was made too good, and this version is as bad as this one.
