In 1988, Paperhouse was proclaimed a horror film for minded people. Wow, you could say sign me. This thing is a mess. It has one young actress with a range from 1 to 2. J. Headley with a bad British (dubbed) accent and a story without cold, thrills or spills. <br /> <br /> This is not even an interesting chatter. You just have to laugh at its cheap effects and crave a Leprechaun show 5. <br /> <br /> This story tells about a girl with a glandular fever who escapes in a dream. What you get is not a good horror, art house or even a decent addition after school. I found that after a two-hour talk ... where my two hours went. <br /> <br /> The direction did not inspire, and I wanted it to be even pretentious ... something interesting ... it seems that the producers were on lithium. <br /> <br /> Even in the dream world, everything is boring. <br /> <br /> Short no.
