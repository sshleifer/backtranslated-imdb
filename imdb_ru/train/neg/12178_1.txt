Annie's wig doesn't look good. she's not pretty and good enough to play annie. Annie sticks in the film, as her outfits look like Halloween costumes. terrible game and terrible plots. This film is such a change from the 1982 version. I think that the younger and the little girl should have played a major role. Ashley Johnson portrays a very boyish Annie. Not attractive at all. At least the casting director got it right with dad Varbax. Miss Hannigan was not in the know either. Camilla Belle played well Molly. “Warning”: this film may offend your IQ, so you can only show it to very young children. 8 and younger. Some of the plots are too fictional and can hardly take place in the real world.
