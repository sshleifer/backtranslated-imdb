I can not believe that I wasted my time with this film. I could not even call it a movie. It was so bad, no advice from anything. <br /> <br /> I like low-budget movies and weird movies, but this one made me bored to death. Bad actions and bad actions spoiled him out of curiosity. You have to wonder what these people thought when they spent money on the production of this film. I wonder what I was thinking, watching it to the end. I do not recommend this movie to anyone. How did they release it? Was there an audience that likes this movie? It must be because you can find it in almost any video store. But why? <br /> <br /> Deserves attention. <br /> <br /> If you like bad movies, then this is for you.
