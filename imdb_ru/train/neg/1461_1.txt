I saw this movie and I was shocked! Robert Carlisle is not Hitler, he is a man who, unfortunately, is trying to be Hitler. The film is lying, it does not reflect the truth. At the scene, Hitler hit the guy with his gun. Hitler never beat anyone, not with his fists, but with soldiers. Understand?? Another thing: it is too obvious that Hitler is evil, he was smarter than shown in this film. No German would accept him as a leader, because he can see that he is angry. So, the real Hitler did not show his evil side to the people. <br /> <br /> Have any of you Yankees watched “Der Untergang” or “The Dawnfall”? This is a great movie with awesome actors. And this is a German film. I think that this theme of Nazi Germany should not be perceived as a film by people who know nothing about Germany. People! Watch "Der Untergang": <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/ <br /> <br /> This is a great movie about a very sad time for people around the world.
