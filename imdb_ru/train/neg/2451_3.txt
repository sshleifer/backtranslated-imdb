This film causes more unintended laughter than anything else I've ever seen. In fact, if you are a Tolkien fan, rent it to laugh with friends. I will not be the millionth person who breaks all his flaws ... all I will say is that the film (for me, in any case) lost the main points for turning my favorite character, Sam, into an awkward idiot. Shame, shame ... 3/10
