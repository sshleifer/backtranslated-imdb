The “seventh sign” borrowed a lot from the “baby Rosemary” and “omens” (in fact, it combines two stories). Even its name resembles Bergman’s “Seventh Seal”. <br /> <br /> However, it starts quite well, with all the omens scattered throughout the land, and in parallel, seemingly a great conspiracy with Moore’s husband trying to save the poor boy (who killed his parents, who were brother and sister) of the death penalty. time, both Christian and Jewish religions are called to help (even a wandering Jew is involved in it), which sometimes makes the lines unintentionally funny (have you ever been in a Sunday school? But they taught me that God is love!). IMHO's Best Scene is a short dialogue between priest John Herd, who does not seem to take things seriously, too bad that he was not given a more important role, because his easy game is priceless, and a young Jew. <br /> <Perhaps Demi Moore had the same desire as the ex-husband of Bruce Willis: to save the world. She does not save the film for all this.
