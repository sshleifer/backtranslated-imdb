I'm a big fan of Largo Winch. This film was a pain for me. I had to use fast forward to not fall asleep. It was boring! How can someone spoil this title so badly? The story was the only good thing. The actors were sh. They can't live in a role. The main actor (Tom ...) is zero. See other roles of this actor. The fighting scenes were incredibly boring and incomprehensible, anyway, they did not follow the situation. Like other reviewers, said the low-budget film with bad actors. Maybe next time someone else can do something better with this name. French can't do the right thing with big movies like Alien 4. It was a little brrr, after Alien 1,2,3.
