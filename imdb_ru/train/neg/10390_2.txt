I just rented and watched this movie to see what was going on. Here are my reactions to this. It's easy to see that this is a low-budget movie with bad actors. The main plot of this film is about how a woman takes revenge on her rapists. This concept, if done correctly, can easily turn out to be a truly provocative film. However, the film does not shock me at all and does not bother me. I'm just bored. This film can be easily reduced to 45 minutes. All scenes are mainly intended to fill the time, such as scenes and some scenes that I described below. <br /> <br /> ************ It contains a spoiler ***** ******* I think the rape scenes are pretty tame. I do not know whether I looked at the trimmed or uncut version, if there is actually such a version. I also found many holes in the plot of an already poorly written plot. Here is a list on my head. <br /> <br /> Why rapists do not rape Jennifer at night when she left the house to find out what kind of noise. That would be a great time. <br /> <br /> Why not just rape her, instead of postponing the pleasure of rapists and prolonging the test of Jennifer for such a long time? It would probably be more shocking and disturbing. <br /> <br /> It seemed to me really stupid that the rapist had left her in the forest and headed for her house. Maybe to show that these rapists are really crazy. <br /> <br /> These rapists should at least know that if you want to do the dirty work correctly, they should not send a cowardly idiot to do this work. <Br /> <br /> Why didn't Jennifer call the police when the rapists finally left? What should be the first thing that pops up in the minds of most people, especially for a person who is a writer. <br /> <br /> Why did these rapists not smell miles when they saw that Jennifer was alive? <br /> <br /> I find it striking that a slender woman like Camilla can pick up a man tree and hang him. ************************ The spoiler ends ************ <br /> <br /> But hey, this The movie is not without its merits, Camilla Keaton is gorgeous, and I hear one of the funniest lines I heard recently when Matthew protested against returning to the house and killed Jennifer: â€œWhy me? Why me, me not even c ^ m !!!
