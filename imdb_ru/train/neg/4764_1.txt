86 minutes lost in my life. I fell asleep the first time I tried to watch it, and I must say that I never fell asleep in the cinema. <br /> <br /> I have never seen such a meaningless plot behave in such nonsense and in a violent way, and one can only assume that the actors were as agile as the creator of the main character in the film itself. <br /> <br /> Everything in this terrible adaptation is overrated. And if this is not a wooden game, almost as if you could see a teleprompter, then the set itself, which is blocked and interfered in a completely unnecessary way, and disguised in an unimaginable degree, is enough to discard the whole farce. <br /> <br /> With regard to the alleged shock of a disguised detective, anyone who does not see this - like the rest of this ridiculous conspiracy - telegraphed light years ahead, should immediately check their vision. . <br /> <br /> Bad behavior from two very decent actors combined with an overly redirected Branagh trademark is enough to make you want to use real bullets rather than pierce yourself. <br /> <br /> On top of that, there is a completely frail hue of homoeroticism in it, strengthened towards the end. All I can hope for is that it was such a failure that people will no longer try to imitate this level of cinema.
