Disney? What happened? I would really like the film to be shot in the 60s, as in the book. And I really could deal with cheap special effects to save the budget for more accurate adaptation ... I'm glad that maybe someone can influence the reading of books ..... but, the Red-eyed Man is interchangeable as this? And what happened to the volcanic coup? Where was it in the book? Peter Jackson! Save us !!!! A long time ago (1978) I heard that there was a European version of this film. I am sure I would like to identify it. I can only imagine that this may be closer to the real story than this bad adaptation. This movie should be X'd.
