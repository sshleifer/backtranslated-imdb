I'll start with what I liked. <br /> <br /> I really liked the songs, everything was great in them, the costumes, the music, the lyrics (if the translation was good :)), the choreography, everything. <br /> <br /> I liked the scene with the crabs and the cooking. <br /> <br /> But that's all. <br /> <br /> I realized the art-movie was blablabla, but too much too much Too much silence (it was interesting for an hour, but two hours to hear steps and moan from time to time, really ...) too much boredom (no movie should be boring, no matter how deep it is!), too much porn, like scenes (I actually get it, I understand that they were making a porn movie, but really, really , in fact, that is too much), I really think that the movie should be for watching and this one is definitely not for viewing by anyone Zom. <br /> <br /> 3 stars for the songs.
