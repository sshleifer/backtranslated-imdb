Well, during this past Thanksgiving break, despite the fact that the whole family got together, everyone decided to go and see the film, and since Fred's proposal was chosen by a majority, we said so. <br /> <br /> For the beginning of the film there were so many holes in the plot that it was a pity. Simple explanations for why a particular event occurred were invalid. example; Who the hell is trying to "close" Santa Claus? Is this some kind of corporation? A little explanation would be great. <br /> <br /> Secondly, in the film you threw fragile characters that didn’t evoke any sympathy for your feelings or actions. Example: a little elf named Willie and the only tall girl in the elven village. they see each other twice, and then they are a couple, and I didn’t give a damn, because this film didn’t bother me. <br /> <br /> Thirdly: I suppose it should be a family film? His rating was low - only PG. For the family film there were several articles of suggestive conversation. That didn't bother me, but if I were a parent, I could see the problem. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Paul Giamatti looked extremely bored in his role, but, to be honest, he was the only one worth seeing in the film. Vaughn had some funny moments, but he played the same character as the last two films. scrambler boy. (nothing against Vaughn, he was good in other films) <br /> <br /> so this film gets 3 out of 10 stars from me just because someone had to make an effort to produce, film and release this film , <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I would definitely broadcast this film, or, if you saw it, leave it for rent on a rainy day.
