Doppelganger has its moments, but they are few and far between. <br /> <br /> In essence, this is a mixture of the classic pop-mental thriller, ghost story and horror. Drew Barrymore plays a young woman who is haunted by the demons of her past (most of her family were killed, and was she, at least in one case, the main suspect), or is she just a very bad case of multiple personality disorder? George Newburn is her new roommate, and most of the action is focused on him. <br /> <br /> Newburnâ€™s character is pretty pretty, and he and Barrymore do a decent job (though not quite well). A mediocre (sometimes) completely horrific script and not impressive directing seem to have come together to plunge the remaining performances into oblivion. Leslie Hope's character is catchy, but so annoying that you want to forget it. <br /> <br /> The plot ultimately splits into bifurcated (one storyline is psychological realism and the other is supernatural horror) - a bizarre climax that is so poorly thought out, acting and photographed that it effectively counteracts most values, which reached the film earlier. <br /> <br /> In general, the film has a feeling of what can be expected from the first result of M. Nate Shamalyan. Student cinema class. The actions and the script for the two leads are good enough to make you take care of them a little - at least until the movie is completely off the rails. <br /> <br /> My recommendation - send your double, but avoid the first meeting
