The film crew did not have good access to the occupied territories, so the shooting of the Israeli side dominated. I was struck by almost completely opposing views of mothers. Israeli mother lost a child who had the opportunity to get great happiness. The Palestinian mother lost a child who only had the opportunity to live in conditions of deprivation and despair. With such completely different points of view, no meeting had a real opportunity to meet with reason. The word "world" did not have the same meaning for each of them. Peace for a Palestinian was freedom. Peace for the Israelis was security. With such a chasm, is such a film really worth a lot? I ended up with the feeling that I was watching meaningless propaganda - both sides were unconvincing.
