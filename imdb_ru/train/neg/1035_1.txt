Awful game, terrible cast and cheap props. It would be much better if he was conceived as a parody action movie. What a waste. Starting with the title of the film. <br /> <br /> “Enemy”, calling it “Action”, would make it better. (contributing to the effect of parody). A policeman who looks like a 60-year-old player, a blond girl with the same dull and boring facial expression. Toward the end of the film, he and she work together to film the bad guy and every time they exchange words he just feels like cheap data lines before the sex scene in the porn movie. Horrible. Do not waste your time.
