Not quite in good shape, just stupid. Killer’s Tongue is a tricky mix of science fiction, horror, and supposed comedy. What it equates to is a meaningless and completely incoherent film. There is very little dialogue, mainly due to the fact that the script, if there was one, is a complete “unclean pond”. I would not even call it strange, more like "complete nonsense." This film is sure to disappoint, and you were warned. There is absolutely no reason to spend time on it, and if you do, the pungent smell will linger like a rotten fish .......................... .................................... MERK
