OK ... I watch a lot of bad movies. I am proud of this fact. many times in bombs with a rating of B there are gems. But this film is one of the worst I've watched. I like a good horror movie ... but with a plot and a sense of movement. The opening scenes seemed pretty good. Worthy music and images. Then he goes down the hill from there. One of the main characters has a disability (Tinnitus called tinnitus). Now this, in turn, threatens to reveal its secret. They made it too much attention in the film. So he has a ring in his ears and accidentally left an ear plug somewhere where he should not have been. No need to keep raising it. So this guy has an affair with this girl, and in a motel she falls and hits her head on the table. Therefore, instead of telling everyone about his case, he decides to drop the body. Now her twin sister is trying to figure out where she is and what happened to her. Well, seeing her sister again and again (like a zombie looking like a ghost) and even pointing directly to the location of the body, she finally finds her. Now the body is restored, and she is going to deal with the only suspect who killed her. The bad thing is that she did not have a special plan. Just to pretend to be her twin and met a guy where the body was dropped. The idiot didn't even believe that he killed her. So everything opens up there, and although she had a gun ... somehow she manages to strangle herself. Thus, the last scene of the film about the "spirits" of her and her twin, coming out of the water. So you want to tell me in this movie that the bad guy wins. And not one, but two innocent people die. <br /> <br /> Good things about the movie: images <br /> <br /> Bad things about the movie: musical sound effects are a long and delayed wrong direction of the plot of poor quality acting from some not all the actors
