... and I saw some bad ones. <br /> <br /> I have nothing to say about this movie. Jennifer Tilly plays poorly - as expected. Daryl Hannah does an excellent job with her work, but nothing compares to the ability to save this film. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw in this film is that the plot is so weak — though based on a good premise — that the author resorted to a “stupid heroic trick” to create a false expectation. When all Daryl Hanna can do is hide, she runs out in front of the pursuer. The hospital scene is absurd. Without exposing too much of what is considered a conspiracy, I think it would be difficult for a bloody miniature woman to take a pregnant woman out of the hospital without being noticed. Lame. Very shit. <br /> <br /> Save yourself time and choose another movie.
