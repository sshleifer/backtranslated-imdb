This film was a big disappointment for me. I waited for the release of this film for many years, and I was a loyal follower of Chaos Comics until they went bankrupt. They not only cut out half the storyline, but also changed the information. The statement that Lucifer is the Father of Hope is not true. He corrupted her father, but he himself was not her father. The voices also did not fit the characters, and as soon as you hear the voice of your favorite character, the voice that you heard in your mind will never return. I can't even remember everything that was wrong about this movie. The bottom line is that if you love Lady Death, do not watch this movie. It simply did not do comic justice at all !!
