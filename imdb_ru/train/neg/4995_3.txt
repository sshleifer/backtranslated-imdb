I considered the real task to watch this movie. The sound track was not the best, and some accents made it difficult to understand what was said. There was little to promote the plot, and often the action simply stopped, and there was a long period of talking that seemed like an outsider to the film. These conversations were switched between family groups, and the observer had to try to piece together the common thread that connected them. Rarely do I rate a movie so low and do it in this case, since the whole viewing experience made me wonder “so what” and “why did I spend my time watching it”.
