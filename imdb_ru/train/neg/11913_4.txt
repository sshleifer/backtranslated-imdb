Good idea, poorly implemented. Although it can summarize 99% of SciFi channel movies, it does apply here. I love movies where a good story slowly unfolds, and I like action movies, and I like all the main actors, so this could be great. However, despite the good play, this film falls through due to the poor writing and directing of Bill Platt. <br /> <br /> Another review showed that you need to know where you are going to get there. This film is not compiled in such a random way that you know that the words “second sketch” are not included in the Bill Platt dictionary. There is one scene that is completely unnecessary and can be deleted without anyone noticing. This scene even begins and ends with driving a car, so you can move from one car scene to another and never miss a meaningless scene in the middle. <br /> <br /> This film also had a strange habit: explaining some details, while explaining others, some to such an extent that you can guess the whole “plot” in advance. He also had the habit of interrupting the fight early, probably only because they could not afford it. There are also some ridiculously bad scenes where the “plot” is revealed on a computer, and conveniently located “poisonous glues” participate in the final battle (seriously, what is this?). <br /> <br /> If you're a Shiri Appleby fan, watch this movie because it's ok. She manages to break out of her Roswell character several times and make her a strong chick (but not always). John De Lancy plays the same character that he plays in everything he ever did when playing Q in ST: TNG, so this is nothing new. <br /> <br /> In general, I gave this movie a 4/10 rating.
