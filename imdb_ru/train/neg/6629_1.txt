If you saw Sholai of 1975, do not watch this film. If you have not seen the 1975 Sholay, go look. But do not watch this movie. This film contains all the ingredients that could be mistaken when creating a remake of Sholai. <br /> <br /> Amitabh “Babban” Bachchan plays the role of a psychopathic villain at best (probably only 40 minutes of the drum, which should not be burned). If you remove the rest of the movie and just see how Amitabh plays with her character, it's still worth watching. But how Insp. Narsimha, Mohanlal does not pay tribute to his talent. Ajay Devgan (Heero) is extremely mundane, and I think the only reason they played Prashant Raj as Raj is that it is strikingly similar to the Amitabh of his young days. Sushmita Sen behaves well with grace and make-up. But the reward for "MOST GOOD performance and any role up to date" should be given to Nisha Kothari. She manages to humiliate her acting skills to such levels that even high school drama would overshadow her performance. <br /> <br /> If you have a deadly enemy, take him to this film. :)
