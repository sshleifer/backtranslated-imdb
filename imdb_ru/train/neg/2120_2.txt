I considered myself rather melancholic, especially when I watch amazing touching films. But not for this (which surprised me!), And I am also very surprised to see how many people highly praised this film. <br /> <br /> There are several disturbing facts in the films: 1. Despite the feeling of guilt I can't help but worry that Ben’s real intention to save 7 lives in order to save his past is worrying that the film seems to be encourages this type of suicide. Some people may take it as a heroic act, while others think that he behaves cowardly, after all, it became a disturbing action for me. <br /> <br /> 2. The plot of the film is excessively dramatized, but the logic is too simplified. From a medical point of view, blood compliance must be an organ donor. By the end of the film, we learned that Emily had a posterior blood type, which limited her chance of receiving a donor for a short period of time. Nevertheless, it seemed that Ben had a rare blood group, the same as hers, which allowed him to become her donor, and, despite Ben's rare blood type, he was able to donate not only his heart, but also his kidney, its cornea and its bone marrow, which in all cases requires not only matching blood, but also tissue antigen. <br /> <br /> 3. Why did the doctors allow the organ donation of Ben, despite the fact that the jellyfish poison that he used to kill himself? <br /> <br /> I may overestimate the whole story, because in the end it’s just a movie. However, some of the alarming facts outlined above will hopefully help you rethink your plan to watch this movie. If you go for a soap opera type movie, go for it. But if you go in search of intellectual entertainment, skip it!
