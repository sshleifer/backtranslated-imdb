I entered this movie, hoping for the best. I generally like military musicals. Dick Powell and Lucille Ball did a good job on their roles; however, the screenwriters gave them a boring dialogue. A love interest between them did not receive any real growth; just suddenly it was there. I did not think much about music; the best number was a snippet we heard about Spike Jones with Der Fuhrer's Face. One complete number that Spike Jones made was a small part of his great musical comedy; pretty tame stuff, even with a monkey. Bert Lahrâ€™s comedic parodies were endless. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of interesting things: Lucille Ball was very fond of, and there was a good selection of players who really deserved more time on the screen.
