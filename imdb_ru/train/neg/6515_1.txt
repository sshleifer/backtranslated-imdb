This is not a boring movie, viewers can stay in their chair, fascinated by this selfish character, Miles Berkowitz, and the director, and the actor. The storyline is simple: after a divorce and ten years of Hollywood's not a career, the author of the play is a search for love in front of the camera. The first question is about how true all this is: what is written, what happened by chance? In both answers “yes” or “no” M. Berkowitz depicts a person with an average standard of living. If you are looking for self-deception about love, like this, I recommend that you read several independent comics: Chester Brown, Joe Matt ... <br /> <br /> In addition, I was very disappointed to hear so much against my country, France . I know that Americans usually say that the French are arrogant (then it may be true), and so on. And surely the French (and the whole world) have a lot of grief against America, but why so much hatred? Do not think that I do not like this film just because of this.
