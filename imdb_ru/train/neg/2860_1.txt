This film received only 1, because you can not give zero! If you have a weak tummy, do not look at EVERYTHING. people for the rights of animals that you do not want to watch. it makes people vegetarian, I swear, I witnessed it! the only interesting details are the case and the fact that this is a true story. it's really very scary that this guy was working at ADT while he was killing people! still feel safe when you click on this little code? I do not! He had access to all codes in Kansas !!!!!! I hated the movie, it was not scary, it was mentally scary! Do yourself a favor and don't rent / buy this film, I think it costs about $ 20 to do it includes their more paid actors !!!!
