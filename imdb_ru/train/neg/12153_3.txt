Feeding The Masses was another movie in which they tried to make some money on the zombie craze, mainly due to the popularity of films such as Land Of The Dead and the Resident Evil series. <br /> <br /> It starts on a television station guarded by the military, and reports that the Lazarus virus (zombies) is close to containment, and soon the city will again be able to go about its business. The problem is that this is completely wrong. Zombies run wildly, and only a small part of people know about it. Among them are the Torch (William Garberin), the cameraman, Sherry (Rachel Morris), the moderator (who is for some reason listed as playing Shelley on this site) and Roger (Patrick Cohen), their military escort. The torch and Sherry are against lies to people, but the station is controlled by a secret service (or other government agency), and they are subject to strict censorship. <br /> <br /> This film pats on the back of the box and says: “We keep FEEDING MASSES at a higher level than any of the three films of The Dead by George A. Rombéro.” The source of this quote has lost ALL confidence in me. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that this movie is BAD. I do not mean bad, as if I expected more (although, obviously, I expected), but I mean bad in that I could not find any expiatory qualities in the film. The game in all parts is either finished or too wooden. Does anyone remember their lines or do they read cue cards? I can't even think about what the best part of the movie was or the best actor / actress. There really was not one. If I had to nod someone, I would say, Roger, a military escort was perhaps the most interesting character, but in fact it says little. <br /> <br /> I would recommend to skip this movie. Despite the fact that the cover of the box looked pretty good (this is what originally attracted me to the film). 3/10
