Given the potential of this step, the reality was disappointing. Although it is always nice to see Jennifer Aniston in the film, even this could not make a difference. Most of the action was predictable. The jokes were flat to slightly amusing. And the characters were not very interesting. I wanted this movie to be liked, but it just wasn't there. Ben Stiller was hilarious in "There's Something About Mary." Here, it seems, he just goes through traffic. If they needed to remove the plot points from Friends, they should have known that something was wrong. Toilet humor was supposed to stay in the closet :-). <br /> <br /> See “50 first dates” instead.
