This film was, as Homer Simpson would say, "duller than the church." Maybe I didn’t understand this well enough, and I thought it all started pretty well, but after (STARTED SPOILER) Herman Brown is sent to prison, and Maria starts working / sleeping with her boss, he just starts to pull, and I fought to be awake Again maybe it symbolizes something, but at the end the explosion seemed very forced and inappropriate. (END OF SPOILER). In the end, I don’t understand why others think it’s so cool because I find it very boring. By the way, I did not watch this film of my own accord, since I needed to watch it in a cinema lesson.
