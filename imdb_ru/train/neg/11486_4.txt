Because some people, like me, love to know EVERYTHING about the film, even if they plan to watch it, including the final. In any case, this is the end that I remember, because I was no more than 8 years old when I first saw it on TV. But I will tell you, it certainly scared the little child I was, and I thought about it for several days after that, and it still stands out in my memory to this day, although some of the details are a bit vague. Abe Vigoda was in this movie? I don't remember that! I did not even remember that in this film was old Barnabus, and I liked the dark shadows. So in the end, the main character (Belinda Montgomery?) Is lured by the judge (Joseph Cotton, I suppose, although I remember that he was an old family doctor or someone else, not a judge; look how the memory disappears?) To the place wedding, which, as I recall, is in a cave? Maybe I was wrong; and Shelley Winters is laughing there, and the Judge has a cape, and the camera looks at him, and he throws off the cape, and he has goat legs, and he announces that in fact her father, the Devil, and she played right in their hands (satanic cult) because the “mortal” guy she fell in love with (I think it's Robert Foxworth) is also the guy Satan wants to marry her, the Demon with yellow eyes, and yes, of course, they show Robert Foxworth , and his eyes glow yellow. In the last few minutes of the film there are a lot of close-ups. Everyone laughs and rejoices, except for Belinda Montgomery, who is very unhappy, and cries, or screams, or something else, and this is the end. The bad guys are winning.
