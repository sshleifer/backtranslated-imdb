I can not believe how someone can make a comedy about such a problem as homelessness. Of course, Brooks did not comedy about the homeless. No mention of drugs, prostitution or violence on these streets. The people we meet in this film are homeless on Fantasy Earth, so the only difference between them and us is that they donâ€™t eat so often. Brooks films became worse and worse over the years. This is just another nail in the coffin.
