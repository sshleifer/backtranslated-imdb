The "true" story of the late monster, which appears when an American industrial plant begins to pollute water. A funny, though not very good movie with monsters makes many people try to find a monster and find out what is happening, but not in a completely engaging way. Give him points for giving us a giant monster, which they obviously built to scale for some scenes, but take him away because he looks like a non-threatening puppy. Funny movie about exploitation, which is silly fun. (My only complaint is that the print used in the Elvira release is so meager that it looks like a well-worn copy of a videotape that was 20 years ago)
