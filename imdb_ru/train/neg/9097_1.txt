Who actually created this piece of shit, this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, it is a waste of time and money. I hate the way they create low-cost prequels with D-Lister actors and a plot very similar to the first. <br /> <br /> I found this movie in a trash can located next to Wild Things 2 and Death To Supermodel for $ 2.99, what a fool I was, to actually think that it might be good, instead of this, I watched in disgust as the bad acting stereotypes tore the storyline and script from the 1st. <br /> <br /> Whoever thought it was right â€” the production of the video was in fact even a halfway movie that you must be mad about, or something like that, because I think that most people who have seen this movie think THAT IS THE LOAD OF LOVE !!!!
