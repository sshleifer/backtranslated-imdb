When MAGIC OF LASSIE opened at Radio City Music Hall, I was stupid enough to believe that it would be as heartbreaking as some of the first Lassie films. Not. <br /> <br /> The story was terrible, the songs of the Sherman brothers were below their usual level, the characters were boring, and James Stewart and Mickey Rooney both saw better days. <br /> <Then I was also interested to see what Alice Fayâ€™s contribution would be, since she had been absent from the screen for so many years and had always been so attractive in her previous roles in Fox. Alice was also disappointed by the stupid script and unflattering photo. Another disappointment. <br /> <br /> There is nothing original here, nothing even remotely interesting for an adult - and, of course, no magic gift for everyone. You can skip this without missing anything.
