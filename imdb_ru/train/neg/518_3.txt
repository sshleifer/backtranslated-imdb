Bela Lugosi is not a typographic actor in this fantastic twelve-part adventure series, playing the lead role in the role of Frank Chandler / Chand Mag, enjoying his role as a representative of the White Magic forces opposing the Black forces, while at the same time successfully demonstrating energetic martial skills to look after the young Egyptian princess and cut an elegant figure in yachting equipment complete with a nautical cap. In a sense, the comic story involves Chandler / Chandu in a continuous series of escapades aimed at achieving the salvation of his bride, Princess Naji (Maria Alba) and others from the claws of the Sult idol worship sect that craves Naji blood, to revive the ancient mummified princess buried in the mysterious island of lemuria. Directed by Ray Taylor, an experienced assistant in such entertainment, continues to lively events, but repeats scenes and shots, much of which can be found in last year's production of “Skull Island” from KING-KONG and in port locations from SON-KONG, reduces the original action less than 60 minutes from the duration of the series more than two and a half hours and, if you look at one sitting, becomes invalid for most viewers, except for insomnia.
