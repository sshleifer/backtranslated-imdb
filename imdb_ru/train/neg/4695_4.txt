I watched this movie several times and never thought it was funny, but watching it is still fun and pleasant for a little laugh. <br /> <br /> He is about women who work for the company, and their boss is a jerk, and they end up giving him a taste of his own medicine and are trying to get the respect they deserve. <br /> <br /> The game is really good. Dabney Coleman - one of those stars of the 80s, who plays a good bad guy, not quite evil, just incredible. Dolly Partin is very cute and funny in comedies, and her southern wit really shines here. Jane Fonda does so little for me. Lily Tomlin is the best thing in this film, she has the funniest roles and made me laugh out loud several times, to love her. <br /> <br /> I could recommend this to anyone who likes the comedy of the 80s. I like the film, but there are things in it that I don’t like. Everything starts off perfectly and has a pleasant flow, and then everything starts to come together and makes me care less about the characters. They all have little fantasy about what they would like to do with the boss, and although “cute,” I just thought it slowed down the course of the movie. As the film continues, it begins to develop again, and the most funny things happen, and then it slows down again, only to quickly wrap up, which is too good to be true. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars, but try it if you haven't seen it yet. I think that depending on the mood, this may be more or less pleasant.
