I felt obligated to watch this film all over since I found it in the trash can and bought it for myself, but I came up many times to turn it off and just write off the money I paid for it. If you're a fan of blood and sadism, this film is fine. If there is something the creators of this film know, this is the creative use of fake blood and body parts for an abominable effect. If you do not care, then stay away. <br /> <br /> This film was shot on a home video camera, with primary school supports and terrible actors. It is dubbed from German, but even with that in mind, the sound is terrible. This film is about the same budget as the budget, with the exception of the above special effects. If they spent a little more money on the actors and the actual script instead of gore and blood, the film could be a little more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The story of three men who land on a populated island with an army of sadists in a tin mask. They are captured, and the rest of the film is about their attempt to escape. I call it history in the broadest sense, because it is really a series of scenes of torture and battles connected by an unbroken dialogue filled with obscenity. <br /> <br /> There is nothing interesting in this film, if only you are like meaningless blood. Consider yourself warned.
