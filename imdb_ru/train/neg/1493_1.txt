I really do not understand how people made this film and thought it was worth all the work they put into it. Even more surprising are those who watched this film, not feeling deceived because he was engaged in something valuable, for example, cleaning under the sofa or reading Leviticus. <br /> <br /> First of all, of course, they could have 2 found a real Irishman, and some pretty women who could deliver their lines better than porn star thrown out by Haggard pervade this film. Of course, gore does not work, but oddly enough, it is not as disturbing as you might think, to see the organs pulled out of the hot (previously) dense bodies of pornstars on the left and right. Perhaps this is somehow related to the fact that after their terrible inhuman game, you just want them to die from pain. <br /> <br /> So, if you donâ€™t care about the following: <br /> <- Acting (seriously, all this sucks. I have never witnessed this before. EVERY sediment). <br /> <br /> - the plot (some crappy horror movies are remotely linear, or at least amazing. The film does not make sense if you are not as broken as the writers). <br /> <br /> - a theme (There is nothing to learn from this film. There is nothing to be afraid of at night in bed, nothing to ponder, grab or explain to others). <br /> <br /> - soundtrack (Shit, crap, crap. Music is as plain and boring as the script). <br /> <br /> - scenery (Perhaps it was the saving grace of this film, but no ... there is nothing pleasant. Even the rocks are fake). <br /> <br /> So yes. If you do not care, and you are just an excited teenager with a bad musical taste and "women", this film is for you. Positive comments: interesting cinematography at times, wasted on other elements. Very realistic blood; again for nothing. But the intestinal scene is classic. I agree with the mutant warming that solves the problem of a fake accent.
