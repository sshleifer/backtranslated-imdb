Watching that lady in Hermine, I wondered what Betty Grable was doing in a project that seemed to be aimed at Marlene Dietrich. Someone from 20th Century Fox decided that one sex symbol is as good as the other. Darryl F. Zanuk should have known better. <br /> <br /> Betty plays a 19th-century Italian countess, who was invaded by troops of the Hungarian hussars led by Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Her ghostly ancestor, whose portrait hangs in the Palace Hall along with the rest of her outstanding family tree, sees little resemblance to Dag now and another invader about 300 years ago, with whom she dealt when the armies failed. <br /> <br /> In addition, the current Betty has just been married to Cesare Romero, and the invasion occurred at the most inopportune moment before everything was completed. This guarantees a bad attitude to everyone, I guarantee. <br /> <br /> Fresh, useful for all American Betty is not an actress to do seductive and mysterious. Marlene Dietrich might have put it off, but with Betty it is flattering than yesterday's presidential candidate. She and Fairbanks have no chemistry, although Doug is as charming as ever, and someone I can look at in everything. <br /> <br /> Frederick Hollander and Leo Robin wrote the score for this film, and this is the moment Oscar nomination for best song. The only chance of this lady in Hermine, for the glory of Oscar, fell on "Buttons and Bows". <br /> <br /> Ernest Lubich died halfway through the movie, and Otto Preminger finished Lady in Hermine. I can't believe that Lubic has meant Grable for leadership here. Like you, if you see that lady in an ermine.
