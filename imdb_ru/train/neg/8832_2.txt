It was very hard for me to go through this step. He was extremely slow, and from time to time he wondered when the plot of the film would really come to life. <br /> <br /> This film seemed to be going slowly, and I kept thinking when it was over. Usually I'm a person who likes a good indie file from time to time, but that didn't satisfy what I was looking for. <br /> <br /> They seemed to be trying to capitalize on this movie. At one point it seemed political, that I am not a big fan in the movies. If you are looking for a slow movie with little or no plot, then this is the right movie for you. As for me, I felt that I wasted 2 hours when I could do something else.
