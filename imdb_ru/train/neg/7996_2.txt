Is there a book titled “How to make a movie with every cliché, Man against Nature, imaginable”? If not, then Ants will be an excellent source material for the insect killer chapter. Ants do not have a single piece of originality, which can be found at any point of its 100-minute execution time. I suppose the most amazing thing about ants is that they actually stretched the film to 100 minutes. The script, the characters, the various scenes, the scenes of death and the way the ants were presented were made before any number of times ?? and in most cases much better. Surprisingly, so many such insects on Rampage were filmed in the 70s, because they are all basically the same films. <br /> <br /> And can anyone tell me what, in the name of God, does the monkey Loy do this monkey from the movie? A woman as talented and stylish as Loy deserves better than Ants as one of her latest films.
