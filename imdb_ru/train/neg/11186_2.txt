I wanted to watch this movie, but one bizarre funny scene after another made me turn it off. The character does not react to anything. Think about it: Heath Ledger walks at night (I think, through the cemetery) when he is attacked by spirits, which he drives away. After going through this test, he calmly leaves and meets a friend who has seen it all. When asked what happened, he gently said: “Demons attacked him, nothing serious,” as if it was just a bit more exciting than a flat tire. <br /> <br /> I turn it off when they go to ask something ... a demon or something, I stopped caring - the question. The answer can only be received from someone with the energy of their death, and the priest watches what seems to be a vague irritation when the person is stretched and hanged, and they ask a question about his beating, the dying body. <br /> 0 of **** stars.
