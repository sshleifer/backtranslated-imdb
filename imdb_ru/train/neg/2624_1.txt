To say that this film stinks would be offensive to skunks. As another commentator says, this film insults everyone who is 7 years old (especially this is incredibly insulting to gays). It's terrible - and not in the style of "so bad it is ridiculous" - just awful. No, I have to say this: Stinks! (excuse me, skunks). <br /> <br /> From initial titles to final titles, it’s hardly worth more than 10 seconds to watch this movie. The “plot” is incoherent, the characteristic does not exist, the acting skills are replete with the words “look at me, I am funny!” School and so on. Plots are awkwardly tuned (if at all) and poorly performed, just awful on every front - except for music, maybe I don’t remember that the music stinks (except for songs). <br /> <br /> To be fair to the creators, they quickly put their cards on the table: the opening credits include the title “Also in the role of Erta Kitt as Betty Meteor’s voice” (since the meteor in question never it turns out to never say anything, but purr occasionally, they could raise the contribution of Miss Kitt from one of her records), and the second line of the film sounds like this: "... and the scientists discovered new facts about the rings around Uranus." ". Uranus - "Your Anus" Geddite? geddit? Yes? Yes ?? Your anus? Humor is really so cheap. <br /> <br /> In the “comedies” of that period, it is strange to say that the hero is completely permissible to deliberately shoot people on the street, but not to say “sh * out loud. <br /> <br /> I paid fifty pence (about $ 1.00) for this movie on sale. I feel ripped off.
