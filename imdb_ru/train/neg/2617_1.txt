This film was pure pain. Sitting in the cinema for a few minutes, I wondered when the movie would start. All installations were in place; a typical love story, characters have to overcome their short plans, the villain has to appear, but none of this is ever initiated. By the time this happened, I was already bored, and the devices were completely ineffective. In scenes that required tremendous tension and accumulation, it seemed that the necessary shots were cut. Children's things should not be so. Children's films can be as exciting and attractive as adults. The excuse "hey, it's for kids" is bull. I will take the "Sword in the stone" any day. It was terrible. I have the feeling that Disney will release something these days. As for the children, the 10-year-old, with whom I saw it, would agree ... clean rubbish.
