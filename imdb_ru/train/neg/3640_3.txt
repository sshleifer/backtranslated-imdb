Before I bought it, I didn’t have a basic knowledge of this film, but it sounded cool, and I have long wanted to watch a truly amazing Viking film ... alas, this film was not what I was looking for. I was hoping for the best, but instead I was given a boring Scandinavian soap opera that seemed to drag on for too long, despite the 84-minute work time. The premise of the film is quite intriguing: it is a Viking warlord who challenges his God, and Odin is so angry that he curses the son of a warlord by the name of Barek to death and rebirth as a berserker. This guy from Barek is forced to live in rage, madness and cruelty all his life. The film was made quite competently, with rich cinematography and almost good performances by the actors, but again I was bored and asked when this dribble would end. The filmmakers had the opportunity to do something quite interesting and semi-unique, but they threw the ball. Perhaps this could be improved by some cheap tactics of exploitation, such as unwarranted nudity and a lot of blood ... I mean, we are talking here about "berserkers", isn't it? The Vikings should have been bad enough that with all the rape and robbery, shouldn't the berserkers be even more extreme? In general, if you are not a fan of “Young and Restless” (and so on. D.) Or you are a crazy berserk who likes torture, I would probably avoid this boring celluloid.
