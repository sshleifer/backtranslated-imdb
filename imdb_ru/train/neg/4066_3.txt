In the film directed by Eric Stanze "ISOYC, IPOYG" three men are tortured by a woman who has been sexually abused. The first victim is made to eat his own shit before being killed. The next guy ends with a bullet in the crotch after refusing to engage in anal sex with the corpse of the first guy. But this is the third person who gets the worst: he has to watch how heavily tattooed "star" Emily Haack undresses and masturbates with a broomstick (oh, he also pushes the handle in the ass too!). <Br /> <br /> And, unfortunately, we are also (see how she masturbates, that is, do not get a broom by the handle!). <br /> <br /> Yes, “ISOYC, IPOYG” is one harsh viewing experience, not because of its ongoing violence, but because Haack, who is clearly under the mistaken notion that she has a goddess body (unlike body for Metallica Road), constantly exposed in front of the camera. This is not a very pleasant sight. <br /> <br /> In addition to rampant nudity from the seasoned Haak, viewers can also see the terrible direction from Stanz (who believes that endless shots of gravestones and trees) is an interesting thing, some really bad game, and a fat penis. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, I assign an “ISOYC, IPOYG” rating of 3/10, which is actually slightly higher than its current 2.9. average. This is one moment for the indiscriminate attack of an ax (which, as a dog, I really liked); one point for a bit, where a fat guy is squeezed out of his face in a chocolate mousse disguised as feces (funny); and one remark for composure to suggest that this film could be a continuation of Meir Zarchi’s excellent classic exploitation “I spit on your grave”.
