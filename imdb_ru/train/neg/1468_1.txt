A wonderful cast is wasted on a useless script. Ten or so adults were reunited in a summer camp where they were minors. Could this ever happen in a million years? It's just a fantasy, and boring. Do they become teenagers again? Do they reproduce their practical jokes, games, good times? They may try, but in the end the answer is no. Is there any intrigue? Any waiting? Horror? Comedy? None of the above. The way someone can entertain this nonsense is beyond me. I wanted this movie to be liked; I tried to love this movie, but my brain refused.
