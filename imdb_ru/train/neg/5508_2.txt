Tim (Gary Daniels) desperately wants to break into serious television coverage. When the job he asked for fails, he is fired. His beautiful but empty girl (Elizabeth Hurley) also speaks saionara. Coming home, Tim is amazed to find that there is an uninvited visitor (Christopher Lloyd) in his house from the planet Mars! Calling him Uncle Martin, Tim soon tries to help his new friend navigate life on earth. But Martin gets into trouble, wherever he goes, from the bathroom to the laundry and more. Beautiful Lizzy (Daryl Hannah) finally sees the opportunity to spend time with Tim, but the course of true love does not go smoothly in this case either. Soon, everyone on TV is chasing Tim, hoping for a story about a true stranger. What should a man do? For those who loved the old TV show with the same name, with Bill Bixby and Ray Walston, this film is not worthy of tying up well-known shoes. Its really, undeniably terrible, without plot and dependence on supposed special effects that fall flat, too. Daniels is fine, like an Earthling, but Lloyd is just as terrible as an alien who beat the storm. The rest of the cast is adequate, as are the costumes, scenery and details of the production. Even if your children see the cover and ask for this movie, convince them to choose another movie in the video store. Rest assured, children and adults will find this film a colossal bore, so instead choose “Night at the Museum” or “Around the World in 80 Days”.
