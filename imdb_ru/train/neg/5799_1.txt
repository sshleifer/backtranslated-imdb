I shot this film yesterday, mainly because of the beautiful design and a brief summary on the back of the jacket. Having inserted it into my DVD player, I looked at the jacket cover again, and although I removed the cover from the plastic viewer, I STILL could not read any detailed information about the film. This film is called “The Evil on the Jacket,” and it had to be found by going to the Faith Films website to find any connection with it here on IMDb. <br /> <br /> The filming and special effects made in the film looked pretty good ... Then the actor read the lines. Oh dear ... reading this actor sounded like some kind of humorist in high school, whose voice just managed to change pitch, and there was no attempt to go beyond reading the lines from the script. At first I thought that I had a bad disc due to the synchronization of sound, but then I assumed that it was a foreign film, since I could not read the cover ... The English dialogue is duplicated. If they chose the right person to duplicate the dialogue, this film could be decent. I gave him a chance for about 20 minutes before throwing him out, when I discovered that a reader with a bad line is not going to die, but remains a permanent basic device. Yes, this is very bad! The cover art and the art made in the film are great, so they gave one star, but minus 1 999 999 stars for the rotten dialogue. I do not recommend this!
