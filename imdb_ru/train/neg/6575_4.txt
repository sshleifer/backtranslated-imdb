An interesting film about a real event that occurred during the civil war in Vermont. It kept my attention until the end, and I do not regret watching it. I never read about this incident, so I was curious to see if the rebels managed. I like the historical films of that era. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is the form of the Confederation. They look too good !!! The game was a bit tough at times. I like an old man who eats mashed potatoes, because he had no teeth. The injured soldier playing for the dog was a bit strange. In general, it was a descent film.
