Despite the fact that he is a continuation of a more powerful original, this is rather a ridiculous remake of the fifteenth, dedicated to the further antics of the psychopath Angela, who killed more narrow-minded teenagers for their “immorality” in the camp. <br /> <br /> Pamela Springsteen (Bruce's sister) looks great. There are some damn funny sex scenes with some damn attractive girls, but the film is so (unintentionally) comedic rather than disturbing, it's ugly. <br /> <br /> * of ****. <Br /> <br /> MPAA: rated R for graphic violence and blood, nudity and sexuality, language and drug use.
