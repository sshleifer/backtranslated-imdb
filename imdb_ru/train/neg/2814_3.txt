1st viewing 08.26.2001 - 3 out of 10 (Deer-Tob Hooper): a terrible but sadistic (which makes sense) image of a relative of the Marquis de Sade performing the same sadistic activities and enjoying it, which his predecessor supposedly did. This film Toba Hooper is really no different from his similar style films of Freddy Krueger, in which the same star (Freddie himself - Robert Englund) plays a double role (Marquis de Sade and his relative). It seems that he really wants to dig deeper into Christianity, but in the end he loses it, much to my chagrin, but leaves an inconsistent feeling in the film. It could have been much worse if the excesses were taken in sex and violence, but they try to minimize it, despite some disgusting scenes. My last thought: why would Hooper want to make this film? Obviously, it took some time to actually spread, then it needs to be advertised badly and with the name Hooper in the title, so I hope to earn some money in his name and his blood. Obviously it didn't work.
