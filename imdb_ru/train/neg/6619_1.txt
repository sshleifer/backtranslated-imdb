This is the worst movie I've ever seen in a movie !! Couldn't wait until it was over. Worse, he is issued a 12A certificate, so you donâ€™t see someone being shot, only the bodies fall to the ground, even the killed Babban was cut out !!! Too many scenes were cut out to attract young viewers, since I think the creators knew it would be disastrous !! Amitabha's acting was great, but the one who wants Basanti and another idiot playing Assistant Devgans can't even play. Devgan was wasted !! <br /> <br /> I would not watch it for free anymore, and I advise everyone who reads this to do the same thing YOU WARNED !!
