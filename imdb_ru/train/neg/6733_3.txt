The exclamation mark in the title is appropriate, although undervalued. This film is not just crying - it screams loud enough to break the glass. <br /> <br /> The cinematographers Andrew and Virginia Stone created shrill, gloomy, tense thrillers that sought a semi-documentary sensation. Here they shot at the real New York locations with tin "real" acoustics to raise the likelihood. But naturalism of sound recording serves only to enhance the inept dialogue of the Stones and the amazing history of the heroes of the tortured butterfly Inger Stevens. <br /> <br /> In a performance completely devoid of modulation, Stevens plays the wife of electronics gifted James Mason (looking haggard and bored); both are held prisoner by extortionist Rod Steiger (who looks bloated and bored) and his mucous cohorts in the scheme to blackmail the airline with a deadly bomb, which Mason unwittingly helped build. <br /> <br /> Here is another trust factor as an example of a criminal mastermind who is so brilliantly attentive to every detail, but smart enough to hire a drug-addicted geek as a subordinate. The idea of ​​Stones about biting a nail is to catch the hysterical Stevens alone with the reckless rapist Neville Brand, filling the frame with his sweaty, drooling kiss. But camera work is so lead, and Brand is so (uncharacteristically) modest that the effect is unlikely to be ominous, much less tense. "Stones", a square pair at heart, do not even have the courage to experience a lack of conviction. <br /> <br /> The film, which ends with how lush Steiger pursues the fast-footed Stevens on a subway train track, as clumsy as its awkward heavy. With Angie Dickinson as the immoral friend of Steiger, Jack Klugman, Kenneth Toby and Barney Phillips.
