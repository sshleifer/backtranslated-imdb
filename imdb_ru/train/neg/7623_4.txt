This little show is obviously some kind of stupid prequel / reversal of the original series. <br /> <br /> Compared to a live show, this show is complete nonsense. The live action movie had clever jokes and plot lines. While the animated series is basically a softened bitter-sweet version for younger audiences, but I think that maybe children hate this nonsense. <br /> <br /> The storyline in each episode is basically just that Sabrina has some kind of silly and meaningless dilemma and uses magic to fix it. This is basically the idea of ​​each episode. The strangest episode was when Sabrina uses magic to become a Gem, and a Gem to become Sabrina. And then Jem becomes a witch and hypnotizes Harvery to become her slave. This then leads to a bizarre, but rather interesting scene in which Jam says “just adore me now”, and Harvey drops down on her hands and knees and starts kissing her legs like a god. (which is quite true, since he is her slave of mind control) But this silly allocation is not worth the time or effort.
