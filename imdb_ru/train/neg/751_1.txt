I sincerely believe that ANY, considering making a film, will undergo this stunning failure. Like Edward Wood Jr.’s “films” in the 60s and 70s, this film is a prime example of why real filmmakers spend so much energy rewriting scripts, re-editing their films and reworking their special effects, until they finally , do not look straight. This film is also a worthy argument for pre-selection of studios. If Mr. Hines was compelled to endure an honest reaction to an impartial audience, he might have cut 75% of the scenes or walking / jogging / walking scenes and edited this film to a more tolerable 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Film students should view this film as an example of how dangerous it is to think that their work is “good enough.” Every performance, every line of dialogue, every digital effect, every filter effect, really every frame of video expresses the danger of striving for simple mediocrity. An aspiring director may be tempted to think from time to time: “At least I have achieved SOMETHING” or “Just completing it will be an achievement in itself.” This film will help them understand how bad the film can be. <br /> <br /> Critics can also benefit from watching this movie before they announce the last summer entertainment of the “worst movie ever made”. <br /> <br /> Novice writers can learn from this film how important rewriting is, and perhaps understand the need for rewriting it. In addition, aspiring directors can learn about the importance of a GOOD script and some degree of respect for how difficult it is to write a script that makes the audience feel emotional forcing throughout the story. Writers and directors who watch bad movies of the week for television and think that “I can do better than IT” can understand how difficult it is to really achieve even mediocre results. <br /> <br /> I sincerely believe that this film can serve as an educational tool for beginning cinematographers. Especially those who enter the craft in the present situation after Lucas and after Spielberg. There is a reason that filmmakers such as these are acclaimed for their ability with special effects. The “War of the Worlds” clearly shows that not everyone can handle it. Some cannot even approach him.
