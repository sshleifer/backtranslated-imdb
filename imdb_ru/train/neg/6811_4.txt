When I first saw this movie in a movie 11 years ago, I really liked it. I still think that direction and cinematography are excellent, just like music. But this is really a scenario that over time began to bother me more and more. I find Emma Thompson's essay selfless and unfaithful to the original book; she made Marianna a secondary character, a second violin for her too old, too harsh Eleanor - in the film she is given many "focal points", and often they appear there to show Thompson herself. <br /> <br /> I understand that she cut off several characters from the book, but did not mention one scene, where Willoughby in the book is redeemed? For a man who painted and cherished a book long before the film, these are things that are always difficult to digest. <br /> <br /> As for the actors, I love Kate Winslet as Marianne. She is not given the best scenario in the world to work with her, but she is still graceful, without much sentimentality. Alan Rickman is great, maybe a little old, but he plays that role beautifully. And Elizabeth Spriggs, she, as always, is fantastic.
