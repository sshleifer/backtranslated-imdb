Before you start watching the show, I heard that it was great and aesthetically very interesting. What a sham, the scenarios are so stupid that I am quite sure that the authors are the son and grandson of the authors of Scoobidoo. As for SFX and colors, they are so extreme that they look painful, the colors are not saturated, they are oversaturated, the scripts are rewritten, and the show is overvalued. This show is like a bad cake, in which the child would put only sugar and butter, thinking that since these ingredients are the best, there are enough of them. Unfortunately for this show, only two components of this show are finally emptiness and a total lack of trust.
