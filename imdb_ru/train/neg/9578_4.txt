Can A-Pix ever do anything right? This film was supposed to be shown on TV in mailbox format. Since A-Pix does not even believe in panning and scanning, we see whole scenes where the shoulder on the left side of the screen speaks with the shoulder on the right side. Of course, not something you miss much. This film is incredibly bad. It is very difficult to enjoy a movie in which the characters scream with all their might for 80% of the film without a reason.
