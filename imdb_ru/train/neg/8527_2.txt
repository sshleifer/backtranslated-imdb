There are three films with this style of animation that I remember with love from my youth. These are the films The Last Unicorn, Flight of the Dragons and The Hobbit. I have copies of both "Dragons" and "The Hobbit" (both excellent), and I have not seen "The Last Unicorn" for more than ten years. It was until today, and now I would not want to. What bothered me most was the script. It was incredibly volatile and often meaningless. Things will happen without a reason, while others will occur without explanation. We are not just talking about the little things here; we are talking about the key points of the plot! The story itself is not so good to begin with, but it could work if the script were decent. Not even close. In addition, the music was terrible! I know that music in such films rarely has what can be called classic plays, but the music in this film made me want to lose consciousness with the help of a bowling ball. It was one of those films that I was ever going to show my children, but it was just shot. I donâ€™t think I can ever get through this shitty holiday again. Disappointed to say the least.
