An illegal immigrant resists the social support system, with dire consequences for many. Well shot and acting, although the story is a bit intrusive, but a slow pace really pushes the conclusion. The feeling of being lost in a big city is effectively transmitted. A little man lost in a big society is something we can all relate to, but I cannot approve of how you watch this film.
