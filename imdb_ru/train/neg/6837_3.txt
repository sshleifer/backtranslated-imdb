I usually don't like revenge films .... PERIOD. But Double Impact has a little more than your typical background plot for revenge. You see, DI has action, accuracy, exotic locations (like Hong Kong), awesome gun fights and enough martial arts to satisfy your craving for impressive unarmed combat. Like all movies about revenge, he has villains who you would like to throw out of a glass window on the top floor of a 40-story building! However, Double Impact has no sensational crap that stifles the plot and the elite, racist and poisonous social stereotypes that have invaded "An Eye for an Eye" and "Deadly Desire 2". <br /> <br /> But in the plot of the department Double Impact is as transparent as saranovoy film. The parents of Chad and Alex were killed by the shock team of the crowd associated with a family friend with money problems, or at least that's what I remembered. The explanation of why the boys spoke French is lousy. It was not a water conspiracy that made this movie bad, but the use of clichéd lines and transitions from other films (from “Deadly Weapons” to “The Princess Bride”) really aggravated the situation. But, nevertheless, the Double Impact can still be watched. But why in these shitty films like this, there are villains (for example, that greedy British guy who killed Chad's and Alex's parents and this deadly red-haired chick) that you would like to hate with the help of your creature's fiber?
