Manmohan Desai made some interesting, though illogical films, such as AAA, PARVARISH and NASEEB, but made several craps, such as COOLIE and MARD, and then GJS. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the worst films he has ever made; the dial has become famous. Mard ko dard nahin hota, but the film is so bad that you cringe. <br /> <br /> The British make caricatures, and the film looks so weird. The scene in the British hotel is damn stupid. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of stupid things in the film, such as Amrita, attacking Amitabha, and then the whole scene plus a climax. The film is getting worse. There are more gems, such as the statue of a horse that comes alive, Amitabha masks, haha ​​and more. <br /> <br /> Manmohan Desai bad Music in order <br /> <br /> Amitabh plays his role in style, no different from roles like Cooley, LAAWARIS Amrita Singh in order Satyen Kapuu in order Prem Chopra, usually, Nirupa Roy, as always, her usual Sam Dara Singh, too, as usual
