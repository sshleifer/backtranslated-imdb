All participants (and viewers) must find a “Candidate” to see how good this film is. What happened to South American history? What did Julie Christie and Kate Capshaw think that their roles were made of cardboard. Until now, I enjoyed every Gene Hackman and / or film performance. He was either disinterested (I hardly believe in it), or he was terribly mistaken. I also loved and defended Richard Gere (and was convicted for it). But here he did not have “power”. He was never intimidating and only sometimes convincing. Overall I was very disappointed. I really expected a lot more from this director and actors. If you cannot find the “Candidate,” see “Wag the Dog” or even “Bulworth” again.
