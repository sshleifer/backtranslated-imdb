This movie is just awful. It's boring, poor quality, the actors are just the worst actors I've ever seen, and the script is so bad that it's funny. <br /> <br /> The “main” actor should be a hot guy who is all girls, but he is ugly, overweight and looks as if he has been from the early 90s. <br /> <br /> All the heroes left for the weekend to get together among friends, but in fact no one is friends! The couple did not see the “main” guy for more than 5 years, and even then they were not real friends. The “date” of the main guy knows him only by work, and then there is the girl they take at the bar. Now tell me that you run the risk of losing your job to spend the weekend in your cabin with people who are not even your true friends. Because this is what he does at the beginning of the film! <br /> <br /> Don't waste a minute of your time on this lemon. I made home movies worse than that! <br /> <br />
