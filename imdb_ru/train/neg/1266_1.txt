If there is hell, there is an observation room in which GRAND CANYON plays over and over again in an eternal cycle. Hopefully, the presence of so many wonderful actors - Danny Glover, Alfre Woodard, Kevin Klein, Mary Louise Parker - will help replenish the presence of Mary McDonnell (whose repentance is to watch her own films for all eternity) ... But no. Apparently, they introduced these other actors serum, made from McDonnell. The whole thing is pretentious, bloated, offensive (if you are deaf or know someone, be prepared for the fact that your blood boils on the ridiculous scene of TDD). GRAND CANYON is filled with disgusting, self-absorbed people, but never gives us a reason to love / understand / sympathize with or even tolerate them. With rare exceptions, they are unbearable losers, without whom the gene pool would be better. There is no plot to talk about, there is no character development (these people will never develop), there is no impressive presentation and the most elegant writing you have ever seen in the film. The best thing about the Grand Canyon? Its name. This is one big hole in the movie.
