Mark Hamill must have felt very embarrassed about the Corvetta SUMMER! This time he uses a new kind of “power” to reclaim his dream car, the bright red Vetta. It seems that another sour film of adolescence for the first half hour makes a turn in the wrong direction. Writing and directing tasks are terribly fulfilled, with several scenes that you can hardly shoot. In any case, you expect this to happen, and you also smell the smell of the hodgepodge of the late 70s. Only a former newcomer, such as Annie Potts, could easily steal the show and save this poor film from repo creeps! Her impractical, but delightful person forever maintains your interest, and this is the best chance to see her in a bathing suit. Hooray for Annie! Sorry, Mark! I think that the Force was not with you this time.
