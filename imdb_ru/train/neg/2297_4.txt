I include the 700 Club once in a while and agree with only some of the statements made: I am one of many believers whom most Christians consider to be liberal and most non-Christians to be conservatives. I vote for my opinion, and usually this is not a rep. or dem. - I do not believe that the 700 Club tells people what to believe, but it represents many older Christians who grew up in very conservative circles. I think that many people misunderstand what is being said at the 700 club. It saddens me when my name is in any direction. I think 700 club members really love Jesus, but so busy trying to get people to vote conservatively, that they forgot to show love to certain people and promote peace, as Jesus did. Please do not judge Jesus by ignorant people who believe in Him, and let's not be as ignorant with our comments about them. Why do people mean so much to each other?
