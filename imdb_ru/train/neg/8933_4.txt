When I watched this last night, I was amazed that Fox spent so much money on it and received so little back from their investments. This is the kind of disaster you need to believe in. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that on the first morning of filming, Raquel Welch shook off the shelf over the fireplace to prepare a place for the Academy Award, which she probably won for this boldly original film. Unfortunately. This is not what happened. <br /> <br /> Rex Reid described the fight on the set in detail, and it helped the film gain a reputation before it was released. When it was finally released, there was no ordinary three-stage advertising circus. If I remember correctly, he opened in Houston in the races and theaters next door and never played in any of the major places. <br /> <br /> I put a lot of blame on director Michael Sarn, who was hot after directing (not everything is so good) JOANN, a film with music about young people in the swing fashion London. <br /> <br /> If I remember correctly, Fox fired him and folded the film as best he could. That is why the scenes are played in a certain sequence, and the characters appear and then disappear. The impressive cast (Kathleen Freeman, Jim Backus, John Carradine, Andy Devine and others) is wasted, and there’s nothing to do. <br /> <br /> To expand it to full length, there are plenty of clips from Fox films with stars such as Carmen Miranda (in stunning scenes from The GANG'S ALL HERE) and Laurel and Hardy who never dreamed of playing a movie with a rating of "X". <br /> <br /> Rating “X” is due to random linguistic many sexual perversions; however, none of the characters seem to be having fun. Perhaps someone associated with the film had perverse Puritan sensitivities and thought that if they could make these things unattractive, it would be nice to use them. <br /> <br /> This was one of the “youth” films that Hollywood almost went bankrupt in the 1970s. One writer joked that EASY RIDER (which was made to change pockets) was the most expensive film ever made, because so many films followed that tried and failed to repeat their success. Sixty, once honorary directors such as Stanley Kramer and Otto Preminger, made films such as RPM and SKIDOO to attract young audiences. White directors and writers tried to make films in order to attract black audiences. These films are locked away somewhere in storage, and two names and many others from this genre never, as far as I know, have ever gone out to a home video or cable. This is a deep dark secret studios. <br /> <br /> Raquel Welch is in this, despite all the circumstances, very good. With the right guidance and script, she could play the type of impudent liberated women, Rosild Russell and Barbara Stenwick, specializing in her. She looks great and has amazing costumes. Mae West is the liveliest seventy-year-old actress I've ever seen. On the one hand, it is partly heartbreaking to watch her trying to capture her fame from past years, but I am sure that she needed money. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a big budget rating of X Film from this era, look OUT OF THE DOLL VALLEY (also from Fox), because it doesn’t take you seriously. These are crazy kids playing with equipment in a large studio. MIRA BRECKINRIDGE is trying to say something. There was simply no one who would listen.
