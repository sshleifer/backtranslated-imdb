Jet Li, one of the best melee fighters in the world. He is over 20 years old, and he puts others in the genre of shame. Although it is large in Asia, it is almost unknown here in the USA. <br /> <br /> Black Mask should be a breakthrough film for him, but he will fail terribly. First of all, it is called. Although it may matter camp (dubbing is not even close and has a smooth tone), it is not suitable for the average film viewer. Secondly, the director in this film Daniel Lee does a terrible job. He shoots scenes so quickly that sometimes you don't know what's going on. In other cases, the camera shakes and sways. Fans are watching Jet Li movies about fantastic martial arts. However, the director edits the scenes so quickly that you don't even know who is who in half the time! In other cases, the scene remains hanging (ie, Lee begins to cut a hole in the jeep's floor, while the villains arm their weapons, after two seconds, Lee and the love interest are already under the car!) So incredible that they cross the border to be completely ridiculous (ROMs with killer CDs? Just give it to Throwing Stars !!!!). Lee needs a director who is less prone to cutting from a machine gun and more to creating a cinematic scene. Added rap / techno music moves from normal to intrusive. The plot has possibilities, but they are all squandered by cartoon characters that deprive all confidence in this film. And do we really believe that love interest does not recognize Simon because he is wearing a half mask? Doesnâ€™t the hair, the lower jaw or the voice convey it? <br /> <br /> If you want to watch the movie Jet Li, try Iron Monkey or its classic Shaolin Temple. This mess is a complete waste of time ..... 2/10
