When a person who does not have Alzheimer's disease cannot remember how many films he has made, he is probably the most prolific director in the world. This man - Jesus Franco, the king of the so-called "eurozone". His 1980 film “The Devil Hunter” was also in a hurry, opaque, stupid, lazy and exploitative in the literal sense of the word (the name of the film is misleading, for starters), like any other film by Franco that I saw. That sounds pretty awful, and that ... And yet Franco has some unique sensibility, a generous way with insanely outrageous, with nudity, meanness and violence, and even with his stupid cheap editing, which is trying to pave the way. extreme haste with which all his films were made. The combination of all these elements makes you play his films, even if you are basically waiting for them to end, because they are very tedious. <br /> <br /> Devil Hunter is hardly incomprehensible for the first half hour. The kidnapping by strangers of a white woman who seems to be a model or movie star is interrupted by a bunch of local activities in South America. On the ugly totem pole there are a lot of bare cramps, dances and endless repetitions. You need to get used to the repetitive approximations and trimming technique to the same frame about three times in a row, since these are Franco's main methods for increasing the length of the film to <br />. <br /> A monster that looks like a totem pole is actually a bit scary. He has the rough eyes of beetles, and his presence on the soundtrack always signals cacophonous moans, apparently recorded in an echo chamber. At the beginning of the play, he is chewing on a native lady tied to a tree, and it is difficult to understand what is actually happening here, but I think he ate her stomach (or her genitals, dear Jesus!). <br /> <br /> In any case, the adventure begins properly when the guy and his frenzied Vietnamese boyfriend are sent to the island to cure the white girl of the kidnappers. The lousy guy has an accent that, as he was christened, is half Brooklyn-American, half English-Liverpud and all backward. All dialogue and duplication are ridiculous and ridiculous, creating another layer of film that might interest you somehow. <br /> <br /> From this point on, not too much happens, and it happens rather sluggishly, strewn with strange indignation, like rape. The blurry action is enhanced (ha ha!) By Akrami nudity 360 degrees from the natives and two female leashes, and even from the monster itself. The fact that he walks with a naked penis makes the fight with him an unparalleled prospect for a tough hero, but at some point it needs to be done, and it is pleasant to note that the director will show someone's genitals on camera. <br /> <br /> The best feature of the Devil Hunter is shooting in locations. Franco can be very cheap with constructive and plot aspects of filmmaking, but he doesn’t bother with sets. You get real islands, jungles, helicopters and mountains, all in widescreen. This is something that is really great to experience in our days of shitty CGI sets and backgrounds to nausea. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the recommendations for this film seem controversial. If you try to see all the “Video Nasties”, you will have to watch it at some point, and you will become as restless as I am. If you like Franco, you still look at it. If you do not fall into any of the above categories, you will most likely never see this movie. Copies of this are not just lying around, and I could hardly recommend looking for it. This is Franco. Lazy, mad Franco.
