The writer came up with a pretty decent idea for the story, but many of the flaws in the performance of the plot so taken away from the film that they almost made it invisible. Basic elements, such as character development, were, at best, obscured. Inconsistencies also raised their ugly heads. Massive mansion in the middle of a rural Irish village? Characters simply "appear" in the gardens on a stormy night (I would add, at a very convenient time)? Overall, it was not "bad." I rated it 4, based mainly on the story and talent of Alison Elliott.
