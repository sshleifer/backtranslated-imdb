Usually I do not do minuses, and if this site could, I would give this film -3 out of 10, that is, I really hated this film. I thought that Uwe Boll alone in the dark was the worst that I had ever seen, but at least I gave him 2.5 out of 10, in my opinion (Stephen Dorff, shooting at nothing, made me laugh, so I raised rating). Hell, if it were compared to Bloodrayne, Bloodrayne would have won an Oscar for best film if they competed. <br /> <br /> Now to the plot, this film is about a BTK killer, which is good, but they could have done better. The beginning looked good, but that's all I had to move most of the way forward, because death is where itâ€™s boring. I like killer movies, and even if they suck, they can still get some cool deaths. I am not an expert on cinema, but believe me, he would have shot himself if he saw it. Sorry for the incoherent, but I can not say anything good about it, because it seems that someone took a video camera and took it ... it ... a disaster. Uwe, Ball, your films are no longer on my list of worst films ever when it has benefited. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I could not explain the plot (if it was), but it was the best I could. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to get into a corner and move back and forth, reminding me how badly this movie scared me for the rest of my life ... Well, not for the rest of my life
