First of all, famous actors should need money ... Surgical scenes were ridiculous ... and, of course, they should know that people who know a little about medicine will find it completely absurd ... Anesthesiologists do not leave the room during heart transplants .... nor do they do the surgery in a tiny room devoid of tools, heart lung equipment and sterile techniques ... just a joke ... could not concentrate on the storyline because of all the silly surgical scenes ... no blood, no staff, and then a hero who will come and take over ... this is not a film for thinking adults .... In addition, the budget should have been limited ... street scenes were fine, but who was the technical consultant .... It seems that it was directed by a complete idiot. Save your money and wait until they are on DVD and rent them ..
