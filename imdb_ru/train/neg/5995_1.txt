This is really a horrible movie. What they did was take a television show that was never intended for young children and gave him George Lucas treatment (that is, spoiled him by deceiving him to appeal to a younger audience). <br /> <br /> Okay, so the telecast in the Thunderbirds was not the most spectacular performance, in fact it was rather formal, but it was always nice to watch it (especially when the models exploded) and the vocal composition was not too bad . <br /> <br /> It suffers from poor casting and poor acting (except for the notable exceptions of Sophia Myles in the role of Lady Penelope and Ron Cook in the role of Parker, who seem to be the only actors who have an idea of to play their characters) & after this parody I would not let Freyks direct the movement. <br /> <br /> The whole point of the Thunderbirds was that it was about the whole Tracy family and how they worked as a team, preventing disasters or coming to the rescue. those involved in natural disasters. <br /> <br /> Avoid such trash as the plague. <br /> <br /> I give him only 1 out of 10, because zero rating is not supported.
