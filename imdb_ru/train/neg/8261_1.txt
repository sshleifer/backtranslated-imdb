I was looking forward to watching this film, and then I realized that any hope for a consistent dialogue between the actors was flooded with unnecessary curses. Now I'm not a prude, in any case, but screaming obscenities at each other is not a good movie. Evan Bremner is probably one of the worst actors in the world at this time (witness his performance in the terrible Life of Matter), and his Cockney accent is almost as bad as his Edinburgh accent. Avoid. How many more of these films "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang", "Beautiful Creatures" we must survive before the filmmakers understand that f-word, c-word, etc. Do not replace the right dialogue with you.
