Put the blame on executive producer Wes Craven and Weinsteins financiers for this debacle with a big budget: the update to the Dracula thrash metal, with a condescending verbal blow in Bram Stoker (who probably wouldn’t want his name in this business) nothing special for us, except for the slashes in the style of slasher and blood. Christopher Plummer looks modern as Van Helsing these days - not just Van Helsing’s descendant, but a real person; he continues with leeches from the body of Count Dracula, who is exhumed from the coffin after being stolen from Van Helsing’s vault and transported to New Orleans. This is exactly what New Orleans needs in the 21st century! The film, well prepared, but without a single original idea (with the exception of multiracial victims), is disgusting and lazy, and after about an hour it begins to repeat. * from ****
