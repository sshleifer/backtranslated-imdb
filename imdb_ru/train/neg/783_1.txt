I watched this show, and I just did not find it funny. This could be the first episode. Recently, I understand that ABC is currently playing a lot of stupid shows and works like a station. All the characters in this series are pretty bad actors, but even if they were good, the jokes and scripts would be terrible and would still collapse the show. I would say that I believe that this show will be canceled, but given that ABC is doing pretty badly for the quality of the shows they play, they can just leave it simply because it is average compared to them.
