A review of this cheap STV's foywonder hits a nail right in the head. Make sure you read this. If you do not do this, a group of scientists will travel to the deep forests of the Pacific Northwest to mess around with a bunch of bones in an animal graveyard. The Big Foot family does not take it kindly and continues to select the team one by one, mostly behind the scenes. Big Foot himself has a clearly ape-like face, but overall he is less scary than Harry from Harry and Henderson. Most of the film has wooden, common actors pretending to be scientists who roam the woods and run away. It is a low-budget film in which very little happens, at least on the screen. We watch the sexiest women take a shower while one of her male comrades watches, but nothing comes of it.
