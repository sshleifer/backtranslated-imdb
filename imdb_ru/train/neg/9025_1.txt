Sorry - this film is just cheap TV production. I saw a lot of promotional material and expected such a professional film as “The Petrels” - what I was presented with was a low-budget film, such as “ZENA” or “Hercules” on TV. No atmosphere, very boring, more than the worst fighting scenes. Some good ideas are no more. I hope that I will have a chance to make such a film, and then I will show how to make such a film !!! <br /> <br /> My advice for ASIAN: "MUSA - WARRIOR", "STORMRIDERS", "SHAOLIN SOCCER", "BATTLE ROYAL", "VERSUS", etc. <br /> <br /> Sorry for my bad english!
