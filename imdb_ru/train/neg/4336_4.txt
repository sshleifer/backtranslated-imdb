I watched this movie and the original Carlitos Way closely. The difference between them is disgusting. Now I know that people will say that the prequel was made with a small budget, but it never had anything to do with a bad scenario. Now, maybe it's just me, but I always thought that a prequel was made to set up another film, starring the main characters and maybe talk a little about life we ​​didn't know. Rise to Power is just a movie named Carlito. In the original film there should have been at least a few characters, the ending does not make sense with respect to the original. At the end of this film, he retires with his sweet heart, but how the hell do we get him out of jail in the next movie? And his woman is not even the woman he talks about, like his only love in the original. I would say that the film itself is a bit entertaining, with a few decent parts, but it is pale when it is held up to the elder brother. Do not lie awake waiting to see it, look at the original again, if you really need a hit.
