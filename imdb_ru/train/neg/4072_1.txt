I watch bad movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is not good enough to be bad. Not a drop of humor, not a drop of talent everywhere. <br /> <br /> I'm lazy. <br /> <br /> I usually see a bad movie and curse. It was so bad that I really did a review in order to try to save others from the completely boring mess that I became a victim of. <br /> <br /> I break my copy of this film. <br /> <br /> Too stupid to even use a clean room. So boring. See “Bloodsucking Freaks” or “Shock, Shock, Shock” for absolute nonsense that has some advantage in the quality of entertainment. This sediment looks terrible, terrible, and the one who made it must feel terrible.
