ATTENTION: I advise everyone who has not yet seen the film not to read this comment. <br /> <br /> Although I did not see them all, Hamilton certainly delivered one modest entertainment that he did not do. generally entertain me !!!! I thought that in common with the welterweight actor’s game, the stupid plot scheme and the turn at the end of the film, which was very backward, this film sucks !!! Okay, so these people are supposed to eat other people. Yes ... pay attention, I said that people are not people, not because they are not people, or wait, I think that they, OH, DO NOT WAIT ANYONE, THEY DIDN'T SAY YOU !!!! Well, okay, these people are cannibals, or they are imbreds, or they are THE !!!! I mean, maybe they are just “THINGS” who came here to see how people taste, or they are cannibals that people have eaten for a long time, or maybe this film was HHOORRIIBBLLEE !! WHAT WAS IT !!! So if you think that Hamiltons is good, I ask you why, why, WHY, WHY, why it was so great, because for me it was just awful! One big BOOOOOOO for Hamilton !!! Visit Graveancers, Tooth & Nail or Borderland for fun!
