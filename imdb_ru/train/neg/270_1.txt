I watch it now on pink (Serbian TV channel), and I must say that this is crap. Small, no acting, too sloppy, I mean, who made this show? <br /> <br /> It was a stupid attempt by the studio to make some more money on the success of the film. OK. The film was great in 1994 when it came out. But the show? <br /> <br /> Sometimes you can see how idiotic the lines in the characters' speech are. I mean, did they pay someone to write this, was it a relative in the studio? This is not scifi. <br /> <br /> The film was a bomb, the show sucks.
