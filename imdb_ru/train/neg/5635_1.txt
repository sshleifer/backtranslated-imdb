I also like Dafoe as an actor, but I spent several hours of my life watching this film, I still can not believe that I managed to watch it completely. Was there really any meaning in the film? And the end, well, I'm glad I never paid to see this horrible, meaningless piece of the film's pathetic excuse! <br /> <br /> I’m not sure if I’m not looking for the facts, but is Defoe married or seeing a terrible actress in this film in real life if it was an attempt to start her career? If so, I'm afraid she failed. <br /> <br /> I publish this in the hope that I will really refuse to watch this film, even if one person listens to my comments and decides that they are watching paint drying much better, I feel that I did something good in the world if i had the same advice ...
