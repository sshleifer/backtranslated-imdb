This film will help improve consciousness. To read a book! It is incredible that someone thought that this film deserves time and investment. I have seen B before, but C has just been invented. I did not think that I would ever enjoy the Power Rangers, as my children stopped watching, but I found that I was watching a video for fifteen minutes in The Knights. High school production is better than this, and the actors involved should erase this from their resume. Embarrassment is one of many descriptions that come to mind. My roommate, who loves this type of movie, even turned it off. Now that should tell you something. If you watch this movie and you like it, I will pray for you.
