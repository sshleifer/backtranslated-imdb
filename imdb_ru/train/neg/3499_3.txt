Comedy Central is successful with original programming using professional comics. The Chapelle Show, Mind of Mencia, The Daily Show and the hugely popular Colbert Report are all star professional comics, and all of them, or in the case of the Chapelle Show, were solid shows. Considering that Sarah Silverman is one of the best female comics in the business, I expected a good one when I was in tune. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> There were some soft funny episodes, but given that the star is Silvermanâ€™s caliber, the show could have been much better. It was just a pilot, and hopefully the show next week will be better. If not, ask her to help in the form of the best writers for the show.
