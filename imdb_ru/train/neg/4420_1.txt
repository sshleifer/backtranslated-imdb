“Anything can be a great documentary” ?? Yes, if someone is deaf, stupid and blind. All but the value, wit, visual style and interesting subjects. Besides. . <br /> <br /> Seriously, Wolken. This is a film that is completely unreliable. Adventure document without incident, military document without a sense of war, marching promise without a trace of wit. It means nothing, is not like anything, and carries an implicit message that absolutely nothing matters. No wonder he has so many IMDb fans! Of course, you know that in the film, in which the great Skip Lipman was shot, there would be neither culture, nor intellect, nor wit (except the rodent teenage joke), nor any recognizable human emotions ?? just adrenaline. “Darkon” is not a film, but a panic attack! Avoid. There are too many real documentaries and too little time in life to spend on creating toilets, such as Darkon.
