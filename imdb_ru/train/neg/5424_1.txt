Mirror. The Mirror (1990) is a bad movie. Why did I watch such films when I was younger? Who knows? Maybe I was the one who punished myself watching one terrible movie after another. I don't know, I probably needed a hobby as a teenager. The teen rogue (Rainbow Harvest) seeks solace in the old mirror. Soon she learns about the terrifying power that this ancient mirror possesses, and uses it to strike those who have hurt her. In films like these, power has an unpleasant side effect. It changes her inside and out, whether she likes it or not. <br /> <br /> Disorder in the film, which for some reason was restored on d.v.d. some years ago. I do not know why. They had to leave it on the shelf and collect dust. People love this movie for some reason. If you do, I would like to know why. Up to this point I didnâ€™t like this film, and I have no reason to ever watch it again. <br /> <br /> Not recommended at all.
