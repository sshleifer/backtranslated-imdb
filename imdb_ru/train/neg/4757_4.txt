Some time ago I saw Sleuth (1972) with two great actors Michael Caine and Lawrence Olivier. Michael Caine is back, but now he is a husband, and Jude Law is his wife's lover. The story is the same, and this is a fantastic play. <br /> <br /> During the film, I always had the desire to watch a performance. This is one of the reasons why I donâ€™t like this remake of the classics. When I watch a film adapted to a play, I still have to feel the film, and not just the play. Director Kenneth Brannigan made some wonderful films in the past, but this time he missed. Another reason was the appearance of the film. The design was modern, stylish, clean, uncomfortable and cool. I have never had the feeling that someone has ever lived in this house. The photo was not bad, but the lighting was terrible. Sometimes there was a blue light, a dark, green light to round it, not eye-friendly. <br /> <br /> The game was really good. Michael Caine and Jude Law perform at their best. I would really like these two guys to play together on stage. But I have to admit, I have never been a fan of Jude Law. The weakest part was the middle part. I remember that in the original this part was still very mysterious and simply amazing. I tried to watch it twice, and I always slept in the middle. The final part is better and more interesting. Sleuth (2007) is not terrible, but it seems that this is more of a film for critics than for viewers. Sleuth (1972) is still a masterpiece and much more interesting than Sleuth (2007).
