It seems that there is little in the middle path when it comes to Watch On the Rhine. Either he likes it very much, applauding his sincerity, the liberal point of view and the beautiful game, or hates his obvious propaganda, mediocre dialogue, cardboard characters and general tendentiousness. I am very much in the latter category and found that the film and the performance concerning the activities of European refugees in Washington in wartime is a terrible occupation, which is mainly for the actors, and even then only intermittently. The fact that the author Lillian Hellman was on the side of the angels does not matter. Her plays were written for people who shared her point of view, and she rarely explored ideas that were not yet supported by the author and the audience, except to show how terrible the “other side” was. Even when I am in perfect agreement with what she has to say — as on the Rhine — I still cannot stand the way she says it. Her characters are unreal, and although her ability to dialogue shows a certain opportunity for how people speak, she does not have real brilliance or originality. She really had nothing new to say. I fully agree with the long overdue liquidation of Hellman’s reputation as the late Mary McCarthy a few years ago. For those who think the theater is dead or is in a pinch and yearn for the good old days, I urge you to look at “The Clock on the Rhine”, as bad as the “Angels in America” that show that there was one leg in the theater in a grave sixty years ago.
