It was the third remake of the film “Sleeping with the enemy” after YAARANA (1995) and AGNISAKSHI (1996) <br /> <br /> AGNISAKSHI was the only one that worked and was the best film <br /> <br /> DARAAR director Abbas Mustan which, unfortunately, failed in their attempt here <br /> <br /> the story was good, but the treatment was not so good, and the heroine was shown too regressive, and the culmination was also disappointing <br /> <br / > Direction is bad Music is good <br /> <br /> Rishi repeats his role as YAARANA (strangely, it was also a SWTE remake) and looks too thick for the leader, and in e right. Juhi is decent, and Arbaaz tries too hard in his debut and does manage to reassure the audience in many scenes, but his voice was terrible, Johnny is too loud
