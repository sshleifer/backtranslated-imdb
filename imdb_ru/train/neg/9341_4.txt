Hal Roach’s tough winter, The Tough Winter, is ninety-ninth in the series “Our Gang / Little Scammers” and the eleventh phrase book. In fact, this is a showcase for the black comedian Stepin Fetchita, who receives special accounts here, we see him going to his hut, where a gang hangs out. Farina receives a love letter from the post office for him, and Stepin tells him to read it, since he cannot read it during the day when he goes to the NIGHT school. It comes from his lover in Tennessee, so now Farin has to fill his ears with cotton, because he is too hot to hear him! In another room, Wieser transmits Mary Ann's instructions on how to make tricks from a walkie-talkie, but since he runs back and forth to the kitchen all the time, he misses the lady announcer’s transition to rice pudding and Spanish tamala, which confuses Mary Ann with the addition of Tabasco and Lux! After the cooking is finished, Jackie and the rest of the gang help themselves with terrible tasting, but a very sticky substance, as everyone gets stuck on the walls as a result. As they are all trying to restore order, Stepin works in the basement on various piping and electrical outlets that mix the functions of various appliances, such as a telephone, a vacuum cleaner, a vacuum that rings, and a refrigerator that plays music! The end. What I have just described foreshadows the wandering nature of this short film, Our Gang, which served as a pilot for a potential short film about Stepin Fetchit. It’s just as good that this never happened, since the characterization of the lazy Negro Fetchit was funny only in small doses and will be considered very offensive today. Many of the scenes I just described are good for laughter, although the final sequence was so confusing that the results were too blissful for me. So, in general, A Tough Winter is a curiosity that is worth seeing at least once. By the way, the real name of Stepin was Lincoln Theodore Perry.
