There will be a time when children grow up without even seeing Bagz Bunny kiss (technically) another man on the lips. There will be a time when it will not be a duck or rabbit season. There will be a time when the Tazman Devil will be called politically incorrect. <br /> <br /> But helping me now is not in this time. <br /> <br /> Nobody really wants an "EXTREME" version of our favorite characters, Loony. Whoever was in marketing, who came up with “Corn nuts: corn went wrong” and “Extreme Doritos” and, obviously, this purulent turd should know that just because they have a degree in business or advertising, or something something else, it does not mean that they know about something children. <br /> <br /> I think they are doing a disservice to children, depriving them of one of the greatest and most iconic shows of all time. This show is disgusting to me, and it’s not just an obsolete work of art or terrible dialogue. They abuse good voice talent like Phil Lamarr, Michael Clark Duncan, Candy Milo and many others. He lacks style, humor, character development and, most importantly, heart. <br /> <br /> The show, like the repacked characters (Slam Tasmanian, Rev Runner, Ace Bunny), is only a shadow of its former, eternal and beautiful personality.
