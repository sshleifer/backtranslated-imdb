Redline is a fake Fast & Furious without any redemptive qualities. He does not need to have an intricate plot with many turns and surprises, but he needs SOMETHING! This is equivalent to porn, where the plot and dialogue consist of 60 seconds at the beginning and the same at the end. Except that it's worse because you are not getting your money's worth. Stunningly boring, impossible racing sequence and a terrible waste of expensive beautiful cars that almost acquire negative points for appearing in this film. Of course, she is hot, but who desperately needs a woman on the screen? I feel that the director was sitting there in a hat full of dialogues and plot excerpts, and every time they changed scenes he shook 8 balls. No serious person who chases or knows anything about this would not watch this movie and enjoy the racing scenes.
