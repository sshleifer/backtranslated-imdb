I am very surprised that this film received such a rating! I have not seen such a bad film for many years. God, it was a really bad movie. Splashes are not enough to describe unnecessary (almost funny) bloody scenes). If you didn’t like hostel2, Wolf Creek or Halloween (2007) ... well, this is 10 times worse. This story reminds me of RL's goosebumps. Stein <br /> <br /> I can’t talk about the acting because the script was terrible. Cliche all the time. (Why should I write 10 lines? I never understood this.) <br /> <br /> == And here are the spoilers == <br /> <br /> The story of how a butcher kills people all the time underground. We are talking about thousands of murders, and no one gets notified. In fact, these people are simply missing. And there is a good guy who is trying to solve a mystery (well, there is no riddle for us, because we know the bad guy from the very beginning), and, as usual, no one believes him! what a surprise! In the end, he puts the meat clothes and fights to the death with the butcher's killer!
