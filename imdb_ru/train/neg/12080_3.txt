I'm a fan of both Shakespeare and MST3K, so I was looking forward to see this episode. First, I will comment on the film, then the episode MST3K. The recipe for this film is to take talented actors, Shakespeare's rich and beautiful material and a budget of $ 1.25. Mix well, then drain all life and movement until it becomes dull and lifeless. Serve cold in a large stone cauldron. The film I give 3 out of 10, because the actors, at least, deserve a little respect. Ok, now episode MST3K. I admit it when I first saw it, I fell asleep halfway. I understand that this was the reaction of several other wavers. However, when I looked at it a second time, I realized that there are a number of intelligent links and good lines that I missed the first time. The trick with this episode: listen carefully! It takes a couple of views to catch every line. Give him a second chance, and you will understand what I mean. MST3K Episode: 7 1/2 out of 10.
