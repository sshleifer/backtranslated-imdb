I do not believe that they made this film. Totally unnecessary. The first film was fine. But there was no need for a sequel, of course, after the television series, which was already a continuation of the first film. This film feels like a soap opera. Writing is so bad, it's very simple. Jokes are not found, acting is flat, shot like soap, he lacks direction. The first film had a good emotional character. Each character had a small arc. Then it was very simple, but somehow it worked, and I was able to see the merits of this film. But this time there is no single storyline. Heroes have boring stereotypes and nothing interesting happens. One good thing: the Brazilian boy who plays the son of Axel Deseler is pretty good. This was their only moment of creative success in this film. I heard that they have already shot the second television series as a continuation of “Team Spirit 2”, but please, God, don't let them do the third release ...
