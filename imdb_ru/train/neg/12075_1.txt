This Hamlet made for one of the most boring episodes of MST3000 ever. I am not a fan of Shakespeare, but I do not believe that he ever imagined that his works would be so slow and drab. It is also one of the most difficult movies to search for, because there are so many Hamlets on the list. As I said, although it is pretty boring. It is black and white, the pace is slow, the scenery is minimal. All the actors are also duplicated, so it does not help. This is the MST 3000, which I cannot watch in one sitting, because the guy who plays Hamlet says that his lines can put anyone to sleep.
