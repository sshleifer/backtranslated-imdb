There is a reason why it went straight to the video - the story is smart, Nick Cage plays Johnny in a rebellious style - sex in churches and other scenes bordering on bad taste (for example, a laundry scene) spoil this film. Judge Reinhold, as a cuckold, is fine, but the film itself, with its themes of degradation and revenge, is not very well made. But this is a good movie for quizzes, because few have seen it.
