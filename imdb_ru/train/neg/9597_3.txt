No matter how much I liked Japanese films, this film was not just cut ... The film, which was supposed to tell about the rebels and the survival of the royal bloodline, turned out to be a very slow film with a dubious plot. br /> <br /> Everything is in order with the photo, although I have seen much better sword fighting scenes in other Japanese films, fast cameras and the way they followed the characters did not convince me. The soundtrack is so weak that you do not even notice its presence. But the worst was how the plot developed. I must admit that sometimes it was difficult for me to understand who is who and what is happening. .. In any case, the platonic love between the main character and another was completely unnecessary and seemed to come from Hollywood influence. <br /> <br /> In general, if you are looking for an action movie in a Japanese film, it is not. It is very slow, with very few scenes of sword fighting and very sentimental ... in a bad sense ...
