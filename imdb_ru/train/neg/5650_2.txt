William Shatner tolerated in small doses. Unfortunately, instead of leaving his character as a minor annoyance, and in this moderately amusing, it was considered expedient to increase his role and overdo it. Just as happened in the original Star Trek series. I guess I will never understand American humor, which often goes beyond what is possible to convey a message. I vote with my feet. I don't watch the show anymore, and it's a shame, because the rest of the cast were good. It is a pity that the excessive role of Shatner also affects the performance of James Spader. But most demonstrate how society moves, I think. I do not travel on the same routes. Frank
