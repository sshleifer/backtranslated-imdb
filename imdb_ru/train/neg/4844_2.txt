I am definitely in the minority on this. "The Hurt Locker" has received more "Best Picture" awards from critics than any other film this year. However, not only did I not like it, but it was hard for me to put up with it. <br /> <br /> The plot is minimal, the character development is insignificant. They disarm bombs, fight and disarm more bombs. This is the whole movie. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing was that the camera did not stop moving and was constantly shaking. This was a recent craze in film making, and it should have made it more real, because it looks cheap and documented. The camera shook so much that I felt sick when I looked at the screen. <br /> <br /> I usually donâ€™t care about war movies, and "The Hurt Locker" was no exception. But you don't have to believe my words, because critics love it.
