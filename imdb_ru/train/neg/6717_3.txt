It was a terrible god. The story was everywhere, and more often than not I was embarrassed because of the terrible editing. I felt no sympathy for anyone, because their characters were not sufficiently developed. They were extremely shallow people without a dimension. Mean, foolish stereotypes with plots that have not gone away. The stripper was just a distraction, even if she looked decent. I don't know what that attempt was, but how shocked was I when they showed this garbage at Sundance? I almost canceled my subscription. You might think that such a channel will show more high-quality films. There are much, much better gay and lesbian movies. Celluloid Cabinet is a great documentary. I thoroughly enjoyed Wigstock: The Movie. I am sure there are others who have eluded me at the moment, but I am trying to say that it was simply not worth it. If you understand it on TV, fine, but otherwise do not worry. <br /> <br /> It was maybe three or four shots that looked really good (sadly, I can count them on one side), otherwise the cinema was pretty cheesy. The lighting was far in many places. I think some of the effects were used to try to add something that gave almost nothing. <br /> <br /> I can't deny that Johnny Rebel is quite hot (of course, without blond hair). It is a pity that his game did nothing for me. Stick with real porn, mate. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
