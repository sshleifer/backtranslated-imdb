I read the book of Celestine's Prophecy and was looking forward to watching the movie. Keep in mind that the movie is based on a book. Many of the most interesting moments of the book do not even go to the movies. This is the movie "B" at best. Many events, characters, the way a character interacts and is found in a book, simply change or not occur. The flow of events that are very fluid in the book, unstable and served in the form that you are a child. Character development is very bad. Characters characters differ from those in the book. Direction is like a click of horror "B". I understand that in order to present everything that is in the book, it would take six hours of the film, but they lost a lot of points. Casting was very good.
