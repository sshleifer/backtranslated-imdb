I can not believe that I looked at it, expecting more. It all starts well. This film pushes the boundaries of reality far! At least the first one was somewhat realistic. He breaks the first film and even mentions the project Joshua. Anyone who knows anything about computers will hate this movie. There is one good message in it: LOOK BIG BROTHER !!! It only seems from the film that Big Brother is much bigger than it really is. It was very disappointing. Even the makeup of the actors was completely bad. Some acting games are pretty good. Although some acting games are really bad. The script was fine in some moments and completely entangled in other parts. This movie plays for convenience about every five minutes. As I said, I can not believe that I expected more. I think I'm going to look in the original to return to Earth ... Q
