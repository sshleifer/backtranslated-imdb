I read a book a long time ago and do not remember the plot, but I remember what I liked. Since I'm sick on the couch at home, it seemed like a good idea, and hey! This is a movie for life. <br /> <br /> Actors and actresses of class B are participating in the film. <br /> <br /> The female cast is straight from the Desperate Housewives. I have never seen the show, but there is a lot of advertising for the show, and I understood the point. Nothing more original? Of course, but not for life. <br /> <br /> All male actors look pretty feminine, but I think girls should have a husband. <br /> <br /> In one scene a woman fights with a man, for her life, and what does she do ??? Kicks him in the testicles. Something else? Women like it, but let me tell you, girls, something ... It's not as easy as it always makes you look. <br /> <br /> Everything was not so bad. I did get a chill once or twice, so I have to believe it to someone.
