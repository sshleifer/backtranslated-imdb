Please, even if you are in a bad mood, refrain from watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I don’t think something was right with this movie. On the recommendation of a friend, I looked at it and literally blushed 1 hour 48 minutes of my life in the closet. A bad game, a stupid guide, a weak storyline, and a pitiful sequence of actions — and when you mix it together, you'll get a “Double Hit.” Even the smallest of the expectations did not materialize. <br /> <br /> I think I learned one thing - I never watched the Van Damme action films. They are a waste of time!
