The idea of ​​this film was good. It is a pity that it was not well written. The appointment of Sydney Poitier as an FBI agent was a good idea, and he did an outstanding job. Tom Berenger, on the other hand, knows only one emotion in most of his films, anger. The character of Kirstie Alley could have been excellent, and even once showed some possibilities, but the author did let us down by making his role a largely helpless woman. It was completely incompatible with the completely independent character she was supposed to be. I don't care what Ellie plays. The film was supposed to end about fifteen minutes earlier than it ended. The director milked the cow dry before an incredible final action. I will leave this in my collection only as an example of the performances of Poitiers.
