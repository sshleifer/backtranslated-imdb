Hmmm, please forgive me, but more than half of the characters are missing? In the original novel, Valjean - a man imprisoned for 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread, and then tried to escape several times. He violates parole and is constantly persecuted by police inspector Zhavert. Along the way, there are a LOT of characters that were not in this version. Some of them worth mentioning are: Fantine, Cosette, M & Mme. Tenardier, Eponin, Marius, Gavroch and Engolras. The only character with the same name is Javert. I was embarrassed and upset throughout the film, trying to understand how it is in any way connected with the epic novel of Victor Hugo.
