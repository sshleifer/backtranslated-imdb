I thought it was tiring to watch the corporate compliance job video. This film went nowhere fast. What could have been quite a funny half-hour episode of the twilight zone turned into a seemingly endless waste of film on people standing in the parking of their cars, a picture of some dude's swimming pool (by the way, he really needs to answer his phone making the matrix printer his job, and Huey and Louis are sitting in a yellow lighted control room, repeating "T minus 10 and counting", as if something exciting should happen. It is not, do not expect. The best thing about this film is to see James Best and Gerald McC in something different from famous television personalities, and it stretches to find something good. And do NOT get me to the music, which was completely composed of Tympani, some large marine mammals and microphone feedback. This film is as close as I gave one, but it gets 2 because I was really able to finish this insomnia treatment and I didnâ€™t have to leave in the middle. AVOID ALL COSTS.
