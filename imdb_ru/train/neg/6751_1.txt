My boyfriend and I rented it because we thought it might be a good start on Halloween. The killer, terrorizing the youth, the white mask ... you understand how I am. We were completely wrong! No pun intended. We not only found one of the worst films, but also a cult classic! It is filled w / plot holes and does not make sense. The actress who plays Maddie is beautiful, but that's all. I pay tribute to the fact that it was filmed with a VERY low budget - I always support such films. Only not this one. <br /> <br /> This movie can be useful if you are drunk or high up; otherwise do not worry. Unless you want to lose your privileges in a movie like me!
