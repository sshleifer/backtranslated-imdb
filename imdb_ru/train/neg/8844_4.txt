I watched this movie after seeing other IMDb comments, even after convincing my wife that this is a “unique horror movie”. I wanted this movie, but I couldn't. <br /> <br /> The Love Story was good, but the horror was pretty bad. If the story was just about a young man who fell in love with a girl suffering from parasomnia, it would be the best movie. <br /> <br /> Help Center stretched the credulity far beyond, it was actually quite funny. The doctor happily ignores privacy laws and professionalism. The nurse enters the room for normal feeding of a dangerous patient (without protection), throws the tray and runs out of the room, screaming for no apparent reason. The medical examiner (and the villain of the film) is bound in a standing position fully clothed - apparently for many years? None of this makes much sense. <br /> <br /> There were even some actors in the film that I liked about other things, like detective stories, but I still can't recommend this movie.
