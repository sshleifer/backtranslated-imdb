This cowardly and offensive film intrigued me from the very beginning. Characters are acquaintances who are deprived of a young man, who can often be seen bored in a seaside town. Robert is an outsider, but he has music that could become his soul. Instead, Clay turns Robert into a freak, who sets off on a journey through cannabis and ecstasy and gets into another crowd. It seems that Clay believes in the "madness of the refrigerator", and Robert finishes the film as a rapist killer. I wonder how much experience this young director has in real life? No one can save poor Robert. Clay leaves us a message saying that young British men are out of control. A very unconvincing link is made with Iraqi rebels; during excessively graphic rape, we are exposed to explosions and images of war. The film demonstrates the extremism of the male peer group, brought to the limit. Young bombers in London draw a parallel with the hated image of Clay of a modern man. Clay implies that men simply cannot help themselves cause terrible acts of violence. It is surprising that the British film industry allows you to invest in films that promote such controversial propaganda, when in London we still have not recovered from the recent attacks. This is Clay's first film, I would be glad if he were the last.
