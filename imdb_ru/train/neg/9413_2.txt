I sincerely disagree with other viewers of this wretched film. The only reason I did not rate him 1 for the terrible was because of the great talent of Carmen Miranda. The beginning and the end are the best parents because of her gifted singing and dancing. <br /> <br /> The problem is the rest of the picture. Alice Fei comes off completely Don Amech has a great singing voice, but because of this disgusting material he is very terribly banal. <br /> <br /> The plot here is very stressful, and Amecha consists of two parts in the role of a singer and a dancer and the baron is not happy with Faye. <br /> <br /> It seems that while playing a song and a dancing person, Ameshaâ€™s marriage gets a second change to be reborn. Some silly nonsense that the Baron has to deal with affairs and be away, allows him to play both roles. <br /> <br /> S.Z. Sakala is given little, and therefore his comedic gifts are not allowed to shine. The same goes for J. Carol Naish, who actually looks uncomfortable in his role. <br /> <br /> This is a bomb blast from a movie.
