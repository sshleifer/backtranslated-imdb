This film is very important because he offered me the following consideration: sometimes you may want to be sick ... sometimes you may want to have the syndrome ... sometimes, for example, you may want to have Goldfield syndrome ... so you donâ€™t I remember this boring film ... and, above all, you do not remember, Adam "super-fluos" Sandler ... sometimes, simply, you may wish ... shot another film ... <br /> <br / > My voice? 3 out of 10. My suggestion? If you are not a fan of boring romantic comedies or Adam Sandler (... this is a joke, there is no Adam Sandler fan ... I want to hope so), save yourself ... Will someone save? Drew Barrymore. ... possibly.
