After watching this film on SciFi, I can only conclude that this film was made by a group of fans who have never seen the film in their lives. The film is an endless sequence of strange events or “delights”, as a friend who reads over his shoulder tells me. The plot is really not worth commenting, but basically the plane with the players falls on the territory of the Yeti. Before the movie ends, we are still trying to get out of our hearts, but for now we are trying to run, before jumping 50 meters, but still tearing off the man’s legs and beating him with a woman who kills a rabbit with a 30 meter spear of the yeti who survived a few bullets and set on fire without visible harm, the yeti hanging from a cliff, holding onto a man’s shoe, but then jumping off, and a whole host of further, strange incidents. In fact, if you don’t go to bed on Saturday with the explicit goal of watching the worst of the original SciFi films, avoid this movie like the plague. Or, as my friend reads over his shoulder, he says: "This is the best movie I've ever seen." To which a friend to my right says: "Only martial techno music could make it better."
