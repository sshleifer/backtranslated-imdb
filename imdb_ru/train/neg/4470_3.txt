This is a comedy, but mostly bad taste, and nothing remotely brings a smile to the film. The film tells how the couple is trying to have a child, and those people in real life who are in such a situation will start at the image. For example, the scenes in the infertility treatment clinic are not exactly funny and frankly embarrassing. The male leader who plays the builder and in his helmet looks like a bad excuse for rejecting the Village People. A female leader is trying to look 20 years younger. Both leads seem unattractive, unattractive, and completely unconvincing. In the film there are various ridiculous and completely unassuming scenes, for example, with a low-cost airline, in which there is no humor. The only reason I give these 3/10 instead of 1/10 is one mark for Shirley MacLaine, which is the class above in the picture, and one mark for some half decent (albeit old) music.
