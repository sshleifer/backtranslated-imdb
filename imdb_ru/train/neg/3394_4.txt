In this film, Ben Chaplin is a bored bank employee in England who orders a bride by mail from Russia, receives by mail Nicole Kidman and gets more than he expected when, surprisingly, she is not what she seems. The story is pretty predictable, and Chaplin gets distracted too much, and he gets a little annoying. Kidman is actually pretty good at this role, which makes her heroine the only interesting thing about this movie. Grade: C
