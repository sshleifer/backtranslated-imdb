Thanks to Neil Simon’s boring, dimensionless script and Robert Moore's sloppy direction, the second chapter becomes a piercing showcase for Marsha Mason, who received her third of four Oscar nods for Chapter 2, giving the same performance here that she gave in Cinnderella Liberty (73) “Farewell, girl” (77 years old), Audrey Rose (78 years old) and “Only when I laugh” (81 years old), only this time she has no child to drag along. Chapter Two is the third and final feature film for Moore, in which Neil Simon's “Cheap Detective” (78) and Murder by Death (76) were previously shot. Caan is a mistake, characters are one-dimensional, the dialogue is excessively analytical, and the details of the groundwork are almost absent. The first half is less than charming, meets a pretty, shy romance between the blunt Kaan and the vigorous Mason, and the dreary second half makes you miss the first half. New York places, as well as Joe Bologna and the painfully thin Valerie Harper do not matter, but at least they distract attention. And finally, during the credits, a terrible song sounds.
