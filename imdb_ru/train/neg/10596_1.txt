Van Damme. What else can I say? Bill Goldberg. THERE WE GO. NOW we know that this film will be really awful. <br /> <br /> I saw the first five minutes of this film on TBS, knowing that it would be bad. But even I did not think that it would be a bad thing. The plot is terrible, Van Damme is getting older (finally), but, unlike Arnold, his films too. <br /> <br /> Forget this movie. I do not see it ever. I would not even have been paid to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/5 star - it is based on a wonderful, exciting, exciting ride. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe not, but marketers probably would like us to think so, right? <br /> <br /> john ulmer
