There are a lot of very beautiful people in this movie. This is probably the best thing about it. Perhaps it even makes it worthy of attention. <br /> <br /> “Loaded” tells the story of Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe), a young man who is going to leave his mark on the world. He is the son of a wealthy family with a good reputation, and he goes to law school. But, like many other similar settings, everything is not as perfect as it seems. The expectations in this family far outweigh the love. With the exception of school, Tristan's father rarely allows him to leave the house. It seems that this is the result of some traumatic event in the past, which shook the family, which is partially revealed in the memoirs, but not stated to the very end. Tristan's claustrophobic setting makes him very weak at the first opportunity, when his friends take him to a striptease club to celebrate his graduation party. The celebration soon follows several strippers back to the beach party, and from there, Tristan befriended Sebastian Cole (Corey Lardzh), who draws him into the criminal world involved in drug trafficking. <br /> <br /> Although it is technically well-made, this film suffers from a lackluster script and a storyline that is not very attractive. Against this film, some constant camera tricks are also taken into account, which usually seem annoying and inappropriate, such as slow-motion, fast-motion, freeze-frames and echoes. These are the types of effects that a director can usually use to show a character’s perspective on taking drugs, except that in this case they seem to fall from time to time at random moments, in some cheap style attempt. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that there are relatively few unknowns in it, the performances were good in everything, especially with regard to the main antagonist (Cory Lardzh). I suspect that in the future we will see at least a couple of such people in larger and better projects. <br /> <br /> Of course, when I mention the actors, I have to mention their appearance. This film, rated by popularity, received 11 points. The women in this film look incredible and almost distract you from the boring movie you are watching. I'm sure that male characters are also pretty attractive, but you have to ask someone to comment on this. <br /> <br /> In general, I cannot recommend this film, not to buy, rent, or even see for free. Unfortunately, it's just not worth it to sit down.
