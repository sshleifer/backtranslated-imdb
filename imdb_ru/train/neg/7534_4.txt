Mom tells the vignettes about men, women and sex between them. BUT? At first, the mummy randomly asks the viewer: â€œImagine that you have sex with this girl. Imagine that you are having sex with this boy ", approximately 37 times, while photographs of half-naked young fashion women appear on the screen. Later they told mods, boys skin mod girls with ... vegetables? If you ignore (or rewind) incoherent mummies, the shorts themselves are not bad. I found several of them quite amusing. My personal favorite is the one where a confused man tries to convince a girl to have sex with him while his beloved lizard sits on the bed. This is one, well, strange film.
