This film begins to present some kind of original idea, but later became a big disappointment. What is the original beginning, if the rest of the film did little to avoid conspiracy? The film itself is very unbelievable. I would like to know exactly how someone enters the clinic, gets the nurse's clothes, kills the doctor, takes out the patient in her bed, puts the Chevy in his pickup and leaves? I think that no one could answer this question, so they just jumped onto another stage, hiding these small details. The performances are just bad. The villain is just another “annoying crazy antagonist”, without depth, absolutely linear. After 20 minutes of the movie most of the scenes are incredible, it seemed that they were put there only for the sake of 90 minutes, since they are completely unnecessary. The doctor sees a woman who is under strong medication, he is denied examination, kicked out of the house and just silent? The final scene made me laugh, only Mickey Mouse could make her more real. I give it 2 out of 10 for the first, say, 10 minutes of the movie.
