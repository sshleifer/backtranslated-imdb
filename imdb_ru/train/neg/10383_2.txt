This may be one of the most enjoyable movies ever, if you donâ€™t take it seriously. It's a bit out of date, and the effects are not convincing, but it is so nice. There are giant crabs that attack a girl. oh, and crabs sing in japanese. This is surprisingly bad. And the ending, which was broadcast throughout the entire film, is terrific. Predictable, but when you see the final fight, you will ride in your place. Do not even give this film a chance, and you will like it. Susan George is fun to watch and yes, she looks naked. Her daughter should not be tolerated, but she is attacked by giant crabs. They are about the size of big cats. This is 2, but I love it. Like a film, oh my god, but for fun I give it to 7. I mentioned that there are giant crabs?
