If I accidentally stumbled upon this script in text form, I would read it and, perhaps, laughed. However, I would not laugh at the point in the film where the director seems to want me to laugh. Although I'm still not quite sure where they are. I don’t care if it’s Woody Allen, this writer cannot write dialogues or, at least, he cannot consciously write dialogues and then make performances from actors capable of causing laughter even to the most sensitive clowns. For example: <br /> <br /> (paraphrasing) "I am an art historian, I am looking for work in an art gallery." <br /> <br /> Well, this is a fact, but honestly, do you know any art historians who would say this? How would you answer? <br /> <br /> “Really? Art Gallery? Who would have thought? ”<br /> <br /> The entire script is replete with awkward quasi-intellectualism, which I did not expect from such a respected character writer. I admit that I do not know the other works of Allen and, judging by this, I do not want to start learning. Are the characters disgusting, without exception, an attempt to illustrate that we all suffer from the human condition? Or really bad character writing? You will be the judge.
