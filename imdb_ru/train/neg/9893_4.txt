I only hope that none of the classics / ancient historians have seen Cleopatra, or, if they did, they perceived it as a laugh. The film is terribly inaccurate, even more ridiculous than Gladiator (at least, a well-written script, whose historical mistakes are clearly formulated and fit well with history). The most egregious is Octavius, Caesar's heir, in the Senate before the murder of Caesar: at the mature age of 19! <br /> <br /> Also, the action is mediocre. In Timothy Dalton there is more than a hint of James Bond when he says: â€œCaesar. Julius Caesar". Billy Zane - funny tight Mark Antony. And Leonor Varela is trying his best to be a seductive pharaoh (who in real life was not good at all), but she looks incredible. <br /> <br /> So this warning is for all historians - this film does not correspond to life!
