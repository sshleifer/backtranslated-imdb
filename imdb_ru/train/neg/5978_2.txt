This third Pok√©mon film is too abstract for younger children and too boring to entertain older children. The message of the film - about the fight against loss - is undermined by the return of the father of a young girl during the credits of the film. Team Rocket provide some entertainment, but in fact they are not part of a small plot, so they do not appear very often.
