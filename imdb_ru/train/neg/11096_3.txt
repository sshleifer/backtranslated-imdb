I had high hopes for this film because I thought “PURE SHEYVEN” (Kerrigan’s first feature) was absolutely stunning, the most guaranteed cinematic low-cost film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> But most of Claire Dolan is completely pointless and flat. Scene after scene seems randomly mixed without much thought about the narrative or character. <br /> <br /> Claire is trying to escape, being a prostitute or not? Hard to say. Why does she pick up a stunt at the airport if she wants to escape this life? Why then does she not comprehend the tricks when she needs money in Seattle? Why do we have to see how she dyes her hair to almost the same color? Why does Claire accept some Jones and not others? The director does not seem to know. <br /> <br /> It seems that everything is improvised (although I understand that this is not so), and the filmmakers simply kept the camera on it, as if they were making a Verite Documentary film. <br /> <br /> After watching what I saw, Kerrigan defended his lack of narrative choice, condemning the film’s narrative as politically conservative. It sounded like scientific rhetoric. I think it was an excuse. <br /> <br /> I am saddened that the creator of the film, as exciting as PURE, SHEYVEN would continue to make such a lame film like this one and then protect it with tired old "political" cliches.
