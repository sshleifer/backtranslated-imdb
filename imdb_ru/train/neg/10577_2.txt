Some of the directors in this series have made some really great films, but they are sure that, damn it, they don’t show much mastery in this series. Especially writing. Well, the first season was a little better, but these new episodes they create just stink. I’m a big fan of horror, and in my opinion, the vast majority of these episodes are rubbish. Nothing new or really interesting. Few of them are visually creative. It's just typical Hollywood shit, uninteresting, childish, poorly thought out and in some cases ridiculous. As in The Tales from the Crypt, the only good thing this series offers is incredible nudity! Another is that this series blows heavily. Sometimes it seems that they hired a group of eighth-graders to write episodes. Maybe they did.
