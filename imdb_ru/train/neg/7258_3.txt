This grainy film has a cult worship and one of the word of mouth radio you've just seen. It may be hard to believe, but in the southwest of Arkansas, in Fuke, there is a rural community that knows that the legend is true. This story is told in the documentary style told by Vern Shtierman and filmed in real places where they talk to real people. The legend changes with the narration, but at the end of the 60s and in the majority of the 70s the neighborhood of Fuke was visited by a creature that looked like a snowman who was traveling through Bogey Creek. A long body with three fingers and a height of over 7 feet, this long creature periodically inflicted damage and scarecrows from the greater part of the community. I personally crossed a small bridge over Boggy Creek in 1974, and yes, the hair on the back of my head really rose. Of course, it was about 1 in the morning in the rain. By the time I arrived at Shreveport, I was already laughing.
