If in the late 80s you made a film of the genre, you had a 50/50 chance that it would be set underwater or in prison (unfortunately, we never had an underwater film). Derek Kaylor (Dennis Cole), accused of killing the Mafia boss Moretti (Anthony Franzios), finds himself on death row, right next to Mafia boss brother Frankie (Frank Sarchinello Jr.). But this is the smallest of Derek’s problems, as the fraudster’s (and mafia’s) government agent, Colonel Burgess (John Saxon, who also heads), uses the prison as a testing ground for testing a new supervirus. This is the only film of Saxon, filmed for his entire legendary career. For the guy who worked with tons of directors, it seems the only ones from whom he took any advice were cheap Italian. Of course, this is a low-budget project, but it can’t justify a skittish staging, shooting a misstep or a clumsy exposure in the first 15 minutes. To his credit, Saxo really made it a bit bloody, and he works in a cheerful nude scene (our management falls asleep during the prison riot only to fantasize about a woman scientist). Cole, who looks like a rougher Jan-Michael Vincent, is decent, like a stoic leader, and Francios — with a very bad carpet — disguises himself as a boss cliche. The end happens at the favorite place of Marty McKee, Bronson Canyon. Retromedia released this on DVD as ZOMBIE DEATH HOUSE.
