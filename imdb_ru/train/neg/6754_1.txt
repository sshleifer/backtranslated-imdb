The only reason I’m trying to comment on this film is to save you all 97 minutes of your life and maybe your money. <br /> <br /> I bought it with a rental for £ 3.00, it looked interesting, so I took a chance. <br /> <br /> A few minutes later I realized that I had made a mistake. The entire cast should be stored until winter, and then thrown at the nearest wood-burning fireplace, where they could meet more people of their kind. <br /> <br /> As for Devin Hamilton (writer and director), he must be just a shot, unfortunately, this had to be done before he made this garbage. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie, if you see it in stores, run away. <br /> <br /> 1/10
