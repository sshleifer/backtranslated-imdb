Scary .. Yes Scary !! Maslin, filled with nude (from fat people to thin people), takes place on a nudist beach in SA <br /> <br /> I saw this film for the first time two years ago - it's safe to say that he made a strange topic of discussion at school the next day. This movie was terrible! It is unlikely that a romantic comedy is just a showcase of nudity! This film reached its lowest point when one of the characters of the new century was watching between the legs of a girl. <br /> <br /> Girl: You will not find God there! Guy: No, but I think I found heaven. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this, unless you want amateur actors to discuss topics such as farting, adultery, and the process of joint fusion of the genitals. TO AVOID!
