My God. How they can make films of such beauty, but it is so terribly bad. I mean, even Uwe Boll doesn't do such shit. There is not even a hint of a decent story, multilayered characters or attractiveness. It's just a random sequence of meaningless conversations, united together to make a “movie.” I believe that only children under the age of 3 could enjoy it, given that the world is so dimensionless and the story is so disconnected that any senior can be annoyed by it. But then again, it’s too scary for those under 6 years old that probably no one should watch this movie at all. <br /> <br /> Listen to my advice and stay away from this movie. Your little daughter can create a better storyline, and although she probably cannot draw such beautiful pictures, her stories are much more valuable to listen to. And please, in the name of someone you believe in, do not expose your children to this piece of ****. I will give 2 out of 10, and this is solely for graphics, because the story and the development of the characters are so terrible that they deserve a negative rating. <br /> <br /> And if you decide to watch it anyway ... remember that I warned you.
