I believe this film is relevant today because it was an early Sophia Loren film. She was 19 years old when the film was shot in 1953. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie because I wanted to see some of the early works of Sophia Loren. I was surprised when she came to the camera, when her skin was covered with brown bronze to resemble an Ethiopian princess. Of course, today it could be considered as a stain and this should be avoided when creating films. It actually became annoying, watching Miss Loren in the color of skin throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Yes, this film would be better if real opera singers made this film. Then the singing and real facial gestures of real artists would be obvious. I do not take into account the comments of others about whether real opera singers are older and heavier in weight. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that Miss Lauren was at the age of 19 years old and is still beautiful, the film is better perceived as though it was done on stage. In the end, we do not see beautiful young people on stage, when behind the scenes sing "old opera singers"! Do not discount the success of using heavy opera singers. One has only to refer to the most artistically created television commercial for JJ Wentworth's company, where opera singers on the stage sing professional praises to the company's product. This is one of the best and most entertaining television commercials released to date. <br /> <br /> The print quality of the film also makes it somewhat lower quality. Color ink has faded dramatically, and nothing can be done about it. <br /> <br /> In order to improve this DVD movie, the production company must add English subtitles so that we, not speaking Italian, can know what these words are. they say. This would help the story and teach it more than the storyteller, giving 30 seconds of exploring the scenes. <br /> <br /> Watch this film not because of the story of Aida or because itâ€™s an opera. In addition to Ms. Sophia Loren, none of her co-authors are known and do not remember this writer. Watch this movie instead, if you are a fan of Miss Lauren and want to see her at the age of 19 - no matter what the staging will be. <br /> <br /> Larry from Illinois
