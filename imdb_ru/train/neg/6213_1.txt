This film is in the top ten of my worst films. Horrible. <br /> <br /> There was not a single moment when there was no fight with this or that monster. There was no chance for character development; they were too busy running from one swordfight to another. I had no emotional attachment (except for a big bad car that wanted to destroy them). <br /> <br /> Scenes were clearly stolen from other films, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. <br /> <br /> Examples <br /> <br />> The ghostly scene at the end was stolen from the last scene of the old Star Wars with Yoda, Obi-Un and Vader. <br /> <br />> At the beginning, the spider machine was exactly the same as Frodo, who was attacked by the spider in Return of the Kings. (Elijah Wood is the victim in both films) and wait ...... he hypnotizes (bit) his victim and envelops it ..... hey hi ???? <br /> <br />> And the theme “car against the people” was the Matrix ... or the Terminator ..... <br /> <br /> There are other examples, but why waste time? And someone will tell me what happened to the Nazis?!?! ???? Nazi <br /> <br /> There was a juvenile plot hurried to a juvenile imprisonment. The film could not decide whether it was a film for children or a film for adults, and was not so good. <br /> <br /> Just awful. A real disappointment, to say the least. Save your money.
