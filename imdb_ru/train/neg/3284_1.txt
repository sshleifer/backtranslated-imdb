Have I seen the worst movie? Perhaps only “Manos: Hands of Fate” dragged more than the “Dukes”. It was much more fun to poke at giant holes in the plot than at any moment I was shown a movie. Let's touch some ... <br /> <br /> There was a noticeable scenario of death and rebirth, when the Sheev talks with the dukes, but they do not respond. He shrugs and goes further, because neither Knoxville nor Scott know what he is talking about (and we do not know). As if the engine had died down and was restarted. <br /> <br /> Several times, when General Lee flew through the air, it wasn't even that exciting. None of what I have seen on the show. <br /> <br /> Very little chemistry between Knoxville and Scott. The best part was when Bo was upset about Luke for stealing his girlfriend. The only reason this works is because the script actually eclipsed it (albeit roughly). The rest of the time he seems distant and forced. <br /> <br /> Awful, terrible accent (or lack thereof) by Sean William Scott. <br /> <br /> I hated Willy Nelson's performance. Were bad jokes appealing? I wanted him to disappear. <br /> <br /> Jessica Simpson is great on the big screen. She really felt like one of the best actors in the film. It tells you how awful this movie is. She is a goddess. <br /> <br /> During the climax of the film, I rooted for boss Hogg and the bad guys to smooth over the entire Hazzard district, starting with Willy Nelson and his associates. A nuclear bomb would be enough. <br /> <br /> This does not mean a consistent dismantling of the film, but an exemption from disappointment about the terrible scenario and the execution of what could be a truly touching film. <br /> If we could only erase and start all over again ...
