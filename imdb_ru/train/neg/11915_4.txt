This obvious pilot for the unproduced series shows young Canadian actress Shiri Appleby as an amnestic with some rather incredible abilities that need to be used when a demon who has become a human has become a world. CGI is nominal for television work, and Appleby is fine like amnestic, but hard to swallow like a superheroine. Familiar TV man Richard Burgi as a mentor Appleby, but he can do nothing to raise this dirt above average. We see too much of a cartoon flying demon from the very beginning, a bad sign. In addition, the scenes where Burgi prepares Appleby for battle are actually funny. They are a bad copy of similar scenes in several other films, in particular, in REMO WILLIAMS.
