Diana Guzman is an evil young woman. Having survived a ruthless series of disappointments and injuries, she brings her anger to the closest goals. <br /> <br /> When she sees violence, transformed and focused by discipline in a worn boxing club, she knows that she has found her home. <br /> <br /> The film evolves from there as Diana learns the usual lessons of legal age along with the skills necessary for successful boxing. Michelle Rodriguez is very good at this role, especially when she conveys the concentrated rage of a young woman surrounded on all sides, and is struggling not only with personal circumstances, but also with ingrained sexism. <br /> <br /> In the picture you can use some refinement of his direction of all the young actors who turn pale compared to older, more experienced actors. There are too many pauses in the script, which distracts attention from the dramatic tension. The general silence of the film exhausts its intensity. <br /> <br /> This is a good picture that can be seen once, at least to see the power of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is complex enough to include her power. Its limitations do not allow it to be placed in the "see again and again" category.
