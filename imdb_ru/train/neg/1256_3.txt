This film is another attempt by director Tim Burton to use a familiar title to bring his “vision” to the screen. He did this with Batman, Sleepy Hollow and now with it. This is not a remake. The only thing he has in common with the original is that he has monkeys who can talk (and Charlton Heston acts in a cameo). Burton recreates the whole story, filling it for today's mass viewing. <br /> <br /> The original Planet of the Apes was a product of its time. In the 1960s, America fought to redefine its civilization. It was a stormy time searching for the soul and rethinking social norms. It was the era of civil rights when groups that were long considered inferior demanded equal treatment. In this context, POTA was allegorical, reflecting the philosophical upheavals encountered by viewers of the day. POTA was an extremely clever film, which discussed difficult issues and elegantly brought the oppression of American society to scrutiny, forcing the white guy to justify his intellect with a look that he considered inferior. The dialectic between Colonel Taylor (Charlton Heston), Dr. Cornelius (Roddy MacDowell) and Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) was defiant and clever with irony, both subtle and obvious. <br /> <br /> The Burton version is just as important a product of today, since POTA was the sixties. These are monkeys for dummies. He is superficial and ruthless, replacing reasonable dialogues with politically correct banalities and concentrating more on form than on substance. The ending of the "surprise" is completely inappropriate and gives nothing in the film, except for the "cliffhenger", which creates a sequel. While the ending of the original POTA gracefully tied everything together in one powerful scene, the ending of Burton just scoffs at the audience, mocking: “I know what you don’t know, and you have to wait for the sequel to find out. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, as always with the Burton film, the film is excellent. Makeup is fantastic, and Burton’s camera work is outstanding (although I still don’t like his dark look). However, thirty-three years of achievements in the field of prosthetic makeup cannot compensate for an offensively meaningless scenario. <br /> <br /> The story was reduced to a monster movie. People unite behind Captain Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) to fight monstrous monkeys, helped and supported by several apostates (especially Helena Bonham Carter in the role of Ari). The presentation is formal and simplistic, with a lot of violence, perfect for the modern fast food mentality. <br /> <br /> The acting game is ambiguous. Mark Wahlberg is a great actor who just missed that role. Wahlberg plays great dark, gloomy characters who are tortured, but strong. This piece requires an inspirational hero, a profile that is not in the Walberg repertoire. Helena Bonham Carter - a brilliant actor, whose character is so far from her abilities that the gap causes laughter. She is desperately trying to do something with a fragile character, but her interpretation is a cross between a college demonstrator in the world and the love of a sick teenager. <br /> <br /> Then there is Tim Roth. This is a virtuoso performance, alone saving the film from complete ruin. The mouth is devilishly hated as the evil General Teyd. He creates one of the most villainous and vile bad guys I ever remember. In addition, his physical game is excellent, which makes chimpanzees so perfect that you can even believe that this species exists. <br /> <br /> This film is a big disappointment. This is worthy entertainment while you are testing your brain at the door. I rated it 3/10. From a technical point of view, it is much better than 9/10. However, the story is an insult to the original franchise. It’s just another attempt by Burton to be self-satisfied, using a familiar name to draw crowds to the checkout so that many people can see what a genius he is. Of course, this is true, but it would be great if he used this talent to produce significant films instead of just like-minded people created for mass consumption.
