What is the load on the left hollywood hold. This film glorifies rebellion as brave and noble when it comes to pacifist principles. The tale ends with a pacifist character played by Danzel Washington, who actually receives a promotion for his treason. What is it with these Hollywood instruments? Is it still payback for McCarthyism? <br /> <br /> If I sound cynical, it’s because I’ve been bored with films showing a political agenda. The military leadership in this film is portrayed as what else? Gung-ho military traders. Sounds familiar? Have you ever seen a film where the CIA or any government agency is not evil? I'm thinking about it. And again “Crimson Tide” underlines this. Hackman's character, captain of the submarine Ramsey, looks like a crazy crazy, to the very end, when, of course, he comes to his senses, makes a full 360, refuses his bloodthirsty, offers a promotion for the devotee Ron Hunter, and repents service. The guy rebels, takes command of your boat, puts the US at serious risk of getting a nuclear first strike, and you are promoting it? What a bullshit!
