I saw this movie last night. I can't even express how this movie sucks. Letter, voice, even clay. Awful, Awful, Awful. It's like watching a 24 hour C-Span for comedy. It just does not work. It literally falls in almost every place. <br /> <br /> In addition, the animation of the film is of very poor quality. I know that this is a movie made by one person, but if you think that he could have done shit for 97 minutes, maybe at least 1 second is funny. <br /> <br /> This show is a cake for being the worst movie of all time. Clap. It really was so bad. If you are looking for a movie that makes you laugh, stay away from this abomination. My advice: don't even buy it, or look for it in this regard. Your brain will be than you.
