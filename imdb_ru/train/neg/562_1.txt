I love musicals, but as a Dickens fan, I hate this one. ** Soft spoilers ** Hungry boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in the workplace? Poor London goes out to sing? Fagin and Dodger go into the sunset? Not exactly the right novel. As I recall, Dodgera was hanged in public, and Fagin went crazy in prison. ** END OF SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Oliver Reed is very weak, like Sykes, making no more than a growl to show his evil. Worst of all, Mark Lester in the role of Oliver often faces such awkwardness and passivity that you wonder if he really is the main character. His image does not in any way help the fact that the best thing they could do when he sings is to duplicate the girlâ€™s voice. I think they did not understand that boyish threes can be found in almost every church in England. <br /> <br /> Self-respecting Dickens fans: stick to the stunning David Lin film of 1948 or the BBC's 6-hour adaptation from the mid-1980s. Avoid this bloated whitewash of the musical.
