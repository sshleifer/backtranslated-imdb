When I was at the cinema the other day, I walked around Blonde and Blonder, but something in this seemed like it could be a cute movie. Who knows? I mean, I’m sure most people beat Romy and Michelle before they saw it, Blonde and Blonder might just have been another secret treasure that was uncovered. But when I started watching this: executive producer Pamela Anderson, wow, I knew that something awful was waiting for me. Not only that, but also what was considered the pinnacle of hotness: Pam Anderson and Denise Richards, so as not to insult them, but they do not age at all, and they play roles that, I think, were more meant for women who are supposed to 20, not 40. The story was just bad and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Dee and Don are your stupid stereotypical blondes, they really have no idea what is happening in the world, just sad. But when girls for some reason are mistaken for murderers, the police tell their stories and actually call the girls geniuses because of their relationship “ignorance is happiness.” They are determined to “hit” a guy, and they think that they simply “show him a good time,” but the real killer is ticked off and wants to start a case and kill the girls. <Br /> <br /> Denise and Pam just look very awkward on the screen and almost the same as they read the script the day before. I know that it was supposed to be a stupid comedy, but she was more than stupid, she went for a nasty and just unnecessary. Would I ever recommend it? Less than a million years, as the girls at this moment are trying to maintain their status of "sexy kittens", it is rather a sign of despair, and Blonde and Blonder - a huge blonde BOMBshell. <br /> <br /> 1/10
