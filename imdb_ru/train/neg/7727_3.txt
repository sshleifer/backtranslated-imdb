I comment on this mini-series from the point of view of the person who first read the novel. And from this point of view, I can honestly say that, although it is pleasant, I understand why it has not been retransmitted recently. In particular, this mini has some serious problems, such as: <br /> <br /> 1) This is terribly wrong. The actors who played the younger generation were 15–20 years older than the characters. Ali McGraw (45 years old) played Natalie Jastrow, who was supposed to be about 26 years old. Jan-Michael Vincent (39 years old) played Byron Henry, who was supposed to be about 22 years old. The other children, Henry and Pamela Tadsbury, were also played by actors who were too old for characters who were about 20 years old. <br /> <br /> 2) Some acting games were absolutely terrible. Ali McGraw at times almost made this mini inaccessible for observation. I have seen more convincing performances in school plays. <br /> <br /> 3) The direction was bad. To be honest with Ali McGraw, bad play and character development were probably guiding. The image of Hitler was too exaggerated. His character looked and behaved more like a cartoon villain than a charismatic, sometimes charming, but always diabolical genius Herman Wook painted him like in a novel. Some of the other characters are so stereotyped (Berel Jastrow) that they do not get the depth of character that Wook created for them. <br /> <br /> 4) This mini is very outdated. Hockey music, a pretentious narrative (sounded like a narrative in movies on the history of high school) and a sense of a miniseries in prime time, sometimes made it almost comical. In addition, too often Byron and Natalie dress and look as if they were in 1979, not in 1939. <br /> <br /> Someone who watches this without reading the novel first probably will not experience it all because it will be released sooner in the late 70s - early 80s “take yourself too seriously” in prime time, not in the television version of what is undoubtedly a modern American classic. <br /> <br /> Remakes of old films and the like are sometimes made poorly, but this is probably one of the times when a creative and inspired director can make a very stunning, memorable and critically acclaimed production. I have never seen this happen, because the remake had to be as long (15 hours) or longer to do it right, and, given the short attention span of most modern American audience, he would not fly.
