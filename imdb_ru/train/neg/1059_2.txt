I watched this movie last night, and Iâ€™m trying hard to remember it. The story of a group of criminals who flee from the space colony. They fly to the moon in a space dumpster; when they are there, they terrorize the garbage cans that work on the lunar base. <br /> <br /> It amazes me that in low-budget low-budget sci-fi films often appear either planets of the desert, or, as in this film, criminals fleeing from colonies. Why this I have no idea. But I can say with confidence that such films are always diabolical. This is really no exception. It starts quite well with a decent credit sequence and soundtrack of dance music halfway through. Then he degenerates into a boring sci-fi thriller. There are so few consequences in this film that I literally struggle to write a useful review, so if you are reading this, I apologize for not being able to explain the subtleties and nuances of the film to you. For reference, I recall a boring bunch of villains, a boring bunch of goodies, several nuclear warheads and a hologram of a naked woman. Other than that, I'm struggling. <br /> <br /> If you think that you may be interested in the actions of lunar trash cans, then I would not hesitate to recommend this film. I would also recommend this to those of you who want to send your friends to bed and steal their wallets.
