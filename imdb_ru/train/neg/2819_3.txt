The Marquis de Sade, Egypt, the ancient Gnostic cults, Robert Englund in a double role, unreasonable sex and nudity, murder and lawlessness ... An entertaining movie with ingredients in mind, It's not. This plot is less, rambling ruins that bring little entertainment. In fact, there is no conspiracy other than some vague material about the cult that follows the work of De Sade, who for some strange reason feels the need to seduce the daughter of a local Christian archaeologist and kill her. This is quite a lot - I think it relates to the Gnostics, but who knows what the authors thought. Much of the film is a mess, as the heroine is exposed to various oddities, dream episodes, and erotic encounters interspersed with Englund scenes when prisoner De Sade chewed scenery in the 19th century. It seems that the creators tried to do something serious, but whatever their pretense, they were mired in carelessness, bad game, meanness and fake appearance of decapitated heads. <br /> <br /> There are not so many good moments. Robert Englund is fun to watch, as always, and lead actress Zoe Trilling, although not very talented, is attractive and undressing in the film at different stages, but watching Night Terrors is not an easy task. At least, I watched the film, from which “When you're the same criminal as me,” is taken from the Australian leadership on the rating of film certification, which was on the cover of many VHS tapes of the nineties.
