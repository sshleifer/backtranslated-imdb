Contrary to most other comments about “Siriana” on the IMDb website, my family and I have found that watching this movie on a DVD at home is a waste of time and space. <br /> <br /> In short, it was a film based on a script, the author of which was far too clever. Instead of trying to tell a complex story in a reasonable and clear way, it was assumed that constantly throwing mostly vague and difficult to connect with each other 30-second vignettes of different subject lines from a dozen or so “subject lines” to the audience made for a gorgeous and clear view. No, sir, it is not. For good viewing, complete clarity, accuracy, plots and plot lines are important, as well as characteristics that have a beginning, middle, and end. <br /> <br /> This kind of cinematic presentation is akin to the experience of Dim Sum in a Chinese restaurant - pretentious and inept to the extreme. <br /> <br /> Thank God for the television and DVD presentations of Hollywood and British moviegoers of the 1940s and 1950s, whose authors, Director and actors knew how important are the stories, diction and acting games that it means <br /> <br /> This is one DVD that this family will no longer watch.
