In 1692, Salem, a false children's lie about the slaveâ€™s involvement in witchcraft, enraged the whole community. The costumed drama with Claudette Colbert and Fred McMurray is not stifling, although it is not a vivid image of contagious hysteria. Designed by three writers (Walter Ferris, Darward Grimsted and Bradley King), the elements of the story are quite interesting (especially coming out of Hollywood in 1937), though will not tolerate for very long. The biggest problem with the picture can be casting: Colbert and MacMurray are poorly chosen couples of lovers who are hampered by the witch-hunt, MacMurray is too modern a presence for these neighborhoods. * 1/2 of ****
