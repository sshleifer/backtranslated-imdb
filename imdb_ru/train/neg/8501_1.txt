<br /> <br /> This movie sucks. It reminded me of the movie Resurrection (Christopher Lambert), which also seemed to me very boring. And “Semana Santa” is an even worse film in all respects. <br /> <br /> Alice Valli is only cast in one of the main roles in the film. Alida is one of the great old ladies in the history of European cinema. I liked her manic looks in Suspiria and Inferno (Dario Argento). I will not spend more time studying this film. I will say another good thing about this movie ... use it if you want to fall asleep very quickly ...
