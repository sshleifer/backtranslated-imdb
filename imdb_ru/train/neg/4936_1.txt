I wasted my time and gave this show a chance. This should be one of the worst new shows. If they gave rewards for shows that suck IT, you need to sweep the category. The game is bad, and the storyline is invented. Now the Dinosaurs were a bit strange, but at least it was interesting. This show lasted three seasons and was finally cleared. This new show, based on advertising by insurance companies, is not funny and in fact nothing is suitable for this. Perhaps the original commercials and the number of repetitions and repetitions - that's what's wrong with this show. This has just come to television, and we are already tired of seeing the "cave" characters.
