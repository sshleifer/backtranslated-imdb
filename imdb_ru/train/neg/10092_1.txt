Very shitty movie. <br /> <br /> First, the film begins with a policeman and his partner, parked near a warehouse / furniture store. The “bad” policeman takes the girl, who they stopped, into the loft of the warehouse, while the newcomer sits outside and reflects on what can happen there. The “bad” cop eventually returns with a heavy duffel bag, and the novice cop doesn't think there are any problems, but he still wonders what was in the bag, so he asks, gets outright nonsense, and then thinks everything is all right (for now). <br /> <br /> The “bad” policeman repeats this process, and even once with a tit scene (made her a little better). But in the end, people begin to realize that it takes some time, considering how obvious it is. One girl gets a voodoo curse on her in case she dies like you. Now the "bad" cop eventually kills this magically protected bitch, and then he gets rid of the body in bags. <br /> <br /> Since she is wearing an eccentric miracle, she returns with a lot of eye shadow, which should indicate that she can be a zombie ... also a magic curse makes all other girls become "shadow monsters" for the ages. " Some of the girls meet with a dude who is obviously a currency specialist and he offers them a ride (they look normal for him, apparently). But when girls see other people, such as the husband of one girl, he becomes infuriated because she is disgusting (some are worried and others do not even notice) ... a huge hole in the plot. <br /> <br /> To sum up, the shadow monsters kill the “bad” policeman, who in turn eventually becomes a zombie in the last scene. As if they were trying to prepare us for the sequel! As if someone would like to see part 2 of this cow fall.
