With the Bo Derek movie, viewers get exactly what they expect. A thin paper plot and a few shots of Mrs. Derek without clothes. “Ghosts can't do this” - it's just like that. The first fifteen minutes is the usual TV drama, while Scott [Anthony Quinn] is still alive. He is a very good actor with extensive experience in a variety of roles, but it seems that even a famous actor sometimes has to work only for money. Bo Derek, on the contrary, always plays a strikingly beautiful young woman with or without clothes. The film is a waste of time. If you want to see Quinn, rent Lawrence of Arabia or La Strada. If you want to see a nude woman or a bad game, rent any porn movie.
