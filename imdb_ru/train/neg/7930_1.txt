This piece of shit may have been recognized 60 years ago, but it is one of the most racist films ever made with Indians played by white people. Right Republican James Stewart was a huge racist in real life, like his close friend John Wayne. In 1971, Stuart fired the actor Hal Williams from The Jimmy Stewart Show (a short series that, fortunately, failed) only because Williams was black. As if it was not bad enough, this film is very outdated and boring. Instead, see Dancing With Wolves for a less racist look. <br /> <br /> Stewart was in his forties when this terrible film was made, and even with his ridiculous wig, he still looked like a haunting pedophile after 16 years Old Debra Page. I am surprised that this was even allowed. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
