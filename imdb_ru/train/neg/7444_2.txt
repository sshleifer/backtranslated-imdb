If you are not petrified by Russian people or boars, this film is a snapfest. In fact, I fell asleep for about 40 minutes, and I had to struggle with the desire to just leave the theater. I would like to have. A waste of absolutely beautiful Saturday evening. <br /> <br /> Even the “Silent Hill” was worse. Hell, even Pan's Labyrinth was worse. It is still unclear to me what should have been terrible in this film. <br /> <br /> To begin with, I am very suspicious of films that use the "Russian pidgin", as it was in the opening credits. It confuses me, since I brought a group of my Russian friends, and we all cringed. Oh my God. <br /> <br /> Hmm. Well, fortunately for me (and probably for you too), this film already burst from my brain, and I just got out of it an hour ago. So I don't have any details, only gloomy visual effects that won't go anywhere, and some kind of languid, now dead hope that something will happen. <br /> <br /> I may have seen a completely disfigured version of this film, because I cannot believe I received excellent reviews here (this is why I saw it) and as a result turned out to be completely devoid of not only horror or suspense, but also total entertainment value. <br /> <br /> I give him 2 because, yes, I fell asleep and wanted to leave after 40 minutes, but I woke up and did not leave.
