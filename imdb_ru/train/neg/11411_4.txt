The storyline has been rephrased several times; "A breath of life in a nursing home." Several plays, films, novels, short stories, poems and news articles broke the theme without end, but it is still an excellent platform for learning characters. <br /> <br /> Had Gideon been created with great enthusiasm, he could have been brilliant, but the dialogue was painfully boring, and the story was completely flooded with cliches (even the subtitle and summary of Gideon’s “simple wisdom” almost made me laugh over its inefficiency). Mostly indifferent action is the last straw for this weak film, but the rest is soft enough for the acting lack of attention to have almost no meaning.
