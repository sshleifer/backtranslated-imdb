What a terrible writing and acting skills. No personality. What, you can not make a good movie with one character? Hmm, this was done in dialogue with Kastaveya. <br /> <br /> This child goes on a journey to see his father. Baby Jason gets on the plane, and the pilot has a heart attack, and he dies in flight. Thus, the child falls into the lake and survives. Then he runs, surviving in the desert, until he is rescued. <br /> <br /> During this time, he fights twice with a bear. The first time he fights with him in the lake. The second time he makes a spear from a branch and a spear of a bear. Two shots of fake blood pouring from the chest of a bear reminded me of the "Holy Grail" of Monty Python. <br /> <br /> The baby also decided to strike the porcupine with predictable results. <br /> <br /> Gag.
