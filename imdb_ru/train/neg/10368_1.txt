This “movie” is such a bad job! Nothing seems to be trying to be realistic. The plot is weak, the cast is miserable, the actors are surprised how, in the first year of filming, they are trying their best to act without any chances from the very beginning. What a failure! What a waste of time, money and effort for all stakeholders, including the audience. Well, as in any thriller, there are also murders, corpses and blood. Imagine someone who committed a murder with a knife 5 minutes ago and came out calm and smiling, not to mention cleanliness as a whistle, as if a virtual agent was making a cut throat. In addition, this murder was to be committed by a tiny, frail woman on a tall, strong man, and she cut his throat !!! She politely asked him to bend over to her? Much more nonsense of the same kind occurs and makes the viewers think, does this mean that this is a joke, which simply turned out to be bad. Continuity is another huge problem, for example: the groom hungry for death lies in bed, waiting for his virgin bride to leave the bathroom and fall asleep after a while (!?!). The next scene begins with a young couple entering the waiting room asking for guidance on landscapes! NOT A WORD ABOUT LAST NIGHT ??? Such a waste of time even to write and write about this “supposedly short film” film.
