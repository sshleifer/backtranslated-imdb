The idea is good. Combining so many stars in one movie is great. But .... too many stories too short and meaningless. No connection between scenes. There were about 3-4 brilliant stories ... but there were 18. The frame reminded me of "All Invisible Children" - a film that I really liked. However, in comparison with it, “Paris Je T'Aime” lacks an intriguing story that develops - begins and has its end. And there is no topic in it that unites all these children. I don’t find Paris enough to put together 18 short sketches. Perhaps people who know Paris are interested. Otherwise, I would not recommend it ...
