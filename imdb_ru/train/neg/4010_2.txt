When I first watched the show, the first few episodes seemed promising to me. Bill Compton introduced herself as a stereotypical "mysterious" vampire, and Suki presented herself as an independent woman. Nevertheless, the show went down the slope, and once interesting characters became as fascinating as a cardboard box. <br /> <br /> As the plot develops, the main characters lose their original features, as well as their acting skills. By the fifth episode, Bill’s frowning eyebrows are so low that his face simply consists of his forehead. Suki, or rather, the actress, is even more dead than her vampire lover. All these tragic events surround her, and she reacts only to how pleasant it was to lose her virginity. Personally, I think they made the main characters sleep with each other too early in the show. The way they teased each other was something that hooked me, and it was easy to play a little more. As soon as Suki loses it, she walks around like a lamb, thinking only of Bill’s libido and the size of his appendage. Bill also loses his attitude and well, he just becomes stupid. His actions are never explained, except that he does it for Suke. What for? Their love for each other never delves into any love. So far, only sex seems to be the basis of their relationship. <br /> <br /> Yes, yes, vampires are usually equal in rights, but come on. Every five seconds I see something like a thrust going on. It was not so much surprise, since HBO is always trying to transfer porn from a soft core as a decent TV show. Bill jumped out of the mud and just got in touch with Sookie for no reason, what was it? I laughed so hard that I almost pee myself. <br /> <br /> The plot is just a stream of consciousness. The characters never went into details about anything. All events occurring usually remain unexplained. The only thing that is permanent is gender. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can say is that I like minor characters. Tara and her drunken mother are much more interesting than the main characters. The only reason why I keep watching the show is the development of secondary characters. <br /> <br /> Without sex and the main characters of the show would be much more valuable.
