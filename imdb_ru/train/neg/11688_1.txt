My wife and I found this film extremely unsatisfactory. While the plot interests you and makes you think about what happens when you leave the theater, too many empty ends have no meaning. (SPOILERS FORWARD) Christopher Plummer, the extremely rich head of the New York bank, keeps a terrible secret. Making a profit from the Second World War with the Nazis and hiding the loot stolen from the Jews, he keeps evidence (including diamonds and documents with the Nazi swastika) in a safe in his bank. What for? If he wants this to never be revealed, why did he not burn and destroy the documents many years ago? What about diamonds? Obviously, he does not need them - why keep them and not dispose of them? How did bank robbers know his secret? How did they find out about this very safe â„–232? Detective Ace Denzel Washington also discovers bank records showing that the SD boxes are No. 231 and 233, but No. 232. Curious. He meticulously took the time to somehow conduct a tedious search for bank records in order to uncover this curious fact. All this time, dealt with the red-hot situation with the hostages and bank robbers who threatened to execute them immediately. Blimey! Talk about super powers for a detective. <br /> <br /> Bank robbers leave millions of dollars in free currency in an open vault. They take only the contents of SD Box # 232, ostensibly with the goal of blackmailing the president of the bank. This defies any rational attempt at a logical explanation of what the film portrays as a criminal mastermind, or his minions with a smaller brain. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster, using his political connections with the mayor of New York, gets permission to enter the bank, which is under the control of bank robbers, holding many hostages. She offers the main bank robber to buy back the documents he currently has, but he is not interested. So what is its meaning (if any?). <br /> <br /> My wife was insulted by the arrogance of all the players, Christopher Plummer (president of the bank), Denzel Washington (ace detective) and Jodie Foster. shooter for serious challenges. <br /> <br /> The last Jodie Foster film I saw, Flight Plan, was also riddled with holes that made no sense. I thought I liked Jodie Foster, but I will probably avoid her future films. <br /> <br /> Now my problem is that I can rarely convince my wife to go to the movies. I can not disagree with her in this matter: "WASTE OF MONEY AND LOSS OF TIME." Be warned. Good movie, good actors, lousy scripts.
