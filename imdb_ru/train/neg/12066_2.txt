Well, as it is for the original - this means that a rich old man leaves his property to his adult children, all ungrateful losers and two terrible servants, if they spend a week in his eerie old house. What happens that night will surprise only those who have never seen a movie or television show before. After a series of murders in which the victims look as if they are bleeding from restaurant ketchup, we end in a painfully obvious turn. The cast is headed by some once respectable actors who must have desperately needed their salaries. There are also a few second-tier actors who grew up at the time, but long forgotten. As a result, the film generates all the drama and mystery of the episode "Matlock". I will give credit where it should - the final scene is smart and funny if you are still awake.
