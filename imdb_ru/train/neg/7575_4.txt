The retired diplomat, played by Michael York, travels to Russia to take revenge on the Russian gangster who killed the son of a police diplomat. There, the diplomat meets an exceptionally strong and decent Russian cop who helps him bring the Russian gangster to justice. <br /> <br /> I remembered the old fighting of the 1980s, which always portrayed Russians as evil bad guys, to undermine the righteous US government. Interestingly, this time the Russian guy is a hero. <br /> <br /> Not a very good movie, usually an action movie “B”. Michael York gives some class to this mediocre film. Alexander Nevsky, who plays a Russian policeman, is sort of like "blah", but surprisingly has some chemistry with Michael York. Admit it, Michael York is such a good actor that he would have chemistry with anyone he starred in the scene with. Disappointingly, handsome Adrian Paul is killed in the first 15 minutes of the film. Now, if Adrian Paul had been in this film longer, it would have been B's above average. All I can say about Adriana Pole is that it is very pleasant to watch the first 15 minutes of the film. The villain played by Richard Tyson, your typical bad guy. He is very blond and villainous in this film. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie if there's nothing more to watch on TV. This is normal. This is not too bad. The scene is decent. Acting could be better, the plot could move much faster, but, hey, you see what Russia looks like today!
