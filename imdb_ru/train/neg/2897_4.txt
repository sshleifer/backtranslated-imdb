There is little to worry about "Dan in Real Life." First, the whole installation is incredibly contrived. Do you really believe that during this long conversation in the restaurant with the first meeting, Marie would not tell Dan where she is going? And since Dan talked all the time during this conversation, why did she attract him so much? However, I did not understand why Marie was so attracted to Dan throughout the film. He is very narcissistic and does little to convince us that he is a really nice guy (for example, he lies with Marie in a bookstore, makes fun of her brother about his past girlfriends and tries to make Marie jealous with a blind date). There is also such a trick as that ridiculous scene in the bowling alley, where Dan and Marie catch the whole family. Yes it can really happen. Dan in real life is slow, juicy and manipulative. Even chicks like the Jane Austen Book Club get higher marks than this predictable tear man.
