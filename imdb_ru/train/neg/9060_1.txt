Channel surfing and caught it on the logo. It was one of those “I have to watch this because it’s so terribly bad” moments, like “Roadhouse without joy”. The letter is terrible; Absolutely reckless, and acting - “throw in your mouth” - is bad. <br /> <br /> There is a small budget, and then an abyss into which this epic should be thrown and never to be seen again. I mean that the main characters go on a ski trip in some rented house, and a house, well, in general, ordinary, which is not difficult, but they want to show all the guests of the house, pouring over it, like it was in the Sistine Chapel. Sorry, but I look at how 6 guys look into every boring room 10x10 feet with a futon in it, and lashes sucks. I believe that they have not learned anything from the “Bad News” in the “Urgent Workouts” (see Stage of checking a hotel room) ... wow toilet !!! yayyy !!!! I do not buy it around, so everything goes with a routine. If it smells ... and looks like ... well, you know the rest. <br /> <br /> Avoid the plague. <br /> <br /> edit: Apparently, other reviewers who are closer in meaning I suppose that, since I did not like this film, I am an “obvious hater”, which, as I can assume, means that I am phobic, which, of course, is not true. I decided to do this stupid, crazy thing and judge a film based on the actual content of the film, not on its mere presence (i.e., to see it refreshing ...) <br /> <br /> Of course, this can be It's nice to watch, but this is not equivalent to a good movie, just give them the best material to work with and clearer guidance. In fact, I salute the effort. Honestly, I'd rather go listen to my “Kitchen of Difference” catalog than watch it again.
