I saw this film during the first theatrical release in a completely empty theater. Believe it or not, but after decades of watching movies, this movie still remains in my memory as the worst movie of all time; or at least the worst that I would allow myself to watch. <br /> <br /> The action of the game is far from the standard set by any random group of drunk high school students who have escaped from the street and have to learn their lines in 5 minutes or less. <br /> <br /> After the first shock of disbelief, we laughed for a while as each scene reached new lows. But after a while, even this dubious pleasure passed, and it had to be really sad.
