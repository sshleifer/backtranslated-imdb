During the cheap movie “The Mad Fat Ethel II” shot in the video, I wondered if it was the same movie that was on the cover. Unfortunately, that was it. The story itself is thoughtlessly simple. Ethel, a killer maniac with an eating disorder, released halfway due to overcrowding in the hospital. She is certainly the most sensible resident, watching as one man puts dead flies in the soup of another. Then Ethel teased a chocolate bar halfway through a house clerk after he decided to cut the cost of feeding the locals dog food. Ethel responds by strangling him with a wire loop on the stairs, and then ... well, you understand. If all this sounds fun, it is not. This film was poorly made with cheap effects and worse acting. Characters are so wooden when giving out their lines that they have to stand in front of a cigar store. Worse, half of the film consists of memories of the first film about Ethel, "Criminally Insane," which is slightly better. VERY bad effort.
