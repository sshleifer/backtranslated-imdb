I would give 2/10. <br /> <br /> I was very, very disappointed. <br /> <br /> The storyline was poorly developed, for example, the incidents were too short and short, therefore, morality was not clearly identified. I thought Brenda Song did a great job, but Shin Koyamada seemed to have difficulty coping with her role. I could see the need to add western elements to the show, however, there are certain places where Chinese elements were also needed! Villain for example. His appearance was like a robot, not something of Chinese culture. The last and worst flaw was the incorrect and distorted facts exhibited in the show. <br /> <br /> Others may indicate that this is a “show for children”, and therefore there is no need for such a high level. standards. However, there are other Disney shows, such as Mu Lan, which were much better in terms of plot development and presentation. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I believe that Disney films should be better researched and better planned. A good show is not enough to simply rely on a series of martial arts.
