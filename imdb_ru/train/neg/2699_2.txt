I did not read a single IMDb commentary on this film, which mentions how a Jewish character in this film jumped up and down like a little kid when a racist skinhead shot his face while the main black character of the film looked down in severity on the barrel of the gun. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t know how someone could perceive this as a balanced report on the life of the university. I agree that universities are not the bulwark of tolerance, as they should be, and the name would be appropriate if Singleton did not make his characters such wide caricatures. <br /> <br /> On the surface, he is trying to portray the character Ice Cube. like a bad guy, provoking Remy to become a racist skinhead. But who ends at the end of the epilogue of the film of salvation? It seems that Singleton points to white as incapable of empathizing (I did not say that I sympathize!) To my black fellow student OR only able to follow the path of a racist skinhead. Many people who are being bullied by people of a different race do not turn to extreme fanaticism. <br /> <br /> And women who were raped do not immediately turn to lesbianism, which is portrayed more as a cult than as a way of life. Honestly, what was the point?
