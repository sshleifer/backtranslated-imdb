Is there anything that happens in this movie that is NOT predictable? I think no. In fact, the movie is cliché for cliché, and in fact nothing surprises. This makes the film extremely predictable, and therefore the film also lacks tension. So for a thriller, it’s not hard enough and unpredictable, but as a drama it’s a failure. This is because the film his story is extremely unlikely. I mean, by no means can this happen in real life, just like the events in this film. So the film has a real problem with expectation and trust. <br /> <br /> But this is really the cliche that killed the movie. From time to time it pressed. In this film, everything is so formal. The predator is portrayed as cold, heartless, almost a psychopath, as a sexually upset boy, and the victim as a naive young woman who behaves as if she had not seen anything like it. Everything that happened in the film was so obvious, and it seemed that everything happened for some reason. For example, the sequence in which the “predator” mends the “prey” of a wrecked car. This should be one of the oldest cliches from the book. I knew what the film was trying to achieve after this point. I tried to look as if the teacher and the student really grew towards each other with the eyes of the people around them. It was so incredibly obvious and cheap that I almost wanted to stop watching a movie after this point. The film is filled with such moments. <br /> <br /> The title can be assumed that this is a cheap porn movie, but this is actually juicy made for a television movie. This means that everything happens slowly, and the film spends less than half the time on character development and unnecessary additional plots to make the film even more dramatic. <br /> <br /> I admit that Elizabeth Berkley is pretty good at playing this movie. It makes some clichés and events even look almost realistic at times. Her Hollywood career is as good as after she appeared in Paul Verhoeven’s film Showgirls, so unfortunately she will probably still only appear in films and TV shows like this one. This is a waste of her talent, and she certainly deserves better. All other characters are disappointing. Cory Sevier plays in the cliché of a rather “untouchable” rich boy, and the way the main character's husband is depicted is even worse. He looks more like a broken sexual predator than a real predator of the film. He basically tries to have sex with his wife in every sequence. He wakes up, he wants sex. Before going to bed, he wants sex. He comes back home, he wants sex. It can be realistic, but I don’t know, it’s just not suitable for a film like this, and for the story as a whole. <br /> <br /> A cliché-filled movie, and I can't think of any reason why anyone should ever watch this movie. This is predictable, and therefore there is also a lack of expectation and trust. Not a “terrible” movie, and it can certainly be seen occasionally, but all the weak and cliché in the film also make it far from recommended. <br /> <br /> 4/10
