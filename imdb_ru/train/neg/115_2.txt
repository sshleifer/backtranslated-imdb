Never use Playboy models and rabbits in your movies! “Star 80” of Bob Foss about Dorothy Stratten, whom Bogdanovich was so obsessed with, to marry his sister after her murder at the hands of her husband with a low standard of living, is a million times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is also not an actress .. I expected to see some lost masterpiece in the spirit of Orson Wells, but instead I received Audrey Hepburn, who jumped up in jeans and a terrible poodle hairstyle ... "Paper Moon" and "Last Show" I could watch again and again. This shaggy man I could hardly sit once. This film was supposedly not released due to the fuss caused by Ms. Stratten’s tasteless death; I think the real reason was that it was so bad!
