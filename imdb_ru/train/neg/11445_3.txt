I saw a lot of shit in my time, but damn, Hot Rod takes the cake. I saw a free show in New York that night. I can only hope that they show a fun version to paying customers. Big laughter was rare, the plot was uninteresting, and the characters were at best one-dimensional. One of the highlights is the fun dance scene with Adam Samberg. It was priceless and was the only scene I really had a hearty laugh at. Besides this, I can only remember chance and dead air. SNL & Samberg fans may be disappointed. I know I expected more from this. But in short, I would definitely not recommend visiting a free preview or pay per view of this film.
