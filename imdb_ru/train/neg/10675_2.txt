You must understand that when the star's name is incorrect in the opening credits, you are not in a good time (the credit says “Cuba Gooding, JR"). Any nice car chase, shoot them, blow them up, if EVERYTHING you want is an action, because the attitude to what exists is, at best, insignificant and absolutely unbelievable. The motivations of the characters, especially Gooding’s motives at the end, are worse than unbelievable, they are irrational when they are not hopelessly confused. All I can think about is that Andy Cheng must be a really good guy in order to attract so many good actors to this dirty project (he can't have something on all of them, can he?).
