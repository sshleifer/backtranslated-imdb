What do you get when you have a bad game, bad direction, painfully long scenes, terrible lighting, painful editing and terrible effects? You get Jessica: A Ghost Story It seems that his shot on the beta camera is good, but the lighting should complement this environment. In this case, it is not. There are several CUs where a person’s face is completely in the shade. One scene, in particular, the scene of psychiatrists. This is a joke if you ask me. Some scenes were so long that they could easily be cut in half ... but I think that then they would not have a full-length film. The main character is incredibly flat. He is a LEADER, so he must have some "heroic" elements in the character, but he does not. He whines and scared the whole movie. I could go on, but I don't want to waste my time. Although the lighting was terrible, I must say that they had good camera movement. It is a pity that the lighting did not complement it. The DVD cover is good, and that’s it. Just awful.
