Born Again is not a standard episode of the first season. He deals with the theme of reincarnation and simply does not fly. I have never been into reincarnation, and this may be part of my apathy for this episode. He refers to the case of Tooms, which is a good continuation of the previous episode. But the positives end there. Unfortunately, this happens at the beginning of the episode. I think it's funny that the dead guy would decide to reincarnate in the body of a completely unrelated girl. And he waits until the girl turns eight to begin demanding revenge. There is even a serious drawback of Mulder and Scully's ingenious dialogue to keep the episode afloat. If you're in reincarnation, maybe this episode is at a dead end. If not, then at least you can find out what is bradycardia.
