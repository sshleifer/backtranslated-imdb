The original 1965 Japanese film "Gamera" http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was, in fact, an update of a darker, less child-oriented Godzir (Godzilla) for the sensitivity of the 1960s. Of course, Gamera is a giant, flying, fire-breathing turtle that literally consumes energy â€” not as large as some versions of Godzilla, but generally similar in most cases. <br /> <br /> This version of the original film was edited and reissued by the notorious Sandy Frank. And just like the Americanized version of Godzilla ("The King of Monsters of Godzilla"), the "Hammer the Invincible" gets more than just the wrong spelling. American scenes are not as funny and annoying as those that were added to the great Godzir, but in fact they do not add anything special to the story, because they are almost not tracked. <br /> <br /> The film starts promisingly, there are several character development scenes, and there are enough personalities to create some tension outside the main plot. However, as soon as Gamer appears, the film begins to turn into a rather ordinary film about kayu. <br /> <br /> The game is good enough, even with American additions, everything is in order. The direction is pretty good for this period and the genre, and the special effects are not bad at all for their time (all miniatures). Some of the sets and backgrounds are actually very good. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem here, of course, is that there is nothing original in this film. Hamera, however, develops a much more unique personality in his later films - most of which are worth seeing if you are a Kayu fan.
