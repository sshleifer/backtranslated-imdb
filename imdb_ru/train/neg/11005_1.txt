This film shows a series of sketches that partially go from one to another. I realized that at the end of the film everything went, at first it just annoyed me. <br /> <br /> Many episodes of this film go without any recognizable highlights and just try to get around this fact, using absurdity and obscenity. Attempting to remain a comedy without any funny pieces failed. <br /> <br /> My staff and, perhaps, the subjective result after watching this film (my God, it hurts my head every time I call it a “film”): A bold attempt to turn nothing into something great. But it failed. At least the director did something out of nothing. But this is not something good. <br /> <br /> Many films were not as funny as planned, but this film surpasses them all. This is a real manifestation of the worst movie making scenario. Not. To fix yourself, it's even worse than that. The movie with gags is so bad that they are not funny at all. It is even fun to watch the leading actor, screenwriter and director (by the way, all three are the same guy) are dying, drowning in a sea of ​​bad films. The film is too bad for this.
