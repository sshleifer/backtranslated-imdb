I could not believe some terrible dialogues emanating from the mouths of people, and the end of the drums attached to the body of the film was a real cry. And we get boobs Angelica Pettijon (sort of) and Lauren Crabtree. <br /> <br /> A teleportation device, activated by psychic Angelica Pettydzhon, delivers a container of aliens to an underground laboratory in the desert. According to director Fred Deer Ray, these were the remaining sets from Klaus Kinsky’s movie, ANDROID, which adds value to the film besides how cheap it looks. <br /> <br /> Inside the container is a small alien (played by Race's son) who begins to scratch people to death. It was pretty funny to watch this little "creature" in a black reptile costume with large beetle shells attached to it, running in the dark. We can even see a little thing on an alien poster that I thought was fun. <br /> <br /> And here’s something like a snake, which also comes out of the container, which is killed in the death of William Fair after a miniature creature chewing Frank Macdonald’s neck in the kitchen. I suppose the low-budget version of “Alien” ... <br /> <br /> It all ends suddenly, it seems that at the end they had finished the film before the reel attacked with the final captions. Talking about the lack of funding ... <br /> <br /> Fred Olen Ray also mentions in the director’s comments that they were also not sure that Aldo Ray would go through the shooting and remember his lines. He barely did. <br /> <br /> Low-budget cheese to sneeze. It's fun to watch, I'll give it to you. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
