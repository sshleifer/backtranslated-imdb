Lady in Cement is a real course in social anthropology of the late 60s. Writing, not acting, is the center of attention. Did I say - clean camp! Get offended if you are female or gay. Wide and the lady are standard terms, and gay harassment and beating are presented as they were during the day (on a campaign). Most of the lines are discarded, although there are remarkable performances by very few outstanding character actors. The action of the action scene is mundane, but it's fun to see Dan Blocker play a tough guy who likes to beat in circles. And Lani Kazan and Raquel Welch are at the magnificent peak of their careers. It is surprising to note that both of them were 28 years old, and Mr. Sinatra was 53 years old. Musical accompaniment, wait. Was there an account? Well, you understand. Watch it with friends who want to laugh. it's full of them.
