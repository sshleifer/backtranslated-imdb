R O B O T J O X. <br /> <br /> Burn the master. <br /> <br /> Grotesque awful. <br /> <br /> Endless; without closing. <br /> <br /> Absolutely and completely the worst film ever created. <br /> <br /> Replaces "The Adventures of Pluto Nash" as the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> I hate this completely unused, unedited, unwritten, not directed, unproduced mess of a thing called “Robot Jocks” - and I just found out - THEY DID SECOND ONE!?!? I apologize to Adma Sandler (Zohar Byutitsin) and Eddie Murphy (Pluto Nash) for hating their films. This mess only makes these films bad — not horrible, horrible, and grotesque, like this thing. This is the only film I've ever spoken for - REMOVE IT FROM NETFLIX - NOW !!! 10,000 out of 10 people found this comment helpful.
