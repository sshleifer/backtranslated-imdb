Cool guys, sexy women, a lot of curses and the most unconvincing monster rising from the depths of a polluted lake. You might think that “Monster” will be fun ... but in fact it is not. These are really the stars of Tony Eisley and John Carradine, however, and in my book it’s worth it to watch at least once. In an interview with Fangoria in 1987, Eisley recalled that Herbert Strok directed the main part of the film, but somehow Kenneth Hartford, who only filmed shots with his children Andrea and Glenn (portraying characters named Andrea and Glenn in a particularly inventive turn ) - Got full credit. Considering how terrible the end result was, Strok was probably glad that he was not credited! Monster looks and looks like a mid-to-seventies television film, so I like to leave it so often in the background. As entertainment, it falls directly on the face, but as a reminder of a different age and disappeared type of film production, it is very effective. The only thing missing is a car chase.
