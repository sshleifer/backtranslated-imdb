I can not believe it is on DVD. Even less was it available at my local video store. <br /> <br /> Some people claim that this is a good film, if we take into account that its budget was only 4000 dollars. I find it funny. I would be very bad, whatever the budget. <br /> <br /> Even more funny, I read the following in another review: “Drama aside, if you love horror and love something in the spirit of a duel” (1971) updated a little more history and some pretty girls, you like this movie. "<br /> <br /> What?!? I’m ashamed to compare these two films. <br /> <br /> I give a“ 1 ”because I cannot give a“ 0 ”. I just don’t understand how this The film can be interesting.
