When the film is independent and not rated, such as Hamilton, I expected your heartfelt abuse to fail. I know that good movies do not always contain blood and violence, but I read reviews, visited the website and even convinced several of my friends to pay $ 9.50 to watch this terrible movie with me. When there will be a festival called “Horrors,” I expect horror, not “Dawson Creek” with incestuous shades. My expectations were extremely low for this film, but those little expectations that were for this film ended up in hell as soon as I saw that an hour had passed before we saw the first drop of blood from someone's finger. There were too many holes in the plot and left too much for imagination. I regret not seeing Happy Feet. I think there could be more violence and blood in this film than in the Hamilton!
