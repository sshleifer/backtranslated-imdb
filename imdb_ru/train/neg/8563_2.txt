This is similar to what is said in the title of this topic. The only impression I got from this film is that Marley Matlinâ€™s character was always evil, so cynical and so pathetic. The first date of her character with the character of William Hurt, where they danced, was mute. In general, I tried to finish watching the movie four times, and of all four times I fell asleep. I would continue to watch this film with one intention ... to overcome my insomnia problem, because all he does is put me to sleep. Sweet Dreams.
