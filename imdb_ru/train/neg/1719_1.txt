“Monstrous Lake” is one of the most horrendous, amateur films I've ever seen. He is in the same place with “Manos”, “Hands of fate” in terms of bad play, useless orientation and production values ​​at the level of kindergarten. In this film, an animated dinosaur with clay clay / stopping motion wakes up after a meteor hit a lake in Bumblebee, California, and begins to dine at local haymaking sites. In an exciting climax, a creature described by one local as a “giant alligator with flippers” drags its heavy mass over the ground to pursue its potential lunch before the bulldozer hits it a couple of times and dies of boredom. Every character in this film is a complete idiot . One pointless story tells how I went to the liquor store to buy a pint of Ripple for $ 4.75; instead of simply buying a bottle, an idiot shoots a cash register, while another passer-by shoots a policeman, is pursued in the direction of the lake, and all this so that the monster can eat it. Unsuccessful close-ups of the monster show that this is nothing more than a piece of foam. There is a fake magician who fights with a fake British accent (to make it seem more legitimate), two overly clumsy tenants of the boat-cattle, some kind of stupid "prehistoric art of caves" made by small, and annoying background music banjo. In one of the painful scenes, the fake magician and his intoxicated wife / girlfriend / accomplice managed to supplement the film with an additional 4 minutes, telling how the stars can see in the night sky, even though it is still clear during the day. Even with constant fast-forwarding, this film hurts and hurts. MooCow says call fumigators because this cow pie really stinks! : = 8P
