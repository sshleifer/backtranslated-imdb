It was terrible Andy McDowell - a terrible actress. It is so wooden that it makes a rocking horse better than it. But then remember this turn in Four Weddings, just as painful. Another film that depicts England as full of chocolate box and village green cottages. I mean that school, how many schools other than Hogwarts looks like this? The police station in Twei looked like a set of Heartbeat (nauseous British TV series, filmed in the 60s). This film simply could not decide what he wanted to be a comedy or a serious study of the undercurrents in the friendship of women. If it stuck to the first, then the sex scenes in the cemetery and a very stupid storming of the wedding could work (I say simply). But these scenes simply did not work with tragedy in the second half. I also find it implausible that Kate will ever talk to Molly again after her terrible behavior. The last remark - what makes a decent actress, like Staunton, in this heap of shit? Not to mention Anna Chancellor. McDowell must adhere to advertising wrinkle cream.
