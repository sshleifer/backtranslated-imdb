This is an amateur film, shot on video, and not “electrified drama,” as the DVD-liner falsely boasts. I have seen much better things from senior students. Most of the story unfolds with an endless taxi ride around Jakarta. This film could have been shot using one camcorder, but there are several sections in which two cameras were used, and the content was merged later. Editing is extremely rude. The final editing was probably done with two cameras, pushing content back and forth, rather than with the proper editor. Perhaps they did the editing in a taxi too? English subtitles were written by someone who does not speak English, for example, “Where are you going now?” To say that product quality is on par with Blair Witch is very generous. If you are not scared yet, this film was ambitious and creative, with a lot of cool and funny images from all over Jakarta.
