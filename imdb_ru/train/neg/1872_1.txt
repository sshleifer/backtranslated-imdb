KEEP IN MIND. This film is such a mess. This is a catastrophe. Do not waste your time on this. I warned you! <br /> <br /> Acting, history, dialogue, music ... well, everything is so unnatural, it’s just annoying and funny. It made me want to quit (if the dialogue / acting / story didn't do it, it's all crookedly shot). You will feel like you are watching a comedy. The problem is that the parts that are supposedly funny are not even funny. Acting, plot, cinematography, you may feel that everyone is just trying too hard for WAAAAY - but it never succeeds. Almost every shot is performed, but so what ?! This film is just like a student film. No wonder they shot it in HD, because it would be wasting more money to make this movie. <br /> <br /> If it's easy for you to have fun or you play badly, write, edit, direct, are full of cliches, everything that is being imposed on you, oh, did I mention a bad game? (well, actually, it's not the actor's fault — it's the director!) Then I think you will like this movie. <br /> <br /> I had to look at this in the lesson. I would immediately turn it off if I could. If you still can not say, I hated this film. It made me want to quit and return time ... at least I did not have to pay for this garbage. <br /> <br /> Jeff Goldblum, you know ... a guy from Jurassic Park / Independence Day, in this film, but of course he has gone down since - taking roles for films like this disaster.
