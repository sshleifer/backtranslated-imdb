I’m totally confused as to why this film even pleases, not to mention being so highly valued, especially by many critics who are otherwise quite reasonable. <br /> <br /> There is one keyword that describes this film in its essence - annoying. <br /> <br /> The most easily explained example of this is the director’s use — or, more precisely, the abuse of music. In the first half, the truly boring reggae melody is played about three times (when one time is too often). But in the second half of The Mommas And The Papas, "California Dreamin '" is played at least seven times, usually at maximum volume. Godsakes, whether you liked the song or not in advance, you will be completely tired of it by the end. Just think, some people claim to have seen this movie four or five times. This means that they listened to the California Dreamin either 28 or 35 times ..... <br /> <br /> All this unnecessary hyper-repetition (not contributing to the story) can be justified if the film has lasting virtues, or if the story was in any way involved. <br /> <br /> But it is not. <br /> <br /> The only aspect that I found pleasant was around Bridget Lin and still plays Asia “The Unbeatable” in a raincoat and Sunni. Even this went pretty fast. <br /> <br /> I’m sure that the undeserved high reputation of this film will convince many poor suckers to go see it. <br /> <br /> I can only warn you - if you have never seen the HK movie before, do not start with this. <br /> <br /> If you feel obliged to watch it, at all costs avoid watching it in the cinema. The fast forward and mute buttons are essential survival tools. <br /> <br /> You have been warned!
