In this film, supporters of Chávez (both Venezuelan and non-Venezuelan) simply lie about the dramatic situation in our country. <br /> <br /> They did not say that the conflict began because of the announcement of Chávez, who dismissed many of the best PDVSA workers on political issues only. <br /> <br /> They did not say anything about more than 96 TV channels. interruptions transmitted by Chávez within 3 days to CADENA NACIONAL (a type of confiscation of private television signals). Each lasting about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> They didn’t tell us anything about the resignation announcement made by General en Jeff Lucas Rincon Romero, the Inspector General of the Armed Forces, who traditionally supports Chávez. Even now, despite his announcement, he is the Ministry of the Interior and Justice. After the return of Chávez, he took the post of Defense Secretary of Defense (equals US Secretary of Defense). <br /> <br /> They didn’t say anything about Chavez’s orders for shooting at peacekeepers applying for an election. <br /> They did not say anything about the people of this concentration who were killed by supporters of Chavez (by civilians and military official forces). <br /> <br /> They present some facts in the wrong order to lie. <br /> <br /> They didn’t say anything about Venezuelan civil society, which even now claims elections, in order to resolve Chávez’s crisis and actions in order to avoid elections. <br /> <br /> That's why I tell you ... This film is just a lot of lies or a big lie.
