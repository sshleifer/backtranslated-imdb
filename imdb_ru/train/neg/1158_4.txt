Tenants Two writers are struggling to finish their books in an almost empty apartment building. First they help each other, and then gradually the tension between them increases. <br /> <br /> This is based on the novel by Bernard Malamud, and unfortunately everyone speaks as if they were in this novel. Very few dialogues are natural, they are purple and filled with shades of meaning. It’s as if the English script of the college has written a script with a head full of claims. It's terrible, and I immediately felt immune to everything the film had to say, and this is a shame because the film is filled with great performances from top to bottom. Snoop-pooh in great shape, unfortunately, none of them can overcome the falsity of words and prerequisites. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie. Although it’s not so bad, it’s very preaching and pretentious to the point that you want to leave. I lost interest less than a third of the way and I had to fight to get to the end. If you're interested, I would try it on the cable, but I would not lay out good money to see it.
