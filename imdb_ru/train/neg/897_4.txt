Two years before he wrote and shot Arthur, Steve Gordon received a small hit in the form of the script for this crazy comedy car for Henry Winkler, and then the television show The Fonz. A college fan of the 1950s (and a comprehensive breakthrough) caring for a student and getting married without any job prospects on the horizon; to make ends meet, he turns to a vibrant world of struggle, eventually becoming a celebrity like "The Magnificent George." Turning the pretty Winkler into a disgusting deception probably sounded like an interesting idea at the time (and a sure way to separate him from his television alter-ego), but jokes and situations are often wrong and mean-spirited, posed by a rather careless director Karl Rainer. Especially rudely shudders when Hervé Villeschez (from “Island of Fantasy”) sets his moves to Polly Holliday (Flo from Alice). As Henry's lover, Kim Darby looks a little out of his element, especially when she is surrounded by all these television amateurs, which makes the romantic aspect of the script irrelevant. * 1/2 of ****
