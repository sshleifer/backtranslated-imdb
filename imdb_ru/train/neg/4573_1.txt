I didn’t know much about this film before watching it, but I heard that it was somehow related to quantum physics, so I was interested. What I didn’t know was that this is NOT a REAL HISTORY, but a group of New Age talkers who like the sound of their own voice, telling how little they know about basic quantum mechanics. I say that it is more in the category of “Documentary” than “Comedy” or “Drama”. <br /> <br /> Marley Matlin participates in the film to give this New Age Symposium a sort of storyline. Her parts of the film feel awfully chained and are designed to show the speaker’s thoughts so that we don’t die of boredom. Matlin has the real work of a photographer, unlike the New Age hippies that fall on her sofa. We listen to how nameless people talk about what quantum physics means to them. The only bright spot in this film is the speaker from India (I guess), but I think it was not for that film. <br /> <br /> It seems that Barbara Eden really let herself go, and she continues to talk about how quantum science is somehow related to her crazy New Age beliefs. It seems that Quark from DS9 had little money, and he also appears briefly in the film. There are many CGIs that should impress us; cells in the body are depicted in the form of dancing jelly forms, because the filmmakers have apparently seen Floubert too many times. <br /> <br /> People in the film say that the aravacs in San Salvador thought that the ship of Columbus Pinta was invisible because the natives had never seen the ships clippers before, as if people today had some possible way of knowing. Of course, they omit all this information and simply say: "The ships of Columbus were invisible to the Indians in America." The film makes a lot of such arrogant jumps. Around 1805, Thomas Young conducted an experiment with two slits and found that light can sometimes look like a particle, and sometimes a wave. Of course, you will never know about this stupid film, because the only mention of it is "atoms can be particles and waves." And this should mean that people can pass through walls, walk on water and never grow old if they just want to see a star !! Then I’m sure Marlee Mathlin would stop being deaf if she just * believed * hard enough. I'm sarcastic, but this film is filled with false hopes and beliefs that people who support them don't really believe. <br /> <br /> These are recruits who jumped at quantum theory, as if this confirms everything they believe in, about meditation, zero point energy, crystal healing, etc. If these snake oil vendors really believed shit that they were selling, could they not just “wish” their salary instead of appearing in this movie joke? We listen to another nameless person, without credentials known to us, talking on his sofa in front of the fireplace (or TV screen) about how he creates his own life. Every time he appeared on the screen, I wanted someone to break in and throw a pie in his face. These people take themselves too seriously. Another balding guy in a suit says that no one ever touches anything, because there is a magnetic force that prevents this at the quantum level. If only someone came out on the screen and continued to beat him in the stomach, shouting: “I do not touch you! I do not touch you! ”The moral relativist in the film asserts that in reality“ there is no such thing as good or bad. ” So, is it normal that Hitler gassed millions of Jews to death? Another person says that "love does not exist." It’s just a chemical, and we don’t really love people, we’re just addicted to the chemical hype we experience when we are around them. I suspect this guy is making this film as a public work due to heroin addiction for many years. <br /> <br /> We are witnessing a truly miserable episode when two young people walk around the wedding reception, seeing everything as Robocop. They evaluate whether women are cows, dogs or foxes, and a sexual stance jumps out on the scree. Marley Matlin gets drunk at the wedding, which she should take pictures, and the next day she decides to love herself and take a bath, because she is a beautiful and unique snowflake. <br /> <br /> I liked it when the film says that people often find evidence of their preconceived notions. Perhaps in this review I see only what I want to see, but I REALLY wanted these people to get cakes, but this did not happen. <br /> <br /> If you have never heard of any of the ideas presented in the film before, you may find them interesting, but there are better sources for all the ideas. If you want to watch a good film, which tells about the principle of uncertainty of Heisenberg, see "The Man, who was not there". If you want to read a good book on quantum field theory, read "Hyperspace" by Michio Kaku. If you want to watch a film that tells about different philosophies with original visual effects, see “The Awakening of Life” (although sometimes it may seem boring, important for yourself, and pretentious). In general, you should go and read “Quantum Psychology” or “The Rise of Prometheus” by Robert Anton Wilson, and not waste your time on this film. <br /> <br /> Usually it’s very difficult for me to give films a score from 1 to 10. But this one was very easy for me: 1/10 stars. <br /> <br /> The name of the film is true. People in this movie do not know # $ *! Hands down, the worst movie I've ever seen.
