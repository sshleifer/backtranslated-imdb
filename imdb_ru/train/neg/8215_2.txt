I really felt bad for the actors in this thing. Without a doubt, drama lessons in high school could have done better, or at least well. The actors must have thought that this would be their big chance to work in the film, it definitely wasn’t. Besides the terrible actions, the stories were boring and mostly predictable. The one about the remote control didn't even make any sense. Unfortunately, this one had the best premise in the group. <br /> <br /> I’m all for supporting low-budget films and providing equal opportunities for new directors, but this turkey is a waste of time and an insult to the viewer. I just watched it because of some nice comments posted here. They must have been imprisoned by people related to the film. You can deceive people by watching it, but you cannot deceive them into loving what they have seen. <br /> <br /> I gave him 2 instead of 1, because at least the story with the boxers was trying to warm my heart. Of course, it failed miserably, but tried. I reserve 1 second for the worst of the worst. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and skip this dribble. I would like to have.
