Well, I would be lying if I said that it could easily compete with the movies "Spiderman" or "Batman." However, it was more attractive to me, because it is a moral value. I first bought a VHS when my son was about 2 years old, and he immediately became his favorite. My wife and I are active supporters of Robert Townsend, and since then he has used credit cards to finance his first film, "Hollywood Shuffle." True, he needs to use the talents and knowledge of technical consultants to make films more believable, but his films are still funny. <br /> <br /> Meteor Man gives the hero a sense of urban modernity. I always felt that if there were superheroes, they would not have provided the same scenarios that are shown in the comics. “Meteor Man” is a realistic hero with real problems: a broken car, a poor neighborhood, local drug businesses that use children for distribution, etc. The scale of his mission largely remained in society. <br /> <br /> was recognized as really interesting, in addition to the fact that James Earl Jones spoke with the “young forever,” how the neighborhood reacted to his newly discovered abilities. Soon they had a full agenda for him, without his participation, of course. It was fun to hear them offering to lend it to other communities where their extended families lived. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot was weak, the film was predictable, it was a bad game, and the continuity was rotten, but it takes first place with my children. Robert Townsend works to bring films home, so to speak. I doubt that he will ever be truly recognized by the talented actor / producer / director he really is, but there are and always will be those who love him for his efforts. <br /> <br /> One moment to think about the film, which I find funny: throughout the battle with Simon, no one bothered to call the police ???? Also, what kind of mother and father do you know who will watch their son fighting from the window? My mom would be right there, breaking me from head to toe. Dad will charge his gun. LOL <br /> <br /> Rent and check. Worth watching at least once and good for those of you who are fans of Sinbad, Luther Vandross, Bill Cosby, Big Daddy Kane, etc. Great job with cameos, Robert!
