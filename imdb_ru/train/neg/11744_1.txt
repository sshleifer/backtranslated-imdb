After watching this movie in full, I am completely puzzled by the adoration he received from both critics and online users. Is this the worst western ever? No, I would not say that. But the "last great American western" phrase I used to apply to him more than once? Even close. <br /> <br /> The film, which is trying to tell such a story, needs believable characters that are plausible, and the dialogue in this film is one of the most beaten and clich√© I've ever seen. The film can be measured in moans per minute; for example, how many times does an actor or actress force a script to say something that no person would say in real life? There are so many examples of this that it is distracting. Cheese lines are coming in waves; predictable, unoriginal and often. <br /> <br /> If a bad dialogue doesn't bother you, then how about a bad shootout? Few westerns can show you that this is just incredible, but at the same time they are desperately trying to get you to take action seriously. It's okay if there are comic advantages in such a shootout, for example, in Silverado, but in Tombstone a very staged and very tough choreography of early shootings is another reason to exclude this film from the list of good westerns. The final fight to some extent redeems the director in this regard, but by that time I was not so interested in the film that he was apart from salvation. <br /> <br /> In addition to these flaws, I can say that the visual effects are stunning - the film is well made and all the settings look great. The action is tolerable, especially considering which actors were given to work. However, if you are looking for the last great American Western, do yourself a favor - hire Unforgiven instead. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10
