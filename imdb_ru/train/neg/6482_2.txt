Disney has yet to meet with a film about which he could not have made at least two sequels. And this one was no exception for people in Disney to give a weak story to get a quick reward. For some reason, although I did not pay for viewing, I feel dejected watching this. <br /> <br /> Ariel has already grown and she has a daughter. While not allowing her daughter to go to sea because of some idle threat from the sister of the dead sea witch. So we go again. <br /> <br /> The daughter is deceived (of course) and helps the sea witch. After a not so glorious battle, she was defeated, and mermaids and people live in harmony. Yawn. <br /> <br /> Nothing to see here. Get back to your life. "D-"
