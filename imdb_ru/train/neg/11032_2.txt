“I love New York” is another VH-1 (MTV Networks) recording that shows the entertaining side of exploring a shrill, unpleasant woman. It must have been a simple decision — to take the wildest, ebony-speaking, most insane rival — and her mother — and show them the shows on this network. Many will argue, "this show." True, this is not as bad as in the previous show "Flavor of Love", but it is just as bad. <br /> <br /> This reminds me of a parody of the 90's "In Living Color" show, where Keenan Ivory Wayans imitated boxer Mike Tyson on the "Love Connection" dating show and chose "Robin Givens" to meet. Mike said that the date was normal, but how the disgusting mother continued to interfere. This show reminds me of that. <br /> <br /> Men are chosen and given names to humiliate themselves and the woman with whom they meet. more - (I think an intelligent man who is dating a smart woman will NOT allow her - and her mother - to give you a name that is so ghetto that you will embarrass yourself every time you appear on television.) But these are professional actors reality, so why bother. <br /> <br /> It eludes me to discover what is so interesting in all this. Is that as false as its newly implanted supplement? 15 minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars of advertising time for the network? (Well, you can't hate them for trying to make money.) Is it any wonder who wants to be with this woman in an hour? Or I wonder if the next show with the mother will be on WWF! Anyway, this is a train wreck that you have seen countless times before, so by now the value of shock has dropped to zero. <br /> <br /> No turns and turns will make this train more interesting, or different from any other. Appeals to the lowest common denominator and for those who call the “end” of a reality show, this is just another nail in the coffin to see why they should end immediately.
