<br /> <br /> Like this movie got a 6-star average score, I canâ€™t do it. The script is so banal and, frankly, an insult to those on whom it is based. Cinematography comes straight from the slippery world of advertising, and the talented Ridley Scott should be ashamed. Demi Moore, however, is not surprised to participate in this film, if you look at her tracklist. In general, the film in the style of "high concept", for which even Don Simpson would be ashamed.
