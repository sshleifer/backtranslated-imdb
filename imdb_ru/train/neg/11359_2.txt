While 3D animation (the highlight of the show) has worked well, most of the other elements did not work. The filmmakers thought: “Well, it will be 3D, so we don’t need to work so much on the plot or character development.” And the fact that this is a children's film is absolutely not justified. The public is attracted to three-dimensional characters (Shrek, Papa Nemo) as well as three-dimensional graphics. The only dimension that any of the main characters showed was the two-dimensional Scooter, which turns the plot from time to time, forcing them to eat everything in sight. <br /> <br /> And the absolute kicker? The appearance of Buzz Aldrin at the very end (after viewing a very robotic animated version of the same historical figure for an hour and a half) appears on the screen and destroys the good time everyone calls the main characters of the film “polluters” and announces that really impossible. <br /> <br /> ??? !!! ??? Did you just want to tell the children that the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus don't exist while you're there?
