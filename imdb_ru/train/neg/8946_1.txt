I think the shots and the lighting were very bad. When I first looked at it, I thought it was the old version (1956). When I really found out the real year of the film, I was shocked. I didnâ€™t know what could be such a bad film made quite recently. This is really all I wanted to say. This film had a good plot, but you could not miss anything if you just read the novel written by George Orwell. All I really want to say has already been said, except for this: I cannot believe that this film could receive so many awards and nominations. I gave this movie One (terrible) because I felt that it was a very bad thing. Well that's all. Until
