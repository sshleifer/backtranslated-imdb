This film is a traditional Bollywood fare, as it has the power of a star, sentimentality and a love triangle of emotions. What really bothered me about this film was the absurd idea of ​​the creators of the surrogate mother. A whore who conceives a child with someone after having sex with a man (from a family that wants a child) is not a surrogate mother. She is also not a good candidate for the role of a surrogate mother. I saw Indian films and TV shows that were made 10-15 years ago that dealt with this problem more intelligently. The whole concept of the film is ridiculous and absolutely implausible. I understand that most Bollywood films should not be believable, but they also do not claim to be so. This film wants us to play with the characters, but this cannot be done with such a ridiculous, contrived conflict. I would have expected better from Abbas and Mustan.
