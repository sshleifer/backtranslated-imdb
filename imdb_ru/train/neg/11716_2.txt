After watching this, I thought that there were too few good writers and directors, or a lot of producers. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a terrible movie. It's terrible, because it's not fun, but rather makes you grit your teeth and tremble. Makes you scream "it's wrong" in the film. Immersion is zero. By now, most of you are probably accustomed to terrible mistakes / oddities in films that have computer hackers, etc. This film is like that in all aspects. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the film is the little girl Emily, brilliantly played by Eliza Bennett. I hope that she will become big and make it ... something at least something worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Don't watch it. There is not even the right action. A complete waste of time.
