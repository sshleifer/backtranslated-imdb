It should be one of those films where the trailer is 50 times better than the movie itself. I first saw the trailer in 1991, it looked great. Since then, I have always wanted to see it, but I could never find it ... ... until today, yes, 14 years later. <br /> <br /> Let's just say, I was very disappointed with his unreal, well, I knew that it would not be the winner of the Oscars, but still hoped that it would be fun brainless film in a bloody mold. Unfortunately, this was not the case, it is Pooh. <br /> <br /> That with all of American rock and roll music, and acting was so bad that it was pretty intimidating. <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes were rubbish and fake eyes. <br /> <br /> This DVD cost me only £ 5, and I think I was over £ 7 <br /> <br /> Now I’m sad because I know that I’ll never get this hour and a half ago.
