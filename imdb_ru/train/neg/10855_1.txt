This is definitely one comedy that I hardly forget for a while. <br /> << should be presented as it is. <br /> <br /> So what then? Well, of course, this is not exactly a comedy; instead, it is intended as a horror flick - “intended” very, being the key word here. The script is an absolutely incoherent and unbalanced mess, special effects are only special in that they are especially pretentious, and as for acting, let's just say that if it was my graduation game in elementary school, my teachers would burst into tears about our talent. <br /> <br /> Of course, I understand that this is a film with a very low budget and that in such cases it is necessary to lower expectations, of course, in relation to such things as special effects. In addition, despite the fact that I am a big fan of the horror genre, I know that rarely one can find interesting scenarios and first-class play in these films. <br /> <br /> But still. /> <br /> In B-films there are often features that can compensate for a lack of funding, for example, humor. Cradle to Fear's only laugh is ridiculous performances. If you can find humor in this — and I could, within the first 20 minutes or so — gradually doze off after this — then this will be the only thing the film has to offer. Oh, these are two or three pairs of breasts. <br /> <br /> Woohoo, how exciting. <br /> <br /> With regard to history, the point is not even that she is not trying to convey anything: the victims either use drugs and / or engage in serious crimes. Lesson: Beware, naughty boys and girls, because one day you will be forced to pay for what you have done. <br /> <br /> I quit my business. <br /> <br /> In general, a little sex, a fair amount of drugs, but absolutely zero rock and roll. <br /> <br /> I rate this figure as 1 out of 10, but if I could, I would get 0., Or maybe I wouldn't: it deserves 1 for correctly spelling the names of the actors in the titles. I mean, this is something, right?
