I found the film offensive to Americans who lost someone in the towers to Americans in general. Pretending to pay tribute to the terrible facts that have happened in recent years, each director takes the opportunity to polemize with the old facts (which have nothing to do with the terrorist attack), or criticize the political behavior of Americans, or compare other political situations with their own Country, not having this has nothing to do or sharing with the atrocities of September 11th. Shame on them.
