I love low-budget independent films and have high hopes for this. But this film is static. Never mind the production value, which is very noble for its budget, but the step is deadly. Admittedly, these people accomplish much with little, but the film fails at the most fundamental level. It's boring. Editing glacial and kiosk placement. It should have been 65 minutes. The best thing about Dr. Jekyll is Mr. Hyde, who has not been seen enough. He had the most dramatic potential. Instead, we have to suffer from the stuttering of the Baltimore-British from endless and exhausting exposure. It looks like a reclusive video scene. <br /> <br /> The noble efforts of all the producers, but the story, tired from fatigue, needed to hit the pants, and the new fanatical low-cost technology had to give it a fresh voice. Instead, it's just a lame recovery.
