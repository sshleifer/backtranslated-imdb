I usually like zombie movies, but this one was just awful. <br /> <br /> Good side: a girl, floating topless with bottoms on thongs, topless Sonya Salomaa and Ona Grauer tits, swaying in a lean top when she ran. <br /> <br /> The bad part: too many videos, too much slow-motion playback of the Matrix (delays the action), not enough blood and courage, bad games and no story. The only person in the theater was smart and left immediately after the topless swimming scene. Total spending 6 dollars and time. I give it 2 out of 10.
