In theory, films should be a form of entertainment. Although this excludes documentaries and other experimental forms of filmmaking; Most films, especially genres, should not only tell a story or a message, but also entertain the target audience. All this is just to say that, in my opinion, a bad film is not a film with a low production cost or low budget, but a bad film is boring. <br /> <br /> “Hellish child” or “Asylum Damned”, as it is known in the USA, is a bad film simply because it simply does not involve, and is irrevocably boring and tedious. Although it has a very good premise, it just poorly developed, and a mediocre game does not make things better. On the other hand, the film could probably be a good or even a classic B-film, but here it’s just an unsuccessful attempt to make a film. <br /> <br /> Director Philip Jones tells the story of James Bishop (Matt Stasi), a young psychiatrist who has just received works his dream in St. Andrew’s psychiatric hospital, but the old shelter seems to hide a secret.After the mysterious death of some patients and the constant rumors about satanic practices, James decides to find out what is happening, only to find the incredulity of his boss, Dr. McCort (Bruce Payne), who He believes that the bishop is going crazy just like his patients. <br /> <br /> Although the package is rather interesting, the film’s performance leaves a lot to be desired. In an attempt to make a supernatural psychological thriller, Jones follows an easy path and makes a film filled with every cliche of the genre. Of course, there are a lot of great movies that are also cliché-filled; but in Hellbourne everyone is wasted and turns into a cheap jumping panic to get things moving, which leads to a boring and predictable storyline. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the action is rather mediocre, with one big exception: Bruce Payne gives a first-class presentation that makes the film look unworthy of such a good game. Matt Stasi is very weak as the main character and the rest of the cast make unforgettable performances. <br /> <br /> Despite all these shortcomings, you need to write one thing about Hellborn; It looks visually very good for the budget and is very similar to Hollywod’s modern high-budget horror production. In addition, makeup and prosthetics are very well done, and the projects for the main antagonist are pretty good. Unfortunately, the rest of the special effects are terrible and outdated, creating a huge contrast with makeup and prosthetics. <br /> <br /> “Hellbourne” is a film in which there are several good things that outperform it in serious flaws: terrible results. Fans of horror horror or b-films may be interested in his premise, but this is a boring and tedious experience. 3/10
