This film is not as good as all the Christ films I've ever seen. And I am very surprised that in this story Pilate wants to end Jesus when the Scripture (as in other films) says otherwise. It also lacks a very important question: the Resurrection. None of the other films misses this very important part: the faith of all of us Christians lies precisely in this event. As Paul says in one of his letters: “If Christ has not risen from the dead, our faith is vain.” In this film, for me, a very impressive scene was to see the remains of palm trees on the streets, which were used when Jesus entered Jerusalem. <br /> <br /> Finally, in contrast to my Jewish commentator, Jesus was not a myth. And in fact, he was also a Jew. There are many documents (religious and secular) that confirm the existence of this unusual person (or, I would say, God became a man), which really changed humanity. I strongly advise him (considering that he is a historian) to read about Flavia Joseph, the most brilliant Jewish commentator of the 1st. Century.
