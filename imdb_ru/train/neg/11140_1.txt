I thought I was going to watch a scary movie ... and ended up laughing the whole movie. In the scene where the man turned into a werewolf, I thought they were joking. Today's computer games have ten times better animation. Low budget is a suitable comment. I would recommend Wolf (1994) with Jack Nicholson for a good werewolf movie. He has good special effects, as it should be (a person turns into a werewolf). If you do not want to laugh, I would not recommend you to watch this movie. This movie is a joke.
