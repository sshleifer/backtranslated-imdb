In the months leading up to the release of this film, you saw how it was advertised in all types of print media, so I waited patiently for it to see what kind of advertisement it was. After it was all over, I had to apologize to my roommate for taking up the video recorder for the last hour and a half to watch such a terrible movie. In fact, it fails, because it is a movie based on characters about non-redeemable characters. With the possible exception of Amanda Pete (whose only redeemed quality is Amanda Pete), you cannot tolerate any of them. The film is based on dialogue, which is sofomorian, moronic and rude. The only slightly funny character is Eric, whose image of the only married member of a group of friends is dead. The final twist, designed to make you laugh at the three main characters, only instead causes the same resentment against Pete. In general, rent only if you are desperate or have a dark sense of humor.
