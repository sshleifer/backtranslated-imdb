Despite the lush performance and beautiful costumes, this film is a routine to watch. The story of the murder riddle is just a means of setting up musical numbers, but it often stops the process, except that it is not very attractive. Although it is obvious that a lot of money was spent on them, the numbers are poorly set and poorly photographed. This is obviously the preliminary code of the film, because girls often wear very little clothes, and even have a song singing praises to marijuana! All performances in one note, although it's nice to see Karl Brisson in the musical, but when Victor McLaughlin, as a police lieutenant, is once again striking the hunt for clues, you can add a towel or the least fast forward to the next number. Sorry for the patrons who were trapped in the movie theater when it was released, though!
