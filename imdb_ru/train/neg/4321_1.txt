It was the worst Christmas movie I've ever seen. I took my two small children to see it. It was the darkest, darkest plot - the family has no money, the mother loses her job, the father is killed in the bank, the bank robber steals the family car with both children from behind and chases at high speed, leaves the bridge and drowns them in the river. Mom was left completely alone. No wonder her Christmas spirit has disappeared. Christmas angels do not save drowned children, and Santa does not return dead fathers! I thought it was the worst message to send children. It is better to tell them that there is no Santa Claus than to show them such a movie !!
