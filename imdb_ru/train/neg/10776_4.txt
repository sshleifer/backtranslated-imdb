When my wife and I decided to watch this film, we thought that it would not let us down. I love Billy Crystal, my wife loves Julia Roberts, and everyone we talked to said they liked it. <br /> <br /> We were misled, in the peaks. <br /> <br /> For my part, I felt that the Billy Crystal Character was extremely one-dimensional and did very little for the film. Of course, he hacked a couple of good jokes, but as a character he didnâ€™t do anything but take up space. <br /> <br /> And poor Julia Roberts. In past shows, she played well as a strong-willed, self-determined lady. In this film, she seems completely depressed and had very little fire. This is not Julia Roberts, who loves to watch my wife. <br /> <br /> Well, if I had found something good, it would be Christopher Walken. Now it's fun. But, like Billy Crystal, hardly anything is manifested in his character. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a night of meaningless laughter with a very small redemption value, look at it. But if you're looking for a smart, romantic comedy, this is not your movie. This is none of the above.
