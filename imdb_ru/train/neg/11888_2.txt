To make any film about the supposed end of the world, there must be some facts and realism. 1. We are never told why these people believe in it. 2. Place New Year's Eve in Toronto, Canada. PLEASE, PLEASE SOME TELL ME, WHY AFTER THIS IS FULLY AND WHY (based on the costumes) IT WATCHED SEPTEMBER <br /> <br /> 3. The acting was in that neo-natural style that required a director who knew , how to do it. <br /> <br /> 4. Separate scenes were dreary and useless. I could go on, but I don't want to make it as boring as a movie. <br /> <br /> score * 1/2 (out of 4) 2 on the IMDB scale <br /> <br /> thanks I, as always, <br /> <br /> JAY HARRIS (aka) SIRBOSSMAN
