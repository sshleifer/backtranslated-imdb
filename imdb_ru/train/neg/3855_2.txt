The only redemption was a small part of Larry Miller. It seemed that the film was trying too hard to be “Something about Mary,” but I didn’t even like the film, and it still didn’t meet these standards. The actor who plays Paula was great, but Selma Blair was stuck in the stupidity of her “Cruel Intentions” character. James Brolin was great, but Paul’s father seemed to be trying too hard to be Randy Quaid’s character from the Holidays in National Lamp movie.
