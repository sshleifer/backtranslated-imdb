Wow, what a snooker. Definitely one of the worst bacon movies. Bad behavior combined with a formulaic, if not unbelievable, scenario makes me yearn for the time I wasted watching this on cable television. In fact, I can say little about this: a basketball scout is too attached to the person he recruits, who, as it turned out, belongs to a tribe that is on the brink of war, and this is determined (spoiler) by a basketball game. Rating: F +
