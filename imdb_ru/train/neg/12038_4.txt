Does anything at all happen in this movie? There are only weird short scenes where I didn’t know what the hell was going on, so this doesn’t count. This film is sooo boring, it hurts, and it's from a person who likes it when making films about making films. Confused? Well, I was after watching this shit. What was Donald Sutherland on because he missed it with it completely. And what about the "pedophilic" scene at the beginning of the film. You can put anyone to sleep! 4/10
