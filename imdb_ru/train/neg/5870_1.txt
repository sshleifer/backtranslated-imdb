I didn’t like this movie at all! First of all, I don’t know why, but everyone here says that the game of Clamens Poezi is excellent, which, in my opinion, is absolutely wrong! She does not look like Natasha: another appearance, another character ... Worse, she is a very inexperienced actress, and therefore she could not play this role! She disfigured the heroine completely! It was really disgusting to watch her play! In my opinion, it would be much better to give this role to the Russian actress, because it would be much easier for her to understand the Russian soul for the Russian person. Unfortunately, Kutuzov looked like a drunken man who had not shaved for 2 weeks and won the battle in which he lost his eye ... (Thank God, there are some actors in this film whose game was amazing! I think that Alessio Bony did a great job with my task! I was pleasantly surprised! He is one of the few who read the book, which is very important for the performance. In addition, I liked the plays of our Russian actors, it was really wonderful to watch them)) The only thing I liked about this work It is very beautiful views and stunning These dresses! My advice is to read the book and understand the real meaning, the goal with which Leo Tolstoy wrote this masterpiece, and, perhaps, bring the whole idea of ​​the book to life ... 1 of 10
