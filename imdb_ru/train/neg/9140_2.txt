Ugh - I don't know what to say. This is a movie that can be very good with a bunch of awesome viewers. Some of those in action reminded me of John Waters ’early proposals. Maybe I should take it back - I don't want to insult Waters' abilities as a director / narrator. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the attorney accepting the proposal of “complete faith and authority.” By the way, this is “complete faith and merit”! <br /> <br /> This also reminds me of “Conrad boys”, where the main actor is also a writer, director, film editor, etc. Multi-dimensional undertakings, such as this, are probably best left to very experienced filmmakers who will have the technical ability (although some may say a trick) to do something like this.
