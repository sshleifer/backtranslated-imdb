The fact that I watched this whole movie speaks about it ... or about me. This is not a good movie. Awful really. But terrible is what kept my attention in such a perverted manner, akin to watching the tragedy and the inability to look away. That would make a great theme for MST3K! <br /> <br /> Here you can find a lot of things that make a terrible movie enjoyable: bad dialogue, inappropriate music, artificial plot sequences, absurd pseudoscience. You will be delighted with the immortal episodes of death: the poor victims with their lips in agape and vaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa for too long to contemplate their impending death, face to face with the outrageously contrived redeemer of their deaths. Your heart will warm old militant clichés, for example, when two women fight for a gun, and it fires, but WHO DRAWN? Both look at themselves, then at the other, then at themselves, then (seemingly after 15 minutes) one, finally, descends. You will sing along (of course, in Latin) street carols, which turn into a chorus of terrible death, which for an instant threatened to turn the film into a distorted musical. <br /> <br /> So if you Believe me how I do it, as the films get worse, they get better, then this may be a worthy choice for you. It's not as funny as my current favorite sci-fi slok “They Live” with Ruddy Roddy Piper, but it's more fun to watch than such warm films as Omen II or III. <br /> <br /> I give it. 4 out of 10
