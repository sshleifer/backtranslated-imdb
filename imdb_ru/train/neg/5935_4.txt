The saddest thing about this “tribute” is that almost all the singers (including the incredibly talented Nick Cave) seem to have missed all the meaning in which Cohen’s intensity lies: conveying his lines in almost silent balance, Cohen conveys the full extent of his poetry, his irony, his all-round humanity, laughter and tears in one. <br /> <br /> To see how some of these singer upstarts make entangled sufferers launch their pitiful squeals in an obvious attempt to shout “I am a singer!” is a real pain. It’s the same feeling that many of you probably listened to some terrible operatic versions of simple songs, such as Lennon's “Imagine.” Nothing, just nothing comes close to the simplicity and directness of the original. If there is an art form that does not need decorations, this is Cohen's art. the street in the form of tasteless cosmetics for sale for sale . <br /> <br /> In this tribute to Cohen, I feel myself suffering and suffering because of pitiful tributes and terrible reinterpretations, they all lack the master’s original irony and, frankly, several of these singers sounded like they were recruited at some talent show asylum. Cohen makes them pay homage by allowing them to sing his materials, though not the other way around: they could be friends or a daughter, he could become very tender and in the mood for a gift. It is a pity that this is not left in the family. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, but only at the very end, Cohen himself performed his magnificent “Tower of Songs”, but even this flower was spoiled by a completely inappropriate background. from U2, they all carry the expression of bored children when they visit their poor grandfather in a nursing home. <br /> <br /> A truly sad sight, and sadder if you really love Cohen, like me.
