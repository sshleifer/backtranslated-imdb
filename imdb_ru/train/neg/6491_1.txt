This film was a waste of time. <br /> <br /> I watched this film with a group of cinematographic enthusiasts who have different tastes in films, but always closely follow the work of the “genius” (as one of my fellow commentators on this site had the opportunity to label this steaming pile ??); not one of them found a single redemptive quality. We finished the film with an incendiary chorus, I will not reprint here. <br /> <br /> I can only guess that the positive feedback presented here was written by Sir Anthony Hopkins himself. In the end, as one of those reviewers would say, did he finance the movie himself ?? because no one in Hollywood or anywhere else in the world, for that matter, would risk a dime or their good name in connection with this film. Do not let the half-famous actors involved in the film lure you in a vise ?? as Christian Slater admits in the special films “The Creation”, he subscribed to the film without reading the script and without knowing any details (stupidity, I am sure, it will never happen again). <br /> <br /> I’m sorry for an unhappy person who is faced with this swamp of self-indulgence, written, directed, produced and funded by a person who is too famous to admit that not everything he creates is a masterpiece (and, if you don't believe me, please google, Anthony Hopkins "And Art".
