There is a reason why some films go straight to the video, and, of course, the obvious reason is that if it’s too naughty for a theater audience, then it’s released directly to the video. Of course, that would be unfair to movies that are good, and yet they also go straight to the video. This is no exception, although the film has good actors or at least actors with potential: Amy Adams (Oscar nominee and talented actress), Robin Dunn, who deserves the best or at least the best agent, and Sarah Thompson that deserves a role that breaks away from teen melodramas. The film is also distorted: this film takes place before cruel intentions, therefore this film is actually a prequel and rather silly. It was a waste and it was really a film that is on the same level as a soft core of porn and pay per view masturbation movies. Fortunately for the actors, I hope they can erase this from their resumes. So if you want to see something naughty, but you don’t have the courage to buy porn then shoot this movie as a starter.
