When I looked at this year's Wrestlemania match card, I was REAL and unable to control myself because I was full of excitement. <br /> <br /> It starts ... and ends. <br /> <br /> I sit there, angry to hell because of how much I wanted to get my money back. I mean, you watch Wrestlemania 22 (one of my favorites), which will become classic, and then you expect the same and get the average trash they have from time to time. One moment in the whole show that ruined it for me was when HBK left the game !!!! At the very moment when KhBK lost to JOHN HAYNE !!!!!!!!!! John Cena is such a loser / problemmaker. It almost destroyed Wrestlemania 22 for me when he won TRIPLE H! I could not watch WWE after seeing Wrestlemania 23. I begin to watch it again (fortunately). I believe in WWE again after Wrestlemania 24 (the greatest I have ever seen), which was a purely classic Wrestlemania. This definitely compensated Mania 23 and presented us with many unforgettable moments. <br /> <br /> If before you watched ANY of Wrestlemania, for example, those who turn you into fans (Wrestlmania 20 turned into me into a fan), PLEASE do not watch it and make the same mistake that I made, and leave WWE behind. And if you REALLY watch this and get angry, start looking again and watch Wrestlemania 24, itâ€™s absolutely classic.
