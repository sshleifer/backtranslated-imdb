Cowardly, cowardly film. Directed by Burman shows Cahil, robbing rich houses, but the man is shown that he changes the nanny, and then everything is in order. A medical examiner investigating Cahill was blown up in his car, but he has a rat face and he doesn't look like a good person, so this is also good. Bates, the owner of Russborrough House, earned money using "dark" diamond mining, so you can rob valuable art from them and hide it in a bunker in the Wicklow Mountains. Garda kills his ferrets and is involved in his murder. The moral equivalent is disgusting, Burman is looking for a hit film, but he does not have the courage to confront the crime of the general gang, which terrorized the neighborhood and brought another wave of scum to Dublin. He even contacted the son of the generals, doing this. Disgusting. Shame on him for his cowardice.
