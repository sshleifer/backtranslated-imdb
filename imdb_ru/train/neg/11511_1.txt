I was lucky to see this film on display in the United States. Reluctantly having gone through all the terrible, I am shocked to see so many good reviews on IMDB here. <br /> <br /> The original film was turkey, but interesting. It fit into those early seventies, after the 1969 revolution; this film just stinks of ......., nothing special. This is so bad. <br /> <br /> Imagine a poorly made perfume advertisement - do you understand what I mean? <br /> <br /> Madonna could never act, and for many years she was embarrassed on the big screen. With each of these years, it looks worse and worse, and more and more resembles meerkats with leather edges. <br /> <br /> Guy Ritchie, who created his “reputation” on Lock-stock, also could never become a director - his films are small, badly cut, fashion shows. He does not disappoint here; he wisely called his wife the star of this disaster. <br /> <br /> Please disregard the good feedback this film has received from other posters below. Obviously, they are a business. <br /> <br /> Do not encourage Richie to humiliate himself even more by giving him money. <br /> <br />
