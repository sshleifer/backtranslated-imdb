Truly a truly terrible co-production between Canada and Germany, the wonderful Rosanna Arquette plays an actress whose teenage daughter redefines the term “problematic child” - several years before the “action” when the child killed her father and her mother took over the fall for posterity. Now she has moved to the northwest United States to start all over again, but her child still has a problem in that she is devoted to her mother. So devoted to the cause that it kills anyone who can be seen as a threat to their connection. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mandy Scheffer (like a daughter) kills more people — she does such a terrible job that she also wipes in the film, although an incoherent script, useless guidance and terrible music (check out the saxophone when she first shows her body in a bikini), will not help anything; we must find her sexy and terrible, but she fails in both cases. Almost completely unassuming and not even bad enough to be funny (not to mention that Arquette and Schaeffer are not really convincing as mother and daughter), all the condolences of Miss Arquette and Jürgen Prokhnov, both of which deserve much more that, and both of them (especially Roseanna) are the only reasonable reasons that anyone can get through this farrago. <br /> <br /> One of the production companies is called Quality International Films - not after a three-hour “Love”. “Lying and killing” (of two short performances) was such a loan “You must be joking.”
