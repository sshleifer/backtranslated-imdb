I was lucky to spend as much as 102 minutes, which, in my opinion, is this shockingly bad movie. It fails largely at all levels; the cast is terrible, the acting is at best, and the plot lacks depth, which makes me feel very apathetic to the outcome of any of the intricate plot lines. <br /> <br /> In terms of B, there is nothing charming in this genre there is an area to convey, and I found myself physically cringing at various points where the script makes its regular misqualified gyrus somewhere to the comedy area. <br /> <br /> A bona fide saccharine-coated poop of a film.
