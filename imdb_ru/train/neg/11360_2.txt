So, someone somewhere a few years ago thought that it would be nice to make an IMAX 3D movie about some flies hiding on board the Apollo 11 and going to the Moon. So they did. Someone was an idiot somewhere. <br /> <br /> I want to give artists a prop to do their homework on hardware. As far as I can tell, the missiles and launch equipment were hit. The graphics as a whole were pretty good - the launch of the rocket made me chills, as always happens with a good launch of the rocket (my blood on the gearbox of the Popular Mechanics flying machine is still strong), and the 3D was quite effective. CG was not Pixar-quality, but overall it was good. Flies were a kind of mediocre anthropomorphic, with some unfinished characters from the late 60s added for color (hippies, African-American flies with giant black and black shades, etc.), And the larvae were more like larvae with human baby heads (although they made suitable rude sounds of repression). <br /> <br /> The scriptwriters, of course, did not do their homework, relying on offensive and outdated clich√©s (gender policies of the 60s, including mostly useless female characters, racial stereotypes, evil Russians, fat a fly that only wants to eat, a level of humor in level 2. In the IMAX film, they used a great opportunity to penetrate into some educational materials about physics and space travel - they did not understand their physics correctly (zero g in the lunar module during landing PLEASE. They could not even bother to read the original transcripts of radio programs between Houston and the astronauts, all of which are freely available; instead, they wrote their own dialogue that sounds like crap. <br /> <br /> But we liked the larvae. <br /> <br /> Thus, they get one and a half points for rockets and maggots. Oooooooh 1.5 / 5.
