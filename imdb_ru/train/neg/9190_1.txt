This is the worst movie I've ever watched. I saw some pretty awful movies in my time, but this one shoots a cake, no, wait, I mean all this damn bakery. It is so bad that I believe that the word describing what you will feel after watching this atrocity has not yet been created. Please do yourself a favor if you ever want to see it and see thirty minutes of this annoying purple dinosaur Barney, multiply it thirty times, and you still get only a small fraction of the horror that would be in reserve. To summarize, I think you can really call it a horror movie, but only if you are ready to be scared of senseless worst actions in business and a completely meaningless story. <br /> <br /> Real rating, -10 disgusting
