<br /> <br /> Although the main actress is stunningly beautiful, the plot is unlikely to be accepted, because too many distracting details collide with the audience during the unfolding of the story. <br /> <br /> One can believe that teenage girls from the middle class in the 1950s easily gave up their virginity without thinking about marriage with 30-year-olds, whom they barely know, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> Someone may believe that young high school teenagers are very confident and self-confident as they interact with their elders in difficult social situations, but my experience shows that teenagers most often feel embarrassing and behaving awkwardly, experimenting in the adult world. <br /> <br /> Someone may believe that an experienced doctor would not know the pungent smell of stropomycin — the stinking, wandering by-product of busy earthly microbes — and would not have discovered that some kind of lifeless soft powder is fake, but I think what not. br /> <br /> One can believe that 30-year-old troublemakers can enter the public school hall and spend time inside during a school meeting and create problems, but I think that school social activities are traditionally protected environment, and parents, caps and school personnel will be there to prevent this. <br /> <br /> One last thing, during the entire “Hey, Babu Riba”, five teenage friends called themselves the Four. There is probably an explanation as to why FIVE were FOURTHS, but since it was never detailed, each link distracts from each scene. <br /> <br /> This film did not seem believable to me.
