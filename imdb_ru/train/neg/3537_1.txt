Convinced the world that it does not exist ... <br /> <br /> This line is probably remembered by many people. This is from “Ordinary suspects”, of course, in relation to “Kaiser Gold”. I mean Sose. <br /> <br /> I have another such: - The stupidest trick the director ever used is to convince the audience that he really had a storyline - <br /> <br This film is one of the saddest things I've seen in a long time. It all starts so well, with really fantastic cinematography, great acting, and a very clever premise. But, alas, this film moves only along the path of self-destruction. And it does not do it with one blow, but with small cuts on the wrists. <br /> <br /> Ignore the comments, which are amazing because they found a way to explain this donut. With enough booze in my brain, I probably would have been able to explain the very existence of humanity to a very believable degree. I have seen and read about a dozen completely different ways that people explained the story. And they range from a plot that resides entirely in a game of chess with himself, to a cunning way in which a criminal can play his enemies with a game that resembles chess. <br /> <br /> And this is all great. But at the same time, this is a painful sale of the fact that something is terribly wrong with this story. And besides, it is in any case stupid ripping off a multitude of films and books, such as Fight Club, Kill Bill, Casino, Ordinary Suspects, Trick, Magnolia, and Shakhnovel. And here we are not dealing with good borrowing. This is a clear robbery. <br /> <br /> In this film, ultimately, something goes wrong: the storyline revolves like a drunken ass at speed. If this film were a rollercoaster ride, you would hit the attraction next to it shortly after takeoff. There are so many turns in this film that will never be resolved, that if it was a cocktail, you would need a vital supply of throws from nausea after drinking Nothing is explained, and when you finally understand the direction in which, in your opinion, it moves, one more thing delays you. <br /> <br /> I think this story is nowhere on paper and Richie Must have thought that it would be great to make a film out of it, be it the next David Lynch or something like that. <br /> <br /> 1/10 f or completely disrupt your own work (Richie: seek professional help). What could easily become a gem, instead, becomes an artificial work of art, food for pseudo-intellectuals, with whom you can argue in discussion clubs on Sunday evening. <br /> <br /> Spare the soul and stomach, avoid at all costs!
