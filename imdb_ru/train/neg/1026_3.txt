Wow. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a movie with so many great actors who have had such a pivotal role, so mistaken. Justin Timberlake is probably the only worst actor who played a big role in a movie with star power and money, behind which Edison stands. <br /> <br /> His acting was unbearable to watch. The story was fine, and all the other characters were played by professional actors, hell, even LL Cool J was fine, since he had a lot of small details to cut himself. As the director and film company decided that Timberlake is ready for this role, it is impossible to understand. <br /> <br /> His character destroys the whole experience, because every time he appears on the screen, you actually support the corrupt cops. to close his pathetic ass, and he must be a hero ... I would not spend money on it in the theater or on video. MAYBE if you have HBO and you HAVE NOTHING to do ANYTHING at 2 am on Saturday evening, and you are drunk and stoned, this can be normal. <br /> <br /> Watching Timberlake in this role was the same as watching a Kermit the Frog man in a Hollywood blockbuster simply did not work.
