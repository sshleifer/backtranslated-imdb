Gosh, MooCow reluctantly admits the truth: I like this cheap lousy parody of the 70s. The idea that huge hordes of killer tomatoes are destroying the United States is a great idea, and despite this, the movie really gives a decent chuckle, a grim look of frightened extras running away from large, apparently fake tomatoes. This film, along with the film Kentucky Freed Movie, is one of the earliest attempts at counterfeiting, which became so popular in the 80s and 90s, thanks in large part to The Plane. This one, like scammers, is pretty poor. Many attempts at humor are dismal failures and cause many groans. But thanks to the predatory tomato hordes, the disgusting song "Puberty Love" and the stunning scene of the helicopter crash, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes does provide some products, albeit mostly for the wrong reasons. Oh, sooooo much bad in this movie ... and so right, it's hard to explain. Probably, many people also liked it when Tomatoes returned in two films by Moore and in the animated series !! Large chunks of time spent away from tomatoes are pretty boring. And dig up the clothes of the 70s, dude !! ; = 8) This tomato is shabby and cheesy, but worth a chuckle or two; MooCow says, take a pizza and put in tomatoes !! : ??
