I start this review with a big giant spoiler for this movie. Do not read further ... here it is, look away! The main character, a girl who always survives in other slasher films, is killed here. There I just saved you 79 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> This is one of those cheap movies that were made in the midst of the horrible 80s era. Despite the murder of the heroine, it is just poor-quality garbage. <br /> <br /> Both priests and college students get a bad reputation here. They are portrayed unnecessarily by sociopathic psychopaths who have too many internal problems to cope with what looks like life on campus ... and the students are even worse. <br /> <br /> “Spray University” just insert your VCR when you have nothing to do, although I advise you to watch the tape for cleaning the head, it would be more exciting. <br /> <br /> This is a rating (R) for severe physical abuse, bloody, profanity, very short nudity and sexual references. <br /> <br />
