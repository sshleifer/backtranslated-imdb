The title song for this film ............ is the best ballad ever written by inspired ballads! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <br /> <br /> I first saw this film in 1978-79, when I first subscribed to a telegram. In 1979, the cable just began to become commonplace in homes. (or at least when it became commonplace here in Missouri). <br /> <br /> Quite possibly, this was the first film I ever watched on a paid channel called “Movie Channel”, which was called “The Movie Channel”. “Star Channel”, then they changed the name to “Movie Channel” in the early 1980s ........ I received a free month “Star Channel” with my new cable subscription. “Van” was one of the films that were actively rotated on this network at that time. <br /> <br /> I remember watching this film at the time and thought that it was a typical film for teenagers (in the same vein). like other mid-budget teen films) ... those where the plot revolves around nudity and parties. <br /> <br /> I completely forgot that this film even existed, until I recently saw this movie again, after having not seen it for a decade (I found it on DVD for sale in a cheap basket), I recognized and bought it for just 4.99 dollars. <br /> <br /> It seems like I remembered that this film is much better than it was (is). However, to watch it then was not at all the way it is now (more than 30 years later). <br /> <br /> It was fun to watch children record for rock and roll music, smoke weed and have sex in the back. fashion van (often all at the same time). This is what a good party movie for teens should be. <br /> <br /> Not a lot of plot, except for the fact that the main character fantasizes about having sex with his best rivals - a beautiful girl ... he spends all his savings on college studies to buy a deceived Dodge Van ( with quilted carpet walls. The mirror ceiling and the waterbed are in it) to get her attention, and eventually he begins to have sex with her. But his main rival finds out and comes looking for him (so that two of them can settle their differences by dragging their wagons) ... he and his main rival eventually destroy both their wagons and instead of stealing his girlfriend vies with the girl, he wins the heart of a neat (less attractive) girl he meets half through most of the film, and he decides that he is happier / better, and the film ends. <br /> <br /> There are funny moments in the movie. But watching this film more than 30 years later, it becomes more and more fascinating. Since I still remember the pizzeria cafe, pinball arch, it also reminded me of a small town cruise when we smoked weed, when we shouted at pretty girls and hoped that they would lay me down (sometimes I get lucky and I get decent looking a girl to share with me together, and we screwed the afterword in the back seat, I also remember many songs in this movement (when they were new) ...... this film serves as the perfect time capsule for this era in this regard ( brought a lot of memories) <br /> <br /> The only The one that is depicted in this film that I, frankly, can't remember is this .... I never remember the time when full-size vans were so popular because this film portrays them as a creature. I remember that era very well and I don’t remember how young people walked around wanting to have a van. Instead, I remember young people in the 70s (including myself) wanting Pontiac Trans Am, Chevy Camaro or Ford Mustang hot rod, but never van. From this film, it seems that the wagons were the most popular thing going and that every young man wanted one (that simply was not true about that era)
