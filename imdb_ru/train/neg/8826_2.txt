This (extremely) low-budget film is compared to the great classic "Silent Night, Deadly Night", as it is labeled Slasher Flick. First let me say that I think that even “Silent Night, Part 2” is better than this (this one was filled with more than half of the film’s original memories) “Christmas evil” is trying to become psychological, presenting the main character as a person who goes crazy (strong word), slowly (very slowly). He is annoyed by people who do not understand the true meaning of Christmas, and at work he cannot bear how toys are made with such a lack of quality and love. Dressed like Santa, he finally goes for a killer fun. Also a strong word, since only 3 people are killed without the real need for special effects. No tension, no thrill, no blood, no actors. With one exception, what is it: Jeffrey Demann in it. He is best known for playing Tom Hanks as one of the guards in the classic Green Mile. He must still kick himself for accepting the role. He is really the only one who can really act, his supporting role is better than the main role. (which is also not so bad, but if you are overshadowed by a slightly minor character, you are not great either). What about this strange ending? (You must see this to believe). “Christmas evil” is completely boring, nothing happens, and a work of art is simply misleading. This is not a slasher. Do you want to see this New Year's slasher, check out the greatest time: "Silent night, deadly night."
