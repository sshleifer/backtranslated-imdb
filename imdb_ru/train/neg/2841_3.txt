SAKURA KILLERS (1+ out of 5 stars) Perhaps in 1987 this film might have seemed cool ... if you had never seen a good * movie about a ninja. Dirty 80s music ... a foolish dialogue ... a foolish game ... and unique martial arts sequences. The coolest scene at the beginning ... with the older Chuck Connors playing golf on the beach ... some black-clad ninjas are trying to sneak up on him, and it looks like he wants to hit the ball too much to notice ... he suddenly climbs in my golf bag and ... no, I won’t spoil it for you ... if you ever have the misfortune to see this movie, thank me. There is a lot of nonsense in history about some kind of stolen video or something like that. A bunch of dim Caucasian heroes are trained in ninja techniques, because “only ninjas can fight ninjas” or something like that. Strange, but these guys don't seem to sleep better after training than before ... oh well, the movie is moving pretty fast. The fight scenes may not be very good ... but they are numerous ... and over-sounding effects are good for a few chuckles.
