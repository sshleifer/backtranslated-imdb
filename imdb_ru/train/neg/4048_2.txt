Maybe not, but it's terrible. Even a fantastic cast cannot save him. Well, I admit that it started quite funny, but it seemed to plummet as they rushed at these girls in the house of generals. Bill Murray turned from a quick-witted, humorous guy to an ass who shouted to people on the street, which was just ridiculous, he seemed to be trying too hard to be funny. His character stole a weapon (RV? Come on ...) and eventually becomes a national hero after invading another country and killing God knows how many soldiers to laugh. One good point is that this film shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the US Army and shows how arrogant and stupid they are, albeit unintentionally. I actually felt disgusted that this kind of propaganda crap really could be released.
