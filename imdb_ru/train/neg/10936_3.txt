I wanted this film to be liked. He has some good actors, but in the end it didn't work. He tries too hard to be funny in some places (daughters because of zealous attempts to cook), in others - for reach (a scene where they clean someone's yard, so he agrees to join the team), and there are scenes in it that although a little interesting. Actually just a filler (all the work scenes). And I did not find frightening or hateful "villains" as much as they were childishly annoyed. <br /> <br /> I met such people in the film when I was playing a church ball. And I will say that the judge is in place. However, in the end, I really didnâ€™t really care about the characters or their desire for the glory of the church ball. Perhaps because they were all so unidimensional, that I might not mind so much if the film was more funny or seemed smoother overall. <br /> <br /> Kurt Hale and Halestorm Entertainment have shot some good films, but this is not one of them.
