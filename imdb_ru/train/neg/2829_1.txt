The worst, and beaten by people who really need to know better (the actors have six Oscars between them). It is installed in "modern" Africa (it was made in 1979) and is dedicated to the slave trade. He was badly written and acted (Michael Kane, Peter Ustinov and William Holden reached a minimum in this career), and he absolutely lacks excitement, not to mention moral orientation. This is also a funny plot. You will not for a minute believe that any of the characters will behave in the same way as in these conditions. Richard Fleisher is in charge, but you get the impression that it was on the phone. This is as bad as it can be.
