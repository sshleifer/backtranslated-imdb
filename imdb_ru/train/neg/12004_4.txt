“Salaam-e-Ishq” - an endless three hours and twenty minutes - is a cute but superficial comic soap opera from India featuring six intertwined stories of romantic love (I estimate that at least four stories are too many). ). <br /> <br /> Filmed as a cross between an MTV music video and a Super Bowl beer commercial, the film is a sprawling mix of exotic places, dazzling colors, sexy show girls, exciting songs and dances. numbers, dreams and fantasy sequences, winkers aside, banal dialogues and funny comedy performances are all pretty standard things when it comes to Bollywood events in our day. This is a grueling routine task - just try to keep all the characters straight while they dance, jump, and make their way through the incomprehensible storyline. <br /> <br /> There is something to watch the audience, not least. all awesome gorgeous women - but he will need Job’s patience to get through it all.
