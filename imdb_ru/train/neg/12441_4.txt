Some things need to be clarified. Mark Ferris is not Mark Ferris, who starred in this film. I know this because he was my father. Please delete this picture. Mark Ferris was also a writer for at least one of them. I tried to find a copy or a way to see this movie again. It has been years, and if someone can point me in the direction of getting a copy, it would be great. The film was not so bad, and trying to compare it with today's world of Star Wars and other high-tech sciences is useless. If you watch it, just enjoy it for the humor and humor it possesses. Get free from the snobs in the movies and enjoy less creative and innovative movies.
