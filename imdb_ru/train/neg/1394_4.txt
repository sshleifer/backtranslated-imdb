The brain machine will at least force your brain to overload, trying to figure out what's wrong. Four objects of different origin and level of intelligence were selected for the experiment, which one of the researchers called the scientific study of man and the environment. Since the only common denominator among them is the fact that each of them has no known family, this should have been a warning — none of them will be missed. <br /> <br /> The whole case is controlled by a mysterious creep, known only as a general, but it seems that he is taking his instructions from a senator who wants to remain anonymous. Good call there from the senator. There is also a dark guard on whom the camera is constantly focused, who later claims that he does not take his leadership from the general or the “Project”. It is a pity that he was not more effective, he was overcome quite easily before it all became heel. <br /> <br /> If not more, the film is a real treasure trove of technology from the 1970s, featuring repeating snapshots of phone numbers, computers the size of a room and a teletype that will not go away. Perhaps this was the basis of the alternative name of the film - “Time Warp”; nothing else would have made any sense. As for me, I would like to consider the name suggested by the experiment of the murdered Dr. Krisner, entitled “The Project of Group Stress”. This applies to both actors and viewers of the film. <br /> <br /> Watch the head of the general by the pool when he asks the agent about his weapon, a boom microphone is visible above his head. seconds <br /> <br /> You might want to catch this film, if you are a devoted fan of Gerald McRaeney, could he ever be so young? James Best also performs in the somewhat uncharacteristic role of the mysterious Reverend, but do not call him Father. For something else more in his alley, try to get your hands on the 1959 "The Killer Shrews". At least, he does not claim to take himself so seriously.
