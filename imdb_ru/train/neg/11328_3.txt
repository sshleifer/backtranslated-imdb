From time to time I will shoot an action / adventure film to relax and do something important. That's why I have a copy of Charlie the Angels (2000) - not a high-quality film, but it makes me laugh and allows me to relax a bit. One day, I’ll probably buy copies of The Princess Bride and several Monty Python films for the same reason. <br /> <br /> In any case, I rented this film because I wanted to be entertained without disputing, For the most part, I got what I wanted. The plot was something like a poorly written episode of "Xena", and the acting game Katie Long was a very public theater (not bad for a professional kickboxer and amateur actress). There were some bright moments from the cyborgs. Somehow they managed to get some pretty good actors to play the bad guys - unfortunately, most of them die pretty damn fast. <br /> <br /> As with most martial arts films, the further you dive into the film, the more attention there is in the action, and the plot (which was not strong from the very beginning) worsens almost as quickly as the action . However, the more Katie Long fights, the more time the director devotes to her back. By the end of the film, I seriously thought about watching it a second time, to calculate how many times Katie Long's tight red shorts were in the center of the screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film simply didn’t have enough film to make a satisfying curiosity worth seeing the movie a second time. If you're a Xena fan who needs something to take several hours off - by all means, go to the grocery store and spend 50 cents on rent. There are strong similarities between the series and this film. <br /> <br /> Just expect nothing more than light entertainment for hours. <br /> <br /> Unless, of course, you like derryer Katie Long. Then you can buy a copy.
