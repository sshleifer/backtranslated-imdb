I gave it to 1. There are so many plot twists that you can never be sure to support. Total chaos. All killed or nearly killed. I'm tired of the crosshairs and the change of views. I can not distribute the plot. Confused and insane. If I paid to see this, I would demand my money back. I would like the reviews to be more honest.
