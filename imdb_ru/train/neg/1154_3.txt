May (Ann Reid) and Toots (Peter Vaughan) visit their son Bobby (Stephen McIntosh) and his family in London, apparently, not often. Even when the visit begins, Toots suffers from a fatal heart attack, leaving May with the flow, unsure and questioning her life and future. Caught attracted to his daughter's boyfriend Darren (Daniel Craig), her actions lead to inevitable consequences. <br /> <br /> Beautifully shot, but, despite all its proclaimed realism and recognition, Mother offers a collection of mostly unpleasant ones, even repels the characters and asks the viewer to talk with them. The raid shines like Mai, and it is her skill and dedication as an amazingly understated actor that saves the film from a completely depressive swamp, but Michelle and Kureishi allowed Craig, McIntosh and Catherine Bradshaw to create such totally unpleasant characters that he is becoming increasingly difficult to take care of happening since May. As written, the characters played by McIntosh and Bradshaw are in fact so selfish and cool that you begin to wonder what Kureishi was trying to say. As directed, they either do not want or cannot raise Bobby and Paulo over two-dimensional in their terrible egoism. <br /> <br /> Worth a look at Reedâ€™s performance, but little else. Crying shame ...
