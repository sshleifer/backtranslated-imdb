I really wanted this western to be a fan of the genre and a fan of Buffalo Bill, Wild Bill Hickook and Calamity Jane, who are all in this story! Add a note to Gary Cooper as lead actor, and it sounded great. <br /> <br /> The trouble was ..... it is not. I found myself looking at my watch in just 40 minutes, bored to death. Gene Arthur was somewhat annoying, and James Ellison simply did not look and did not act like Buffalo Bill. Cooper, too, was not in his power, sounded too wooden. It was a few years before he reached his peak as an actor. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, his western shots are gone. Head to the pass and look at another diver, because most of them were much better than this one.
