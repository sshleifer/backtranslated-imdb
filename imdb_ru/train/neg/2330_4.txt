I liked how it started, with some decent special effects, especially for a 50 year movie. There was quite an impressive landscape. Nevertheless, the film stalled quite early with some very stupid dialogue, when all men try to flirt with Anna Francis "Altair Morbius".) <br /> <br /> Watching this in the 90s after a long absence, he was it's fun to see Francis again, an actress who has been doing mostly television shows since this movie was released .... and still works. It was also interesting to see young Leslie Nielsen (“Dr. John J. Adams”), whom I would not have recognized if this voice had not been. <br /> <br /> I watched half of this. The film until boredom came almost overwhelming, and I had a strong desire to go to bed. I appreciated them re-doing this VHS tape in stereo. but it was a weak effort. This is one of those overpriced films where "elites" think so "hard" and "make you think." This is nonsense. He just seemed “smart” because the rest of the science fiction films of the 50s were so stupid! <br /> <br /> Some if the early scenes looked great on the widescreen, which I didn't have at the time of writing. Perhaps another look - this time on a widescreen translation of 2.35: 1 I would change this review.
