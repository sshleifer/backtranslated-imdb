Raw fighter with Dolph Lungren in the title role. Lungren is a former military man who switched to teaching. But the changes in the district and the student community left him frustrated, and he decides that he is going to hang it up. Things become risky when, watching a group of students in custody, some robbers seize a school as a base for robbing an armored car. His dolf against villains in the battle to the death. The jaw drop was thrown back to films about the exploitation of the late era of Grindhouse, where the bad guys dressed like punks and some bad women had daylight hair. What a stupid movie. Watching the fact that I can’t believe people did these things, this is a fighter who probably was doomed from the very beginning to how low-budget, fake breakaway sets and bad direction were even flickering in the eyes of producers. See how late in the movie the cars pass through the school (don't ask), they crash into the security tower (don't ask, since it looks more like a prison than a high school) and break its barely built form into parts (it doesn't look like It was in the previous pictures). What did the gods of bad movies do? Actually, I'm puzzled, because it was led (?) By Sydney J. Fourier, a really good director who made films like “Boys in Company C.” His ability let him down, or it was hopeless from the very beginning, and didn't even bother? This is turkey. Watchable, but turkey nonetheless.
