We had a free weekend STARZ, and I turned on the station to see what was happening there. It was a movie Howling II: the game was terrible, but the eye candy was gorgeous. Sybil Dunning and Marsha Brown as the aforementioned eye candies. I laughed a lot because of several scenes that I saw. <br /> <br /> My friends wonder why I never want to go to horror movies. If they saw this movie, they would know why. I would be thrown out for such a strong laugh. <br /> <br /> Just a couple of trivia: Reb Brown, who played Ben White, played "Captain American" in the television movie "Marsha Brown" and inspired Mick Jaggers for this song. "Brown sugar" Mick, of course, has a great taste in women.
