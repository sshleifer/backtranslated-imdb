This is absolutely the worst piece of shit that I had to watch - in fact it was so bad that I just needed to watch it :-) CGI is sooo bad, it's fun! It's not even close to the crappy CGI animation in Spawn, that's how bad it is, har-har ... <br /> <br /> I am amazed by the fact that some distribution company actually put aside money to release it on DVD but I think that in this way they will get more money from it, because the cost of its manufacture cannot exceed several hundred dollars. <br /> <br /> It is so terrible that the kindergarten class could do it. <br /> <br /> Look and laugh!
