Acting well, women are beautiful, and men are beautiful, so if you are looking for a good soft porn, this film is for you. Otherwise, you waste your time. The motivation of the main characters, in particular the hero of the same name, often remains a mystery. She could simply tell the truth — the truth presented in the film is not necessarily the historical truth — and her lover would be imprisoned for rape, which he did not commit. Did she defend her father, who seemed to be bent over when he provoked an evil lawsuit? She defended herself with her sudden concern for her reputation, when until then it seemed that only her art was important? During the trial, this strong-willed woman turns to porridge before our eyes. Conversely, her lover, starting out as a narcissistic jerk, becomes a selfless hero during the process. At least his motivation is clearer: he sacrifices himself for love. Naturally, since no good deed should go unpunished, we are told that she will never see him again.
