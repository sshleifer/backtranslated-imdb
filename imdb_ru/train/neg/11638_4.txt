"The Blood of the Sacred, the Blood of the Damned" is the third edition of the games of "Gabriel Knight", a series of adventure games about the scammer-writer / paranormal detective Gabriel Nita. Prince James of Albany asked Gabriel and his companion Grace to investigate a series of mysterious attacks of the so-called "night visitors." When the son of Prince James is kidnapped, Gabriel pursues the night visitors of Rennes-le-Ch창teau, where he begins to collect the mystery associated with the Holy Grail. <br /> <br /> Despite the marketing, this game is not about vampires, Vampires have a symbolic look in the game, but they are never in the center of attention, like in voodoo in Fathers Sins or werewolves in Beast Inside . Gabriel and Grace make no attempt to uncover the true nature of vampires or explore the knowledge of vampires. Although vampires kill three people during a game, their victims are randomly selected and have nothing to do with the main plot. <br /> <br /> Much of the charm of the first two Gabriel Knight Hire purchase was in the relationship that Gabriel had formed with the villains. Through these relationships, the player could not help but sympathize with the villain, and thus the villain was turned into a man and less into a monster. However, in the "Blood of the Sacred" Gabriel, the only interaction with the villain takes place through one stupid interview that does nothing to indulge the villain to the player. <br /> <br /> The roles that play Gabrielle and Grace are pretty useless in this mystery. Gabriel spends his time spying on the personalities of members of the treasure hunters tour group who stay at his hotel, but what he reveals is nothing more than a red herring. Grace spends her time exploring the secret of Rennes-le-Ch창teau, but all her research turns out to be superfluous because of the perplexity of an ally who knew the answer to this riddle for centuries. <br /> <br /> The actions of this perplexity are ally and its polar opposite - the leader of the vampires - are unbearable. An ally leaves allusions to the secret of Rennes-le-Ch창teau in broad daylight and expects Grace (and not the other treasure hunters from the tourist group) to find them. However, he could have uncovered Grace's secret completely on the first day, instead of putting the kidnapped child at risk for an additional 48 hours. And in the end, he still just tells Grace about the secret. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, a vampire leader cannot achieve the goals of centuries-old intrigue, because he prefers to refrain from actions for two days after the kidnapping of a child. The only reason he chose to postpone action is because he wants to enjoy his victory. <br /> <br /> The game would be much better if it focused solely on the Holy Grail. Abductions and vampires should have been omitted, they were replaced by a race against the Vatican to uncover the secret of Rennes-le-Ch창teau. Since Gabriel was often portrayed as a reluctant Catholic, this conflict would have many opportunities for character development. <br /> <br /> Overall, the game was a disappointing part of the series, despite the improved interface and the return of Tim Curry as the voice of Gabriel Knight.
