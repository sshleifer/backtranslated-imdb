To make a good movie, you need either great actors or a great director. You need at least one of the two. In this Eye of Eagle, we have not one. <br /> <br /> I don't even remember the name of the director. He must have not done much in his career. I really like Donald Sutherland, but he absolutely can not be the main actor in the movie. He fails. Sutherland is great at the movies when he appears no more than 15 minutes. For example, I would say that Sutherland spoke well to Oliver Stone’s Kennedy when he talked to Kevin Costner on the park bench for 10 minutes without a break, without even knowing his breath. Wonderful. But the Sutherland starring in the film is no good. <br /> <br /> Kate Nelligan? She's probably good for TV shows. The DVD is terrible. Scary colors. Scary light. I could not even appreciate the landscape of the island of Storm for how disgusting was the picture. <br /> <br /> This story with Ken Follett was good, but it’s a pity that they turned it into an uninteresting film.
