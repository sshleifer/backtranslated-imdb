Please help the economy - spend money elsewhere! The film's synopsis: The First Lady was killed because he cheated on her. That's all. No one, except Cuba and Angie, notices her, develops and implements an extensive conspiracy of assassinations, about which no one knows ... and leaves completely free. <br /> <br /> Some specific moments are especially funny: standing in front of the president, Cuba rejects the assassin’s bullet ... which then hits the back of the president’s head. <br /> <br /> Cuba and Angie are watching a movie from a news camera, and they see ... a hint. They do everything possible to protect the film, believing that they are the only ones who have a copy of this very public film. <br /> <br /> Cuba talks with the President’s staff. PSM comments that there was no conspiracy. Cuba claims that more than one person participated in it. Then PSM reports that the plot includes the FBI, the CIA and the NSA. Damn, I wonder if PSM is involved. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Archer, the first lady, is a crap artist. Cuba cannot see the picture, and she says: "You are too close ... get away ... look from another point of view, look from my point of view." Can anyone miss this hint?
