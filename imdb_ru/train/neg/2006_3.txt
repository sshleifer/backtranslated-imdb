It would be helpful to know why a book ready to shoot took as much time as House Next Door, adapted for film or television. The book was copyrighted in 1978. One of the reasons may be problems with the design of the "house". The house in this movie "Lifetime" is really so ugly that I can't imagine anyone buying it. In fact, it is so ugly that someone would probably come and destroy it as soon as it was built. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m not thrilled with horror books, but this book was hard to deny when I came through about ten years ago. The main characters are not one of those people who are looking for something occult in life, and this is one of the strengths of the book. They are not people who would conclude that the architect was a kind of demon ... (or a personalized devil), without observing and analyzing the events described so well in the book. However, for the most part this is a bad book, and I do not think that people who run Lifetime will like it. Maybe someone will invent another version of the book in the coming years. Better home .. better music .. better scenario and darker lighting ... definitely will help.
