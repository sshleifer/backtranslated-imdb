Great disappointment from the writer Hamm and director Dante. Their previous teamwork on “returning home” in the first season was perverted and darkly hilarious in all respects. This mistreatment with an intriguing premise left me confused. Alleged "returns", showing that aliens, extracting something from the brain of infected psychopaths, were completely unsatisfactory and did not explain anything. If the meaning of this story is an extraterrestrial “clearing” of the planet from its human infection, then why did they do this with such groundless sadism and misogyny? Why not just release the completely deadly Stendan King’s “Stand” virus instead of the male population destroying females? I kept hoping that the episode would improve as I continued to watch, but it only became more pretentious and ridiculous. Religious overtones simply seemed compelled, but it was clear that Sam Hamm must have thought he was deep because of the weight he attached. I like the work of Dante and Hamm, but it was just impossible.
