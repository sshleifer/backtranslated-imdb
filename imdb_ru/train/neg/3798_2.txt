And this is the only reason I have this DVD. Now I have not seen the first film about Nemesis, but I checked the information, and then I said: what? What for? Because in the first movie, Alex was a man. But again, the first one was installed in the future, so perhaps this Alex is completely new, and the scientist accidentally made Alex a woman this time. Who knows, at least in the film it is in no way mentioned. <br /> <br /> Here is a brief summary of the plot: Alex, then still a child (or whatever you like, as it was in the future) escapes with his mother on a special time ship and goes to Africa in the 1980s. Mother is killed there, and Alex (Sue Price) grows up in an African tribe. Then the tribe is killed by a cyborg from the future, and Alex runs and hides, and finally, she kills the cyborg. So that. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? <br /> <br /> “Terminator” is not the only film being torn here, “Predator” also gets its share, and I think that the first film “The Fly”, the film “Vincent Price”, becomes special. nomination for creating a solid foundation for creating cyborgs head. <br /> <br /> Let's see what else? Well, the film was a fairly standard small budget film, but it had bad special effects for the mid-90s film. It would look good for an 80s movie, as always. The biggest problem is the plot. Things just happen, and the viewer is barely interested. “Nemesis 2” is not the crappy movie that I had the pleasure of (?) Watch, but it is pretty darn close. <br /> <br /> I won’t say anything about acting, because let's be honest here: did anyone expect any decent Oscar performances here? Oh well ... at least I found Sue Price by the hot Amazons. <br /> <br /> “Real” movie rating: 2/10 There are not so many advantages in all quality, And, despite the very simple story, the movie itself does not make much sense. <br /> <br /> Camp cinema rating: 4/10 I sometimes got a laugh because of the sheer badness of the film, so he had a little Merit on that.
