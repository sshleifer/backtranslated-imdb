This movie was awesome. It is beyond the atrocious. I often go with a group of friends and go to the cinema to find horrible movies to see their comedic value. My friend suggested it, but when we watched it, people started to leave. I really wanted to finish this, just so that I could say what I had, but I could not. This is so bad. Terrible running gags, slop game. The main characters are annoying dinosaur Klutts and Whoopi Goldberg. I would prefer to watch Kosteren's Postman twelve times in a row than to see part of this film again. I think they are trying to cope with some dinosaur discrimination issues, but the part of the film that really stands out is that the dinosaur constantly tilts things with its tail, and then screams about it. Painfully. Look, if you are a beginner masochist, otherwise leave it alone.
