I do not know why, but after all this hype over NPR, I thought it was a new film ..... all the best shots were used to document the BBC and the NatGeo projects that you saw, if you are interested in programs on nature ... it was repacked with lush narration and overly dramatic music for Disney to take advantage of Earth Day - there are wonderful moments and it is always nice to listen to Darth Vader ....... oops, ... ......... James Earl Jones says, but I was hoping for an innovative film, given the new camera technology used in Creating this film ... it was disinfected for a children's audience, so you can actually see the best shots for free on YouTube ... I feel that we owe for something as revolutionary as Koyannisquatsi (SIC), and this one the film is certainly not this
