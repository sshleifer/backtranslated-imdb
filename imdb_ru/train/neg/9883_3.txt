Reasons for watching the movie: <br /> <br /> 1) Bo Derek at 16 looks good and sometimes gets naked. She copes well with the role of an immature, unsafe 16-year-old beauty, in fact <br /> <br /> 2) Many pictures on the beautiful Greek island <br /> <br /> But: <br /> <br /> 1) Peter Houten in the worst performance of the actor, since Brutus played a friend of Tsezer in the "Senate Proceedings of the Roman Senate on March 15". He delivers each line in a delicious baritone below. Turn down the volume whenever he speaks. Preferably until the very end. <br /> <br /> 2) Boâ€™s fantasies are sadly tamed, especially by today's standards. A few turns in the bath and as a fully dressed model <br /> <br /> 3) The plot is leaner than Bo costumes
