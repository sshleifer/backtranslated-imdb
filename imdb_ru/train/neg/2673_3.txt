Not long enough to be long and not short enough, this thing exists for one reason, to have a three-sided lesbian. There are worse reasons for existence. One sad thing is that it could make a decent full-length movie. Misty fits tightly into her outfit and a very cheeky girl, and when people are so passionate about the game character as Lara Croft that they make nude calenders out of her, you know that the click of a soft core is going to explode. Unfortunately, this is quite a pity. Especially painfully fake sex scene between Dariana and Misty, where you can see how her hand caresses the air. Take a look at this if you just can't get enough of Misty or Ruby, who makes a beautiful blonde and has ever had a mile jerman accent.
