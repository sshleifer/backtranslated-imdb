I recently watched this movie with my sister, who likes the performances of Sophia Loren. I am the man they call cultural barbarian. I hate art in any form or form. Rambo - my movie, thriller, murder, blood, horrors. If you recognize yourself in this, avoid this movie like the plague. No one dies, no action, no nudity, nothing like that. Let me give you a summary in a few sentences. Begins 5 minutes with black and white Nazi propaganda. Every Italian in a residential area attends a parade in honor of Hitler, with the exception of the housewife, anti-fascist and caretaker. A housewife deceived by her husband meets an anti-fascist. She falls in love with him, wants to make love with him, but the anti-fascist is gay. Despite this, they make love to each other. In the end, the housewife reads a book from her gay lover, and the guy himself is deported by agents. The end. Do you want an even shorter resume? Boring ... Is it short enough? The guy should have used his gun at the beginning of this film and shot himself to save viewers from this atrocity. By the way, my sister loved this movie. As I said, I am a cultural barbarian ...
