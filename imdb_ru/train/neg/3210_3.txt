There really is no way to go around the bush, saying this, Lady Death: The movie just sucks. In addition to the fact that the main character is a well-gifted blonde, running around Hell in a leather bikini with occasional bursts of graphic violence, the film seems to have been made with the mentality of a cartoon from the 1980s, based on a line of action figures. The bad guy himself even speaks like a scumbag Skeletor, has a compulsory incompetent minion and lives in a den, which looks as if he was created after the model of the villain from the old Saturday cartoon “Black Star”. Just do not expect any humor, except sometimes terribly bad dialogue. In other cases, this looks like an anime tale better suited for a hentai, but there is no sex, rape with tentacles (thank God!) And very little sex appeal, despite the physical appearance of the title character. In this material, there is simply no adult advantage, except for half-naked heroines and bloody deaths. In fact, we have a full-length episode of She-Ra, the Princess of Power, but with leaner clothes and more blood.
