This movie was a super smart guest. This theme rhymes with every horror movie ever created. Valentine makes ZERO try to be original. What is Valentine? This is a group of people giving each other the same slop messages that were given to the same people a year earlier. There is nothing original in Valentina. <br /> <br /> I saw him only once, and during one viewing some movies were made here. 1.Prom Night 2.Carrie 3.Scream 4. Any other horror movie in which someone kills someone. <br /> <br /> I know there is something else, but my mind was gradually turning into a puddle of silk, so I could not grab them as quickly as they came. <br /> <br /> Valentina had no chance of becoming a good movie. As it turned out, every horror movie should have a surprise killer, people you don't care about, because their emotions change every other scene. In one minute, the sweet girl turns into an evil BBC, then she’s an unreliable woman, and so on, and a son. <br /> <br /> Usually, any horror movie (in my book) can be saved by blood, again Valentine has no such thing. As if they were trying to do this with PG-13, but failed, so they left editing. <br /> <br /> Do not think that this is too much inspired plagiarism if you don’t hate yourself and don’t want to die. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (3) -J.Leonard Rollins -
