A really awful movie that made me feel spoiled by watching forty minutes or so I could stand. Not the fault of the actors, but with the writer / director, producers, financiers, etc. It needs to be very tough to talk. Maybe he thinks it is deep. This is not true. This rape and ultra-violence, in contrast to what is central to the "Clockwork Orange", has nothing to do with human understanding. These are not the Straw Dogs with whom I have compared this. Most likely, this is similar to what Pete Walker could turn his hand to, but even said that I was probably a little unfair to Pete Walker. <br /> <br /> Revenge is a strong human desire, but the Bedroom Window has something to say about this and male exhaustion than this pathetic effort. <br /> <br /> I don’t think that this is a particularly misogynistic, just too joyful description of some details - blood running down the leg of G.А. after rape Example. This is not a challenge or confrontation, although I am sure that the filmmakers consider themselves very “bold”, just very unpleasant. <br /> <br /> This is as high as we can aim? Therefore, interested parties wanted to make films? (I wrote a Latin phrase here that translates as “Oh, the times! Oh, the customs!”. But the new spell checker on IMDb would not allow me to post messages before I deleted it. In the same way, I had to remove the square brackets. Get it Sort IMDb.) <br /> <br /> Where is the high aspiration? Noble rush? When you watch a British film, Ealing's comedy comedies or The Boulting Brothers; The work of Carol Reed with Graham Green in the film "Fallen Idol", "Our Man in Havana" or the exalted "Third Man" (a film in which much more can be said about evil than about a thousand straight heads); Powell and Pressburger; or if you want to talk about sex, violence and male exhaustion, take a look at “The Offense” Dir. Sidney Lumet, from the original play by John Hopkins; see “Tunes of Glory” for something worthwhile that is, what to say. <br /> <br /> Unlike the above, Straightheads are, alas, a disgusting waste of celluloid.
