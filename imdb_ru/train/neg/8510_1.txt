When we were in high school, some of us boys sometimes started smelly bombs. Then it was considered ridiculous. But the producers, directors and actors of “Semana Santa” (“The Angel of Death” in the “DVD” section of your local video rental) are adults, and they disable ALL of IT. <br /> <br /> Like the previous reviewer who wondered if the actors wanted to leave the set and go home, I doubt that more than one take was done on any of the scenes. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino, hot in “Mighty Aphrodite” and other best rated films seem to have underestimated themselves to this project. Her actions do not exist, confining mainly to a thoughtful look, which should indicate how "sensitive" she is to the plight of the various victims of the film. <br /> <br /> But let me warn you - do not be the next victim! Get away from the DVD if you find it on the shelf. There are not many good pictures of World's legs (the only bright moments I could find in the film), and the cast is of poor quality, delivering a mess of poorly done dialogue with embarrassing Spanish accents worthy of the best high school theatrical production.
