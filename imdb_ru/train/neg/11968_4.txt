This is just the typical Bruce Willis movie about action movies. Watch it with popcorn and your friends. Rent it to save money. <br /> <br /> None of this is realistic. Battles are not realistic. Soldiers are not realistic. The victims are not realistic. And why did the character Tom Skerritt talk to Willis from the MEDIUM DECK? What's up with that? Can't he do it from inside the ship? <br /> <br /> Of course, Bruce W. was injured by a machete. There are many medium blasts. <br /> <br /> If this film accurately represents sea lions, then don't get stuck in Africa, expecting them to save you! <br /> <br /> The noble attack on the village bothered me the most. "First row seats for ethnic cleansing" ... as Bruce looks at the slaughterhouse in the city. So what does he do? He crawls into the city on his stomach. Yeah. How many died when they fussed? Well, okay ... I think it was necessary to calculate the body. <br /> <br /> And if this African guy was so important, why didn't he get on a helicopter with the old men and children? Can he say "Spirit?" <br /> <br /> Finally, the film was very dark. Not only in the plot, but also at night, so many things were difficult to understand what was going on. <br /> <br /> Rent it.
