What do you call horror without horror and story? <br /> <br /> This is the most annoying thing in the film: I have a feeling that the writers haven’t decided what is really going on in the film! It is another thing to know this, give clues to the audience and not disclose it completely, but here you have a feeling that the writers do not know this, the film’s characters do not know it, and the audience sees that no one knows! (Remember “Cube”? Even this film knew more about itself.) <br /> <br /> I ate a lot of horror / bloody 80s films, and this film undoubtedly has deep roots in these films. But many important things are missing. We really don't know anything about characters. They keep repeating blank lines again and again. The story does not really develop - it will not go anywhere. In this type of horror movie, everything is in order, but there are not so many actions in the script. We don't care about characters. There is nothing to remember about them. There is not even a cheese humor or unnecessary sex. And most importantly - without thrills, without chills. <br /> <br /> You only get some frequently used elements of the horror movie genre. They show the monsters of the Lords one by one, but their characters contribute nothing to the plot. <br /> <br /> I sincerely believe that such a number of scenes, character development and atmosphere can be achieved with a minimum number of crew. and equipment. Oh yes, the filmmakers did it - and even more - about 20 years ago! I felt a general embarrassment to the audience when the film ended. Sorry, really.
