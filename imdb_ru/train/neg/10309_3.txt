CIA Codename: Alexa is an absolutely horrible story with Luc Besson’s classic film La Femme Nikita (1990). The film is mainly about a woman who is taken and trained by the CIA and is forced to perform a secret mission for them. (Much the same structure of the history of La Femme Nikita) The operating company of Lorenzo Lamas and O.J. Simpson, perhaps the worst in cinema history. Lama's “acting” is simply a bad imitation of Steven Seagal. Watching the act of acting in this film is a painful experience. <br /> <br /> Writing and playing in this film is so bad that sometimes it's funny. There are so many "conventions" of an action movie in the film that it is ridiculous: unnecessary car explosions, people flying through glass windows, terrorists, bad tails, etc. Steven Seagal's theme in this film. The film has a lot of martial arts, and this is well done for low-budget American production. Senseless action and excessive action never lose heart, and I must admit that I was entertained a little. <br /> <br /> Lorenzo Lamas looked like a fighter in the early 90s, but he is definitely not a fighter star, so he does TV shows, not fighters. I recommend you skip the CIA Code Name: Alexa and check La Femme Nikita instead.
