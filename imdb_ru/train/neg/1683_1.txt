It's hard to call The Grudge a horror movie. At best, it made me wonder in a few moments. <br /> <br /> If you forget the frightening dimension (failed) and look at the other sides of the film, he is again disappointed. The game is normal, but not great. The story may be somewhat interesting in the beginning, while someone is trying to understand what is happening. But towards the end you understand, not so much to understand. Sometimes it seems that “scary” elements were added to the script for no reason ... <br /> <br /> So ... (yawn) Watch this movie if you have nothing to do, for example, cut a carrot or looking at the clouds.
