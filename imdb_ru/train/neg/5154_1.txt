This is the only film I ever went to. bad behavior - bad story - bad cast - bad direction - bad cinematography - if they decided to make a bad picture, they could not do better I hope they are proud of their turkey. I'm surprised that anyone associated with this film has ever been hired again in Hollywood. do not waste your time!
