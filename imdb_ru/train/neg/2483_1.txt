An incredibly messy turkey, a mixture of the anti-Nazi musical (!!), pre-war Americana and Agatha Christie, which unite a parody with one big, big problem: it is deadly unfunny. In addition to the unambiguous I.Q. The plot and dialogue, the most amazing aspect of "Lady ..." - is the cast. Gene Wilder (star and co-author) tries his best: he plays a romantic role (with his appearance !! and his age !! he and Woody Allen have to create a club for ignorant, mirrorless aging comedians), and he tries to be agile, fun, sharp and smart, and try to sing and dance, and succeeds in NOBODY! A long shot of his good old days with Mel Brooks. <br /> <br /> I thought for a while that I had a fit of myopia, because everyone in the film all the time says that Cherry Jones is a pretty hot chick, and that Michael Cumpsty is an incredibly beautiful stallion! The guy who plays the male secretary Claire Bloom is a bald skinny actor with glasses, as sexy as a chair, and the object of passion of two leading ladies !! Extremely popular Mike Starr, acting as the most incompetent, fake cop you have ever seen, deserves to be one of the 10 most disgusting acts in recent movie history. The saddest thing is to see how the wonderful Claire Bloom and Barbara Sukova are completely wrong and offensive. At least I hope that both stars paid their bills home (and subsequently fired their agents) with this flop. Not surprisingly, the actress Sukova returned to Germany after seeing what Hollywood had prepared for her !! <br /> <br /> If you want to see how you can create a really bad movie from a really bad script with the help of a madman actor. director, study it - otherwise stay away !!! - 1/10
