While I was watching this movie, I tried to understand why they bother to make it. Although the main plot of the film is potentially good, there are many different unrelated / unnecessary scenes. Marketers in Hollywood must have dictated a lot of bad guys, permanent double crosses, as well as men and women who are too close and have sex. It is strange that we see that they have more sex than the president and his mistress. A lot of the plots and the plots make the film too wide, and none of the characters are properly designed — I really didn’t feel that I knew any character except that everyone is corrupt and evil. The ending is completely unfinished - it left me more than just a desire for what could be, but what should have been. In the end, there really is no explanation for why someone does what he does, except to serve as additional spoiled characters who make a double cross. I am surprised that so many famous (and good) actors agreed to make such an empty film. It looked like a film made by college students who are working on their second or third project. <br /> <br /> Don’t waste your time if you don’t study in a movie and don’t want to get an example of what you can’t do when making a movie
