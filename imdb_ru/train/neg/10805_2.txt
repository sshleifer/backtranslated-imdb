The only reason I made this film was because: 1. I live in Cleveland, and Shaq plays basketball for us now, and 2. I always heard how terrible it was. The film did not disappoint. The best parts were Shaka's outfits. The worst parts were, well, almost everything else. My 12-year-old son and I just wriggled and couldn't look at the screen when Shaq started knocking, and we continued to wonder why Max did not want Kazzam to correct his front tooth! But despite all this terrible, we just could not stop watching it, the story sucked you in like a black hole, or quicksand, or a tar pit, it was hypnotic. But it was worth it to laugh and just say that we really watched Kazzam.
