Well ... it was not the worst movie I have ever seen, but I heard a lot of good things about it and I was very disappointed. I could see where the filmmakers came from and that they tried to express the fact that the two sides in this battle were not very different from each other, that people were lost in battles, and so on. D., And so on. D. (in any case, This is my guess = ^ _ ^ =) <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is boring for me. I watched a lot of really long films, but this one seemed to stretch and pull and continue ... mostly because I just couldn’t bring myself to care for any of the characters. I just kept thinking .. who cares ??? I also found the action to be a rather dead pan, and the dialogue was strained. I understand that these were the 1800s and all that, but most of the conversations just seemed unnatural to me. No one seemed to have any emotion for most of the film, except during melodramatic events. <br /> <br /> “Romance” in history, it seems, was not supported by anything except “I am a guy and you are a girl", which I do not consider romance, and yet I felt that I was inclined to believe that these people are in love. Oh well .. I think this is all "all this horror around us, we have to cling to each other," or something like that. I also hoped for some kind of dynamic between the two best friends (both were originally seemed to be interested in the girl), but it was kind of discarded. Maybe avoiding the cliche of the love triangle. I don't know. <br /> <br /> Oh well .. Daniel Holt was the only character that I really liked. And Sue Lee was fine. I didn't really like Jake, but he looked too ... spineless, I guess. Jack Bull, I didn’t care. And I I'm sure you * should * hate almost everyone else, with the exception of poor, normal people who are simply mowed left and right. It was pretty visual and contained all these “horrors of war”, but I saw a lot of other films with the same theme made it is better. (For example, I really liked the Patriot, even if it was a bit emotionally manipulating). But, as I said, I'm a cynic. What can I say? :)
