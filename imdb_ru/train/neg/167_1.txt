Anyone who has ever been a fan of the original series or even had an idea of ​​the plot should be confused by this series. The Borg does not appear until Q delivers the Enterprise to the Gamma sector, the Klingons will NEVER see, until Kirk meets them, the NCC-1701 was the FIRST ship named the Enterprise. Berman and Pilliar mocked the creation of Gene Roddenberry. After his death, they saw only $$$$ and just went their own way. No wonder Madzhel Barrett participated in every episode of Star Trek before this episode. I do not blame her for not having this mess. Poor Bakula. He's a great actor, like the whole cast. I like them all, but the plot is tragic and ignores all the precedents set by the original series. Just check the ratings. I think more people watched Deep Space 9 (which was prematurely canceled).
