This is not just a bad movie; it's not just that four “best” Mexican filmmakers participate in the film; and it's not just that the script is terrible. It just ... this movie sucks ... a lot of time. These people spend money on horrible scripts. He should have criticized Mexican society, but we are tired of films of this kind. Bad language should be funny? I don't understand Mexican movies have big problems if films of this type continue to be played (and will be written and produced). <br /> <br /> Please do not think that such films are well received in Mexico: we hate them, and they do not reflect us.
