Now I have written reviews for several episodes of the MoH, and this is one of the worst. An interesting premise at the beginning is completely abandoned by the time the loans roll. If you are interested in watching people for something they would never see in their lives (“let's check the basement!”), Then this is your show. Except that it's not funny and not interesting - it's just annoying. <br /> <br /> The spread of the virus has never been shown. I can very much overlook the fact that this only affects men, as the resulting situation is very, very scary. But then everything worsens, as the daughter allows an EXTREMELY deranged father to the house and eventually dies at his hands. A woman runs north and faces dozens of situations. Then some spirit or alien or someone else appears and rescues her (things that make you leave? Or something. Then she shrinks for heat. End. <br /> <br /> Terrible. These directors send out this newsletter.
