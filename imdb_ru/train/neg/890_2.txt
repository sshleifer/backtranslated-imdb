I saw this regurgitated bunch of vignettes tonight on the preview, and I was just shocked at how bad it was. <br /> <br /> First, the film practically flaunted its gaping blind spots. In love there is no black or gay from New York? Or who, say, knows the white people involved in love? I know that this is not an anvil love disaster, but you cannot pretend that you have a cinematic New York without these fairly common members of society. In addition, you know that the people who produced this ishu thought that Crash deserved this Oscar with his hands, so where is everybody? <br /> <br /> Perhaps worse than bizarre and deliberate socio-economic ignorance, there were offensive chapters. This film showed how to be the worst. Bad behavior, bad writing, bad direction - all of this covers all possible genres that ever affect affluent white people who smoke cigarettes outside of chic restaurants. <br /> <br /> But, thank God, they finally brought the Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson power stations together for the reunion of the Jumper. And note, Uma dodged a bullet; Ethan Hawk looks devastated. This, of course, is one thing in terms of his appearance, but he added an incredibly creepy extra horror horror to his horrific scene scenario with poor, sweet Maggie V. <br /> <br /> I terribly chose my least favorite scene for the end questionnaire of the film, but it should be a little bit of Anton Yelchin / Olivia Thirlby for the apparent lack of taste that makes me sad because I really like these two actors. I do not consider myself easily offended, but all I could do was scoff and look with disgust like someone’s 50-year-old aunt. <br /> <br /> A close second place in this incredibly intense contest of horrible things is the deaf sound of Shia LaBeouf about what it means for the former star of the Disney channel to oppose Julie Christie. I do not mean the opposite, I mean against. Against this is the only explanation. Now I understand that the early sequence with Orlando Bloom is a relative highlight. HIGHLIGHT. Please keep this in mind when your brain begins to drain from your ear soon after the opening credits, which seem to be a tribute to the first real world in New York. This film is embarrassing, strangely outdated, slurred, ineffective, pretentious and, after all, completely separated from any real idea of ​​New York in general. <br /> <br /> (An additional star for Cloris Lichmann / Eli Wallach’s sequence, since she’s actually pretty pretty, but this is just one bright spot that resembles a watch of meaningless, masturbating torment.)
