RATING STARS: ***** Saturday evening **** Friday evening *** Friday morning ** Sunday evening * Monday morning <br /> <br /> McBain (played by Gary Busey, before the name became synonymous with the character in " Simpsons "- (usually) an unorthodox policeman who gets results but makes his superiors something rotten. Avoiding the cliches of his partner, who was killed at the beginning of the film, the plot takes another turn instead and sees it sent to Mexico, where the secret American super- tank with incredible firepower and image abilities was smuggled only to be taken hostage along with the film crew by a gang of terrorists. <br /> <br /> This cheap (even by the standards of the 80s) boring little fighter was a strange career move for Gary Busey the impression that he made the ardent villain Mr. Joshua in “Deadly Weapon.” He just goes through the movements with his cardboard character here, sharp and crazy, as always (with “butthorn”, which is his trademark, depressed for the bad guys), but without material to keep it up Henry Silva is in the role of a villain on the screen, but he is completely mistaken here as an Arab leader (in a red beret!), And the horrible script gives him some really clumsy lines of boring dialogue that make his speech ridiculously wooden. He is just one of the many actors in the action characters, including L.Q. Jones and Lincoln Kilpatrick, who float, but can not add anything to the mix. After a boring first half without much exciting action, in the end, things improve a little, but it's too late, and none of this solves the problem of pleasure. *
