It was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. No, really. I am not kidding. With the exception of everything “based on real history / historical references,” there is no excuse for such bad behavior. It's a shame because, as others have already reported, sets and costumes were great. <br /> <br /> The sound track was typical “Asian-style” music, although I could not understand where the “modern” love song came when Fernando was lying in his bed thinking of Mary. I do not know who wrote and sang this beautiful song, but it was as if Norah Jones was moved to the 1500s. <br /> <br /> Hershey's syrup blood in Psycho was more realistic than ketchup spilled during the Kwik-n-EZ battle scenes. <br /> <br /> but acting. Oh, how painful it is sad. The lines are delivered as a bad game for kids. If Gary Stretch donned a potato costume for the 4H County Fair, he could have been more believable. In the end, he sounded like a street gangster from Little Italy. At times, I almost expected him to shout "Adrian!" or even "Do you want a piece of me?!". <br /> <br /> Favorite phrase: when the queen tells her lover (after being hunched over on the floor), “I will have a child”. He replies "Baby?" I expected her to answer: “No, donkey, chair leg!
