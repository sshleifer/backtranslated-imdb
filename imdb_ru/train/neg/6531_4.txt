First of all, I would like to say that only user comments left me with tears in my eyes from laughter. One comment that bad SF movies become good comedies is on top. MST3000 earned on this. <br /> <br /> If you look at ANGRY RED PLANET as the feverish dream of a 10-year-old comic book reader of 1959, you will have a pen with this sucker. All the elements are present here: pseudoscience, sometimes logical, more often ridiculous infantile. The adolescent boy's attitude to sex when the captain is a “gigolo” (good call, guys!) Glimpses a magnificent “scientist” with red hair that is surprising that he does not light the fire alarm. Funny idea of ​​Mars as such an alien planet, that everything glows red, but one alien monster has a mouse face, and an alien has an eye that rotates like a child's toy. Comic relief, overweight astronaut (!), Which sounds as if he never finished 8th grade in Brooklyn and has psychotic fixation on his radiation gun. And of course, the very fact that the alien = is dangerous evil. If these people had met Ye.T., they would have fried him for two seconds! "OW" really! <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong. I rated this movie low. However, it is never boring (unless the scientist tries to explain everything - only so that it all sounds more and more absurd), and you have to admit that in the core of your little child it makes you jump several times. <br /> <br /> OK, then don't admit it. I think you have never been 10 years old.
