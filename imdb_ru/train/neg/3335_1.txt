This film about the cannon film is the worst of all, and is convincing evidence that the five-minute fable does not make a full-length film. Poor Sid Caesar, as a vain emperor, looks so stupid that it is difficult to watch him. As a cunning tailor, Robert Morse has no charm. Just like his unfortunate nephew (Jason Carter). "Songs" are terrible and only slow down what is happening in the plot. The direction is almost absent, and the auxiliary characters add very little. Lysetta Anthony is as good as the emperor's daughter, but for some reason her voice was clearly duplicated, fate shared many secondary players. And the movie creeps in tempo snails. Hans Christian Andersen must have turned somersaults in his grave when it appeared. You can honestly say, at least from this tale of the film, it is not surprising that she went straight to the video of oblivion.
