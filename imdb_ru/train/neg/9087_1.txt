Canadians are too polite to plump, but viewers at the Toronto Film Festival left the theater, muttering that they would rate this film 0 or 1 on their voting sheets. The premise is that the modern director interprets the fable of the 17th century about the love of shepherds and shepherds who appeared in the distant past when the Druids were spiritual leaders. Work in three eras provides many opportunities for introducing anachronisms, including silly and impractical clothes and special spiritual rites, which include really bad poetry. The lovers share jealousy and their tough commitment to idiotic codes of conduct, from which cross dressing and various farcical situations arise. The film may have been funny as part of Monty Python, which is too similar to it, but Romerâ€™s effort falls very flat. The audience laughed at the jokes at the sight, but otherwise complained about the slow pace. The ending is in a hurry and is really terrible. This is a trivial movie and a waste of your movie.
