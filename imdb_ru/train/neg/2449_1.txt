Baska should be congratulated on trying to turn one of the great works of English fiction into a film, and then hit on stupidity for trying. The animation was bad, the characters looked ridiculous, the music was overwhelmingly overwhelming, and the film ripped off the first book and half of Tolkien's masterpiece. I still remember my deep disappointment and disgust for the film when I first saw it. Now I understand that any attempt to turn a book into a film is doomed to failure in many ways, simply because of the medium, but this film, regardless of the source of the story, is simply pitiful. Baski is capable of much more.
