I saw a movie trailer several times in the theater, and I was excited. He looked like a classic action movie like in the 1990s. It also reminded me of the films The Runaways, chasing the cat and mouse between Douglas and Sutherland. However, The Sentinel - the most tasteless fighter of all time. As I see, many people say it is like a television movie. Not really. Firstly, there are much better television films in this genre. Secondly, television films can sometimes be very funny, but this film is the complete opposite of having a good time. It is not stylish at all visually and most importantly, the tone of the film does not appeal. This is not a fighter, there are two battle scenes, consisting of chases and clashes. Also, they are not big action films, but the worst thing is that these action films are very tasteless, like the whole movie. The love affair between Douglas and Bassinger was very unnecessary. In addition, the plot to assassinate the president is also the most clich√© in this genre, but they insist on this. And this is not a movie about cats and mice, as it should be. Although Douglas is now very old, he still has the potential to participate in an action movie. For example, in the movie Michael Douglas may not be the same as Tommy Lee Jones. Sutherland is also the wrong choice because you feel like you are watching Jack Bauer, and for some reason his character is one of the reasons why the film looks like a television film, Eva Longoria Parker is a strange choice, of course, it is too passive right in this the film because she is a soap opera actress. The film was not funny for me even for one second, so I could not pass some time.
