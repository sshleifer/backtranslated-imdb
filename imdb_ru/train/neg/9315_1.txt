This film was very bad! It was terrible! It was terrible! I can't stress this enough! Acting, directing, plot, characters and everything in it was bad! It was so trite and clich√©. Do not be deceived by either the cover or the inscription "Texas Massacre" - there is nothing to laugh at. " You're kidding me kidding me! That was funny. <br /> <br /> The first 2 minutes of the movie are good until you get to the main character Brendan, and now turn it off. What I got from the film is that a bunch of ugly, annoying and immature people go to a hut in the middle of the forest, and a clown who sings nursery rhymes, kills them with non-original and fake ways. This film was a waste of my time and money, as well as a waste of your money and time! I rewound most of the film because it was so terrible, I just wanted to see how every bad actor died, and it was not STILL worth it! Just looking at the cover is a waste of time. This is seriously the worst movie ever! Rating: does not deserve.
