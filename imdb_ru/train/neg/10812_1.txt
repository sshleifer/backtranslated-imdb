What a pathetic movie. <br /> <br /> I will not spend much time commenting on it. I'm still trying to get back the couple of hours I wasted. <br /> <br /> Let me just leave it with - at Shack NO BUSINESS, being an actor or a singer. He is completely inept in both directions. It is a pity that many more talented people are wasting in public theaters and karaoke bars, while Shaq uses his name as a basketball player to play films and record CDs unfairly. The film was a pathetic, mediocre Shaq.
