I never thought I would see a movie worse than Lisa Picard is famous, but it was pretty close. As often repeated in the comments, it was predictable; Five minutes after the beginning of the film, you will find out that he will be in a difficult situation. This film painfully refers to everything from “Something about Mary” to “Revenge of the Pink Panther”. Writer Greg Glienne (“Meeting with Parents”) needs new material. <br /> <br /> The only turning point is an abnormal guy / policeman, pursued by internal affairs, but even this opportunity is missed. Lots of installation shots of the Seattle Space Needle to disguise the obvious Canadian shooting site. Some of the worst driving in cars is practically effortless to hide the fact that the car drives through the city on a trailer. God, at least from time to time, turn the wheel or turn on the brakes. Selma Blair is inert, and a short haircut is a crime. 3 million dollars to Jason Lee, for what? I think it's better than skateboarding! <br /> <br /> This is the one who should watch this movie: Bee Gees fans who want to hear the two actors sing “Islands in Stream” badly; People who can not get enough of Julia Stiles. 1/10
