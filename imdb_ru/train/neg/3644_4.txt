This film is pretty poor. The game is terrible and completely forced. In addition, making a film as a documentary does not necessarily make it more believable, you cannot easily get out of it, Mr. Deer. However, do not let my comments mislead you, as I would recommend you to watch this film, because it sheds some light on the psychology or non-existent psychology behind the perpetrators of such crimes. However, the climax of the film - absolutely nonsense! There is no other way to express it! It is pure and simply not able to capture any sense of the atmosphere! What happens does not translate to me any feelings of despair, panic, fear or fear that someone would surely have experienced in such terrible circumstances. No, instead, he leaves you with a slack jaw. "It was ?!" splashing out of your tongue, and by no means do you pursue these actions of boys. Rather, you just feel embarrassed by another movie that began with potential, but ultimately collapsed on his face at the most important moment. Indeed, zero day .... zzzzzzzzzzzzz
