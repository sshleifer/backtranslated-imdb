Therefore, I heard from several people that this film brought them to tears in the theater. When I watched it for the first time, I was expecting another romantic film “Barbara Streisand”. Something like the way we were. I was certainly wrong. The chemistry between the two main characters, Esther Hoffman and her John Howard, was absent, making it impossible to attach to heroes. There was nothing romantic about it. The character of Streisand fell in love with an alcoholic drug addict who could not sing a single note without making me want to press the fast-forward button. At some point, her character finds her husband in bed with another woman, and she forgives him in about five minutes. There is nothing romantic about a runaway rock star and a woman who seems unable to understand this until he really dies. Parts of the film seemed to go on and on, and I kept asking myself when it would end. <br /> <br /> John Howard’s death was completely predictable. At the beginning of the film there were completely obvious omens of his reckless behavior, and when he died, I did not experience any emotions. It was not a tragic incident, it was mostly an idiot. Not to mention the movie, I was distracted by his hideous beard. <br /> <br /> The only parts of this film that are worth seeing are the Streisand songs. The end of the film, when she sings "Another Look at You / Look Carefully Now," was my reason for giving this film a whopping 3/10. These 7 minutes were the only part of the film where I actually experienced not only irritation and anger, but other emotions as well.
