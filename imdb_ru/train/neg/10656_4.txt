What can I say. The film about Kamala Hassan is terrible. It works very well, but it's a terrible story, along with a terrible direction. In my good opinion, director Gautam Menon has to give up directing. There are many tragedies in the film. In addition, one cannot simply believe how true these horrible crimes were. There was no practicality in the film. Gautham just ends the story. But both Kamal Hassan and Jotika work very well. The villains look too ugly, although their performance was not bad. I do not think this is a Sunday film at noon, like Padayappa, which you can watch with your family. You will not fall asleep after seeing this film !! However, Harris Jayaraj did a great job again, which is why I gave this film 4 out of 10. His song “Partha Modail Nallae” is soulful and soothing. In addition, excellent cinematography. In general, this is just a bad, bad movie. Kamal Hassan, I think, should have abandoned this film.
