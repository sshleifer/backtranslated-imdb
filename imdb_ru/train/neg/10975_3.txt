This film is blowing - let's go right now. There are a few gems in this pile of shit, but none can buy back a sluggish plot. Colin Farrell looks like Brad Pitt in "12 Monkeys" and behaves in the same way. I usually hate Colin because he is a fairy at all, but in this film he is fine. In this film there were two storylines - one about a child who throws stones in the windshield of moving vehicles, and the other about a woman with a mustache. Let's face it - this film has no idea what he wanted to say or where he wanted to go. The plot lines of the characters are intertwined at some levels, but in no way worthy of inclusion in the script. All this is weak and meaningless, and sometimes a good scene appears. But in general - do not worry if you dislike Irish accents so much that you can observe mediocrity, and this saves everyone who sounds like an elf Lucky Charms - an American fetish who has catapulted some truly crap films to success.
