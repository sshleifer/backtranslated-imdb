Non-existent conspiracy, tons of poorly directed / super-clean scenes (snipers / world famous snipers who can't even hit their targets in a few feet? Plus what's up with the final? ---> a group of law enforcement officers vandalizing the WTH shooting gallery, technical errors ( how many bullets can you put in the Glock 100+ magazine? These people shoot their weapons without having to reload.) The film is so bad that even a senior Hollywood actor such as Michael Bean (“Aliens”, terminator) cannot save this trash. <br /> <br /> DO NOT watch this from the film (I realized that I spent some good 100 minutes of your precious life on this). I hope that the director or stop making movies, or read more for his next film.
