Identical twin sisters Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen rose to fame on sitcoms, such as “Two Views,” I had never seen them in anything before, but I had an idea of ​​what to expect, but it was much worse. In fact, the sisters Hunter Charlie (Mary-Kate) and Leila (Ashley) are in Rome to participate in the summer internship program, but soon after they start work, they are immediately dismissed for a series of failures. But the person who owns the company in which they work, Derek Hammond (Julian Stone), returns their work to them, and they slowly prove that they are useful assets and talented (fashionable) artists, and help to prevent the dastardly man from seizing power. company. Also starring Leslie Danon as Jami, Derek Lee Nixon as Ryan, Ilena Lazarin as Dari, Archie Cao as Nobu, Valentine Mattolini as Heidi, Michelangelo Tommaso as Paolo and Matt Patresi as Enrico Tortoni. You can say that this film was made to go straight to the video, camera work doesn’t fit at all, and it does not help when you want to admire the sights of Rome. In fact, the background is the only good thing worth seeing, the twin sisters are the two most annoying celebrities around, I knew before looking that they were not going to interest me (they are not even so beautiful), this is a terrible stream trash film. Pretty poor!
