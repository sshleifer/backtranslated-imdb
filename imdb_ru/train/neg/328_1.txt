I am a HUGE fan of Adam Sandler, and once I watched the Cast & Crew compilation on one of his DVDs, saw “Going Overboard” and decided to rent it. So I went out with a few of my buddies and rented them. We put it on, and we were shocked to see Adam Sandler, who had not yet reached puberty, he looks like he was 12 years old when this film was released. I couldn’t even watch 30 minutes of this shit, I didn’t laugh, didn’t laugh and didn’t even smirk at this film, in fact, the only time I grinned, I saw how terrible this film is. I could not believe how hard he tried to make the audience laugh in this film ... and it did not work even once. Although, after seeing the horribly awful camera angles and hearing the disgusting script, I understood why I had never heard of this film ... because it sucks more than anything else sucked before. This film, in my opinion, was the worst film ever made .... ever!
