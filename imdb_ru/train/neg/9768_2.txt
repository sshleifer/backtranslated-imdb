When I first appeared on Happy Birthday, I checked the timer to see how long the movie lasted. I was amazed at the length. Both animated films and horror films have a common basis: the concentration of attention of the chosen audience should be about 90 minutes. Nothing more, and you lose the bulk of your audience. <br /> <br /> These 110 minutes or 20 minutes after its heyday have become a huge problem for me. I would like to say that half of this film could have been edited, but I would be too generous to say that. Go ahead, watch it and tell how many scenes you could edit, even without being the major of the film. <br /> <br /> Despite the long visit, the film was below the mediocre. He spent all his time trying to be this huge mystery in which from the “elite 10” he kills his remaining friends. For the most part, they not only exaggerate, but also enlarge the face and pretty much say: “This is the guy! Not! This is this girl! ”You will spend more time with a camera that is misleading you than with watching a movie. And don't make me start acting. <br /> <br /> Okay, that made me start. At first I had to laugh, trying to remember whether Melissa Sue Anderson played a character who went blind in the Little House on the Prairie (later research confirmed my suspicions), because throughout the whole film she genuinely looked blind. Strange as a recognized actress, she was supposed to be the best of the group, but turned out to be the worst. The rest of the staff, apart from Ann (Bregman), was also damn bad, but she took the cake. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a group of ten friends, and one of them is immediately killed off. Hardly anyone thinks twice about the disappearance of this “dear” friend, so they continue their cheerful journey. Slowly, and then more quickly, revelations appear about Virginia (Anderson), the main character, the past, and her psychologist, who is a bit more personal (AND ON CALL 24/7, obviously) than most psychiatrists. At the same time, more and more deaths are occurring. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that as the first “disappearance”, the more “better buds” disappear, the less concern for the rest. Of course, they give a few seconds of airtime to say: “Wow, (that person) just won’t run away,” and so on. But then they return to their sexual lifestyle. And, speaking of the fact that this was probably due to the horrible scenario, or maybe it was I who lost interest in the 30th minute, but it was very difficult to keep up with those who liked who were from the group, since they all seemed like sexual partners next or someone might be stunned by max others and best friends of the next scene. See: creepy guy who kept a mouse / rat in his pocket? literally ?? and was the most obvious suspect. I give the film too much attention (and time), but I never know how it became part of the “elite 10”. <br /> <br /> But, distracted, there is a mystery. Why are these children targets? Why does Virginia think that she killed someone, when it was never proven (to the end) that one of them was actually killed? And why does the trailer and poster advertise these murders as "the six strangest murders you have ever seen"? Hell, even in 1981, most of them were shown in any of the first two Friday 13th films? coincidentally, Friday the 13th part of 2 was released 2 weeks before my birthday. They may be talking about when they shot it a few months ago, but were late, well, well, to the party. <br /> <br /> When the “secrets” are revealed, believe me, you will have to rewind 3-4x to actually get ridiculous and incoherent motives, and even put on the subtitles to hear all the words of the victim / murderer. Even if you get it for the first time, this is an incredibly outrageous and fun ending. It would almost be worth seeing the whole movie again, but as a drinking game. <br /> <br /> This birthday is not worth it. Is this a terrible and illogical first draft of the script ?? Please keep in mind that before the role of the camera requires several rewrites, it contains either an acting game or extreme than an acting one, and it is 100% unrealistic how people react in emergency situations. <br /> <br /> Note: when I was a child, or, say, 10-11 years old, I loved horror movies. (So ​​far, strangely enough. Definitely guilty pleasures, but it becomes harder and harder to watch them every year.) We had our first VCR, and I recorded so many horror films on the net (or EDITED VERSIONS). All I remember about “Happy Birthday” is the last 10 minutes of recording on tape, which scared me to death. and, obviously, revealed a great mystery about who the murderer was. Despite the fact that I saw other clips of this film, I think that this is the first full-length viewing I had. Fortunately, this horrible film did not hurt me in childhood. I'm older now, and I can take this trash. But never again. <br /> <br /> Note 2: However, this crazy song "Happy Birthday to Me", played in the final credits (and overall), still scares me very much. I think this film (or the last few minutes) had an impact on my childhood. Shame, Melissa Sue Anderson!
