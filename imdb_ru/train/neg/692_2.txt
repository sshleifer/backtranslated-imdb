One of the many slashers that appeared in the early eighties, Pranks differs only in the early performance of Daphne Zuniga (The Sure Thing, The Fly 2); her character dies quite early, and the rest of the film is completely forgotten. <br /> <br /> During the Christmas holidays, a group of students voluntarily trying to clean the school building from a convicted college. The mad assassin, however, throws a wrench into his works, methodically striking young people in different disgusting ways. <br /> <br /> Using every clich√© in the film, director Jeffrey Obrow delivers a tedious and uninteresting horror that made me pray for the dead characters so that I could look for something more worthwhile. Most of the deaths (which, let's face it, that's why we usually watch this film) are short and not so scary; the only truly horrific images appear at the very end, when the bodies of the victims are discovered by the survivors (there is one particularly bloody, dismembered corpse - the film could have done more). <br /> <br /> At the last minute, the film saves itself from shame, getting the least possible points from me, having a pleasant unexpectedly difficult final, but in fact it is only for finalist slashers.
