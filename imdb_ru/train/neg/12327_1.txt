The previous reviewer said that the film is not so bad. What kind?!?!?! The film glorifies the corruption of children. Yes, but Sylvia Christelle was naked in this, so let's give her 5 out of 10 stars. Why not the whole 10? Since the film was “painful,” the child’s shocked looks were “unreal,” and the fat friend was “annoying.” Nowhere in the review does the reviewer express any indignation at the fact that in the 1981 American film there were scenes when the child had sex with an adult woman. I happened to catch this smoking piece of the film during my stay in the hotel where I had a Showtime. For me, even if a fat friend played the storm and was a worthy Oscar, I would still have to give the film only 1 star. Howard Hessman from this television starred in the film at the same time that he appeared in WKRP, especially funny. But don't take my word for it!
