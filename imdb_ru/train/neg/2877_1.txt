My mother worked with Dennis Raider for eleven years, not to mention sharing an office with him. When it was announced that he was BTK, she was shocked. All day she told stories about how she would never see him as the killer of Wichita. I heard her tell them many times. I asked her about many things and attended all the interviews she was asked to go to. I read the entire book written about the Raider, Wichita is my hometown, and I was surprised that this could happen in Kansas. <br /> <br /> Not so long ago there was another film on BTK on television, and I. I thought that it would have been better to portray Dennis’s murders, perhaps even having some clever touches to his motives. <br /> <br /> I will be very rude with the flaws in this film. This is based on how my mom portrayed him, all my testimony about him and on videotapes I saw when he spoke. <br /> <br /> First, the camera angles were awful. It looked like it was taken on a home video camera. The game was terrible, and I could not even look at it. <br /> <br /> Denis Raider has never had long hair. Dennis Raider was a “very anal man” and was a “follow the rules” guy. He was not as good as the movie made him look, he was very polite and sharp, like a business. The same goes for his killings, as far as we all know. If you have seen his confession in court, you can already guess. <br /> <br /> As for the obsession with carnage? Not. I have never read, or Dennis Rader admitted that he has problems with cruelty to animals or with beetles. In fact, he practiced on cats and dogs for choking techniques. Yet throughout the entire film, he depicted animals on the faces of his victim and behaved as if he cared for their well-being. <br /> <br /> Dennis Rader never killed people he knew, he confessed to this, but in the film about his first murder he tells a lady that he knows her too. <br /> <br /> I really don’t even want to go to this film, and I already rant. This is NOT what you want to see if you are interested in real BTK events. This is NOT what you want to see if you want a good horror movie. If you want half porn filmed with some episodes of the massacre to serve the side, then this is your movie type.
