I am a big fan of the works of Ludlum and the Secret One books, and I often thought how incredible they would be turned into a film. Imagine my excitement to learn that such a film really exists! The Aida Factor, the first in the series, seemed like an obvious start. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, the film was disappointing. Simple elements from the film, such as Griffin's first meeting with Smith, are unnecessarily different from the book and are much less exciting. Several characters also played poorly. For starters, Dorff is as unhappy as Smith. A good actor, just an incredibly bad choice, as he is too soft and unable to show many of the features that are decisive for John Smith. <br /> <br /> Renaming, reassigning and even omission of some characters worsens the film even more. For example, the removal of Victor Tremont and the entire history of the virus, including the participation of VAXHAM, makes the whole point of the film somewhat hazy. Marty Zellerbach is a very large part of the book, and the place he occupies varies greatly in the back seat (not to mention that the character of the film has nothing to do with the character in the book) is another big mistake. <br /> <br /> Rachel Russell is supposed to be Randy Russell from the book. Not only should she be the sister of Sophie Amsden (should be called Sophia Russell), but she also needs to work for the CIA, and not in The Secret Side. Which brings me to my last point, and I think one of the most important. COVERT-ONE doesn't even exist at the moment! Only in the second book of the “Secret One” series, developed by the President as a preventive measure against further biological terrorism. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I could go on all day. In short - if you like books and you want to see a good adaptation, I'm afraid you will be very disappointed. Even as an action movie, it is rather average, mainly due to the lack of brilliance and bad effects. The playful storyline and the script “dull like water” are the last nails in the very cheap coffin of this film.
