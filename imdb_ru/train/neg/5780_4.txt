I really wanted this film to be liked, and I watched all the time, thinking that it should become better. Don't get me wrong, this is not the worst movie ever, but it never justifies its potential. The idea is good, the cast is great (I was particularly excited to witness David Noton's return), and, my God, you can say that everyone tried their best. It just fails again and again. Brutal Massacre should be a constant reminder to directors that only Christopher Guest can make films about Christopher Gest, and although he makes it simple, you should probably just forget to try the same thing. Naughton and Brian O'Halloran are fantastic in this, and they should be seen more often ... that's why they get 4 stars from me. If you have the horror of “Spinal Tap,” I suspect that you might want the guy who made “Spinal Tap” to control him ... just thinking out loud there.
