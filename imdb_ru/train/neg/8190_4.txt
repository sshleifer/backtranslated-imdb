My Take: tired Christmas comedy. The laughter is tired, and the talents behind it seem too big. <br /> <br /> I love holidays as much as the next guy (even if I often have bad occasions with holiday blues), but it looks like it's just a dump for the comedy “Holiday”, which will be a bad movie any day of the year, but that does not make them less painful during the season. As if we already had enough SANTA CLAUSE films (three and * gulp * are still considered), who wants to watch a movie about their brother? In the storyline, which would be at home with the Disney SANTA CLAUSE franchise (with the exception of the rare coarse humor and Santa's Little Mate in a short skirt), FRED CLAUS is a mockery that lasts 116 minutes. Of course, Jolly All Saint-Nick has a brother, but where is he going? <br /> <br /> This is really a shame. FRED CLAUS is endowed with an cast that could make it a pleasant Christmas comedy that will probably melt with the snow, but that would be much better than that. Vince Vaughn is your typical snob, but we are inclined to believe that he is indeed the long-lost brother of ageless Santa (Paul Giamatti), who invites his good brother to visit. Mrs. Claus (Miranda Richardson) is reluctant, and, even worse, an efficiency expert (Kevin Spacey) came to closely monitor Santa Claus, and his IT is close to closing. Hah And guess who plays Santa's mother! Katie Bates, of course. Elizabeth Banks - Santa's assistant, Charlene, John Michael Higgins - one of the elves, and Rachel Wesz plays Fred's girlfriend! I do not know whether I praised the casting or beat him. Here we have familiar faces to add a touch of quality, but they are too few for work. <br /> <br /> As for humor, the best FRED CLAUS can think of is Santa’s brother. his exact opposite and some joke about the DJ's elf. I have to admit that I had a few chuckles with Fred, who attended a group consultation for celebrity brothers (where he was joined by Stephen Baldwin, Roger Clinton and Frank Stallone), but the chuckles begin and end there. Worse, the film is even sentimental, which should make us "feel good" and teach us a lesson about "what Christmas really means." Obviously, Christmas means for Hollywood getting as much of our remaining Christmas shopping money as possible. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of 5.
