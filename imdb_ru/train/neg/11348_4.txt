The six soldiers who are going to be sent home and discharged get drunk and sneak into a cult meeting in Asia. Surrounded by hooded figures, two dancers pretend to fight. Behind them on the altar opens a wicker basket, a drawn figure appears and begins to imitate a snake, finally biting one of the dancers in the neck. Imitation of a snake is dressed in several voluminous tights. (This is definitely a female snake imitation.) A member of the cult who stole them for a secret meeting, repeatedly warned six men that the ceremonies should not be interrupted, and certainly photos should not be taken, otherwise they would be hunted. down and killed. Naturally, the soldiers take a flash photo, send cult members to angry hysteria, steal a snake's basket and run away with it on an Asian night. <br /> <br /> One of the guys, the most offensive and caustic, dies from a cobra bite on his neck, although no one can explain how a snake hit his hospital room. <br /> <br /> In New York, it all seems pretty old news when discharged people settle in their civilian lives, while still maintaining their connection with each other. Their work ranges from a bowling manager (David Janssen) to a graduate student (Richard Long). James Dobson, Jack Kelly and Marshall Thompson are also part of the neighborhood. Richard Long has a good blond girlfriend. Kelly is a bit of a reckless womanizer. But they all get along well enough, and they all seem happy. <br /> <br /> Then a dark, fleeting, mysterious woman (Faith Domegg) appears, and Marshall Thompson sympathizes with her and hints at her. Group. <br /> <br /> Guess what happens. First, Janssen is frightened by the shadow in the back seat and dies in a car accident. Kelly then visits Domegg. Something scares him so much that he falls through the window and falls when falling on the pavement. Long and Dobson are beginning to suspect that the viewer already knows that Domerg is somehow connected with death. They also believe that, perhaps, it turns into a cobra that takes place. Dobson confronts her with her suspicions, and she proves her point. <br /> <br /> By this time, Long and Thompson are completely exhausted, especially Thompson, who is in love with Domerg and found that she also attracts him. although he must explain to her what love is. Regardless of. The last reckless attack of a female cobra on Long's girlfriend - not one of the six original perpetrators - and Thompson must throw the snake out the window. On the sidewalk below, the body changes to Domerga. The end. <br /> <br /> I think I will skip most of the questions that the plot raises. I will simply mention one of the most prosaic of them in passing. Who paid for Domerg's fare from Asia to New York? Who pays her utility bills at the hotel? Who paid for her spectacular wardrobe? Why does she speak English so well? What the hell is going on? Writers and filmmakers clearly saw some of Val Lewton’s modest horror films, and although there wasn’t much effort put into this production, they stole Lewton’s tricks without embarrassment. For example, in Lewton's Cat Men, a woman turns into a black leopard, but, with one tiny exception, the threat is always kept in the shadows and all the more terrible for her. Most transformations also use shadows here, but unlike Lewton, shadows are clumsy and unequivocal. <br /> <br /> Lewton also sometimes used what he called "buses." Lewton's first "bus" was literal. A potential victim hurries alone through the dark tunnels of Central Park with only the sound of footsteps. Something or someone is following her. She freezes from fear under a street lamp. Something rustles the branches of the bushes above it. She looks up. There is a loud, wheezing screech that makes your hair stand on end. This is a bus that uses air brakes to stop it. The producers used at least two “buses” in this film, and they mean nothing. For example, a guy is distracted at a crossroads, and suddenly a truck rumbles, which almost hits him. There is no installation on the shot. He stuck with a shoe horn. <br /> <br /> I don’t really like movies that perpetuate a snake stereotype such as slimy, ugly, poisonous and phallic. In fact, no snakes are slimy, most of them are harmless, and many are extraordinarily beautiful. In addition, they are more feminine than men's in their winding movements and serpentine approach to goals. Do you want a reptile symbol for masculinity? Try a six-line racer. This is really a quick lizard. When he sees something to eat, he breaks and devours him. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you want to watch some good, low-budget scary movies, do not worry about it. Find "Cat People" or one of Lewton's other secondary masterpieces, whose obvious copy.
