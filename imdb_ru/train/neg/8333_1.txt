This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The game is bad and the storyline is almost incomprehensible. Whether you love liners or any ships in this regard does not matter. As for the special effects, they are not in the film. The entire film crew was probably on a boat in the rough seas, not in the studio, and when some men are “hit” (if you can even call it that), their reaction is absolutely unreal. Weapons are quieter than mute. How this film can receive two awards raises serious questions about the state of the human mind. Well that's all. This review is probably more fun to read than to watch a movie. If someone is considering viewing or buying, I would seriously advise you against this for obvious reasons. I said this includes a spoiler. If the fact that some people are being stabbed and firing a pistol is a distribution of the plot. I suppose it's because they are the only good parts of the film.
