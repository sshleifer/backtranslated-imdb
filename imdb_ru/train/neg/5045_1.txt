Claustrophobic camera angles that do not help the film: Too long a person takes pictures only when you have a feeling that the bottom half of the film is missing (the screen is cut off), because it seems that important actions are taking place on, but you cannot see them. In any case, the film is already too much confusion, so these viewing angles worsen it and do not contribute to clever visualization. <br /> <br /> I like skillfully made films and non-standard camera work. I can handle deep and slow movies. But this one tries hard to be tricky and, in my opinion, fails. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to be attached to any of the characters, because they are not well developed. To work out the characters, you need more than small long shots of the face, at least with this set of script + director + actors. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, because of the scenario is some kind of not very good game? and director or because of the actors. <br /> <br /> In the future, Iâ€™ll definitely stay away from films written and filmed by Le Y. <br /> <br /> What an annoying movie, even for those interested in this part of the story, and for those spent time in shanghai.
