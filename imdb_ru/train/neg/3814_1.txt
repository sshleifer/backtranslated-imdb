I see little girls enjoying this show, but calling it a family show is ridiculous. I am amazed at how well it is remembered after all these years. This is an extremely unfunny and stupid show about the widowed father of three, living with his late wife's brother and his stupid school friend, and others as the seasons go on. All storylines usually have a very dumb lesson. In the middle of each episode, someone is angry with someone else, and each episode that they make up ends with a light, unfunny joke. As for the actors, I didn't like them either. Bob Saget was terribly unfunny as a father with the duties of a mother. Dave Kulier is a joke at 30 that makes cartoon voices and behaves like a child, and he is terrible. John Stamos was the most tolerant character, but he was so excited that it was difficult to watch him. The oldest girl, DJ, was a really bad actress on the show and never showed any emotions. The average girl Stephanie was too excited, like an annoying younger sister. The younger girl Michelle showed how bad the actresses were the Olsen twins. You can always tell when they turn them off. Storylines for too many storylines were so unreally stupid that it is worthy of perversion. This is a “family” show, which tried to replace any good substance with attractiveness and love, and although they are needed for a show about the family, they are too overdone. It will be remembered as my most unloved sit-com of the 80s and 90s. <br /> <br /> My rating: terrible show. TVG 30 min.
