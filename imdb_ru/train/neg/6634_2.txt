First look at the cover of this picture, it looks like a good rock and roll movie. But don't let the cover fool you or the fact that it contains Alice Cooper and Blondie. The storyline is just awful, as is the acting. Simple and clear: BAD <br /> <br /> This is not a film about roady, it's just a subtle love story, so terrible that you can see through it. The only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack. Some good songs, and that's why I give 2 out of 10. If it weren't for the music, it would be 0 out of 10. Meat Loaf is a terrible actor (at least he was in 1980), and a girl who plays a fan, doesn't even look good! This film was a big disappointment for me, because it makes a lot of good promises.
