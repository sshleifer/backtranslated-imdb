A lot of people seem to like the film, so I feel somewhat ill, giving a bad review. But after sitting 96 minutes, I feel that I have to do it. Where the hell is the plot in this movie ?! I must have missed it, I waited for the plot to unfold and nothing happened. Of course, the finale was “somewhat shocking,” but they did not match that. I forgot who someone was half the time, so they really didn’t develop characters. The acting was so-so, most of the time it was believable, but most of the time I saw it. So ... without giving anything away, I must say that if you do not like the actors in the film, there is no real reason to watch this film. I could be mistaken, but I just did not understand why there was so little or too much film. I can not decide what it will be, so I say, judge for yourself. I don’t even know if it would be a good idea, cost or anything ... <br /> <br /> Plot: 0/10 Characters: 1/10 Acting: 2/10 General: 3/10 I feel that in fact it is too high, I stay with my voice upstairs.
