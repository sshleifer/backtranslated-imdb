The film is basically a boring series of horrific clich√©s that do not give a real cross-cultural understanding. The Middle Eastern section of the route is described in a particularly annoying way: it is obvious that these are mud brick villages, dirty paths in the middle of the desert, women in black clothes and a dancer. It is interesting how camels and date palms were missing in the whole picture. The identity of the two main characters is very awkwardly drafted, and many situations are hardly credible. <br /> <br /> The original idea might be interesting, but at the end of the day, if you are looking for cultural insights, you should skip this film.
