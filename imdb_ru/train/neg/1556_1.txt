I was China in this film. I chose the pseudonym Sheeba Alahani, because at that time I was modeling in Italy, and they could not correctly pronounce my real name, so I chose Sheeba and then added Alahani, because it looked like Alohalani. <br /> <br /> I have never acted before (and it shows), but it was so much fun to shoot. They gave me "acting classes" every morning (which, obviously, were useless). They baptized my voice (thank God). <br /> <br /> David and Peter were on the set, full of good humor and jokes. This film was never meant to be taken seriously; it was a tax write-off according to inside information. <br /> <br /> I give him 1 because I have a sense of humor, but 10 for fun, in which I "played."
