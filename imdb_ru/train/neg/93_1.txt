The woman asks for advice on the road to get to the mysterious city, and hears two nasty stories from the local geezer, both related to zombies. But maybe fate has something unpleasant for her ... <br /> <br /> Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I've ever seen. In fact, I must admit, so bad that I quickly went through most of the garbage. And that was a lot, believe me. It works in just 69 minutes, and there are still tons of filler. You have several skinheads who do a lot of push-ups, lots of dull kissing and kissing scenes between stupid teenagers (who rhymed, mi hi) and some great examples of why some people should never become actors. for title characters they don't even have a footnote in the film. Yes, in the introduction you get more undead than the previous function! Although, considering how pitiful it is to break out of the sockets and eating the brain (among other “charms”), maybe this is a hidden blessing. <br /> <br /> And in the end, everything looks like it so much that it was filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Torn camera work, scratches on the print, flickering lights ... I had to rub my eyes when I realized that this was done in 2001, and not in 1971. Even clothes and trendy looks are outdated by about three decades! <Br /> <br /> If you think that I am not qualified to review Chronicles that have not seen the entire film, then continue. You are trying to sit through it, I am sure that you will not even reach the first appearance of crazy color freaks, before making excuses and leaving. It's really funny that someone decided to release it, and, frankly, you will get much more pleasure putting a drink on a disc than trying a DVD player with this horrible excuse of horror. In fact, don't be surprised if he packs his bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You have been warned ... 0/10 <br /> <br /> P.S. What kind of horror with 18 ratings makes a woman put on a massive sports bra during the mandatory sex scene ?! You see, the film cannot even understand this role correctly ...
