I saw this movie on TV. this afternoon, and I do not see how anyone can sit through this piece of garbage. This is not at all ridiculous and requires your conclusions. down a few steps. I know that this film is for children, but this does not mean that authors should take their mind for granted. I bet that the writers were sitting at a large wooden table and decided that a) The word "turd" means a big laugh. b) A child four feet tall can dive into a ten-foot basketball net. c) children should always fight with the kidnappers, armed with weapons, because the kidnappers will fall for everything, and d) 3 months of karate training is all you need to beat the so-called "ninja" with swords. One good thing I can say about this film is that it contains the weakest suburban “gang” in the world that could not scare anyone. Maybe the guys from MST3K could laugh at this movie. Don't worry about this shit excuse movie.
