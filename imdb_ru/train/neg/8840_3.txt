Here is a great example of what not to do when you have a great idea. That is not the problem? The concept is fresh and full of potential, but the script and its execution lack any real substance. He should grab you from the very beginning, and then pull a little on emotions, interest and invest in characters. This film does not have what it takes to take off and endure a flight, and here's why. First, you are not very worried about the characters, because they are not presented in the way people can relate to them, I mean, this is not Superman or Mission Impossible here, itâ€™s rather normal people who are in a stressful situation. They are not believable in the way they act and interact. Example: Jeffrey Combs, like a cop because of chewing, is a gum, a frown and a tense appearance, but this is not the way to go here. I mean what is it? He looks like he's in the toilet or something. I loved him in the reanimator, and the way he played the intense / neurotic, undervalued medical genius was right on the money. But not for this, he is trying too hard to compensate for this, looking so tense and irritable, but still in an easy neurotic manner, it is not natural, I am surprised that he did not sprain his jaw during the shooting. The film is mainly about life support, he has hardly a pulse, and he made me wait for something that would never come.
