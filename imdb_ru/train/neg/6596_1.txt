This is a film that is watched in awful silence with jaws and spectacles, and yet continues to look hypnotized, as if watching a train wreck in slow motion. And yet, deep down in his mind, thoughts come up: “Who on Earth shone this garbage with a green light?” <br /> <br /> Some of the previous user comments talk about things like “A good way to introduce children to Laurel and Hardy “- insulting children everywhere. The fact that children will need some kind of curriculum to learn to love comedy, shows a deep misunderstanding of the nature of children around the world. Others commented on the correctness of the two-star Laurel and Hardy characteristics, to which I would answer: so WHAT? would think that a rash Ilma BOMBS, based on favorite TV shows (Rocky and Bullwinkle, The Avengers, Flipper, Mod Detachment, ad nauseam), would teach Hollywood that there are some things that are simply impossible to recreate. Movies Laurel and Hardy are easily available on video: why bother that? <br /> <br /> As for F. Murray Abraham, the great actor of the stage and screen ... well, all I can say is that he must have had problems with the IRS. <br /> <br /> Run, do not leave the TV, if this garbage appears!
