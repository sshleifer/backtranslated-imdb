Not only did they misunderstand the characters, not only slop voices, not only writers seriously need girlfriends, not only really rough drawings, but it seems that they were mostly created between the ages of 1-6 years. The only episode I've ever seen from this show that made me watch was “The Family Question,” because I liked the character Robin. And sometimes I think this is just a common copy of Batman. Example: At BTAS, Bruce is friends with Harvey Dent, right? For two episodes, he turns into an unlikely villain TwoFace. In The Show, Bruce is friends with this guy from Ethan, and in two episodic stories, he turns into an unlikely villain Clayface. It was just a small example (it may not even be true), but in short, this is the MOST IMPORTANT attempt of the Batman series. And it says something.
