I am amazed at the positive reviews about this completely boring movie. <br /> <br /> Often in foreign films, I miss reviews that complain about slow rates and seem to be “inaction”, as many of the best international films do. live according to the West Hollywood model of cinematic narration. <br /> <br /> I like the frequent tricks and the lack of clichés in the arena of foreign films. I like that many foreign films do not tie things up with a neat, pleasant little bow. <br /> <br /> However, this particular film did not bring any redemptive value during the time I spent watching it. No meaningful character development, no captivating storyline, no way to emotionally entice any character on the screen. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: a group of emotionally immature, biased, biased, colonialists mistreated their slaves, and the little girl got hurt from her only friend when the “home boy” finally got bored and insulted her, <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the above paragraph is sharp and dramatic, this film will tire you while playing the script. I was not so interested that it took three meetings to finish it, and I would not even do that if it were not for the positive assessments. <br /> <br /> If you have no academic interest in the period, I strongly recommend that you avoid this period.
