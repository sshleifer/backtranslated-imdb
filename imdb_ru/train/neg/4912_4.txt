Without reading the novel, I can not say how true this film is. The story is a typical mystery material: the killer targets the newlyweds; A female researcher falls in love with her partner and is put on a fatal illness. Yes, it sounds like a soap opera, and that's how she plays. The first 2/3 are boring, except for the killings, and the last 1/3 partially return when they pick up speed in the direction of their winding completion. <br /> <br /> Acting is strictly not up to the mark, although itâ€™s difficult to blame the actors: the script is terrible. During the last 1/3 you stop noticing, because the film actually becomes interesting, but it is only the last 1/3. Directed by Russell Mulcahy, he understands everything, but he can do so much with the television budget and network censors behind his back. He is largely limited to fast, sharp and distorted lenses, although he managed to squeeze a couple of "under the floor" shots during the killings in the club lounge. Unfortunately, since it is made for television, the cool compositional details that he uses so well with the wider image are not found anywhere. Note to producers: give this person a reasonable budget and an anamorphic lens when you hire him. <br /> <br /> To summarize: this film is bad by film standards and mediocre by television standards (see CSI instead). If you're in the mood for such a movie, I have some great tips: take a copy of Deep Red by Dario Argento (my best recommendation; excellent movie), Opera, or even Tenebre. They are stronger in each category.
