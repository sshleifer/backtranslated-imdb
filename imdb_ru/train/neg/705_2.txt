There is so little of the fantastic book by Anne Rice, that what is here does not make sense. Some of the characters - intense and amazing characters - do not fall on the screen at all, and those who do it are brought to such an extent that there is no reason for their existence. <br /> <br /> Where is the relationship between Christophe and Marcel? Where is the continuation of the relationship between Marcel and Juliet? Why does Dolly Rose appear at all, since her story is never explained? Where is the rape and atonement of Marie, whose most important sign (and fall) is that she can pass for white - and her marriage to Richard? Why does the film end up beating Marcel from the hands of his father? We know nothing about Agla, except that she is a bitch who hates her husband; why there is no background explaining this hatred? <br /> <br /> With regard to the performances, there is no one that is better than mediocre, although, most likely, this is due to a lousy scenario. The best of what the actor who plays Richard has, but Richard is not enough on the screen to save the film. The worst of them - Jasmine Guy in the role of Dolly Rose, although again it all comes down to the fact that the actress has nothing to do with what it is not enough to work with. <br /> <br /> In general, it's just terrible. I thought that no movie turned into Anna Riceâ€™s book could be worse than EXIT TO EDEN, but FEAST OF ALL SAINTS makes this mess look like a critical hit. How is it that Rice is such a slut that she allows her best works to become such garbage on the screen?
