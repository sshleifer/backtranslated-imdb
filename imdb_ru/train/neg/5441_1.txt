Of all the films I've seen, this one, The Rage, must be one of the worst. Direction, LOGIC, continuity, changes in the plot and dialogue made me cry from pain. "How can anyone come up with something so shitty?" Gary Busey is known for his films "B", but this is a sure film "W". (W = waste). <br /> <br /> Take, for example: about two dozen FBI employees and local lawyers surround the trailer of a jeep wagon. Inside the jeep there is an MA and he is “confused” about why all the police are going. After a few seconds, a huge exchange of fire begins, and MA kill right away. Police shoot a jeep with Gary and the company shooting them. The police are falling like dominoes, and the jeep with Gary drives around in a circle and does not fall under one bullet. M.A. killed, and Gary did not seem to notice, damn, this guy is cool. Truly a miracle, since six shooters with 300 bullets did not become such a miracle.
