James Gandolfini is a good actor, so one day he would take part in this funny junkie. Affleck is just a lightweight that simply can not cut it, the rest of the actors are really unforgettable. I saw it in the USA in an empty theater, and soon I understood why the place was empty in about 10 minutes. I went to the end, it was so bad, so imagine my surprise when I saw a film in England with a vivid reportage from that yoyo "Paul Ross" on a Sunday weekend. I always expect Ross to save me money on movie tickets. If he says that the film is good, I immediately go to this site to check it out. This movie would cost on a DVD for Â£ 1.99 at a supermarket near you.
