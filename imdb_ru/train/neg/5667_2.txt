If I checked IMDb before renting this DVD to Netflix, I would have a couple of hours of my life back. I am frankly suspicious when I see that the director of the film also wrote this. In this case, according to the credits, the same guy was a “script writer and director” - unfortunately, an indicator of the overall quality of these products. There were several interesting moments (for example, the scene of Judy Tenuta reminded of her early routine comedies touting Judism), which made me appreciate these two stars, not one. However, these moments were few, and they were far from each other ... and I almost did not see them, because the initial sequence was almost incomprehensible to me, not to mention reprehensible in his violence. I admit that I came back again to look at this part, to see if I missed something that would help me understand this as soon as I see it all. No, although I at least found out who the characters are that will turn out to be important later. The “rotating camera” technique was excessive and essentially meaningless. I found myself talking to a TV screen: “What?!?” Or “For God's sake, come on with this!” Not recommended.
