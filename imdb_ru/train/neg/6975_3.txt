Oh god, what an idiot movie! Incredibly cheap with fake special effects (the creature plays one guy in a lame suit) and a silly plot. All conversations are incredibly bad, and these actors (HA! HA! HA!) Are ridiculous. For example, I have never seen such annoying characters as in this junk (these stupid children or a pregnant woman with her husband and many others). In general, this is great entertainment if you are drunk. Avoid this like the plague. I'm drunk? I do not think so ...
