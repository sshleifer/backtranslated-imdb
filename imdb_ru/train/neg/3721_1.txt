Two films are useful in order to scare people before God, this is the “Event Horizon”. One has a significant and sharp message, the other is as one-dimensional as a religious film can receive. It is a pity that Paul Anderson went to the damned films "Resident Evil", he really had something going on. <br /> <br /> “Thief in the night” is held back by many obvious independent attributes of the film (acting, storytelling, dialogue and belief) and it is obvious what the film intends from the very beginning. The Christian film industry has not learned from the failures of this, so we are stuck with Omega Code, Behind and other Tribulation films. Their main element is that they are so interested in selling their message: “Save, guys!” That everything else is second only after the audience hits the head with the Bible. <br /> <br /> In general, I can't believe that I even write so much about a film that is ineffective. Skip this completely and go back to Sam Neil, knocking out his eyeballs. 1 of 5
