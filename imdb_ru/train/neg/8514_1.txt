I give this film ONE, because it is really a terrible film. The DVD track is so bad that I actually have an ear ache. But the vision, however fragmented, shows something really fashionable in Italian society. I will not go into the details of what really was so shocking, but various incidents are absolutely abnormal. So for the meaning of the kink, I give this one. Otherwise, video, photography, acting adult actors / actresses are just a poor-quality, practical joke for people who love foreign films. The main character, Roberto, possesses a full range of emotions, but is exaggerated to the point of being incredible. However, the children in the film are mostly 3/4 years old, and they are authentic, and the film gives an idea of ​​Italian life ..
