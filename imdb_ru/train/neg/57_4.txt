What does the “Executive Producer” do in the film? If I remember correctly, this is a person who has attracted financial support for making a film. You may notice that in a large number of movies with Sean Connery in the lead role, he is also an executive producer, which means that Connery was raising money himself, since he is a big player. Unfortunately, it should also be noted that starring a large number of films with Sean Connery was done solely because he managed to raise money because he is a major Hollywood player, as a rule, this indicates that when the credits say that the executive producer and the star from the film are one and the same, the film itself is nothing more than a stellar vehicle with a plot / script that is not fully thought out <br /> <br /> PROTOCOL follows the saga of Sunny Davis, the fucking waitress Cocktail Saves Invited he receives the title of highest diplomat and as a reward. Probably? As events unfold, Miss Davis (who has problems with the ability to put two sentences together) turns out to be in more outlandish and less likely situations. When I say that the PROTOCOL plays Goldie Hawn, who is also the executive producer of the film, do you understand what I'm saying that the story / script is not from scratch?
