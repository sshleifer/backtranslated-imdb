At first I didn’t want to watch this movie because the trailer gave the impression of a normal and overly-expected film ... but, as I recently had the pleasure of discovering the amazing "Mensonges et trahisons et plus si affinité", which was Perfectly Directed and written by Laurent Tirard screenwriter "prête-moi ta main"), I changed my mind and decided to try, thinking that "Prête-moi ta main" would be just as good as "mensonges ..." And this is absolutely not the case. The script is not bad, but he is not as well directed as "Manzongi ...", the actors are not as generous (especially Charlotte, as usual boring), as Ed Ward Baer or Clovis Kornilyak and, frankly, I still do not understand how such shit can have such success, even with such casting ... In any case, the story could be the reason for creating so many interesting stories, but this not as good as the "Mensonges ..." Tirard, although it is also written by him. Easy, no wonder and lazy work. Completely overvalued!
