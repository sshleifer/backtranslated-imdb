I want to say that the acting is bad, but I think it was the direction that made it so. I never thought of the Highlander (the same director), but this can be blamed in the 80s. <br /> <br /> However, this one has no excuses. People shoot, leaving the trenches with a man in front of him!? This kind of mistakes, along with an unclear timeline, strange combat tactics, irregular cuts and poor visual effects, make this film poor quality for everyone. <br /> <br /> Whereas many others commented on this whole American bullshit. The German general is practically afraid of his captive American private. Be prepared to swallow most of it, albeit in small doses. <br /> <br /> To summarize, we can say that it is not a terrible, but still an unsurpassed war film in all aspects.
