Baba - Radzhinikant will never forget this name in his life. This is the film that caused his fall. It was released with a big sensation, but it crashed and turned into serious financial losses for its manufacturers and distributors. Radzhikikantu had to personally pay them for the losses incurred. Soon after his release, he tried to get involved in politics, but failed miserably. This is a very bad movie with a terrible acting game, poor quality makeup and a pitiful script. Throughout the film, Radzhinikant looks like a man suffering from some kind of illness. I am one of the unfortunate souls who saw Baba, the first day of the first show in the theater. The spectators were so bored that most of them left the theater before the intermission. Sorry, I will not recommend this to anyone.
