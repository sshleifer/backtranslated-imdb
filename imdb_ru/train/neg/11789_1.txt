Actually had to stop it. Don't get me wrong, love bad monster movies. But this one was too boring, despite the intense music that leads you nowhere. The actress had too many teeth, and the moment when she came into contact with one of the animals was too obvious a cliche. This film fully covers the DVD cover, which looks quite interesting. From the cover you can expect a giant monster, but you get these cute not as giant as the expected electric eels. I switched to watching another movie called “Killer Rats”, but this is another review. Deep Shock was really shit, a big shame, considering the fact that it looks quite expensive.
