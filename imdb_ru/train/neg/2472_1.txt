Anyone who actually had the opportunity to sit in this film and leave, feeling that this is a good film, does not appreciate quality films. This film was insulting to watch, the director was the quality of films in high school, as well as cinematography. The Blair Witch project had the best cinematography, and I hate this move with passion! The storyline could be a very rich and very good film, but from the first 10 minutes until the end of the film it did not work. Someone mentioned that this film is about children's imagination, well, all is well. But they could still do better with this scenario than they did. I mean, come on, an Indian in the store. The child looked at the little idol and suddenly imagined an Indian and the whole story about the Indian spirit called Wendigo? What they mention to the store employee, and she casually says that no one here besides me works, so you think the script of the creepy ghost is good, but then it just changes the amount for an idol, and we forget how this guy. It was so unconvincing that it goes beyond the pathetic. The ending made you think not only about what happened to Otis in the hospital, but also with the feeling of OMG !!! Why the hell am I just wasting my time watching this !! This movement, which I recommend NOT to watch, there are better quality films that will not offend your intellect! Thank God, I never had to pay to watch this movie, I would have demanded my money back! For those who were easily entertained by this film ... itâ€™s very sad that you lowered your standards to this level of film making to actually say that it was a good movie.
