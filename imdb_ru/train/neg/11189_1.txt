Always enjoy great movies that relate to supernatural and deep thoughts of the Spiritual World. Nevertheless, this film simply distracted me from its production and direction. There is nothing to delve into the deep discussion about what this story should tell; all i can say is that it was a big waste of time and effort to bring it to the big screen. The actors, namely: Mark Addy, Thomas Garrett, gave an outstanding performance at home, in England, and we saw him in the TV series "Still standing." Heath Ledger played a real evil dude, and we recently saw him in Brokeback Mountain, 05, who gave an excellent secondary role. Shannin Sossaman (Mara Sinclair) did a good job tempting the priest from the church, not recognized by any faith. Do not waste your time, you will be sorry!
