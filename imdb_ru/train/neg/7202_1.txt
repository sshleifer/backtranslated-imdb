Since I loved the Inspector Gadget cartoon in the 80s, I went to see this movie. I wasted my money. The plot was very thin. In addition, the film could not long interest me. I was glad it was over. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the Inspector of the Gadget, look at the cartoon instead. It was much better than the movie.
