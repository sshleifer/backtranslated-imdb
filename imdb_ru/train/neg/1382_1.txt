The film was terrible. The theater was dead in silence, because everyone was embarrassed watching such garbage. I think that someone made Jet Lee a lobotomy and made him execute a script with a dialogue written by a five-year-old child. Martial arts are fine, but if you put them next to the Jackie Chan movies and The Matrix, you'd better see one of them.
