Let me start by saying that I consider myself one of the most (most!) Unbiased movie viewers ... Films are my passion, and I am a big loyal customer in my local box office of cult films. ..I also feel the need to add that they often ask me for advice about films whenever I get there, and it seems to me that I can never leave this place without having a thorough discussion or exchange of ideas about what is happening. in the field of cult cinema ... I like to shoot strange things, and that is why this film was recommended by one of the guys at the cult video place. He told me that he thought I should have seen it, and since something was said on the cover that it was a film with the atmosphere of Yodorovsky (one of my favorites!), I rented it. <br /> <br /> The vote I gave here is not entirely fair, because I did not. I thought it was terrible, I just did not know how to estimate it otherwise. A question mark would be more appropriate ... <br /> <br /> This is the first and only film that literally ached in my stomach: I really felt physically sick! Am I the only one whose belly literally turned? However, I didn’t want to turn it off, or maybe I just couldn’t, because I was fascinated by the opposite ... <br /> <br /> I never want to watch this movie again. <br /> <br /> Not terrible, 1, as I said. Just not my cup of tea (or vodka for that matter) ...
