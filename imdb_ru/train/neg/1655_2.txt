This film really shows his age. The imprint I saw was terrible due to age, but it is possible that there are better prints. However, this was not the main problem with the film. The problem was that, although the film was shot in 1933, in fact, it was a silent film, in which only a minimum of dialogues were scattered in the film in the most amateur way (just a few sentences). Sometimes the backs of the characters were turned, or they talked, covering their faces with their hands - all in a pitiful attempt to hide their lips and “skillfully” (?) Hide the fact that the film was dubbed. Well, it is true that this Czech film would have to be duplicated into many languages, but it was really stupid and obvious to do it this way. It looked just cheap. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film looked low-budget and stupid. Although it is really a shame, because there was a piece of a good story - a young woman who marries an older man who is either gay and / or not interested in women. But in the 21st century, few would really like to go through this archaic mess. Even with a few glimpses of naked (and somewhat stocky) Hedy Lamarr, this is not worth all the fuss that accompanied the film when it debuted. Even by the standards of 1933, this film was poorly made. The only interesting thing in the film is to see how Lamarr looked different in 1933 than the glamorous image created by Hollywood when she came to America - she looks like 2 completely different people. <br /> <br /> This is such an incomplete-looking and technically incomplete film, I don’t see how it received such rave reviews. Only because of technical problems, the film cannot rate 10 or something near it.
