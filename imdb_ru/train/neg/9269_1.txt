Well, since, seeing parts from 1 to 3, I can honestly say that they NEVER should have done part 4. Everything, starting with bad taste, and I really mean a sloppy account and really bad game, I dare to watch everyone on this and not be bored because of their minds. <br /> <br /> I mean that parts 1 to 3 maintained a strong atmosphere on Damionâ€™s plot, but without him this is simply not the same thing. Of course, by the end of the third part I was a little tired of the ongoing storyline, but it was a good completion of the third part. Again, for part 4 there was no reason. Even if they existed, they could have done MUCH better work than this shit I had to put up with, lol. An hour and a half of my life has passed, which I will never see again.
