The knights were just the beginning of the series, a pilot, one might say. The plot (I really shouldn't call it that, there was no plot) was not logical at all, and there were many mistakes, for example [warning, I summarize the plot]: <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, someone said that there were only a couple of these cyborgs (bad guys), but after the climax, Nea learned that there were a lot more left. And it was said that the cyborg was hard to kill, but after a month of training, Nea could kill them with one blow. <br /> <br /> The movie was just a clean hit. I was not at all surprised when I learned that the leading star was a kickboxer. <br /> <br /> There was ONE positive thing in the whole film: it really caused laughter while watching. and talk about it with my friends. I recommend watching it if you need some laughter.
