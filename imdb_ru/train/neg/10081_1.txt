I read some comments about this film and I can only assume that some people have fun easily. This film is nothing. It is so poorly written, directed and acted that it only makes an impression. The characters talk in a cliché dialogue, and the situations are completely implausible. Although it may seem funny and fun, but not because everything is so lifeless, the film becomes boring. It’s as if Lee Rose decided to write a drama about a woman who struggles with her sexuality, but then either the studio executives either didn’t allow her to give a believable taste to the story, or she had no cohabitants. This film may be included in the Encyclopedia as the standard release of the bad film Lifetime TV.
