Honestly, this film is another one of a series of huge disappointments ... most of these so-called masters of horror films are terrible only in terms of their sub-partial effects and ridiculous plot lines ... except Ron Perlman, everyone else in this film cannot act to save its life ... shots sounded as if someone was playing Bop-it under a boom microphone or something, and looked completely unreal ... In general, this one the film is about as scary as Home Alone ... the only good ones Rami are Cigarettes Burns, Jennifer and maybe Pelts ... I donâ€™t know how these directors can sleep at night knowing that they messed up the same genre that some of them usually understood ...,
