I stopped at BB and took 4 zombie films to watch the weekend. Now I understand that the effect will be stupid, the action will be subordinate, and the sets will be suspicious. So I do not expect much. But it must have at least a story. Stories cost nothing but time ..... obviously, they also did not have time. <br /> <br /> In Zombie Nation, there were 5 zombies that appeared at the end of the film, and everything looked like new prostitute waves. The image of a zombie on the front cover NEVER appears in a film. It was awful to watch, and I had nothing to offer the genre. <br /> <br /> The duration of the performance is only 81 minutes, but it seemed to be 2 hours. According to my wife (who could only hear this movie, since she was on the computer in another room), it sounded like porn zombies .... which, if you think about it, sounds kinda gross ... but this it wasn't even that good. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can do is that the writer may have tried to do too many things, and in the end there was an incoherent mess. <br /> <br /> This turned out to be a free rental, and I still feel ripped off. I rated it as 1 out of 10 because IMDb does not allow me to use decimals.
