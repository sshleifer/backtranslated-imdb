Wow, my first review of this film was so negative that it was not excluded. I will try to soften it. Let's be real !!! No one wants to watch a Chuck Norris movie, where he is not the main character. In the end there was a good fight scene, but the rest of the film was smelly. I have to wonder if old Chuck can't just talk more with the best. Did he really slow down so much that he had to turn into trash and hope that his reputation would help him go through the entire film? Chuck is a terrific martial artist, and as we saw from Walker, a Texas Ranger is a pretty good actor, but the trick is to combine both of these qualities in his films, but this one is not. Very saddens us fans of Norris. Chuck, remain the main character in your films because it doesn't work for you ... Gary
