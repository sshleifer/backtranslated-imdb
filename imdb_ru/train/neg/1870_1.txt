I used to always love the bill because of his great script and characters, but lately I feel that he has become an emotional type of soap. If you look at advertising photos / posters of the bill, you will see that two officers are hugging / kissing or have something to do with friendship, while advertising bill shots have long shown something to do with crime. This proves that it has changed a lot: from a completely stunning police drama to an ordinary television series. When I watch it, I feel that I am watching the police version of Coronation Street or something like that. I have to say that I still like this bill, because I am interested in the work of the police and such things, but I really miss the greatness that Bill had. I want to rate it as 2 out of ten, because you have to admit that it was completely destroyed by the people who accepted the bill. <br /> <br /> As for the script and characters, they both went down, most of the great characters are now gone (although some still remain, I think), and Iâ€™m not saying that newer characters are bad or something something else, because they are definitely wrong, they just lack the rigid appearance, personality and scenarios that all the old characters used to have, because most of the new ones at the moment are associated with stupid relationships and family problems. <br /> <br /> In general, Bill is one of the few police programs on television these days. watching will always be a terribly interesting thing, but, as I said, she has lost most of her uniqueness (if this is the correct spelling) and will now be classified as a terrible, unreal television soap. <br /> <br /> It is recommended to look after the stupidity of the involvement of police officers - 2/10
