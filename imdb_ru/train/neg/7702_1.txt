I am a black man living in a predominantly black city. In this case, I have some serious concerns about the work of Tyler Perry. I understand that some people feel the need to praise him because he is black and tries to portray a positive image about culture. But I truly believe that if Perry White, this film would have the NAACP, Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson all over his ass. <br /> <br /> I was forced to watch this movie one whole hell a lot lately, and every re-viewing makes my blood boil. Characters are poorly written and acted. The jokes are so bad that I need to say something must be funny. I'm just gonna break this big pile of crap. <br /> <br /> Madeya = sucks. A character might have some appeal, but this is no longer the case. When it seems to her that the only thing she does is slapping children and threatening adults with violence, then she becomes useless. She is not needed. <br /> <br /> The situation with the wife who beat the groom was terrible. If a woman is so scared to the death of her husband, why should she try to escape when he is sleeping in bed. It would not make more sense for her to leave when he was at work. In any case, the characters in this arch were so annoying and powerful that I hoped that he would throw her off the balcony, and was royally marked when he did not. <br /> <br /> Then there are two lovebirds. The bus driver asks the woman, harassing her while he makes detours. I could not believe it. I really could not believe when she agreed to go with him even more. But what is needed for the cake is that an adult man was forced to throw pebbles out the window and pass on notes like a ten-year-old child, castrated by a mega-dry. I do not use this term lightly, but this woman had only two ways. Frosty victim and psycho mother. No matter which of the two individuals she showed, however, there was one constant. The bus driver was not going to take them. He even married her without trying goods - WTF! <br /> <br /> Then there is the scene of family reunion. Here we have a mother load that includes hidden intraocular taboos, grinding for grinding, shirtless, overly muscular, b-ball, plus the great taste of Maya Angelou. When these kids pulled their asses into the street and called a meeting, I was wrong, wanting the eldest of them to get a heart attack. All this crap happens at reunion, it’s ridiculously easy to separate groups, and then they ring the bell. When they do this, everyone throws away what they do, and are sent to a strict conversation, like a flock of Pavlov's dogs - WTF !! <br /> <br /> Then you have the last five minutes of the movie. In him we see how the cruel bride is chosen by his long-standing victim and the bad actress all around. There is an improvised wedding where black people are dressed like angels and hang from the ceiling - WTF !!! The only reason you can watch this far, besides checking your pain threshold, is the hope that the second villain of this story will also get his ass. Guess what doesn't happen. Instead, Perry chooses a way out of the challenge with special challenges and beats him, completing the film in a tone of forgiveness - WTF !! <br /> <br /> I’m pretty sure that if I was given a day, I could write a doctoral dissertation about how this film sucks. Don't even get me into the rest of the Tyler Perry movies. I'm just going to say it. In my opinion, as a black guy, DV Griffith's legacy lives on. The irony is that this is happening through the Black, who will be praised for what he did the "Birth of a Nation" by selling us adrift. I just wish Perry's films were guys so that I could kick them in the nuts. Thanks a lot dude !! What are you going to do about it in 2009, a comedy about the violence and brutal beating of slaves in colonial America?
