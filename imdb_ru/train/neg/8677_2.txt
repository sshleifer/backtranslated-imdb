I liked Chiba in Street Fighter, and I thought, hey, no matter how stupid this movie was, I can at least see how he kicked his ass, right? Wrong. This is a boring, dreary mess of meaningless conversations, half-written scripts and senseless intrigues. There are few scenes of action of any kind, even fewer scenes of martial arts, and the few that are being filmed and edited so badly that you cannot even understand what is happening in the world. The dub is also terrible, and, perhaps, the idiocy of this film is best illustrated by the fact that the Italian mafia allegedly appears in it ... EXCEPT THEY ARE ALL Japanese! Avoid like the plague - you will see the best martial arts if you look out the window of your local preschool karate class for five minutes.
