If I created a thermometer for a movie, this movie would be absolutely zero. Of the ten stars, I would rate it as follows: <br /> <br /> The plot: zero stars Video quality: zero stars Sound quality: zero stars Action: zero stars <br /> <br /> It’s like schoolchildren gathered once afternoon with a camera, made up the plot and shot the film. It has so little artistic value that I would rather watch children strolling through high school than watch this movie. HOWEVER, something needs to be said about the bottomless depth. The “shootout” on the stairs is one of the most fun scenes ever destroyed by a train. First of all, the combatants simply wave at each other with plastic cannons, tugging their hands back and forth to imitate recoil. The couple actually "duck" each other into non-existent bullets. No squibs, no sparks, no gaps, but only waving spray guns. If you want two grown men to play the "actor", play with him once ... after you clean the refrigerator, brush the carpet, polish all the door handles, scrape the gravel, level the books on the shelf, etc.
