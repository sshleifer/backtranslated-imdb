I watched the movie tonight on a free preview, and, despite the fact that I did not pay a penny to watch this movie, I still felt torn off. Ladies and gentlemen, time is money, and if you watch this movie, you will leave Benjamin in his place. The game is at best a torpedo; Kiefer Sutherland calls in his worst imitation of Jack Bower, and Michael Douglas seems to understand that he made a bad choice, leaving Catherine Zeta-Jones for the time it takes to shoot a turkey. Eva Longoria is not an entity; Looks like she reads her lines from the teleprompter. And if you can’t spot a mole in the first 20 minutes, then you just landed on this planet from a world without television and recycled storylines. If you really want to see a good secret service fighter, rent In the Line of Fire. If you look and buy it, you will begin to fear for presidential security, because the Secret Service looks and behaves like adult versions from 90210. Regardless of what you think about W, let's hope this “art” does not imitate life.
