This film is really boring. It was banned in Chinese cinema, and I understand why. This is not because it is critical of the communist regime, but simply because the film is of such poor quality. I would never want to pay money to watch this. I like the films of Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou, and I am disappointed that such a bad film could come out of China. It seems that this completely ignores the public, and the director seems to have made a film for himself. Frames of a person standing there, doing nothing for a minute, are ridiculous, and there are many of them. The cinematography and video quality is incredibly bad. I watched this movie online, and it looks like people really like this movie. The only explanation for this is that some movie lovers believe that if a film is not in English, it is automatically good. I see no reason why people like it. this is not a feature film, it is a waste of celluloid.
