I was looking for a nice, simple comedy to pass the time, but the choice of this film turned out to be a huge mistake. <br /> <br /> I can't write a single good thing about it. First, the script is stupid and not at all ridiculous, relying on weary, reworked jokes and a farting turtle for laughter. In my book it is not funny, it is a pity. <br /> <br /> Low-budget “effects” (if I can even call them effects) with terrible cinematography. In many places it looks like an indie film shot without money. <br /> <br /> Acting ... I'm sorry for the actors. Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards crave money to agree to take part in this? (Looking at their recent filmography, it would have looked like this.) Despite the outfits, Pamela shows her age, and in general they don’t even seem sexy, not to mention ridiculous. the film is not even in the category so bad, it's funny. It's just bad, as if everyone involved was tired of it. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
