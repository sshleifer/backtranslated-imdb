Dolph Lundgren reflects and frowns through this rambling mystery / thriller, which is not as cool as you can believe the box. He’s actually pretty good here, but the story is a cliché of a B-movie (detectives, revenge, tycoons, prostitutes, S & M), which looks like it was coined when they walked together. In the second half, the film becomes a bit livelier, but for a more respectable Lundgren film, instead rent a RED SCORPION.
