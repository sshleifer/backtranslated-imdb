That's right, you heard me. I'm a big fan of James Patterson. I have 10 of his books, and I read the entire series about Lindsay Boxer. In my opinion, the screenwriter should be shot. <br /> <br /> What is the right of any director to kill an amazing artwork and turn it into a mockery of a mysterious genre? If I ever thought that Harry Potter was killed, then Michael O'Hara proved me wrong. <br /> <br /> I can only pray that the next screenwriter, who took up this incredible book, would make it a lot fairer. Michael O'Hara and Russell Mulcahy: Do not give up your day job.
