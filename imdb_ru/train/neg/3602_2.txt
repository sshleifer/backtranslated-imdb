I’m an avid B-Rate horror movie lover, and I’ve watched my large share of slashes, so I’ve got a lot of weight to judge this movie. It easily enters the top echelon of the worst horror films that the 1980s has to offer. It's not as scary as “Night of the Demons”, not as scary as the “Rescuer”, and it lacks the value of the camp “There is nothing.” That being said, this film does not matter. Keep in mind the film's decoration for a completely different movie. Pictures on the back of the DVD box are not taken from this film. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (Violence is plentiful, but we’ve seen it all before. The killer kills Nubil’s students and a random member of the institution by cutting off their throats and all other weary killing methods that use horror movies). <br /> <br /> Nudity: no <br /> <br /> HISTORY: $$ (The story focuses on Francine Forbes, who, after this film was shot, wisely changed her name to Forbes Riley, which accepts university teaching. People start dying, and Forbes thinks the killer is aiming at her. Is her new heartthrob with a colorful past or crazy libido? Honestly, this is impossible because there is no character in the script outside of Forbes. <br / > <br /> ACTING: $ (Awful at all levels. This slasher has the Sensation of a school setting - high school, because then college students can make a better film than this one. Forbes demonstrates a little bit of talent, like the Seminar as one of the students, but everyone else has an "extra level" of acting).
