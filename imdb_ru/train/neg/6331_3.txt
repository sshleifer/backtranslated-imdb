Mr. Mike was probably the most misanthropic comedian of all time, so I was interested to see what he would do with full creative control over the film. Unfortunately, it is impossible to track down, though not because the jokes are not funny - some (I will not say most) of them, and in fact Mr. Mike did a great job of translating his mentally unbalanced screeds into visual jokes. The trouble is that the technical quality (scenery, lighting, sound, editing, you name it) is so terrible that the film is unbearable. Some equipment called “PKO Productions” receives a production credit, but it does not look at all produced; it's more like Mike stole one of the cameras from the SNL kit and did it all in the afternoon. I understand that Mike’s goal was to torture the audience, but even this deserves some basic standards, such as the ability to really see, hear or understand what should be shocking. However, the DVD is not a waste: it includes the praise for O'Donoghue by Bill Murray and the three “Least Favorite Tales of Mr. Mike” from SNL. In addition, the section of the movie "swimming cats" - this is a great scene that you can catch by watching if you want to scare someone. 3/10
