Now I love sci-fi cartoons. However, when “Robotboy” appeared in Canada at the end of 2006, I watched the premiere and was inevitably shocked. The characters are general and stereotypical (do they really need an African American man to wear tiger-print clothes and speak with an emphasis on Jamaican language? And chest and constantly complain?) To the extent that things become unreal, predictable, rude and sometimes disturbing. Astro Boy has a lot in common and even stab blows. Let me explain (duplicate the names for the young): Robotboy / Astro, Kamikaze / Tenma, Konstantin / Shadow, Gus / Abercrombie, Tommy / Aleho, Lola / Zoran + Kennedy, Mosimo / O'Shay, and so on. A brief similarity with “My life as a teenage robot”, “Star Wars”, “Ninja Turtles”, “Kamen Riders”, “Sailor Moon” and others. in move. Not to mention common racial / gender stereotypes. Don't even hint at me. I just say that they are hidden and rather dirty. But seriously. Don't even try to watch it. Especially if you like Astro Boy.
