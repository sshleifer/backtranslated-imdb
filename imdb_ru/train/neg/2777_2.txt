Unfortunately, this was shown on Star Movies here in Thailand, last week or so. This is complete rubbish. As another participant said, this film is a good example of how not to act. I have not seen such a bad movie for a long time. Actors (can you call them "actors"?) Absolutely flat and express their views with the passion of a dead dog. I would say that in order to truly understand how bad the acting is, you will need to watch a movie ... but it will be like torture. <br /> <br /> I cringe when the lead lady utters her lines and the rest of the actors with their accents (fake or flimsy) are equally disgusting. Yes, another actress with a fake British accent was pretty, but a good gentleman was her terrible accent. Mix it with her (lack of) acting, and you get a disaster. She just had to say nothing, and I could accept her as beautiful. Oh god, we just got to the scene where the leading lady's mistress says: "Am I really?" After weeping forcibly from her. Ridiculous. No, really, I just laughed out loud. <br /> <br /> Filming and art directors offer a bit of saving grace to the film. Some of the sets are colorful, and some scenes are pretty sweet (no actors). <br /> <br /> Old lady with magic potion? What kind?! Another participant mentioned the “modern” love song that was in the film. Absolutely inappropriate for the period established about 500 years ago. <br /> <br /> I understand that the film was considered the “Big Budget” in Thailand at the time of its production. I would be very upset if I were the producer of this film. This suggests that money does not necessarily make a good (or even mediocre) film. <br /> <br /> I would give King Maker 1 out of 10, but the costumes and scenery save the film from such a rating. 2 out of 10.
