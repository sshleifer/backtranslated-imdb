I missed this one on the shelf several times, looking at a lot of huge positive quotes (with tiny names) on the front panel and wondering if I had missed something. Last night it was on one of the movie channels, and I tuned in. I missed nothing. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I watched only the first 30 minutes. Perhaps the film will become a comedy gold after that. Given the slow, slow pace and total lack of laughter in the first 30 years, I seriously doubt it. <br /> <br /> The main character starts the movie in the classic style “I don’t know how to start my movie”. with a long, tedious monologue that he does not want to receive a claim. It's not funny. This is not even funny. Others commented on the San Francisco bit; well, a little laugh the first time he says it. Then he throws it into the ground, smiling at the camera, as if it were the funniest thing ever written. Get over yourself. In fact, I think that talking to the camera was the reason why I didn’t immediately love the movie. Do not assume to get acquainted with your audience. Acquaintance - _earned_, very much like respect. <br /> <br /> From there you basically have a fat, aching guy, very eloquently telling about his boring life as temporary. I did not understand that he was a Jew; It discredits Jewish comedians to call it "Jewish humor." This is just funny humor. Just because you are a Jew does not mean that you have a talent for comedy. WASP, Spalding Gray, copes better with self-analytic humor than this guy, so obviously it's not about ethnicity. <br /> <br /> If one of the bits I saw worked, I could have stayed, But some club telling how much he loves the names of the women he works with and then lists them for five long minutes, doesn't make a big movie. <br /> <br /> This is an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of Office Space. Do not allow yourself to become a victim of targeted marketing. Just say "Tunnel Haiku."
