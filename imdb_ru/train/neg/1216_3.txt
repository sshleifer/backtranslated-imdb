The genre of unknown films really sinks into this. The big problem is INCREDIBILITY. I understand that you need to create difficult situations that could cause tension and an intense sense of what happens next, but this film was so predictable and simply implausible. I find that the more I watch this film, the more I constantly tell the actors to avoid danger. Constantly making bad decisions just borders on stupidity. If they took the time to make it more realistic, I would like it a bit. Having said that, you might be better off staying away from it.
