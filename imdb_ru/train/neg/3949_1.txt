I got the Bogeyman DVD, and this stunker was an extra feature. I assumed it was “Boogeyman II” because it was paired with the original. But you know what they say about those who "accept": it makes an "ass" of "you" and "me." Before reading, I read that BII contains many shots from the original and that actress Love was shot in it. Watching the film “The Return of the Boogeyman,” I decided to view the original video to see the notorious death scene from a toothbrush. Before I knew it, the film was over. Sell. I think I thought it was BII, because it has a name similar to one of the alternative BII names. Well, at least it was just an extra feature, right? <br /> <br /> Let me stop talking about my mistake and start talking about movie errors. Many, many mistakes. Who is this guy, Ulli? Whatever he thought? Does he really think that the same film will be sold in different forms. There is nothing original holding Part III. This is basically a recollection of the original through the eyes of a psychic, which gives us an exhaustingly boring game when everything happens. This is a movie. Oh, and one death scene for a stereo, but you can read it from another review. My interest in "Boogeyman II" has been lost forever. <br /> <br /> Last note. This is not a series of films that need to look closely.
