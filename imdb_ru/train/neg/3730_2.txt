First, there is nothing wrong with studying Daniel, Revelation, Matthew 24, Isaiah, and other prophetic writings. There is nothing wrong with making such a film to try to present the Gospel message. So my doubts about this film are not in his sincerity or aspirations. Being a Christian, though merciful, I believe that there will be great sorrow, and I believe that Christ will return as he said. Therefore, despite the fact that I have a disagreement with this film about delight, I do not therefore appreciate this film so low. <br /> <br /> No, what makes me evaluate this film so low is not his sincerity or his message, but rather the lack of production values, the terrible scenario, the mediocre game and miserable FX. This film is on a par with one of the most beautiful science fiction feeds of the 1950s. No, this film is on a par with Plan 9 From Outerspace. This film did not endure good aging and was probably dated by the time they made the sequel. <br /> <br /> The producers of the Apocalypse genre could learn how not to make a film about the last times, but failed. In the series “Left behind me”, “Apocalypse” and “Omega Code” we could not learn from this, because they solved problems with FX and an obsolete look, but their scenarios are still bad and their actions are wooden. <br /> <There are wonderful Christian films with a very low budget, but this film is not one of them. I am surprised that the MST3K team never let it go.
