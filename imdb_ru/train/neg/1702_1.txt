Let's be honest: the only reason someone bought it, the only reason someone looked at it, and the only reason someone could claim to enjoy it, is what David Lynch did this and because you want to have children of David Lynch. But guess what? Even David Lynch can create a piece of shit. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Lynch wanted you to transcend normality and themselves feel absurd as a pure object of knowledge. Perhaps the brutal, cacophonist sounds and visual effects of chicken scratching should imply something about the place of humanity in the world, our attitude to the Real, the absurdity of all this. <br /> <br /> Instead, it just tells me one thing: I just lost $ 20. <br /> <br /> If I wanted to offend for the sake of the offensive, I could lift Hansen high and let me bleed in my ears. If I wanted absurdity for the sake of absurdity, I could just take the dump on the plate and watch it for 33 minutes. <br /> <br /> Dumblend has the only redeeming quality - it is meta, meta is funny, I mean, it's so bad that it's not even funny, because it's so bad. This fact, however, is a little fun. <br /> <br /> If you hate yourself and hate your money, then buy Dumbland. If not, rid yourself of the torment.
