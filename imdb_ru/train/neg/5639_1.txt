I watched this film today at the Haifa Film Festival in Israel, having heard rave reviews, but I think the critics have just shared with Willem Defoe and his wife (director) who attended the festival. This is by far the slowest film I've ever seen, with numerous meaningless, ridiculously long scenes from nothing. In addition to Defoe, who was decent, the actions of two and a half other people in the film, including Defoeâ€™s wife, Hyades, were ridiculously terrible (as they play the role of saleswoman in a bakery, I cannot do it). This film is largely less than the plot with an unsuccessful attempt to abstract from the wall. The only scene that provoked any reaction in the crowd was vulgar and sprang from nowhere, as if it was just adding some shocking value to the dullness of this film. Sorry for being rude, but in reality this film is a precious waste of time and money. I appreciate a good indie movie, but this film is not worthy of the time of the audience.
