This is the third film of Errol Morris, which I saw, and I no longer like his style. He seems to find very interesting and diverse characters, great personalities for creating documentaries, and then with mocking editing makes fun of everything they are about. In fact, this is never a direct caricature of them, and Morris seems to say most of the time, “But no, no, these people are really adorable, really!” But there are always these thin little oblique corners and not very subtle editing. methods that show that Morris seems to mock them behind his back. <br /> <br /> This film tells about four people who violate the traditional boundaries of organic separation ... a man who studies African hairless molarats and discovers that they look amazingly ant-like, a lion-tamer, a man who keeps a garden , full of animal-shaped shrubs, and a robot designer. The overall theme of the film seems to revolve around the question of what means animals, man and the peculiarities of life? So the title “Fast, Cheap and Unmanageable” really means nothing from the point of view of the movie ... right? Except, of course, Morris seems to be a little worried about the passion of these people (he can call them “obsessive ideas”) creating synthetic designs in life. I do not share this fear and, frankly, do not appreciate some of the connections that Morris makes in the film. <br /> <br /> But I emphasize its subtlety. Without the narration and the transfer of words to the whole interviewees, this does not mean that Morris ever imposes this anxiety on the collective head of the audience. Instead, he often mixes frames of the circus and the ant, sometimes when they are taken out of the context of the circus and the ants, demonstrating a kind of collective absurdity about what all these people are talking about. I do not find them absurd, I find them all very neat and interesting people. <br /> <br /> Unless, of course, he meant such comparisons, which means that he is simply a bad master, and not a silent person engaged in subversive activities. Considering that none of these films that I have seen so far made a special impression on me, I don’t care what he is trying to do. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
