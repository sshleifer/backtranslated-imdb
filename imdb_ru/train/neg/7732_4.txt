Before writing this review, I went back and read the reviews of others. This film caused me a particular disappointment, as two of my favorite dancers, Gene Kelly and George Chakiris, participate in it, and his points often delight Michel LeGrand (Wuthering Heights, Ice Station Zebra, The Thomas Crowne Affair) . "). The dance was unnatural, unmotivated and unoriginal, forgotten songs, history a joke. Even the suit was not particularly flattering. Only the photo correctly caught the right mood and mood. I am glad that other people enjoyed Rochefort Young Girls, although I certainly did not like it.
