I don’t remember the last time I reacted to the performance as emotionally as I did to Justin Timberlake in Edison. I was so excited that I wanted to scream in pain, destroy the screen, readily accept the hopeless cries of nihilism. Timberlake is terribly wrong; in fact, his casting is the same as Andy Dick in the lead role in Patton or Nathan Lane in the role of Jesus. But this is almost not relevant. <br /> <br /> Timberlake is just a bad actor, and he will be equally terrible in any role. I used to have problems with Ben Affleck's acting talent, but Timberlake makes Affleck look like Sir Ian McKellen or lady Judy Dench. With his metrosexual whisper (read Lithops), his boyish looks and emotional expressions that flow from something like “25 cliche expressions for actors”, he poisons the screen on which he is put ruthlessly, and no matter how you cut it, I do there is not and will not buy his role as an amateur journalist who has become a crusader for justice. He just won't fly. <br /> <br /> However, only Timberlake is not to blame for his failure. Director David J. Burke not only puts him in the (essentially) lead role, but also puts him in the direction of Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, John Hurd, Dylan McDermott, Carey Elvis and (I am surprised that he was just as good). LL Cool J I can imagine that someone is almost physically suffering, watching someone from this actor interact with Timberlake. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is another side to this: at the moment when any of these actors interact without Justin, it looks like a double relief. Nice if you want. Freeman and Spacey can have no more than 10 minutes of screen time alone, but these ten minutes are blissful, unlike their scenes with our so-called hero. Dylan McDermott is also a breath of fresh air. <br /> <br /> But stop beating Timberlake - in this particular case there are not enough words to get things done. "Edison" is a very, very ordinary corruption story. Its plot ranges from clichés to just ridiculous. Nevertheless, I admire the motivation for creating the film, which I interpret as a tribute to such films as Serpico, Donnie Brasco, or maybe even Chinatown. Don't get me wrong - “Edison” is not even at the same stadium as these films, but I can stretch my disbelief to admire its reason for existence, perhaps to justify my sitting through it. <br /> <br /> The script itself contains a surprisingly poor spelling. Yes, he has some decent exchanges, but any conversation between Piper Perabo (who's been wasting here) and Timberlake seems to have been filmed directly from the Dawson Creek episode. This is your typical “let's be too impressionable for reality” dialogue, let's impress the audience with how well we formulate (and fail) the dialogue. Note that this dialogue is accentuated by great music at inappropriate moments - sometimes it seems that “Edison” wants to turn into a music video where the emotions of the scene are not transmitted through acting, but through poorly chosen music and different speeds of the film (read slow motion) . <br /> <br /> Thinking about it, “Edison” is curiosity. Of course, damn it, who has the cast, but the actions are spoiled by Timberlake, who simply does not work. In the film, as in most works of art, if something is wrong, everything is wrong. Directors must make difficult choices. David J. Burke missed the mark here. Some scenes are well reproduced by themselves, but in general they do not seem to fit the pieces of the puzzle from different puzzles combined into one non-consecutive picture. And this is not a particularly addictive puzzle to begin with.
