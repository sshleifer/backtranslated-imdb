Like many media experiments, this amateur effort contains the seeds of very interesting social comments. For more than 5 years since its release, the prerequisites due to real events in software development have become less outrageous, and I think it’s less boring than the previous commentator for this reason, I think ...

Sometimes a spot can offer us less, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in disassembling it for educational purposes. Oh, yes - and although the stitches showed, and they creaked badly, my heartbeat quickened, and I did not want to get up and take a break.
