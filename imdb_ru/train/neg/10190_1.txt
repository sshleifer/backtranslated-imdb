After watching this episode of MST3K, I wonder how many films this film borrowed. It seems that it combines elements of Logans Run, Farenheight 451, Final Sacrifice, and at least several others. At one point, I was really expecting Chris MacPhiz to call Lee Majors ROWSDOWER. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the director has any clue how many holes there are in the chart? as the fact that, although there is no gas, it is sufficient at abandoned petrol stations, and the stations are close enough to each other for a Formula 1 racing car to travel across the country.
