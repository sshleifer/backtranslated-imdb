The film is bad. There is no other way to say it. History is weak and outdated, especially for this country. I do not think that most people know what a “walker” is or that he really needs it. It seemed to me that I was watching a movie of the 70s. The subject was simply implausible during 2007, even as it was established in Washington. I think it sounded believable to everyone else who also watched it, because the applause was low and quick at the end. Most also did not stay questions and answers. <br /> <br /> I don’t think that Schröder really planned the film in advance. Many scenes seemed circumcised, as if they had never been completed, or he simply did not know how to finish them. He jumped from one scene to another, and you had to try to figure out or guess what was going on. I really didn't have the private life of Woody (Carter) or the guy. What were the "artistic" pictures of male slavery and torture (from Iraqi prisons)? What was he thinking about? I think it was his very unsuccessful attempt to create this dark private subcultural life for the character Woody (Car). It did not work. It didn't even make sense. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this film is Woody Harrelson. He played his character (car) without any complaints. You really got a good idea of ​​what a “walker” could be (say, twenty years ago). He was great and most likely will never be recognized for it. <br /> <br /> As for Lauren, Lily and Christine ... Boring. <br /> <br /> Can't see! It hurts! Unless you're a real Harrelson fan.
