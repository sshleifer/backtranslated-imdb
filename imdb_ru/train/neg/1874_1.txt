I’ve been an ardent supporter of Hal Hartley ever since I saw his short “Surviving Desire” in high school, and even then he was still completely not anchored by his disgustingly brilliant “Henry the Fool.” But this continuation, which continues for 10 years, is not only unnecessary, but also shameful. <br /> <br /> After an uncertain and quick start, Fay Grim turns into pseudo-intellectualism, smoothes out boredom and, finally, is unjustified — and undesirable — nihilism. And this is just the plot. <br /> <br /> Most of the new faces are just as frivolous and poorly developed as in the film: one particularly flat character ends up losing half the time we spend with the notorious Henry the Fool, and this is his only conversational scene in film! <br /> <br /> Jeff Goldblum's agent, Fulbright, seems to be the only bright character (pun, no doubt, Hartley). How, then, did he leave? ** SPOILER ** Dead from car bombing, easily transforming this most cruel Hartley film with a soft character to date, and tonally absolutely wrong in a film that is completely wrong from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> Like other new characters, Angus James, Ned the Fool (or is it Grim?), not to mention Faye herself ... well, I won’t spoil their fates because the film does a pretty good job over it all on his own (when he is not busy with yet another monstrous oblique angle, which creates a discouraging impression that Hartley is moving in the opposite direction from Oter to the crappy student of the film). <br /> <br /> This part is a complete disaster, a terrible mess that isn't even good enough to revel in its mess. Instead, he smugly squeezes his director's typically amusing hipster pretense into the “real world”, one uglier and more evil than necessary, but not so ugly and not so angry to get close to saying something. At the same time, Hartley keeps track of all my memories of these people and the wonderful world that he originally created for them. <br /> <br /> I rarely get so depressed in movies, and I think "Leaving Las Vegas," who, at least, developed new new characters we loved before destroying them, instead of to immediately ignore your already favorite characters. <br /> <br /> Indeed, gloomy.
