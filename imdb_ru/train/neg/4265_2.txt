I'm a big fan of war movies. Some of my favorites are Braveheart, Troy, Last Samurai and Gladiator. And after watching “Mongol”, which is absolutely amazing and which I highly recommend, I had high expectations from the Sergei Bodrov film. But it was a terrible, terrible, even pretentiously not strong word in this case. The whole movie I was waiting for something exciting, but it did not happen, then I, at least, expected a great epic battle at the end, but even this was a huge disappointment, just some random running around, waving swords ... There are many good movies about warriors, this is not one of them.
