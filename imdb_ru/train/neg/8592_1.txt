To create a film in which the prequels and the “real” trilogy of “Star Wars” is taxed even by a great director .... Mr. Lucas is not the same director. <br /> <br /> To portray the fall of a kind man in darkness, a good actor is needed ... Mr. Christensen is not the actor. <br /> <br /> The first 60-80 minutes are overwhelmingly boring, with only a few pockets of even lighter saber fights, but there is not enough sharpness because you already know which main characters survived in the original “Star Wars” . <br /> <br /> Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) has a very fleeting role, and the best idea is to silence Jar Jar Binks! <br /> <br /> No, the film only begins when the chancellor turns on the Jedi, and has one big (too long) sequence on the lava waterfalls.
