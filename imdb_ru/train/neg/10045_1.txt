The whole world said that the film "Tashan" would be a good film with great pleasure, but it is not. Vijay Krishna Acharya made a serious mistake by taking actress Karina Kapoor. She was unbearable throughout the film. Her appearance does not look good. Even the film, the story of the film does not make sense at all. Everyone said that Ketin Taratino from India is Vijay, but this is not Quetin at all. Talent Anil Kapoor was involved in this stupid film. Anil is a big-caliber actor, but this film is not. Akshay Kumar also became a victim of this film, since all this is Saif. Style and Formola are not very good in this film, I was disappointed
