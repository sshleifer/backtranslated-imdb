A man brings his new wife to his home, where his ex-wife died from an “accident”. His new wife has just been released from the institution and is also VERY rich! Suddenly she begins to hear sounds and see skulls everywhere. Is she going crazy again or is the first wife returning from the dead? <br /> <br /> You probably guessed the end, so I will not describe it in detail. I saw it many times on Saturday afternoon on TV as a child. I liked it then, but I was young. Seeing this now, I understand how bad it is. It's terrible, poorly written, very boring (even at one o'clock) and has a huge composition of FIVE people (one of whom is the director)! However, there is something good about it. <br /> <br /> The music is kind of creepy, and the atmosphere with a huge empty house and a pond nearby is rather atmospheric. There are also a few scary moments (I jumped a little when she saw the first skull) and a somewhat spectacular ending. In general, this is definitely NOT a good movie ... but not a complete disaster. He has a small fan. I give him 2. <br /> <br /> Also try to avoid his release of Elite DVD Drive-in (in combination with “Attack of giant leeches”). It is in terrible shape with jumps and scratches all over. It didn't even look so bad on tv!
