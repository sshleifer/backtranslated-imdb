I am a fan of the series and read all 7 books. I wanted to see it, just to see how it was done. All I can say is that the only people who need to watch this are those who have already read the show and are interested in it. This is pretty bad and you canâ€™t read them. Not to be evil, but Lucy is so ugly that it distracts from the film. Was she the daughter of the director? Seriously, I'm sure the beavers in the film envied her teeth. She had a bite that would make any beaver ashamed. The film just loses so much in translation. CS books are not translated as easily as Tolkein LOTR books or even Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> One thing they did right! Aslan! very well done. Although other human actors with painted faces (beavers, wolves) look stupid, Aslan was really great, because he was not just an actor walking around. (I guess it's like that old horse costume? 2 people inside?) Also, I would be curious what the children think about this film. Maybe they will like it? But as for adults, they will not be safe, even if a CS fan.
