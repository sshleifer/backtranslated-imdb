I got the Mirror Mirror mainly because Yvonne De Carlo was in it (I thought she was great in American Gothic), but unfortunately she didn’t have a big role in this film. It all starts well, and the pace moves well ... but by the end it gets a bit tedious and boring. This does not mean that it is a boring movie, but it is very average and nothing exciting. I didn't like the “obsession” side, and there were no decent bloody scenes. Plus, the “main” story was very confusing, and the ending does not make much sense. I, however, liked the story of the gothic girl and how she avenges her tormentors. <br /> <br /> I wouldn’t particularly recommend Mirror Mirror to horror fans - this is nothing to wet yourself.
