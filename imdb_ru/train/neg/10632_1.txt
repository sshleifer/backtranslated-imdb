There are so many wrong statements in this so-called “documentary” that I screamed at the TV. <br /> <br /> Bart Sibrel may be able to release a spectacular DVD, but unfortunately he doesn’t have enough time to watch. on the science behind his statements. <br /> <br /> He relies either on an inaccuracy that does not tell the full story, or on the old favorite hints “the government always lies to us”, and people who believe what they are told do not check the accuracy or details of statements. <br /> <br /> Moreover, his “exclusive” or “unpublished” images are freely accessible via the Internet from various sites. <br /> <br /> Further reading about the circumstances related to the filming of this play shows that he used false pretexts to get an interview and used creative editing of answers to promote his own opinion. <br /> <br /> All statements made by Mr. Sibrel about “inaccuracies”, “errors” or “revelations” in the Apollo program were thorough. Everything was refuted. <br /> <br /> How do I get back those 40+ minutes of my life?
