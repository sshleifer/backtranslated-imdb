I just received a special edition of Superman 1 from the UK with four discs for about $ 5. Additional material includes the 1951 Superman and Mole-Men features. Last night I inserted it into a DVD player, and here are my conclusions. <br /> <br /> Some initial disappointment - I didn’t check it out, and it seems to me that I marked it as one of Kirin Alin’s TV shows. I'm not a big fan of George Reeves as Superman, and I have not seen anything except Kirk Alin's strange clip — but, hey, it doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> This black and white production takes less than an hour. This is similar to a couple of episodes of one of Reeves' early television series, a two-part film, put together for release in theaters, although IMDb says it was filmed as a release of films before the first series. In any case, this is a strange choice for reasons that I will discuss later. I am at that age when I remember television and movies that are limited to one or two locations and filming, so there were no serious surprises here. However, for a low-budget film, this film is REALLY low-budget. <br /> <br /> The story concerns the small town of Silsby with a population of 1,430 people, which, oddly enough, is home to the world's deepest oil well (6 miles). The story begins with the fact that the head of the well hastily takes steps to close the well. This is in conflict with the arrival of reporters from Metropolis Kent and Lane, who report on the well as directed by the oil company. When Clark discovers the fact that the training appeared 6 miles down in a radioactive cave, several strange little guys come out of the cap (short, large in head, black in overalls and thick in eyebrows) Drill a shaft and start climbing the city with puzzled expressions on faces. <br /> <br /> Taking a deep breath, this is the rest of the plot. The little guys scare some kids, so Jeff Corey (who plays the city’s rampant xenophobe) incites some buddies to kill these "creatures." Superman enters (moderately to no avail) and catches one of the little guys who was shot and takes him to a local hospital. Cory's friends burn a shack in which another kid hid, and suggest that he was killed, but he runs away and lowers him down the mine. Corey instigates a mob of vigilantes (despite the arrest of the sheriff) to hang up a hospitalized Krotik. Superman stops them in the hospital and delivers the wounded guy to the mine, to return him to his comrades. A total of 4 man-moles appear with some kind of weapon that they shoot at Jeff Corey (I call it Aargh weapon!, Because its only effect seems to make Corey go "Aargh!"), And Superman saves him. He immediately changes his way because of the surprise that Superman rescues him after he behaves, people-moths return back to the mine. The end. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film lasts only one hour, around it crawls too much, fears and pursues - I missed all of Mole-1, crawling from A to B, looking for no one to watch him. "Mole people never participate in any way - they have no dialogue - they just appear, are harassed and come back. They look a bit creepy, but they are unlikely to have monstrous eyes, what the city’s reaction hints at. <br / > <br /> Reeves is a pretty good Clark Kent is a very frisky reporter, far more than a Pretty indifferent Lois Leigh Phyllis Coats. But he's a terrible, terrible Superman. Not only does he not look part of (at least his hair is dyed black in this, which is an improvement over the pretty blonde hair that he wore in some television episodes ), the way he plays is completely wrong in my book. I’m sure that he was told to "take a pose" (which Superman does all the time), but someone had to tell him that they should be fists at the hips, and not fists on the ribs. And he plays Superman as a rather strict and touchy school teacher - in fact, he doesn’t wave his finger in protest, but he may have coped just as well. <br /> <br /> And Superman walked a lot to say a huge amount - he really isn’t that much) and run a little. It takes off and lands a couple of times, but in flight it is not visible. Oh, some bullets bounce off him, and he uses a telescope as Clark, but without the attendant visual effect. In fact, the visual effects are noticeable by their absence, and the few that are present are not very good. <br /> <br /> I tried to consider these efforts with reference to the standards of the time: but even by these standards, I think this is a rather exhausting effort. Fortunately, production standards in the series were higher, and at least they took the trouble to come up with stories that were a little more for them. <br /> <br /> Something disappointed - I will not watch it again.
