After watching Revolt Of The Zombies with the participation of the future winner of the Oscar Dean Jagger Award, I still have one burning question. How did the society that created these perfect warrior fighting vehicles ever triumph? <br /> <br /> This is a question that you will think about if you take the time to watch Revolt Of The Zombies. By the end of the First World War, the French discover a cult from occupied Cambodia, where these inanimate creatures, which cannot be stopped by bullets, form a brigade of monks who run across the top and knock out the Huns. <br /> <br /> This frightens the live feces of all interested parties, so an international expedition is created to find out whether to destroy the mystery of these zombies so that no nation can reach it and rule the world. <br /> <br /> But we got some disagreement in these ranks. The first is the villain Sneadley Whipples Roy D'Arcy, who kills a Buddhist monk who has a secret, and the second is Dean Jagger. Power, as we all know, is an absolute aphrodisiac, and it is determined to divert Dorothy Stone from rival Robert Noland. <br /> <br /> I think you have an idea of ​​how this will turn out, especially since the race of zombies does not conquer the world for one country. Dean Jagger, having received an Oscar for Twelve Hours, had to shudder every time, thinking about this film and the terrible dialogue that he was trying to call a spark of sincerity. <br /> <br /> The moral of this story is that you could become a real warrior with a potion of zombies and a chant of zombies, but you cannot make the ultimate love slave.
