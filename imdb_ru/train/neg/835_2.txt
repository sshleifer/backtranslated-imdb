Having seen both the Lion King and the Lion King II, he enjoyed both. I thought Lion King 1.5 might be worth seeing. What a disappointment ! Disney must have desperately needed income. <br /> <br /> Especially now that they lost the deal with Pixar. <br /> <br /> In essence, they just took a few snippets that remained on the editor. floor (or trash can) and glue them together to get a quick tank <br /> <br />. Unlike LK I & II, both of which had strong plot lines. <br /> <br /> Thereâ€™s no story at all in this movie. Although it is always interesting to watch characters and animations, the material for the film is simply not enough. Some of them could serve as a good filler for the second disc in the original sentences. <br /> <br /> Disney - shame that you threw away this garbage in order to earn money quickly! <br /> <br /> Next time Take the time and effort and invest our long work.
