I started watching this movie, expecting some barely tolerable Hummer horror movie to wink ... and I was just around the corner. There are quite a few flashing blood, and they added a lot of nudity, but the second half of the film represents a few ironic twists. Holy cow, they actually thought a bit about this story and did not completely fall into the predictable things that could be expected from the very beginning. And I dare say that some “useless” nudity, after all, was not so useless, because it fits into history and setting. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, this is generally a bad movie, but, like bad movies, it's a shade, smarter than a REALLY horrible trip, like Mesa Lost Women and the Monster Robot.
