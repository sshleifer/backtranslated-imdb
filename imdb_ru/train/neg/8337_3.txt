Millie is a juice. She marries a rich guy named Maitland, and they have a child. Then she catches him for treason and divorces him ... but allows him to leave the child she claims to love. Then, in the early 30s, she would have the right to have a hefty spouse and alimony, but she allowed the guy surprisingly easy ... without support ... what a juice! Later, when she has a boyfriend, and life seems pretty good, he turns out to be ALSO a cheat! Wow, it's hard for her to choose men. <br /> <br /> As a result of these bad relationships, Milli is changing. Now she is a wild party girl - she is doing everything possible to distract herself from hard luck. Suddenly many years pass. Millie's daughter, whom she left at the beginning of the film, is now 17 years old, and, oddly enough, fashion has not changed for a minute. Old friend Milly (yes, this is another evil person!) Now pretends to be her daughter's friend, but he has depraved thoughts about her. Millie promises him that if he touches the girl, she will kill him. Think what will happen next! <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is a tangled and often weird mess â€” a bit like Madame X, but much, much less focused. So often the motives and actions of Millie seem to have no meaning. And in the film, it seems, there is everything that is needed - so far this confirms the idea that all people are pigs. Unusually, but not particularly good.
