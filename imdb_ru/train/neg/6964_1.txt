I usually check out awards at a movie on MTV to watch a witty, exciting show that represents a unique show (for example, Chewbacca wins a lifetime achievement award). So this year was no different. While I'm not a fan of Justin Timberlake, Seann William Scott has always been a funny-albian fool to me. I laughed at Stifler in both American Pie films and even enjoyed it in the movie “Dude, Where's My Car?” But the MTV awards were terrible. Nothing was consistent, humorous, or interesting. Justin Timberlake must stick to singing and dancing; he is damn sure he can't act. <br /> <br /> I am curious as to who the writers for this show were. Jack Black and Sarah’s Michelle Gellar last year’s performance was extremely funny (the Lord of the Rings parody was worth the entire show), but this year was completely different. Has anyone understood Timberlake’s comments on Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson (“They're shooting a movie together, but they never met! Here they are ...”) Where was this joke? Kate and Luke have just entered into their unfortunate dialogue, never referring to the "joke" of Timberlake. And Seann was completely wasted as a talent, not even making me smile, but laughing alone. And what was the point of the one-time Harrison Ford? Did they have ANY sense to anyone? Perhaps the authors of MTV believed that young viewers would only learn about the aging Ford as Han Solo, Indiana Jones or the president of Air Force One. I'm confused. And will anyone tell me a deal with Adrian Brody? How old is this guy and how much does he THINK? The guy looks at 30, trying to play 19 again ... throw it, show some class (as in your performance in the nomination "Best acting award at the academy") and shoot your age! <br /> <br /> I give this show 1 star out of 4, simply because of Gollam's speech for better visual performance. It was very creative, very well done and caused the only real laugh for the whole evening.
