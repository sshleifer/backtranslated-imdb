Another case with a decent case of DVD, betraying the quality of the picture on the video. <br /> <br /> Everything was not so bad. Rochon does good work and damn it! The cast is good. I have never seen so many muscular guys hanging out together regularly. This film really wanted you to think that Rochon was the killer, but that did not happen. My biggest problem with the film was that in the end I didn’t care who the killer was, and the real killer didn’t make much sense, as it was completely unexpected, and the filmmakers thought, “Yes, of course, no Look who goes sucker! Yes, there were mistakes in continuity (mainly due to Miss Rochon's ever-changing wardrobe), but for indie slasher this is not so bad. At first, I was pretty sure that for girls it was just a veiled excuse for them to be topless, but it was just a trick. At times the dialogue was overly deliberate and painful. <br /> <br /> Just don’t expect from this high expectations, and it will not be so bad. And Lloyd Kaufman's cameo is wonderfully understated.
