Drones, ethnic drums, a bad synthesizer, children sing. The most patronizing "world music" of all. This is a tourist and lousy movie. What really kills is incoherent strings. India, Egypt, South America, Africa, etc. And so on. D. There are no transitions, there is no visual explanation for why we suddenly found ourselves ten thousand miles away, there are no ideas expressed in images. According to another observer, these are just frames with images of supporters of the world with "baskets on their heads." Going endlessly, as if it had some deep meaning. If these guys wanted to make a video for the 3rd World, all they had to do was go a few hundred miles south of where the best parts of Coya were filmed and make a movie in Mexico. It would be much better for “life in transformation”. <br /> <br /> But no. What they decided was a crowded tourist route covering half the globe and a pacifyingly crowded filter shots. The only thing that can recommend this film is that it is not as bad as Nakoykatsi. <br /> <br /> rstj
