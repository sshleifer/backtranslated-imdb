Henry, the veterinarian (Paul Rudd), and his overbearing bride, Kate (Eva Longoria), are considering the possibility of taking them at the last minute. This is the morning of their wedding, and Kate, in a frenzy, telling about how she is served, make food. But, terrified, the ice sculpture "angel", commissioned by Kate, comes without wings. In the ensuing fight with the sculptor, the heavy "ice" girl falls on Kate and sends her to the afterlife. Now, a year later, Sister Henry is arranging a psychic to tell the young vet that Kate would like him to start dating other ladies and move forward. Nevertheless, a wonderful medium, Ashley (Lake Bell) became interested in Henry herself, much to the chagrin of her nutrition partner (Jason Biggs). More importantly, Kate returns from the other side to create havoc for Ashley, since she does not intend to let another woman get hold of Henry. Can anything be done to bring Kate back to heaven forever? This is a terrible romantic comedy, one of the worst this loyal fan has ever seen. No, this is not the cast, as they diligently try to make things work. Longoria is beautiful and funny, as the overbearing groom and Bell have an unusual style and humor, which is also contagious. Biggs, the funny talker, is also completely wasted. As for Rudd, a very gifted performer (see “Presenter”, “Exposed” or “Powerless”, please), he tries his best and, in truth, is the main reason to see this fool. His charm, appearance and easy wit make the film be bearable. But nothing can turn a meaningless scenario and a terrible direction into a winner, absolutely nothing. So, if you're a fan of romantic comedy, think long and hard before you fork out for some money for this. Even if you had free tickets on your lap, keep in mind that this film is a near-death experience for those who love movies with love and laughter.
