Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a mentally unbalanced young woman with a troubled past who gets more than she expected when she goes to a pool party with a beautiful colleague. When her date and his friends jokingly say that they belong to the Murder Club, Maddy takes it seriously and goes straight to Level 3, beating the woman’s brains in the garage (because her car is lucky!) But Maddy is also puts on a plastic mask and kills other members of the group, or has someone else lost it? <br /> <br /> The plot of this film (originally called MAKE 'EM BLEED) is very poorly thought out. , full of holes and spirals, completely out of control before a ridiculous turn out of the field. Some dialogs are ridiculous. I had no problems with Rochon, but the cast was cruel. However, I managed to sit in this issue of Full Moon completely entertained. There is a lot of skin and blood, and this is the ideal type to sit with a group of your buddies and get out. Horror fans may also like cameos from Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman (as Debbie’s parents) and Julie Strain (an early victim). <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 10
