If you want an undemanding and amusing enough hour or so, then it's ok, watch this. This is not so bad, really. Yes, he has more errors in logic than I can describe here, and this can be done by the patience of people like me, I have to admit, who tend to throw things at the TV sometimes, but at least it's funny. Just because it is not always INTENTIONALLY funny, there is no need to let it upset you. <br /> <br /> However, if you read a book — or any other book by Brookmayr — then you probably would be best to avoid it. I read them all, and when I first watched this film, I despised it. In fact, I described it in detail and in detail on another site. The television story has little to do with the book and serves only to revolt and infuriate many loyal (and, by all accounts, rabid) fans of Brookmayr. <br /> <br /> Best advice ..? Look at it, then read the book, and only then do your comparisons and present your judgment.
