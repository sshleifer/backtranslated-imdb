I gave it 4 stars, because there are many interesting topics in it, which many have already mentioned here. From domestic violence to sexuality and many prohibitions in it. Outside of blood, I really would not call this horror as science fiction. <br /> <br /> It is sad, sad and hopeless. While I don’t mind a less fun final, I’m really very tired of the “suck people” cliché, which is central to every movie. I know that today you cannot get a degree in the humanities without worshiping a change in self-hatred as a member of the human race, but how about becoming a writer / director, we pretend that we are different from everyone else in the group and pay attention that Aliens who kill the human race are evil! Right now, if you are reading this and you think that humanity deserves to die, just go out, find the lake and swim until your hands are tired. Thus, you will not be there to shoot the next film or write the next book, which says that I deserve to die for being alive. This is stupid, not thoughtful and boring.
