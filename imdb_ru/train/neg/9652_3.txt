The film was written 10 years ago, and another director planned it with Sh.R.K. and Aamir starring. <br /> <br /> The film was finally shot with director Vipul Shah, while Ajay and Salman were shot together a decade later. HUM DIL DE CHUKE SANAM (1999) <br /> <br /> The film, however, fails due to the processing of the 90s, and, even worse, it has loopholes <br /> <br /> The film trying to collect too many commercial ingredients, and we also have a love triangle <br /> <br /> Everything is predictable, film-based and too banal. <br /> <br /> There are loopholes, for example, how does Ajay escape from London airport and suit anyone? even the way in which he starts his group is not convincing. The second half gets better with a twist in the story about Ajay destroying Salman, but unfortunately the climax fails and the film ends on a bad note. <br /> <br /> Directed by Vipul Shah - normal or below average Music is the worst point, most of the songs are mediocre. <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Ajay gives his best chance, although he is not convincing as a rock singer, but he plays an excellent negative role, Salman, however, annoys him with his punjabi and senseless nonsense, he hits only when he is given drugs and in this Asin is not something big, just a show part that Ranvijay should stick to MTV Om Puri is fine
