Well, I have to say this before uncovering the "monster." saying that he really does not fit into this category, just some strange thing that causes an annoying screech! And personally, I think that my grandmother could have escaped from this thing, but in any case. In fact, I got into this film, although the presence of the main character drunk and heroin addict did not attract. But scenes like when she runs away from the train, and you can see that the figure at the door was pretty creepy, also where the guard had just been killed and the monster put her hand on the screen. <br /> <br /> But then, when the monster was discovered, the catastrophe was stuck, and it became an ordinary horror, with limited sensations or fears. Gradually, I was bored, and I wanted to turn off this thing. I like that most people said that they were rooting for the homeless, especially the guy, he laughed here and there. I think that this film really could be something special, instead it became what any other horror is now! Just boring and not worth the money spent. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a cheap panic here and there, or a meaningless feast of blood (which is actually limited, there is hardly any at all), be sure to let it go, but for all of you, serious horror watchers, look somewhere else, better movies.
