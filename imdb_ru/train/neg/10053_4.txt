The dead body of a little girl is found devoid of all possible means of identification. When it is found that one leg is longer than the other, it is assumed that this is the body of the pairâ€™s missing daughter. After this injury, the couple is separated, and the mother becomes dependent on tranquilizers and leads a miserable existence. It all changes when once, many years later, she receives a phone call from her daughter! With the help of a former policeman and a reporter, she sets off on a journey to determine if her daughter is alive. "Los Sin Nombre" is a disorderly plot, moves at a painfully slow pace and is not at all scary. Saving grace - Emma Vilarasau, which copes with the role of a desperate mother. The best part of the film is the final, but I'm not sure what the rest of the film is worth experiencing. Beware of English subtitles in the recent release of R1 - they are not very accurate.
