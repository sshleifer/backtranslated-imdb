Do you ever sit in a movie, and after it's over, it looks like one big “WFF!?”. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Lure. <br /> <br /> Another direct movie that you can immediately forget about watching or, even better, not watch it at all. Peter Weller and Robert Patrick are stars, and they quickly get lost in this hopeless action, quickly losing the action of the mercenaries, where the story is damn bad, and the action sucks, and what’s the point of watching the action unfold? Robert Patrick, in particular, reaches a new minimum in the sequence of actions when he shoots a machine gun while standing on the hood of a moving school bus. Filmed with surrounding Charlotte Lewis and his own Canadian Scott Highlands (from the television fame of Night Heat).
