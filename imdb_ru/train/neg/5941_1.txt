As a fan of Notorious B.I.G. I was looking forward to this movie. I'm sorry this is a terrible movie. Jamal Woodward is not convincing enough and not realistic to portray the infamous B.I.G. Most of the story follows the real son of the notorious B.I.G., Christopher Jordan Wallace as the notorious B.I.G. like a child. Unfortunately, he is not convincing enough to pay tribute to the memory of his father. Derek Luke is as unconvincing as Sean "The Plump" Combs. In short, no one is convincing enough to play a role here. The big problem is that these are real people that they play in. It was boring and did not give any information about the infamous B.I.G. that both fans and non-fans did not yet know. I was especially disappointed with Angela Bassett, a very good actress who was lost here like Voletta Wallace. The film slugs and slugs, thinking that the notorious B.I.G. fans will spend a lot of money on it. I'm sorry it happened. This is not close to a good movie. I expected a lot from this, but unfortunately I received nothing from it. I think you should definitely skip this.
