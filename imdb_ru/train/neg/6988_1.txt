I so wanted to see this one of my favorite TV shows. I saw the Universal trademark, followed by a recently familiar song with a title and a theme that still impresses me. a spaceship approaching an amusement park, and more made this version awesome and fantastic. Soon after this until the end ... I could not believe my eyes !!!! How lucky I was that I could forget everything I saw. Just the songs of Tiffany and her thematic song in the new arrangement were in my head. In any case, I want to see this space family (also the Flintstones and Yogi Bear) in the whole graphic computer design as a toy story or the life of the Bug. Hanna-Barber in my opinion.
