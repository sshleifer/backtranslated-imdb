It must be one of the worst films I've ever seen. There is nothing positive about this movie. Some of you really like this movie! I saw a lot of movies about Dracula, and I liked everyone I saw, but when I saw this movie, I said to myself: "What the hell is this?" Now Dracula is becoming what he is, because he is Judas. For those of you who don't know who Judas is, he betrayed Jesus Christ, and then you felt so guilty that you hanged yourself. Are you kidding. This is the stupidest reason I've ever heard why Dracula became evil. Has anyone asked the reason? What a piece of sh ** this movie. Anyone who ever came up with this excuse for the film should be beaten. Even Dracula is terrible. If you have ever seen this movie, you would not even think that this is Dracula. Wow, Dracula 2000! Should this title impress me? Do not waste your time or money on this garbage.
