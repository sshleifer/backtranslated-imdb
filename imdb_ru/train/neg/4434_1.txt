I rented this film, thinking that it looked like an amazingly delightful historical piece. What I got was a piece of clean rubbish. This film was confusing in most places, changeable in almost every place and terrible in all places. The image of Mira Sorvino about the queen playing a young male scientist was depressed at best. Ben Kingsley should have been denied his knighthood for even considering this film as one of his projects. Fiona Shaw must play Petunia Dursley; at least the Harry Potter films are more interesting than what they call the play in the film. <br /> <br /> It seems that a student from college went to cinema class 101 and failed miserably. Almost every scene in the film is divided into some kind of effect; the end result, of course, was the easiest editing I've ever seen. Jay Rodan was almost as good as Agis; It is a pity that he had such a bad script for work. Rachel Sterling tries her best as an almost credulous lady in anticipation. In the end, I would really like Blockbuster Video to refund. I'm so glad I didn't spend 10 bucks watching this fiasco in the theater. If they play this Marivaux play from the 18th century, it surprises me how many people over the years have snoozed during this work. If I were there, they would not have heard the play because of snoring. Thank God for the modern convenience of DVD players; You can skip boring or horrible scenes. I think that means that I only watched the beginning and the end!
