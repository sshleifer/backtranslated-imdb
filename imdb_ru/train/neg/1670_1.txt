The premise of the film is creepy: a woman became pregnant when a stranger kissed her in a bar. <br /> <br /> But as soon as the film begins, the terrible opening scene establishes that this is a fantastic C-type television. This is a big Star Trek and some X-files, but most boring. <br /> <br /> When the movie starts to act, everything is predictable and cliche. It was more like 2 members in a bad science fiction series. No waiting and thrills, but not because of the lack of attempts. Just a lot of predictable dramatic conflicts between the main characters. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time.
