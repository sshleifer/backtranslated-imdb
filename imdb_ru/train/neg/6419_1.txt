Think about ending Grudge 2 as follows: <br /> <br /> - a man who repeatedly says the word "Sunlight" - a cowboy - a love story - Sarah Michelle Gellar cuts himself - and a creepy mirror <br /> <br /> HE AND THE UNDERWATER SEA ANIMALS ... ooh ... <br /> <br /> not a very good movie ... I seriously did not enjoy it at all. The movie poster is also misleading, and I found that it was just to get people to watch it ... I can't believe I left. <br /> <br /> Save your time and money ... watch the movie “Saw III” ... a movie in which you feel you have invested in it ... <br /> <br /> Im Mike and i went out
