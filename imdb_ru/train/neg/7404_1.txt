Initially, I became interested in this film after reading a review that said that this film reminded Silent Hill reviewers. <br /> <br /> Being a big fan of Silent Hill and disappointed with his movie debut, I thought I would give this chance. Keep in mind, Fearnet only lists this film as “Dark Floors,” and not by its full name. Therefore, when I saw the name “Mr. Lordi” in the credits, I immediately thought of the group (I had several college friends who love them), but did not think that it was important, and quickly put the thought aside. <Br /> <br /> the film starts off strong. Although “DEATH” was made by a “creepy little girl,” good use of sound and a sense of isolation really began to unify the story. The tense atmosphere was growing rapidly, and all the signs indicated that the film was excellent. Since the monsters are real stars of horror, I could not wait to see what was hiding in the hospital rooms where the main characters were trapped ... <br /> <br /> And then the first monster appeared and I felt very depressed . By the time the second one appeared, I was stunned by the fact that he looked as if he had just come from a concert in Megadet, and stupidity completely turned me off. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the atmosphere remained intact, and the story made you think about what was happening, but the fears almost did not exist. However, I was hoping that the end would benefit. Unfortunately, it did not happen. By the time the film reached its climax, I was completely at a loss, and I immediately found out about the big bad in his last show ... Soloist Lordi? Seriously? <br /> <br /> What was all this about? Are lords of the group chasing a bunch of poor souls around the hospital? The silly monster design suddenly made sense. If you are going to be so trite, you can also through Marilyn Manson members or even KISS there. Not to mention that I'm almost sure that I saw the final in one of the Lordi clips a few years ago. Did they have to go make an entire movie out of it? <br /> <br /> Worst of all, when I found out what was really going on, all I could do was yawn. I'm not going to “destroy” it for you, but I can say with confidence that this is probably the plot device you saw before. Most likely, not once. <br /> <br /> So, if you're not a big fan of Lordi, stay away from that. It's not scary, it does not bring anything new to the table (although it does well borrow other horror films, mostly Silent Hill). And I can't stress this enough, LORDI is an antagonist. Lordi. Talk about buzz. <br /> <br /> Indeed, you better scare yourself by watching Slipknot music videos. In other words, it is simply impossible.
