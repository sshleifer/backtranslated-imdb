In the end, I looked at the "Tenants" with my close friends, who shot the film based solely on the appearance of Snoop Doga (their passionate fetish) on the cover. It is clear that I did not expect much. I thought the film would include a typical picture of the behavior and images of Snoop Dogg, often found in clichés of rap videos. However, my generalization was for the most part incorrect. Unfortunately, it did not make the film better. <br /> <br /> Most of them would describe this film as a dark serious drama, whereas I would describe it as a dark serious boring dramatic film. The film tells the story of two struggling authors (Dylan McDermott and Snoop Dogg) who are trying to create their own individual masterpieces. Their polar opposite lifestyle ultimately forms an unlikely, but very complex and neurotic friendship. This friendship moves throughout the film like a wild roller coaster - most of which is made by Snoop’s character - reminiscent of someone with a difficult case of personality splitting. And although the film is a drama, an acting game that has a painful and serious shade, Snoop and company were more comical than anything else. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this film to those who pay attention to be disturbed, because it has a lot of dialogue and a lot more dialogue after that. There are some mediocre conflicts, but even they are mostly bogged down in a larger dialogue. The end, however, jumped on me with unexpected surprise. It was a slightly perverted, somewhat unexpected and ideal way to complete the film, which was supposed to end. Watching the final captions, I could not help but imagine how the director thinks: "Oh God, how the hell do I end this snooker." By the way, the director has laid out carefully thought-out hints and subtleties leading to a climax - they are all more noticeable than Waldo in a crowded street of dwarfs wearing only black sweaters.
