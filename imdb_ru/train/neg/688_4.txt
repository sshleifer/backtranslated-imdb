I always liked Fred McMurray, and although her career ended tragically, I think Carol Lombard is fun to watch. Connect these two main and attractive stars, add the best support players such as Gene Dixon, Anthony Quinn, Dorothy Lamour and Charles Butterworth, give them a romantic script, combine them with the famous director Mitchell Leisen and you will get mediocre movie experience. br /> <br /> Skid Johnson (Fred) and Maggie (Carol) "meet with darlings" during her visit to the Panama Canal and spend the next few weeks falling in love. Skid is a great trumpeter, so he starts a musical career that is predictably fast in both its takeoff and fall. During his rise to musical glory, he neglects Maggie, who later inspires him to start all over again when he has reached the bottom. Oh yeah, this is a real Hollywood happy ending that won't come too soon. <br /> <br /> Stars and a director of this level should guarantee success, but this film is so predictable and slow that it is difficult to watch it from time to time. The early scenes taking place in Panama are so heavy that they seem to go on forever, and later the alcoholic drift wanders around New York endlessly. Fred and Carol try their best, but the weary script and the direction of S-L-O-W simply do not give them a chance. Even the final scene, in which Maggie calls Skid to rise from the ashes and disappointment, simply does not sound believable. <br /> <br /> This film is worth watching once to watch some of the early performances of the stars McMurray and Lombard. However, I guarantee that the review will take about 48 hours.
