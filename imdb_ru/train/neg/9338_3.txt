Pam Grier plays the role of Coffey. She is a nurse who wants revenge on drug dealers who have picked up her sister as a bad heroine. As in any other movie of the 70s, you can expect that the racist bad guys will only get their desserts. <br /> <br /> In the 1970s, dozens of these films were made, and they are truly humiliating as for a black and white audience. This is mainly due to the vicious racial hostility in these films and degrading stereotypical characters. Especially female characters. <br /> <br /> Other common themes between Coffey and his other films include violent violence, corrupt police officers, car chases, a generous abundance of naked people and insanely sexy women. Not to mention the urban ghettos, populated by drug dealers, pimps, gangsters and other criminal scum. <br /> <br /> Greer was the undisputed queen of 70 black actors actors. She was gorgeous, and strong, and awesomely gorgeous. As in her other films, Pam overshadows other characters in Coffey. In fact, Pam is so charismatic on the screen that such films cannot be seen, without her as the main character. <br /> <br /> If you like Pam Greer, you'd better watch her other films, such as Foxy Brown or Friday Foster. These films have far less empty meanness than Coffey. Pam's character in Coffey humiliates himself too much to get the bad guys. Pam's characters in her other films about the Blizzards do not go so low as to get revenge, as Coffey did. <br /> <br /> I would say, see only Coffey if you can't see other Pam Greer films. Otherwise, Coffey is a waste of time. Only Pam's talent as an actress makes Coffy viewing bearable.
