Television really influences society ... just look at the surge in the popularity of cappuccino stores after this little piece of work debuted. In addition, real people who look as good as these people have no problems. <br /> <br /> Besides, does anyone really believe that these people can afford to live in a good Manhattan loft, considering what they are doing? living room? NBC just loves to insult the viewer's intellect, even if itâ€™s just on the level of Gampa I know a man who earns $ 100,000 a year as a web designer and lives in a tiny two-room apartment in Manhattan, which costs $ 2,200 a month. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a show called Friends, where six ugly people who are engaged in a dead-end situation live in a dirty area, where sirens constantly cry, and someone is robbed every week ... but then the landlord raises the rent. Now THAT I would look.
