I read in the newspapers that W. Snipes was ruined, so itâ€™s not surprising that he would take part in low-budget projects, such as The Contractor. He is another militant star who joined the growing club: the mediocre stars of the 90s (Van Damme, Segal, Lundgren, Snipes). Here he plays a major role in a cheap action movie filmed in Bulgaria (we must assume that this is London, as if only a complete moron bought it). This is a story from 1000 other films: special forces retired is a good guy hired again by the government to do wet work - after the government wants to get rid of him - a good guy runs away after killing bad guys (it was a spoiler? Don't guess!) the girl (Eliza Bennett) surpasses all other actors !!! One star for her plus one star for eye candy Lena Heedy, gets 2 stars. Only for loyal fans of snipes! The rest: avoid!
