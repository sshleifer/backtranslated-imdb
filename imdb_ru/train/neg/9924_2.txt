The Dutch Schulz, also known as Arthur Fleggenheimer, was a real person, and his rather dirty life is pretty well documented. In this film, intended to depict his life, one had to use a fictional character, because the over-dramatized events are too strong, unlike facts and chronology. Not only did he ignore some interesting details that were included in other versions, such as the public relations fiasco in upstate New York and his religious appeal. It is true that he was executed by Luciano, Lansky et al., Etc., but this is so far away. The exploding scene depicting Luciano performing Bo Weinbergâ€™s execution in his own house with the assistance of his own mother is ridiculous. In addition, there is a scene in which a Dutchman approaches his mother to protect Legs Diamond. It just does not work. Mrs. Flaggenheimer's character does not work either. This film does not need a loving Jewish mother for comic relief. The lame performance of the Legs Diamond was quite humorous. I am sure that man turns into a grave. And, by the way, the Dutchman did personally kill people, but he was not Rambo or 007. The scene in which he destroys the brewery is absurd. I dont know. Maybe it should have been a comedy, but I just did not understand.
