This film was so bad that it was funny. I couldn't stop watching though. The plot is standard, the acting is pretty awful (supporting actors such as the crazy neighbor and a lawyer friend were the best actors). It's pretty funny if you have the time to waste time and you like to watch the dramatic plot. <br /> <br /> The headliner, which plays "Katie", was simply fascinating, because I could not decide whether its deadpan, flat effect would affect it. was the result of a bad operation or just a bad game (I decided that it was both). That leaves a script for comments, which was pretty awful. Pat remarks, idiotic decisions and reckless stupidity on the part of each character in the film. Maybe this is what was so exciting; I dont know. I just looked to see how everything can be bad. (In fact, the dialogue cannot even be called a “cliche” - but it is almost completely meaningless.) <br /> <br /> In general, a very bad, cheap film. Scenes, the same scenes (house, building) were shown again and again without artistry or real binding to the action; more like a prop that was accidentally thrown into action in a bad game. A chase scene could have been shot by any minor in a warehouse or in an old school: bad shot, cheap props, minimal action ... and I still wanted to see the end. Go figure it out.
