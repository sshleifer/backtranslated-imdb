** WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> If you can cope with a very unpleasant storyline, this film really offers a tremendous help to an incredibly curious melodrama. Surprisingly, this film was copied and copied several times over the years, although it’s hard to understand ANY director inspired by this crappy drama. None of the Hemingway women can act here (although Mariel HAS has improved over the years), Ann Bancroft offers the only touch to the class as a defense attorney, and Chris Sarandon, in turn, is pathetic and unintentionally cheerful, like a grinning, smart bad guy part. <br /> <br /> Veteran filmmaker Lamont Johnson cannot make a silk wallet from this sow's ear of a script that is filled with explosive wild dialogue and outlandish situations. For example, the final sequence, where Margot grabs his shotgun and pursues Sarandon after his last shocking act, should be exciting, but causes a hearty laugh instead. Add Michelle Polnarev’s notoriously shrill and spacious musical accompaniment, and you’ll get a true sense of guilt, even though after watching you probably feel dirty and needing a hot shower. Do not say you were not warned.
