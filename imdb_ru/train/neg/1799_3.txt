Skippy from "Family Ties" is played by Eddie, the stinking "metallic" nerd who is chosen. When his favorite woozy metal singer, Sammy Kerr, dies, he throws a hissing fit, tearing off all the posters on the wall of his bedroom. But when he later receives an unreleased record, which keeps the spirit of his dead "metal" idol. At first, he is fascinated by ideas of revenge, but then he does not want to go as far as Sammy. That is actually not that far, because his main victims seem to be in the hospital. This film is very funny and has the same relation to real metal as, say, “Rock Star”. Well, maybe a little more than this garbage, but you understand my point. And how ANY can root for the guy that Skippy plays from Family Ties, I have no idea. Cameo Gene Simmons is fine, and Ozzy Osbourne achieves consistency, I applaud him for it, but otherwise miss this one. <br /> <br /> My rating: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Elise Richards gets topless, topless at a pool party
