It will be brief. Let me first state that I am agnostic and not completely crazy about xtians, especially from xtian fanatics. However, this documentary was like a teenager, evil at his mother, that he did not allow him to play video games. I just could not take it seriously. The mention of how Charles Manson thought he was the Christ to illustrate that Christianity can be evil? I don't know, it was just cheap and childish - it made the opposition look ignorant. In addition, the narrator seemed just snobbish and pretentious. Delivery was complete redundant. I can't take this documentary seriously. I can turn to an angry teenager who is angry at his mother and does not allow him to play video games.
