I never heard of it until the owner of my local DVD rental service mentioned it to me; As a horror film from the 1980s, with the infamous difference from the UK ban, I decided to check it out. The film turned out to be a boring, amateur and ugly trip; the sound recording is so bad that the dialogue is incomprehensible in half of the cases, and the game gives new meaning to the word "inept"! <br /> <br /> Worse, the film follows a terribly tired formula: a trio of teenage girls get into an accident and end up in the shelter of a dysfunctional family living in a remote area. Soon one of the girls goes in search of help, and they never hear of her again; the other, still bedridden, quickly gets rid of (being forgotten for most of the time). The heroine is the one who interacts most with the three inhabitants of the house: the Haridan of the biblical mother (a terrible reappraisal), her depressed (and long-suffering) daughter and the strange brother of the latter, who sometimes appears on the scene to drool at the sleeping female guests. <br /> <br /> Often resorting to memories at the dinner table from a mother who hates a man (as a means to fill the dreary, not to mention unoriginal, background) and who invariably develop into a sparring contest between mother and daughter, the film does have one ace in the sleeve - the end of the twist is as unexpected as it is ingenious, but it does little to eliminate the bad taste left by the film in the mouth (as much through the limp of it all as intermittent blood) or the inevitable feeling that I spent 80 minutes of mine time ...
