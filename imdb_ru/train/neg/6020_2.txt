I like the end of the day movies. I like bi-movies. I was hoping that I would like this movie. <br /> <br /> I could ignore the bad effects, often cruel music, causing ugly strings. I could ignore the inexplicable events, and the fact that the film constantly relies on deus ex machina is forgiving, considering the subject. I could ignore the fact that people who are struggling with hunger and trying to achieve world peace are bad guys. None of this kills the movie. What kills this film is that itâ€™s just plain boring. In fact, nothing happens; almost all the scenes in the film are intended to impose the morality of the filmmakers on viewers, at the cost of having a coherent story or some kind of uncertainty. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for an entertaining B-movie, look elsewhere. This movie is just boring.
