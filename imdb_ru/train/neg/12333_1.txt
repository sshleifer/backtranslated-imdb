Un-bleeping-believable! In this, Meg Ryan does not even look like his usual attractive personality, which usually makes me forgive her petty, obscene game. It is hard to believe that she was the producer of this dog. Plus Kevin Kline: in what self-destructive journey did his career begin? Damn ... Banzai !!! Finally it was directed by the guy who made Big Chill? There must be a rehearsal of Jonestown - Hollywood style. Wooofff!
