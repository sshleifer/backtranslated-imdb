Jack Black is an annoying character. This is an annoying indie film for a 14 year old. Should I write eight more lines? Anu de la Reguru is damn nice to look like a Mexican nun who puts up with pretty forward and Jack Black's crude achievements. This film is a version of the indie film PG 13. I really like the film, in which there is the courage to explore Mexican culture. This film deeply explores Mexican culture. I'm just choking on his cultural rudeness: Jack Black is so rude. A white man, such as Jack Black, is not my most valuable emissary in Mexican culture. The Mexican wrestling culture is not the most transparent place where a white guy like me could find. I suspect Mexico is more culturally opaque than Jack Black is represented here. <br /> <br /> I think IMDb changed my review. Has anyone else changed his review? Just a question.
