Let's chase: this erotica pornography film is sold to the masses under the name that the studio is milking every last penny of an American pie nipple. Period. <br /> <br /> The whole storyline (and this should not mean that there is a lot to do around) serves as a means to show the audience more tits and sex scenes. <br /> <br /> If you are a tween guy and you are too squeamish to get actual pornography, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, the film has nothing to offer. <br /> <br /> The subject of acting and character development is practically non-existent, and history is a meaningless impulse to nudity and drunkenness. and leprosy (none of which was especially remembered). <br /> <br /> go buy real porn, if this is what you want to see, and if not, then watch a good movie. Animal House, Kids, or even the original American pie are all great cinematographic works, and they all contain heavy drinking and nudity. <br /> <br /> “It’s not how much you use it”
