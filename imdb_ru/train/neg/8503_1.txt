with all the European studios involved in this, you might think that you at least get a beautiful photo; but local flavor is minimized. <br /> <br /> Irritation No. 1: Does Mira Sorvino use a Russian accent to play a Spanish policeman - WTF? The story is hopelessly confused. Is there a supposed romantic story that is deliberately confused - is she lesbian or not? - serves no purpose. The police in the film are the most stupid people who have long made a movie about a serial killer. There seems to be some message about the Spanish Civil War in the mid-30s, but since almost everyone involved is dead, no one sees the point. <br /> <br /> Despite the bullfight part of the story (which part? who can tell), you can never take a good look at the bullfight. Ernest Hemingway would hit the director in the nose - with my blessings.
