Well, my friend and I rented a DVD and after about 30 minutes in the film we exchanged opinions many times: “ehh, what is this film about and, more importantly, do I really want to know how it ends?” We either needed drugs in order to interest us in the “conspiracy”, or simply stopped the pain right there and then, in order to see something else. We chose the latter. <br /> <br /> I really liked “But I'm a fan,” but Mango Kiss is too stupid and surreal for my taste, sorry! I definitely prefer "D.E.B.S", "Better Than Chocolate", "Fucking Amal", "Goldfish Memory" and "Fire". <br /> <br /> -Sorcia
