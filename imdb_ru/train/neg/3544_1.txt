The Vulpine Massacre was supposed to be this movie with an actual title. And in the tag should have been the inscription "It is guaranteed that your children will scream!" This is a natural drama telling the story of a family of wild foxes in a remote region. Starting with the meeting and mating of two young foxes and the subsequent birth of a large family and tests for their upbringing. The only thing that is said in the narration is a tree that stands above the den, giving an idea of ​​the love and life of animals ... Beautiful landscapes and magnificent shots of animals. Sounds good, huh? From there, things are going straight to hell, and then they start drilling to the core ... <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers below - Or they could be a warning! *** Practically first of all, we learn that one of the foxes was born blind. But it seems that he gets along quite well, and he is accompanied by a wonderful cheerful musical score ... And then he dies ... Then we have one of the adventures of the brothers and sisters. And then he dies ... One of the sisters gets her screen time ... and then she dies ... And so it looks like some terrible slasher, when one fox after another dies by nature, in traps, it’s just disappear, and even a bunch of snowmobiles! By the end of the film, almost all the foxes were killed. Although, fortunately, no deaths are visible on the screen. (At least in the version we saw.) Unlike, say, “Tarka Otter,” deaths in this film are almost all senseless and border on the sadist in how hopes are built and then disappear. One or two losses would be acceptable. This is a film about nature after all. But not nearly the whole family. <br /> <br /> Do not go to watch this film, deceived by the joyful box, to think that it is safe for children. Watch this with some foresight that things * will * not go well at all, and that you or your children may feel very sick depending on how sensitive you are or they are. You can enjoy it. Or you can't ...
