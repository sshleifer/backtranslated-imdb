Well, people, to be honest ... it must be one of the worst show business films that has ever been made, but I was laughing stupidly (maybe that's why I liked it). Basically, it's all about sex, sex and the way to get your personal 15 minutes of fame. Did I mention that sex was the main problem in this movie? If you like bizzer characters and light entertainment, watch this movie when you get the chance (and you have nothing better). <br /> <br /> *** Attention spoilers !!! *** The funny thing about the movie was that the guy asked Jerry if he could marry his goat (!) In the series, and threw his wallet with his love. photos. Three And for bad taste and fun!
