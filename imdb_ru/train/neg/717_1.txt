This was supposed to be a parody of the LOTR trilogy. But it was one of the worst films I've ever seen. Bad game, bad script, everything is bad. It's my personal opinion. I have no doubt that there are people who will like this sense of “humor”, but the films contained the best parodies from famous directors, such as Mel Brooks or the Zucker brothers. I work in the cinema and in the DVD Shop, and the success of this film was the same in both areas: in the movie it was a good (but not great) success during the first two weeks, but then when the reviews from those who saw it were not too good, the film very quickly sank. On DVD sales, it was good for a short time, but then no one else asked for it. Over the past ten years, the two worst films I've ever seen are Ring and Torque. I can't decide which one was worse, but I’m happy that there are so many good films, so I don’t need to think too much about this issue.
