There really is not much to say about the Las Vegas Lady. It's pretty harmless, but it's a little more than a boring movie about the robberies of the 70s. The film is not as smart and sexy as we would like. The plot is a repetition of a weary old casino robbery storyline that was made to death. Except for the case of Las Vegas Lady, I think the robbery plot was developed by a 3-year-old. Three women are involved in the plan, one to overlook and see the scale outside the Circus Cic building, one to impersonate the waitress, only to blow up her cover as soon as possible, and one to stand around, exposing her split. That's all. Confused, huh? In addition to Stella Stevens and her breasts mentioned above, the other women involved in the conspiracy are not particularly remembered. Las Vegas Ladies co-stars Stuart Whitman. When he does not caress Stevens, his participation in the film is emphasized by one of the most idiotic shootings ever filmed. <br /> <br /> I really wanted this movie to be liked. He has a 70s feeling, which I always like, and a few nice pictures of Las Vegas around 1975. But the film itself is too boring to be rated higher than 4/10 ?? and this is probably exaggerating. In the end, the Las Vegas Lady is a waste of some perfectly good splitting.
