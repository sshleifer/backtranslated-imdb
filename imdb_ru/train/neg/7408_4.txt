I don’t quite understand why I clicked “contains a spoiler”, because, frankly, there are not enough explanations in the film to understand what had to spoil it. <br /> <br /> Visually, this basically delivers. Well, except for the 80s with monsters in a rubber mask. Now I will say that before that I had never seen the Lordi group and knew nothing about the fact that they won Eurovision. Apparently the monsters in this are band members, largely in their stage faces. No difference. Anyway, I did not know this while watching. I just thought that the monsters / demons were mostly passable. About. <br /> <br /> I am pretty sure that there is a semi-coherent explanation behind what we see on the screen, but in fact it may be better not to know. Probably, it would actually be incredible to limp, if you think about it. The action makes him move well enough that the viewer is mostly entertained, even if half the entertainment factor is joking that the fun should be in this movie. <br /> <br /> I gave him four mainly because I laughed at it, especially because it explains almost nothing. I must have been in such a mood, but for some reason I found this hella funny. Then I watch a movie on the Internet and find out that NO ONE knows what the hell it should be. It amused me even more and raised my account by another half point to 4/10. <br /> <br /> This is not scary and not particularly coherent, but rather pleasant from a visual and aural point of view. In general, far from necessary, but watchable. Do not expect too much and do not expect it to make any sense, and it can entertain you if you are in the right mood.
