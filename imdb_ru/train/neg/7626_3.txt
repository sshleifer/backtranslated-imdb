After hearing rave reviews of this film over the years, I finally decided to rent it and see. Let me start by saying that I am glad that the rent was free at the local library. This step was slow, boring, unreal, and the plot did not make sense. After 2 hours, I was ready to destroy this provincial Texas town and save a group of these characters from their suffering. I understand that taste is subjective, but believe me, I just donâ€™t understand all the hype I heard about this film. Dallas presented as good a detail in life in Texas as this film. Rent it only if you want to understand how film studios can pay reviewers enough money to convince the general public that a bad movie is good.
