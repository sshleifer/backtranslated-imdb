Gone With the Wind is one of the most overrated films in history. This is a movie that mothers, grandmothers and closed people love, who go to the movies every five years. Like a zombie movie, it blows. There is no flabby corpse in sight, and he is terribly light in the blood section. Zombie 3, on the other hand, is good in a flabby corpse and quite generous in blood, therefore better than Gone With the Wind. It is also not overvalued. Most reviewers have no illusions that this is garbage. This, however, is not boring trash. After a terrorist has stolen a virus, he drops it when a helicopter stalks him, and chemicals get into the ground. A terrorist exposed to a hideous mix hides in a hotel room, where he slowly turns into a meat-eating zombie. One of his first victims is the cleaning lady. As soon as she was bitten, hellish brand Lucio Fulci broke free. As usual in the movie Fulci, acting is terrible, the storyline is riddled with plot holes, and the blood is abundant. It turns out that the film was shot by Fulci and Bruno Mattei, which explains his rather schizophrenic nature. It is also poorly filmed, poorly edited, and the sound design is flat. Nevertheless, he is saved by his joyful adherence to horrible murders and an impatient pace. Definitely worth a raise if you undead are fuller. Or don't like "Gone With the Wind" is undoubtedly the worst zombie movie of all time.
