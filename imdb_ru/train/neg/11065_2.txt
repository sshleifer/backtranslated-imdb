This film had so much potential. Anyone who has been following the story of Jeffrey knows that there are so many details missing from this movie that itâ€™s funny. Too much time and effort was spent on a film about Dahmer's homosexual tendencies and his use of alcohol. Where was the character development? The origin of any villain is always interesting, and Dahmer was no exception. Where does the film tell about his youth when he began to kill and maim small animals? Instead, we give a dizzying set of memories that try to explain the origin of the killer, but do not affect the main point in the development of Dahmer. In addition, the reason why the country was so intrigued by this story was the details - how he kept the bodies in his apartment, and what measures and measures he took to achieve this goal; his cannibalism and his pursuit of flesh, etc. I could continue, but to sum up, there are too many lagging moments in the film, focused on his sexuality and not enough blood - good things you expect to see when you name from the movie "Dahmer".
