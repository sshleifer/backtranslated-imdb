I saw this film completely in the 1960s and 70s, yes, it is terrible and could become the progenitor of the Faces of Death series, popular in the 80s and 90s. Given the state of the so-called "driving instruction" in our day, it should be necessary for everyone who is preparing to learn to drive to view. When you see a violent death in all its blood and horror, you certainly (if you have any sensitivity at all) get a more truthful picture of the duties necessary for safe driving, which can make one moment of thoughtlessness or inattention behind the wheel. I worked at Bell Telephone in the 70s and 80s, and at some point I was appointed to conduct a security lesson. I found this film in the company's library, showed it at the session, several people fell ill and had to leave the room! Incredibly, most of them later said: “I never knew that a car accident could be so terrible!” This film, and another one, “Red Asphalt”, is certainly a reality in graphic form itself. I will never forget this, I would just like to find a copy when my children attended the "driving course" in high school!
