I usually do not leave the film, but halfway I did it. This film promised something different, but I kept thinking, have I not seen it before? Beware, spoilers! Back at 1, the spacecraft falls and lands on the ground, well, all these years later, with a super adult on board no less, this thing still manages to burn and break! What, this advanced civilization can not develop the chassis? For such a liberal industry, we will see another Woody Allen film, please, without the black ones! Superman runs, saving people, making sure that he holds on to Europe and the United States, do not go into dark areas, please. Perhaps I could survive this about 30 years ago, but now and now.
