It hurts to watch, and not entirely because of sympathy in the struggle of the characters. Two of the main characters, Cynthia’s mother and Monica’s recognized daughter, spend the bulk of the film on miserable boredom and bitterness, respectively. Their characters are so firmly established that their redemption into tolerant personalities after a quick family catharsis is incredible. It was not worth the wait. I would like a decent feed for honesty among families was not such a headache to watch.
