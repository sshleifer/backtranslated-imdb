My main commentary on this film is: how did Zwick get to work with reliable actors? Impressive cast? even for supporting characters, none of which really helps this film. I have to admit though, did Tom Hank's cameo almost make it worth ?? what was it about tom? Did you lose the bet? The best cameo of the film was Joe Isuzu, although - definitely a classic! The premise is good. The Basinger character, struggling with the existence of the Pink Lady, sneaks to the Vegas motel, motel smashing the glorious pyramid of cosmetics sales. This happens when a Corbett character travels to Las Vegas to deliver an Elvis suit to his ex-wife, who will soon be motivated by extortion. As they both make their way, they have numerous clashes with Elvis imitators, who are on their way to agreeing to emulate Elvis in Vegas. Soon the FBI intervenes and begins to track what they consider to be the serial killer of Elvis imitator. Unfortunately, the premise does not mean that the film was good. <br /> <br /> When watching this movie, imagine that you are back in first grade? when storylines and continuity are not very important. It is much more pleasant to just watch how Basinger looks beautiful in her Pink Lady outfit, than to wonder why what she does does not make sense. The film tries its best, but ultimately fails. Ultimately, it is filled with ideas that theoretically could be funny, but in practice they were not that funny. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst thing, but you may feel that you want to leave the building when you are watching this one ???? Do not say that I did not warn you!
