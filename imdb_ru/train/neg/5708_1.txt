People like me will tear this movie apart. This is just unreal. The plot is sooooo predictable. You can foresee everything that happens comfortably. Of course, they find treasures and become dirtily rich, and cheat the bad guy. We have seen it a million times. The authors of this film must think that most of the film that goes to the public is stupid. They should be right, because most people really liked this movie. I mean solving riddles in seconds. Secret treasure room, hidden under the subway of Manhattan? One would think that with all the work in the New York underground this room would have been open earlier. and all that was built during the civil war? PLEASE And the love story between Ben and Abigail ?? how cute, and I thought that the novel in the novels of Clive Kassler was weak. They just fall in love like this, after 2 seconds, WHAT I would no longer care about saving my own ass, and then about getting it. hell with a girl and a stupid piece of paper. 1/10 trash
