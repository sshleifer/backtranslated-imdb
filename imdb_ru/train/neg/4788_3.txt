In the third entry of the Ghost series, Mike and Reggie continue to pursue the High Man, who is assisted by a 9-year-old boy with the joy of the trigger, black GI Jane and the spirit of the late brother Mike (he died in the original Phantom). Number 3 is a rather disappointing sequel, since the blood-black comedy is much less inspiring and exciting, as it was in Phantasm II. I had a feeling that stress was simply put on Reggie’s incompetence as a lover and his talent as a comedian. The humor in the previous film was much drier and more depressed, which fits better with a similar story. In addition, the settings here are not so gloomy, plus the constant presence of a tall guy (Agnus Shrim) is not so obvious ?? There is still a lot of blood this time, but not half. By the way, beware of the strictly cut version, as it shows the most delightful killings behind the scenes. The entire Phantasm series is a lifelong achievement of Don Coscarelli, who has so far written and filmed 4 episodes - the fifth in production. The first is a semi-cultural classic, the second is a celebration of horror, cruelty and violence, and the rest can be easily missed. A. Michael Baldwin returns as Mike, although James LeGros portrayed his character much better in “Phantom II.”
