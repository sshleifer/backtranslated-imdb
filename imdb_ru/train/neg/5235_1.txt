I can roughly understand why some people would like to emphasize the connection of this film with the eighties, but I would not say that this is an accurate description of the lives of most people in that era — even in Bradford’s poorest estates. However, this is typical of the blunt agitprop garbage, which at that time created the expensive old Royal Court Theater. A lot of “correct” mastery for a small, small audience, but rather retarded, well connected to provide future commissions for ardent playwrights. This is a simple fact: if you want to reflect on a more truthful common experience, you will find that millions of people nod, knowing they agree to love and live, as depicted in “Gregory Girl”. <br /> <br /> I would have been tempted to call it a “kitchen sink” drama, but it would have done a disservice to the plumbing industry. However, as for the decent script, this film is really completely washed out. For some reason, he scored a strange popularity among those who read films about the Guardian - I can only assume that they get the visual effect of pretending to be slums. Stay away, my friends. This is a bad movie with a bad script, which likes to think that it breaks boundaries, adding a humorous understanding of dark life on estates. it is not .. but it is gloomy. Do the washing instead.
