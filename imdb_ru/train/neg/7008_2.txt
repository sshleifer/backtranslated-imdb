Annie Potts is the only highlight in this truly boring movie. Mark Hamill plays a teenager who is really very upset because someone stole “Corvette,” which he and his classmates turned into a hot rod (quite possibly the ugliest car in the movie), and goes to Las Vegas with Annie to track down the evil genius who stole his pride and joy. <br /> <br /> I’d rip out my eyes after watching this, if it weren’t fun to watch Annie Potts in a very early role, and it’s too bad for Hamill that he didn’t take a few acting lessons from her. Danny Bonadews also makes a stupid cameo.
