Jamie Foxx is my favorite comedian. However, I feel that he has sold out to get his first major role in the budget. Foxx follows in the footsteps of people like Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chapple, who have all seen how their talents are wasted by stereotypical producers who think that black men who commit beautiful crimes are a fun concept (see Money Talks, Blue Streak). <br /> <br /> Well, I laughed a few times, and all these comedians continue to act in fun roles, but I would really like these guys to play a la Marlon Wayans in Requiem for a Dream. Or in "Vivid Color" Tommy Davidson and Damon Wayans, moving performances in Spike Lee's Batirsed satire.
