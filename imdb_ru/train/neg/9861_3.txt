I only sat in GenCon because it was quiet and I could take a nap. What a waste of time. Beverly D'Angelo and William Catt? WTF? The lady who played Flo and Abe Vigodu was busy or something like that? <br /> <br /> Indeed, a piece of unfunny trash. The characters were stereotypical without meaning (I think ...) and wooden, most of them seemed to be on autopilot. The so-called "funny" situations described in some other so-called reviews were so beaten up that I mourned the writers. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t understand how someone can find it worthwhile. , seriously. I only give 3 out of 10, because in order to be 2 or 1, he must be either five o'clock or have more Kelly Lebrok.
