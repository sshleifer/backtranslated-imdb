I don’t even have to watch this movie, because in reality it’s not a horror movie, and therefore it doesn’t deserve Dr. Cheese’s attention. At least, this is not a horror in the usual sense. This is definitely a terrible offer - to spend your time watching this shit. That's why I turned it off after the first four hours. Then imagine my surprise when the clock showed that only 45 minutes had passed. Yes, it's true; Simply put, this film - b-o-r-and-n-w. <br /> <br /> The Order had many flaws, and not all of them are unique. In particular, it seems to me that the main problem with the “religious” horror film subgenre is the reluctance of Hollywood to practice Christianity on its own terms. It is quite possible to make truly creepy movies that are also Orthodox. Just ask William Peter Blatty. In fact, without orthodoxy, such films are just a buffet of cinematographers' imagination (usually boring and illogical). <br /> <br /> Think about it. If someone made a film about, say, physics, but not only misunderstood the basic laws of physics, but based the whole plot on its wrong images, you would quickly get tired of the resulting meaningless plot. The same applies to these types of films. <br /> <br /> In other words, the Order (and many similar films before it) invented whole things about the Catholic Church, about the Christian faith and trying. build a plot of these inventions. Not surprisingly, the plot turns out to be incoherent and stupid. This film has the extra charm of being watched just like toenails grow. <br /> <br /> Avoid this steaming pile.
