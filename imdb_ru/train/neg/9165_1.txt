In this review there are no spoilers, because everything has already been shown in the trailer of the film. I try to be balanced in my review, because I strongly support local films, but I cannot but support a backlash against this film. It is slow, boring and borders on meaningless. Even “almost pleasant and believable moments” were immediately undermined by painful cliches and bad play. Vernetta Lopez and Wong Lee Ling, whom I usually love, were only bearable in this film. It seemed that the director was trying to make a melodramatic television soap, then got carried away and decided to put it on the big screen. Leap years have to go with an RA (Rated Awful) rating, but that did not change my faith in local films. There will be more good films if more such films are not made.
