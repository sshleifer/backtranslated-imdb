I am a fan of Gene Harlow, because she was of star quality. I don't think her films are good, and I don't even think she was a good actress, but she certainly was great in comedies. Every comedy in Missouri Girl is very good. But this film may be more like a love story. Gene Harlow is wonderful in this, and you can forget the rest of the actors - their performances do not bring anything new. I am always impressed by the idea that the beautiful body of Harlow belonged to a sick woman. Well, in this film, she looks beautiful.
