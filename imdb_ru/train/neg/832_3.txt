I give support to this film that it is very well made and acted quite well. But I could not overcome the improbability of all this. <br /> <br /> First of all, the game, built around the concept of “Russian Roulette”, which should be filled for an hour. The big problem is that if you do a “live” show, you have a chance that your first participant will be unsuccessful enough to draw a “real” bullet. Then what are you doing? You have 50 minutes of the show to fill out and nothing to show. The consequence of this is that well, you get to the end, and the first five participants survive, which means that the number six has a bullet and can not get paid. He is not going to shoot himself at this moment, so this is a kind of anti-climatic. <br /> <br /> The second problem is almost as big. Human nature. People are going to flinch, panic, stain their underwear and do something that otherwise would not have turned out good television. Too many accidents. That is why “real” reality TV is actually written in strict scenarios and even more carefully edited. <br /> <br /> (The only random thing is the artist’s rant about female victims, which historically were rare. Predictably, as she shot herself to no avail. <br /> <br /> We tend to believe that the ratings the show will rise until it happens at 1:00 am (unlikely) with an Asian girl character announcing every increase in ratings. <br /> <br /> Point by race and gender. Big surprise in the movies: two minorities (one gay ) and two women participating survive. So we were left with two white men, and, of course, a little less than this the pathetic one is the one who buys it. The purpose of such a show will be an accident, but the guy who you like the least is the guy who dies. <br /> <br /> The culmination is that after two hours of suicide fight on television, the character of Eva Mendez (Mendez starred and starred in this film, so she has no one to blame but herself), in fact, her conscience grows when someone dies. What did she THINK that was going to happen? She was quickly shot by an eyewitness, dissatisfied with all of this (the motives were never explained), and the show was a great success. Indeed? <br /> <br /> The problem of media satire is that it must either have some kind of rationale in reality, or be so excessive as to be ridiculous (like the Web). It is neither one nor the other.
