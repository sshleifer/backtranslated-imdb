I have rarely been exposed to such frank nonsense in a film that should be based on a historical person. A terrible joke with a film that I used to shrink everywhere. Horrible, banal, distorted and riddled with blatant lies and half-truths. <br /> <br /> Hitler’s famous biographer Jan Kershaw was originally to become a consultant to this film. However, he found the script so historically inaccurate and ridiculous that he refused and also demanded that they stop using his name as a source (he was embarrassed to think that people would think that he was involved). <br /> <br /> One scene shows Hitler beating up his dog. For this there is no source. Hitler loved animals above people. He introduced the strictest animal protection laws in Europe, banned vivisection and animal experiments. He was also a vegetarian. <br /> <br /> The film transforms his receiving the Iron Cross into a farce associated with bribery. Perfect lie. He was rewarded for his repeated courage over a long period of time. <br /> <br /> There are no historical documents showing that Hitler had ever had sex with his niece. Not alone. <br /> <br /> In addition, Hitler is portrayed as a mad simpleton on this trash click. <br /> <br /> If he was even half as ignorant, insane and fat as he was in this meaningless film, as in real life, you would not even know that he ever existed. Never mind being the leader of Germany. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this film was terribly awful. <br /> <br /> Go look at the “Crash” and do it very widely.
