It seemed to me that I read somewhere that it was the last play “Monogram”, but whether it is true or not, it does not matter, because if it is not so, then it should have been. This is a deadly dull affair with gray-haired John Carradin, in which he looks like an elderly scientist who, with the help of his young student (Robert Shane), is trying to bring the dead back to life. Every time their objects come to life, they seem to have a whitish face that looks like marble when they are tied to the lab table (a big deal). Carradine manages to restore his faithful dog after death, and the fool gains an unusual ability to walk through walls in a ghostly way (wooooooooohhhh). That's all she wrote. <br /> <br /> For a very cheap quick monogram, this thing, at least, actually uses a more unusual laboratory setup than is usually highlighted. The funniest joke in the film is that the “old” doctor Carradine constantly calls his “young” assistant Shane “m'boy”, when in fact Carradine was actually 40, and Shane was 45 when they did it!
