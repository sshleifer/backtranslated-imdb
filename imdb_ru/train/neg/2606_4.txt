Drew Barrymore plays a young Holly Gooding, who moves to the beginning screenwriter Haku Patrick Highsmith (George Newburn) and completely destroys his life, claiming that her "twin" or an evil twin wants to kill her and her family. <br /> <br /> This stupid horror film is difficult to take seriously, even if the directors and actors themselves seem too serious. The "double" is confused, with some unpleasantly dull dialogue. <br /> <br /> Some viewers will notice that character Drew’s name is taken from the role of Audrey Hepburn in Tiffany’s Breakfast, and Newbern’s character’s name is played by the famous writer Patricia Highsmith (he’s actually trying to rewrite Breakfast like a horror movie, believe it or not!). <br /> <br /> I believe that he deserves some respect for not being your typical horror movie - I mean, writer / director Avi Nesher seems to genuinely care about his characters and gives his film more plot than standard bastard. <br /> <br /> After a stupid villain explaining everything - the confrontation of the audience, the film continues to present a disgusting, off-time point that needs to be seen to be believed. This film, of course, does not skimp on blood. <br /> <br /> But hey! Drew is killing her mother in this. No, I'm not joking. Jaid Barrymore appears at the beginning, only to forcibly kill. <br /> <br /> Drew is always very watchable and very sexy about it. Newburn looks like a pretty, nice guy. But the culmination of the film should be the scene with Sally Kellerman, an attractive veteran who is very professional in her one scene as a former nun who began to have phone sex (!!!!!!). <br /> <br /> The film is mostly useless, but rather funny on a scruffy, disgusting little level. <br /> <br /> 4/10
