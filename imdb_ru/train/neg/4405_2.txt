All I can say is that before watching the film I had no hint of who Annemarie Schwarzenbach was or what her life story was ... and I must admit that the film hardly helped to get this data .. . and even this failed to convince me to do some research by typing a few words on Google; However, all I can say is that actress Janette Hein was gorgeous with her dumb expression, she really played well and showed a deep depressive mental status, as it really is. <br /> <br /> In the end, based on the screenplay, the film took place in Turkey and Tehran, as well as in Afghanistan ... but believe me, I am familiar with this region, everything was about the Arab desert in Morocco. Turkish and Persian people are completely different in face and culture. as well as in a language that is not Arabic. <br /> <br /> I believe that in order to create a film like this, of a documentary type, you need to carefully study all these minor elements.
