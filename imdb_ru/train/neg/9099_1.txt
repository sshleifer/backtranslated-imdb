This review also contains the spoiler of the first film - so if you have not seen a single film and you want, but you do not want spoilers, do not read this review! <br /> <br /> Although this is supposed to be a film about the meeting of Christian and Catherine for the first time, the film is a bad copy of the first Cruel Intentions. The actors, whom they portrayed as Christian Ryan Philip and Catherine Sarah Michelle Gellar, are really very bad substitutes. None of them can cope with such a clever, mocking attitude to a rich child, like the original actors. It is absolutely terrible that some of the dialogues were literal - not so much between Christian and Catherine, but if you listen carefully enough, you will recognize them. There are also discrepancies in the plot - if it was really the first meeting of Christian and Catherine, then why did Christian fall in love with the girl at the end of the film? Presumably, he was supposed to fall in love for the first time in the original film (with the character Reese Witherspoon). <br /> <br /> In addition, the link to the photo / comment “You could be a model” at the end was completely unconvincing and did not add anything. Overall, this film was a waste of time. I can't believe they made cruel intentions 3.
