After watching about half of this film, I noticed something strange ... I constantly switched on TV channels to see what else there is - not quite a good feature of the film. <br /> <br /> This film is listed as being in several genres, and I must say that in most cases it failed in each of them. After 80% of the movie, I switched to watching the old restart. The result - the whole film felt as if those who shot it, did not know what to do, and were in the mix without noticeable taste.
