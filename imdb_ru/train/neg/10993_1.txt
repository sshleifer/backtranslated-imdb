Of course, we like bad movies all the time, and we really enjoy them. However, it was not even a guilty pleasure, it was just crap. Some guy, Vince offer, who is arrogant enough to make himself the main character, while probably getting drunk / highly - probably both - and thought it was a great idea to make a movie. Then he continued to show his script to equally tall / drunk people. In general, this film was so bad, predictable and unoriginal that I could not get through 20 minutes until I turned it off. It makes you look like a citizen of Kane. Batman? WTF ... Some guy who walks with the bat, a real original. Almost as good as calling him Fat and having a fat guy in a superhero costume.
