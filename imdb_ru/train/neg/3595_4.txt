I was not as "lucky" as some others commenting on this film: I have never seen anything else of ... let's say, Sarno's "prolific" mind. I agree with many: some of the actresses who spend a lot of time topless and (go-go) dancing are not very attractive. I somehow liked Fraulein Crank (?) ... she was so homely, she was cute! The acting was also rather stale, although the delivery of strings in a second language could be a big part of this problem. Attempting to trace the plot was the main work: was it really? I sincerely agree with another comment: there is not much blood for a vampire film. Yes, if you want GOOD blood-sucking films, check out Hammer's classic works such as Dracula's Fear and (my personal favorite) Dracula's Brides. <br /> <br /> The most (unintentionally) humorous part is when the Lady Doctor unloads her clothes from a cloud of bats ... which you will never SEE! ... bats, I mean. <br /> <br /> It's good that you lose time if you happen to catch him here in the Great White North, but for the sake of all that is holy, don't rent it out!
