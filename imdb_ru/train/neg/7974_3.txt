Interesting first. A naive park ranger (Colin Firth) marries a beautiful, mysterious woman (Lisa Zane), whom he only knows for a short time. It seems they are happy, then it disappears without warning. He is looking for her and, after several dead ends, stumbles upon some of her humiliated childhood and dirty recent past, which may include criminal activity. And then, it seems, the filmmakers did not know what to do with the story. The beginning, although not as alarming as it seems, is at least watchable. Then it ceases to be interesting or even makes a lot of sense. And the ending is so lame, so boring and devoid of any excitement or reason that you think that the writers didnâ€™t know what to do with it, and it became boring for them to try. What a waste of a good idea!
