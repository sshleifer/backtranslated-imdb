The acting was terrible, and both sportsmen made a mistake ....... not only misunderstood the rules of figure skating, but also the rules of the game of hockey with girls. In GIRLS hockey you can not check. You also do not block for someone. Not all of them, girls, are disgusting and vile. I play hockey, and I'm only 4'11, and I was asked to go to schools like the one in the film. Also, not all hockey players hate skaters. Many of the current girls hockey once were themselves skaters. We also ride much faster than those in the film. I was confused by the movie that gave people the idea that we suck ....... although I have to mention that it is difficult to switch between sports because of the choice of fingers on figure skates ..... also some of those twisted moves , which KAtelin did on the ice, you could not do in the usual game of hockey. She mostly stumbled over a person who is illegal. It is also unrealistic that she will get a hockey scholarship when she skates. It really pissed me off that the scholarship would normally be used for someone who could benefit the team.
