OK, me and my friend shot it a few days ago, because we like to track bi-films, since we do them ourselves. Anyway, there was blood on the cover and strange looking naked girls with fangs and stuff ... and Tom Savini! This film simply can not fail! Right? wrong!! It just seems like such a waste! There was really no story, the dialogue was terrible (anyone there? X 1000 !!!), the characters were ... well, they really lacked any personality ... The effects were terrible ... and what's wrong with that long frilly shots of frightened people running around, doing nothing .. with extreme close-ups of eyes and stuff? We sat all movie waiting for something ... something happens ... but no ... "Oh, here come the nymphs! Great! Oh ... they kiss ... again ... and now for the violence Good ... nothing really happens ... again ... oh, now they run ... and close-ups of the eyes ... again ... oh, here is Tom Savini! Oh ... he died. .. right ... well, maybe now something cool or even interesting will happen .. no .. oh! cool! severed head! end ... oh, shit ... "And, finally, since I'm so full of myself ... tell you this! Give me a van, six cast, a strange looking house, Tom Savini, a pair of naked girls with fangs and buckets of blood, and I can make the coolest movie you've ever seen ... I made zero-budget films in two days, which has better effects, better game and better scenario than this one ... what does this guy from Johannes do ?? Making great movies easy! It could be so great ... I am very upset!
