One of those, "Why was this done?" films. The novel is very hard to swallow. This is one of those romances that suddenly "click" - they are in love. The film is filled with long pauses and unpleasant moments - the most notable is a restaurant on the road. Charles Grodin does a credible job, but most of the film is just him and Louise Lasser. Ask yourself if you want to observe Grodin with his neurosis and Lasser with her neurosis together for an hour and a half?
