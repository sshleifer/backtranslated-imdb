Cliches is a story about an upcoming divorce - or is it? - through the eyes of a 6-year-old child. Clumsy dialogue, cardboard characters, warehouse situations, a plot about zombies from red herring and, worst of all, absolutely no feedback, emotionally or dramatically. <br /> <br /> Nobody teaches creative writing anymore? The true sign of a weak storyteller — when you cannot create any satisfying denouement — just finish the story. I have to ask: “What made you think this is a story you should tell first?!” <br /> <br /> A good but lost debut of children's actor Anthony De Marco - the rest of the cast was, at best. case, forgettable. And they wonder why nobody watches indie films! This is ninety minutes of my life, I will never come back.
