This mini-series, also based on the book by Alex Haley, as well as The Queen, tried to use similar formulas, that is, to build a long history, following the life of the family for many years. While at Queen, the result was a workshop, here at Mama Flora, there was not enough inspiration. First, perhaps in the book itself, and certainly in this television production. Too much has been invested in too much haste over the years, so the unfolding saga is small, superficial, not as genuine as in Queen. Full ratings for the scene in the earlier parts of the film, which was prepared with great care, but as the film progressed, it seemed to have degenerated into some unpleasant mixture of Dallas and Forsythe in the last third of its three-hour length. I was hoping for more; but, obviously, Hayley was less inspired by this story than his almost biographical "Queen", and Peter Werner III does not suit John Herman. It is recommended only to those who have an appetite for these long stories of growing up generations.
