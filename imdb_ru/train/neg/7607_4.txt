“When a local sheriff is killed, his wife takes possession until she decides to clean up the city.” However, not everyone in the city is happy with what she does. When the sheriff appoints a curfew in the city, the local salon owner (also a woman) hires the killer to take care of the sheriff. The owner of the cabin could not know that the sheriff and the killer fall in love with each other. <br /> <br /> - Shooter is an example of what happens when you have a rather interesting concept and you combine it with poor performance. There's a good movie here somewhere trying to go out. In more capable hands or with a large budget, Gunslinger might be an interesting look at the role of women in the Old West. As such, Gunslinger is an inaccurate mess in a film. <br /> <br /> - There is so much bad in the film: an auxiliary cast without acting ability, unnatural and unnatural dialogues and sets that look like sets. But the biggest offender is editing. I was amazed at how many times the scene began with the actors (and the horses for that matter), clearly expecting Corman to shout "Action." The best is the scene of two riders on horseback, just standing next to the building. Suddenly they take off and ride around the corner, as if they were traveling a few miles. Or take the example of people who seem to be able to transport themselves through the city. We see a person enter the building, and a second later he appears through the city to mount his horse. <br /> <br /> - Corman didn't have a few decent actors to work with. Although none of them was a great star, Beverly Garland, John Yarland and Allison Hayes were able to show a good game. But in Ganslinger they don’t have much work to do. <br /> <br /> - I have seen movie versions for both MST3K and non-MST3K. I highly recommend taking the MST3K route.
