Given the name and the unusual boxed graphics, I was ready for almost everything. Perhaps my expectations were too high because I stayed a bit dry. <br /> <br /> A film crew working on a sexy sex movie ends up in an unfamiliar house when they get lost in Mist and decide that the best way to spend the evening is to have sex. Where has this installation not been used before? The difference here is that the sex is very perverted. It is not allowed to show all the goods (inguinal pictures were banned in Japan for a long time, what is shown is clouded), the film is trying hard to show the viewer how unnatural sex can be. <br /> <Among all the strange events there is a dirty monster (the origin of which I can not understand) and starts killing men and raping women ... then killing them too. Some of the sights are few, especially a woman who has her intestines pulled out through her vagina or another woman who spits out a mouthful of ... material, but otherwise the blood is a fairly standard price. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film is shot with its own ideas; he is too excessively sexy to be a straightforward picture of horror, and too ugly to work like a sex movie. Mediums can work, but the balance should be. <br /> <br /> 4/10
