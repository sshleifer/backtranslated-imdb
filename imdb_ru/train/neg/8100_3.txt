Bonfires of Vanity is a film drenched in sweat. I can’t remember a single film that tried so hard to be so ruthlessly outrageous, provocative and important, but still failed in all directions. It is like a comic that does not laugh, but cannot leave the scene. The harder the movie tries, the louder each attempt at laughter leads to a loud bang. The despair that the film demonstrates is so vivid that it almost arouses pity for all who participate in it. <br /> <br /> The film reaches ridiculous status only twice. Once, in the field of view, Geraldo Rivera plays a disgusting, arrogant and amoral television journalist-journalist — which is funny only because he obviously does not understand that he is playing himself. Another scene worth laughing at is the last “big moment” of the film, in which the judge, played by Morgan Freeman, reads a sanctimonious lecture on what morality is (“this is what your mom taught you!”). The pompousness of the moment is insulting to the point of absurdity. <br /> <br /> However, it should be recognized that this is a noble effort. He has a good, but badly-played group of actors who are trying to make characters from thin cardboard cartoons. The film looks professional, and the small cinematic flourishes that director Brian DePalma just loves are obvious, if not particularly effective. But the film, which clearly wants to be a commentary on modern morality and ethics, never rises above the level of the cartoon. Satire requires style. Farce requires energy. Even a sitcom takes time. But the best that Bonfires can gather is despair. In the end, you do not want to laugh, you just want to turn away.
