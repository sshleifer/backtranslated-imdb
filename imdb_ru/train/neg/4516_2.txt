I bought this DVD set, the vision was not visible, and it is a pity that I did not. The script needed to be seriously rewritten, as it seems to be completely devoid of any feelings and pales in comparison with the book. The lighting is terrible, not very polished, but if it were simple, I could have missed it. The script does not focus enough on the characters ... there is hardly any introduction to the various characters, which makes it difficult to determine who is who (especially on airplanes - I have no idea who will die when). <br /> <I have long felt that the key to a good movie is to get viewers to take care of the characters; if you don't have it, you have nothing. There was no attention to the characters at all - you never recognized them - who they were, what they liked ... what made them do what they do. The series lasts 5 hours and is divided into 6 parts ... I bet you wonder what they have been doing all this time, if they have not detailed the characters - they have added a lot of filler ... I will say that at least an hour is spent on how they land and take off on their planes. (I mean, do we really need to see it again and again ???). I would give it a much higher rating if they only improved our knowledge about the characters.
