I have a question for those who thought about this idea. What for? What made them think of making a second film about it. If memory serves, did not Cinderella end with the words "All lived happily ever after"? I'm sure it was done, or it was meant. Wait a minute, if they all lived happily, how can there be a continuation? If they are not trying to make the most boring story in history, there can be no continuation. I mean, of course, they could have Cinderella sing about rubbish for two hours, but why? A film that ends “happily ever after” cannot have a continuation; if this happens, they will not live happily ever after! Something must go wrong, which causes problems with the first final! What for? It is not right, it is evil. This is my last word on this issue.
