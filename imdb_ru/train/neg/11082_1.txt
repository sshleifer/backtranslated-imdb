I know this is a Power-Rangers trick and is meant for seven-year-olds, but really, why did they take this film seriously? If they are going to write a story with pencils, at least decency, to make it stupid. It's quite fun if you watch it. We have a typical family filled with stamped characters (the father of a war veteran who lost his wife and blames himself for lolola), impartial children who try their best to fill the stereotype, but fail with a terrible game, and a ridiculously disgusting insolent guy who doesn't makes sense to the cinema, but to fill the space of the camera. Fun stuff! <br /> <br /> However, the real great moment comes closer to the end, when the military dad and the villain-villain try to arrange a sword fight, but then they realize that none of them know how (probably because There is no place in the budget for choreographers), so they came up with this setting like the American gladiator to run. Lol <br /> <br /> 1/10 of the rating, because they are trying to take it seriously.
