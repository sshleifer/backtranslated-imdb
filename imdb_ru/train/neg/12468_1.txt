Simply put: the movie is boring. The cliche on the cliché is confirmed, and the storylines never converge. It seems that the director was not sure whether to make a film or a documentary. The main story is very subtle (a CIA agent orders to kill the oil prince, he will be caught and then warned the prince (why?)) And therefore some elements were added to make the film more interesting. Thus, the child dies, which leads to the father’s “natural” response: to freely advise the person indirectly responsible for the death of his son. The lawyer has a drunken "friend" and he keeps him nearby, why no one knows. Some children become suicide bombers and blow up a ship. <br /> <br /> In general, this is one of the worst films I've seen lately. I was neither entertained nor mentally retarded. I did not laugh and did not cry, did not understand and was not forced to learn or do business. It meant nothing to me, which in my opinion is the worst thing that can be said about the film.
