I warn you here: I decided to believe those reviewers who said that this is not a fighter in the usual sense, but rather a psychological drama, so you should evaluate it on this basis and you will be fine. <br /> <I am here to tell you that they were wrong. Totally wrong. <br /> <br /> No, not really; it is very disappointing, if you are looking for an action movie, they were right about that. But it is also very unsatisfactory at all other levels. <br /> <br /> Tom Beringer was not so bad, probably no worse than usual; but what motivated them to play Billy Zane? Was this a kind of deadly desire on the part of the producers? A way to make their film a guaranteed failure? In this case, it worked. <br /> <br /> If they really wanted to succeed, why not hire someone who can act? Oh, and you might as well go to a screenwriter who knows how to write. Oh yes, and a director who knows how to drive. <br /> <br /> As a person who was sitting in this mess and really believed that he would soon redeem himself, I can assure you that this never happened. Sorry, it could be a good movie.
