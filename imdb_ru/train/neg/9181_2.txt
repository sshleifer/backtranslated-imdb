I usually try to be professional and constructive when I criticize films, but my GOD !!! It was the worst movie I've ever seen. Bad game, bad effects, bad script, everything is bad! <br /> <br /> The story tells about a group of young clichés heading for a rave (which happens in broad daylight) on a remote island. However, when the group arrives, all they find is an empty dance floor and bloodied clothes. Deciding to find out what happened to the other party-goers, the clan goes on a mission through a teeming zombie forest. During this crusade, they are assisted by a police nestling and a sea captain, who, as it turned out, has enough weapons to give to each of the children. They also meet with Jonathan Cherry and some other survivors. In fact, the rest of the film is a collection of ill-targeted militants, including a too long shootout outside the "home of the dead." This battle was accompanied by obscene Hollywood violence, redundant clips from the HOTD video game and casually turning the camera in a matrix style. One of the characters even voluntarily sacrifices himself to save others. What for? Not because he was noble and courageous, but because part of his face was wounded by acid, and the zombies spat at him after he continued to beat the creature even after it was turned off! Should I be sorry for this guy?!? <br /> <br /> To summarize, it makes no sense to watch this film, unless you yourself want to see how terrible it is. The theater I was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen, and I’m sure that the money I wasted seeing this piece of shit could easily cover the costs it took to make it. Grade: F
