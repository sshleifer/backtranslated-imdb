No, this is not a horror movie ... In fact, this is a love story. <br /> <br /> The Ring is a silent film of 1927, in which two boxers appeared and the woman who was between them. She loves the boxer known as "One Round" Jack. She loves him until a champion appears. Despite the fact that she is getting married for one round, she begins to flirt openly with the champion until the final boxing match between one round and the champion is over. She returns to the corner of the "Round" when everything looks gloomy, and he miraculously finds inner strength to win the fight and return the love of his wife. <br /> <br /> This film was very early in Hitch's career, but time limits should not have forced him to make a long film. Although there are special movie tricks, and some comedy relief, this film just does not stand up to any of his later works. It must have been extremely risky for a period of time, with a shameless adulterous wife. This may have been a flaw back in 1927. Looking through all these old films, itâ€™s amazing how I think that they can be remade on a modern screen and really come off. Maybe I should be the only one .... <br /> <br /> Skip this movie, unless you plan to watch all the Hitchcock movies. You could fall asleep in the middle.
