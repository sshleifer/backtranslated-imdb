I totally agree with the last commentator, this may be the worst movie I've ever done. I also had to rewind much of this movie. Michael Madsen must have made this film as a favor to someone. Image quality is grainy all over. And what a little story there is, just stupid. I would not waste your time on this film, otherwise you will regret it.
