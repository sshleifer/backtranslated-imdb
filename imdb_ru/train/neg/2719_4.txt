When the little ball of the space age lands on the ground, it soon begins to absorb earthlings and gain weight. The only part of this meaningless chatter I enjoyed was all the cool classic cars. This dog had so many holes that it could be cut and sold for Swiss cheese. Did this item actually earn $ 20 million? And McQueen's salary was 3K? All were overpaid. The “monster” looked very much like a big bag with beans, and the “teenagers” looked as if they could have children approaching the age of a teenager. And these shotgun shots; sounded like a machine gun with a noise suppressor. The ending was a pity banal; obviously, the producers left the door open to continue .... and there were a lot of them. Thumbs down.
