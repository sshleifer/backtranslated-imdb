Home Alone 3 is one of my least favorite movies. This is the cream of the harvest, or s ***, if you tend to be more cynical, as it rises (or falls) there with things like Battlefield Earth and Flinstones: Viva Rock Vegas. In fact, it may be even worse than these two, because these two, at least, occasionally made me laugh at their stupidity. It only made me constantly shrink from pain and clap when loans started to roll. No other film made me cringe in pain. Now I will point out exactly why this film is incredibly cruel. <br /> <br /> First, the plot is funny. It rotates around the chip in a remote-controlled car (?!), Which is inappropriate and how these terrorists want it. Stupid things. <br /> <br /> Subsequent action is similar to the action of the other two “Housewives”, using traps and everything else, but watching how these traps are executed is not just funny, but watching them is incredibly unpleasant. Once I did not laugh (or even smiled), rather, I constantly cringed and hoped that the terrorists would kill the child. The bird, instead of providing comic relief, was unfunny and annoying. <br /> <br /> Actions performed by a group of nameless names range from poor to cruel. There are no good performances here. Alex D. Linz is absolutely incredible and unmixed, like a child, while the terrorists are acting (and, judging by their films, see) how they were hurriedly thrown from the street ... and well, that's all. <br /> <br /> I see some people saying, “Man, this is for children. Don't be upset, dude. ” Well, MAN, children may like it, but they can become damn better. See Monsters Inc. and Toy Story, before you even think about it. Heck, even Scooby-Doo and Garfield (which sucks - see. These reviews are more) better than that! <br /> <br /> In short, this is a terribly cruel movie. It was obviously reworked for money, since it almost completely disrupts the first two; The only thing that completely offends the first two. No one, no child, no one else, must find a reason to see Home Alone 3. Always. This is very bad. <br /> <br /> 0/5 stars
