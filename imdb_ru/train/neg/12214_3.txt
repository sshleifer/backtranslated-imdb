What I can say about this film is that it’s great to see so many Asian faces. What I didn’t like about the film is that it’s full of stereotypes about what typical racial characters will do in their role. An Asian girl with no confidence to play to someone else to succeed, a white guy fascinated by Asian culture, who decided to leave his white world behind on the land of yellow and “leave him a real” black taxi driver. Plus, the placement of products from coke, Shanghai tanga and donuts was too obvious. The plot of the story was funny, but as I thought the story would fall apart. On the other hand, when you watch romantic comedies, you cannot expect much, but on the other hand, I would just like to be surprised at least once. Parents are the best part of the movie.
