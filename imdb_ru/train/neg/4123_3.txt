Although the beginning suggests that everything is calm on the Western Front, this stupid and superficial version of the war is far off the path of its much better modernity. It depicts the most amusing war in which the first one and a half hours were devoted to romance and good times. <br /> <br /> When we finally see some kind of battle, it becomes lame: does an enemy plane fly over you? Shoot him down (with one shot). Sniper on a tree? Kill him before he shoots. Enemy soldiers in the forest? Do not worry, they are happy to surrender. Ho-hum <br /> <br /> Warm, swollen, predictable ... <br /> <br />
