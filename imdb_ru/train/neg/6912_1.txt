The only reason I even gave her 1 out of 10 was because it was not allowed to give zero out of 10. This was the biggest waste of time I had ever experienced. For about 75 minutes you are exposed to the most ARTISTIC game (and I do not mean that in a good sense of the word, as, for example, in KILLER NERD, which had a great terrible game) and a plot that is not only funny, but absolutely NOTHING to do with the slaughter. The reason I even rented this piece of shit was that there was a massacre in the title. However, there was only one murder in the entire film, and it was rather unconvincing. You spend more time watching children bicker and do work in the yard than anything else. Speaking of children, the little boyish actor is probably the most annoying kids' actor since Bobâ€™s time in the graveyard. Did I mention it was videotaped too? If you want to throw away money and spend more than an hour of your life, then by all means watch it. But if you relish your hard-earned dollars and time, then go as far as possible.
