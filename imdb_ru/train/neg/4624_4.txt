This beautifully filmed and screenplay episode was let down for two reasons. 1) It may have been the moral of the talk of the 1950s, but not a single man left alone on the asteroid for many years would have reacted with such hysterical negative to the gift of the female android. 2) It was not an android at all, but a woman, beautiful Jean Marsh. <br /> <br /> The popularity of the sex doll industry in the coming decades could trace the origins of this episode if they did it right. In fact, about upgrading sex bots in the news, as I say. <br /> <br /> Robots were not new to the cinema or to television when this episode was filmed, so they could at least act like one, Then her flesh would add a creepy element. Instead, it becomes a good little love story about two people on a distant star. <br /> <br /> The twilight zone always stretched imagination and gullibility. Usually nobody cared. But this episode seemed clutched with Calvinistic morality, avoiding what would be tantamount to masturbation with the help of a machine or outright negligence.
