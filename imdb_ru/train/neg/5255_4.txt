Visually speaking, this movie is awesome. He has some delicious black comedy moments. But in general, the plot is very cliche, as is his apparent idea. If you are a fan of excessive violence in popular films such as a hostel or view, you will like it. If you are looking for something at a high level, stay away. I saw it as part of the Edinburgh Film Festival 06 and chose it only because I was looking for something disturbing. Ultimately, it does not bother. Just gnash and sit unpleasantly. If you really want to be challenged, look something like The Lost. If you want to get kicked off, or tell your friends about a really spoiled movie, then this is for you.
