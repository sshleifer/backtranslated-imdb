Well-known writer Mark Redfield (like Edgar Allen Poe) is trying to defeat old addictions and start a new life for himself as a magazine publisher in Baltimore, Maryland. However, blackout, delusions and failure threaten to hinder his efforts. He would also like to stir up an affair with an old lover, a much mistaken prospect, as it turns out. Mr. Redfield also directed the drama of the mysterious last days of Edgar Allen Poe. Redfield uses a lot of black and white, color and stunt photos to create a mood. Kevin J. Shinnik (as Dr. John Moran) performs well, relatively speaking. This is not enough.
