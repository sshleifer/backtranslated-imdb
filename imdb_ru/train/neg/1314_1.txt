This is the worst piece of shit I've seen recently. There is nothing good about this movie. The plot is stupid, the dialogues have no meaning, the humorous scenes have never heard of real humor. Actors just do not play, so much the worse they do not even try. The script itself somewhat coincides with Ed Wood and Uwe Boll. In this film, there is only one good thing - fighting. They are well set, as one would expect from Hong Kong guys, and are the only reason to watch the Prince of the Sun. Although I think that the fights just have to fill in the empty space so that the writer does not have to think about the plot. However, this weak and absurd plot can prevent you from watching it to the end. Avoid this, if you are not a fan of dragon lady Cynthia Rothrock.
