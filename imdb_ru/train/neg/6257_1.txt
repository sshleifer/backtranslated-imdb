SPOILERS. Strange people with generous tastes review this film. Let me add a balance by specifying the following: <br /> <br /> Script: Dreadful. Since Tom and Dan “get to know each other”, they joke about films, we are clearly talking about one person, and I suspect that it was the director who carefully thought out his words to sound reasonable. At some point, Dan asked: “Have you heard of the HIV virus?” And it sounds as natural as the question: “Have you spoken with nine alien races?” <br /> <br /> Acting: white teeth and a broken face does not make a sensitive performer. I believe that Speedman coped well with the fact that he was given, but Marsden was terrible - he is not sympathetic, incredible, and quite smug and cunning in his captivity. In his speeches emptiness (also see Interstate 60). <br /> <br /> Story: Deliver me! The half-flight moments were not exciting, but annoying and weak. Remember Marsden, who pretends to try the keys in the door and then throws them: “They don't work, man!” T-h. And beware of semi-black-and-white memories that start with some kind of hooligan sound, taken from CSI and other criminal dramas. <br /> <br /> The most important, most dangerous, evil and offensive is homophobia (you decide, external or internal) in a film in which HIV is considered a weapon. Tom says that Dan may have removed the condom or didn’t use it at all - excuse me, where was Tom when they had sex? There is some villainous partner insertion that looks like the gay evil in general. <br /> <br /> In summary: be careful!
