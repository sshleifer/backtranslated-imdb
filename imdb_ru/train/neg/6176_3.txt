I'm not a big fan of the farcical Stooges, but I find their story interesting. I recently tried to check things from every era of Stooge, but the opportunity to see Joe's shorts doesn’t seem so easy; This is the only one that I have seen so far. <br /> <br /> Some people say that the quality problems of Joe’s shorts are not really Joe’s fault, and I suspect this is so. Joe as a performer is far from the worst in this. What worries me most about this was noted in another comment: opposing the other guys to the third one is disturbed by the entire comedy collective / spirit of Stooges. Perhaps Joe’s style was perceived by those in charge as not quite appropriate - although there was no real conflict behind the scenes between him and the rest - and that was their way around it. <br /> <br /> And what about the names of this and some other shorts of the late Stooges? There is definitely a lack of creativity going on there; Was such a thing a cause or consequence of the exhaustion of the shorts market?
