I quit trying to figure out which version I'm watching. Copyright at the end points to 1983. And although this is not an important part of my objection to this film, I’ll say that I’m watching a film that was clearly made in the Aquarian age (including long-haired hippie chicks and odious wagons), but it’s disturbing to the 1980s synthesizer soundtrack. Extremely disturbing. <br /> <br /> My main objection here is HOW TO LOOK AT THE FILM PRODUCERS OF THE FILM PROKATAL, AS THE BUTTON OF PAMEL FRANKLIN ALIVE. HOW TO LOOK. <br /> <br /> Seriously, she’s just as charming and all that, but in the two films I saw her in — this crappy festival and the superb game Legend of Hell House — they kill her. <Br /> <br /> I would like to draw the attention of the film industry. Pamela Franklin seems to have gone out of business, but if she ever decides to make another film, and some damned actor tries to kill her, I WILL OBTAIN IT. <br /> <br /> NO ONE Beats. Pamela Franklin and leaves with him. I AM A FULL CROSS. IS A SOLUTION. <br /> <br /> For B-movie fans looking for a stupid holiday, you can do a lot worse than that. On the positive side, this is not a film that includes Satanism in a peripheral and prudent way - this film is a tough satanic film. <br /> <br /> Wall-to-wall Satanic ceremonies, baphomets, hallucinations, the absurdity of the Rat attack - what more can you ask for. <br /> <br /> This excellent material is almost completely destroyed by the mysterious grafted 1980s soundtrack soundtrack that does not fit the film as much as possible. The soundtrack reminded me of something that you hear on the equalizer. This is really bad. <br /> <br /> In addition, they forced Pamela Franklin to crush her charming English accent, which was also a rather rude, if not atrocious crime (against the viewer), such as you can find in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I say that we have the right to hear Pamela Franklin speak in her own voice. Who is with me? I could forgive everything else about this film if they did not insult Pamela Franklin. And so I throw the glove down, sir - ANY, THAT CONTAINS FRANKLIN'S MEMBER, COMMUNICATES ME. <br /> <br /> EVEN IN A FICTIONAL CONTEXT. <br /> <br /> Good afternoon, gentlemen
