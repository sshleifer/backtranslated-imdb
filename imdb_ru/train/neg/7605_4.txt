I think Shooter wasn't as bad as most movies that show Mystery Science Theater 3000, but westerns aren't Roger Korman's strong point. With the image of Rosa Hood (Beverly Garland), who became the sheriff in the old western city after her husband-sheriff was killed and he had to fight the villains, the film is quite predictable. John Ireland is Rose's new husband, secretly working for unceremonious Allison Hayes (yes, a 50-foot woman). Also briefly appears a frequent partner in the film Corman Dick Miller as a postman (Miller is currently starring in the films of Joe Dante). <br /> <br /> I really want to say that you probably want to watch the version of "MST3K" to really enjoy this movie. They had a great time with this.
