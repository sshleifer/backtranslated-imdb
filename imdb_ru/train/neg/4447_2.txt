Yes, there are worse films. Most of them are made for fun, on budget lace, or as tv. movie of the week, but even if it was a movie of the week, it would be rated no more than two stars. This is a bad film about a serious plot involving an offended woman who runs from the king of slimy people to the protective weapon of the king of wise people. (If this is an attempt to show that she doesn’t need a man to protect her, then the asshole is superfluous in the film and should not be in it at all). He has no expectations, no development of the character and the heroine, which can be outwitted with the help of a rotton bow. (I think she dumps her wedding ring on a boat with an autonomous tank, rather than just throwing it overboard in the ocean (where her body should be anyway), and after her husband finds her, demonstrating that she is an idiot , she’s still childish assumptions that almost kill her.) I’m always amazed when I see a film rating as high as this one, and it makes me realize that Dr. Suze still has a huge untapped market of people challenged by his work. When I laugh at humanity, I cry.
