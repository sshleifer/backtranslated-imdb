In fact, everyone in this film looks like they want to be elsewhere! Not surprisingly, the casting is not done with his left hand, but rather quite. I have not seen anything worse than Natasha Makelon, posing as some kind of agent with a gun. You do not use the spoiled look of the city in this role. The only thing I can imagine is to play Doris Day as a prostitute. The rest of the cast is also terrible, perhaps with Hurt as the only exception, sometimes you can see how he tries, but suffers. Oh, did I mention that this is a completely crazy story? The danger of the lives of many people, because you are divorced and want to see your family? Well, it must be because the guy (Weller) is German? <br /> <br /> 2/10, because the photo could be worse.
