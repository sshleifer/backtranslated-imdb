This film still makes me think. This film was not just bad, as low-budget, badly acted, etc., although, of course, WAS all these things. The problem with this film is that it seemed to intentionally try to annoy the viewer and did so with great success. What I want to know is a horror movie? I mean, this is definitely awful, but not like it should be in horror movies. I could see the first segment trying to be terrible and failing, but what the hell is the second segment? It is just annoying. The third segment is like watching a student film, which, surprisingly, makes it the least painful. This is a crime that this film is not so low on 100 lines, so get your votes (1/10) in people !! I know that some people have given good reviews, but, in general, they are lying in a sadistic attempt to deceive you. Believe me, this movie may not please. The only advantage of this film is the amazing effect of life extension: it feels like you watched this film for years after only the first half hour passed.
