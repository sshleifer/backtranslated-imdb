Being a fan of Billy Bob Thornton and the diversity of his skills, I noticed this film on the list and was surprised that I had not heard of him. <br /> <br /> I traveled more than usual during both the period when he was filmed in 2000, and when he appeared in cinemas in more than 2-1 / 2 years (this period is the first clue, all It was not very good with the production). <br /> <br /> Now Patrick Swayze cannot speak for sour apples, but Thornton has more than enough ability to make up the difference between them. And Charlize Theron is the one whom it would be nice to see, even if she showed that she looks at the dried paint. <br /> <br /> With curiosity I checked the product information of this site. On the first weekend, he earned a whopping <600 dollars per screen and just over 400 dollars each after his monthly show at the theater at the end of 2002. The total gross amount was 261 thousand dollars, which, I doubt, could cover the film crew, hotel and food for the week location. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty bland, and even using the usually interesting region of Reno is just as boring as everyone else. <br /> <br /> This is something like a few bits of SNL all connected together, none of them is too big, and the overall presentation is even worse. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the cost of this production should have been significant - even if everyone worked less than usual. the fees - so the only thing that made him a bit tolerant opus was the quality of the filming and the gift of Billy Bob (although, for obvious reasons, he is a bit laconic compared to his usual work. <br /> <br /> Think of three He portrayed excellent, completely different characters in Sling Blade, Bandits and Bad Santa, and you know that he understood this work below standard, long before viewers had the opportunity to confirm it. One star for him , even here, and one, because the production was better than, say, a typical film "Lifetime".
