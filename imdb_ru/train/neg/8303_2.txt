Since the release of the Christmas story in 1983, Jean Shepard's story about his alter-ego Ralfi has become a real classic. However, Shepard is still the narrator in My Summer Story, but there is absolutely no charm in it, and the characters are far from the caliber of the original film. <br /> <br /> “My summer story” is basically a confusion of mediocre and simply not very interesting stories, which include hill neighbors and fighting peaks. Charles Grodin, whom I usually love, is extremely unlikely in the role of father (more aptly crafted by Darren McGavin in the original), and his character never seems to be anything but forced. Kiernan Culkin is a poor substitute for Ralfi, and his younger brother is almost forgotten here. It seems that only mother has something valuable here, and perhaps this is because she arranges a film manager with a sauce when he removes his fate too much with angry housewives on the “night of the free dish”. <br /> <br /> mostly irrelevant and stretched with thin paper. It may appeal to the extremely undemanding, but as a continuation of the "Christmas Story", it is very bad and not worth the time of most people. 2 out of 10.
