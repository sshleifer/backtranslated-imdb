Ringmaster, Jerry Springer’s pitiful excuse for wasting film that needs to be recycled as toilet paper has recently destroyed my confidence in the art of filmmaking. First of all, it was done. Secondly, people went to see it. Third, some people voted for the best film they have ever seen. If a monkey could make a movie, I'm 100 percent sure it will be 1 billion times better. Most crappy films have their moments (even Godzilla had some cool special effects), the moment of this film was when I was sick of the theater. The only thing that could have made this movie even worse would be if Jerry Springer were a star. If I want to look at shit for an hour and a half, I'll take a dump in the bank. If someone does not despise this film completely, I feel sorry for you, your children, and the children of your children; however, contrary to Springer’s beliefs, I clearly do not condone children who have sex.
