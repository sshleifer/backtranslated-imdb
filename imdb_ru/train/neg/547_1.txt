The full title of this film is “Waqt: Race Against Time”. Nobody can win this race, but you can certainly reduce your losing position without wasting any precious “bakwa” on these backups. This movie was clumsy and manipulative, so K3G looked fair. This too strained my gullibility. He was ridiculously stupid in his storyline and deserves to be ridiculed. <br /> <br /> It's not as bad as Bagban or Black, but there's nothing to recommend in this movie. It is stupid, senseless, with the absurd OTT performance of Amitji. The central "conspiracy" is another unpleasant example of gross manipulative propaganda that floods so many "family" black and white films. If my father, who raised me and whom I loved very much, treated me just like Big Bi, like Akshay, I would have shot him myself. Not to mention the banalization of the deadly disease.
