It is interesting why this picture was made at all: the plot as such is absolutely incredible, if not funny, the characters (an experienced lone policeman compared to the younger one, quite enchanted) are quite predictable, the ending is completely dark and impossible to understand that you must have a masochistic tendency: the idea is that you must read the book in order to fully understand what is being said), and the game is bad. Was the main idea to show that French filmmakers are able to cope as well as the Americans in the genre of "Seven" and "Silence of the Lambs"? If so, then this is a complete failure. Although it was quite successful (and has the kind of cult status of the first French film about a serial killer) and seems to be considered a good product for export. Strange.
