I have never seen a worse movie. <br /> <br /> You can shoot a video game and make it a worthy movie. <br /> <br /> Error 1: absolutely no connection between the characters. In this film, you are not connected with any of the characters, because ... you have no chance. <br /> <br /> The only character who sympathizes with or even interesting is Deck Hand: Salish as he played Clint Howard. With the exception of this unique character, the outcome of the film does not make sense, since all the characters were lifeless from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> Error 2: the worst scene of the shootout in history. I love shooting. I love it when the heroes open up to the bad guys and clean the house. hell, I even like to sometimes watch the bad guy clean the house. But this skirmish was strange, I think the best way to describe it is “Apathetic,” I saw people shoot with great feeling and emotion while watching a video game. In this film, it looked as if the “actors” were just walking, removing everything that moved without emotion. <br /> <br /> Why? Where is the garbage talking? where the roars of anger amid shooting? It is assumed that these are children who were caught in a rave, which deteriorated ... but even real soldiers, acting professionally and ruthlessly, show their humanity. <br /> <br /> If you want a GOOD horror movie about a lonely house full of monsters, I recommend Sam Rami’s series, The Evil Dead. DON'T SEE disaster, which is the home of the dead. I hope they burn the masters and all copies of this film.
