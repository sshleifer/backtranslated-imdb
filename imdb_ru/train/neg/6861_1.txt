My first encounter with Templarios is not very good. I was excited to discover this title among the Anchor Bay Video offers, which brought us other iconic classic pieces, such as Spider Baby. Print quality is excellent, but this alone cannot hide the fact that the film is deadly dull. There is a fascinating initial sequence in which the villagers revenge terribly on the Templars (and set everything in motion), but everything else in the film is slow, heavy, and ultimately unfulfilled. Adding insult to injury: the film was dubbed, not subtitled, as promised on the video shell.
