The package is funny, the characters are incredible, the dialogue is banal, and the ending is absurd. <br /> <br /> Believe me, I'm a fan of Kevin Kline, but watching him make an accent to Pepe Le Pugh for 2 hours, since the supposed Frenchman is no longer as fun as it seems. <br /> <In turn, Meg Ryan is again as cheerful and charming as (choose yourself): a Keppi doll, baby, puppy, kitten, whatever you think, this is the cutest creature on earth. She also has no resemblance to a real person. <br /> <br /> This film gives me the opportunity to use my friends Lawrence Casdan and Klein to spend a vacation in Paris and in the south of France, being well paid for It. So I can't blame them.
