I just wish they knew that I don’t often rate films below 5. I was initially very happy to see this movie. His numerous trailers on television for several months made me really want to watch this movie. So, the night before, when I saw that it was available on FearNet on Demand, I took some popcorn and sat down to watch a movie. <br /> <br /> The storyline seemed intriguing enough - some dude kills unsuspecting subways. There the photographer is obsessed with missing. Where are they going? What happens to them? One day, the photographer sees a connection between some of the photos he took and becomes an obsessed butcher, following him around, yada yada. The film had a way to get you involved, although the plot was very predictable. “Oh, no, dark, beware behind,” I say, rather dull from cheap thrills. <br /> <br /> The plot, although predictable, was intriguing ... that is, to the end. “It was good to the end ... Then it's just stupid,” says Jack_skellington_freke on the bulletin boards. And I totally agree. And here are the spoilers ... <br /> <br /> You see, I hoped that it was some kind of insane killer, some kind of psychotic, obsessed with cannibalism. Not. It was some kind of secret society that has supported the life of living beings for centuries. Woo. How original. How unreal. How boring. <br /> <br /> 3/10. Come on, Lionsgate. You had awesome movies, but this one sank.
