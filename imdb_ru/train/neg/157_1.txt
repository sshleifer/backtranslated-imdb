Well, first of all, the video looks like it was shot in the 80s. I was shocked to learn that it was released in 2001. Secondly, the plot was everywhere, immediately the story got confused. If there was some short prologue or introduction, the story would be better. I also appreciate the fantasy, but this film was too much. It was strange and bad shot. The scenes did not go smoothly, and the characters were strange. It was difficult to follow, and perhaps it was a translation, but it was even difficult to understand. I love Chinese epic films, but if you are looking for a Chinese epic fantasy film, I would recommend Promise (visually stunning, interesting story and good character development), and not this film. Carefully, you will be disappointed.
