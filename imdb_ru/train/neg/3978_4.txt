When in Rome a definite improvement is on the way there. I found it too predictable, far-fetched and slow to get there, and to this day I still consider him the worst of the Olsen twins. Nevertheless, although the film “When in Rome” is not terrible, it is also not very good. If I had to summarize in one word, I would say tolerably. For teenagers, it's fun, but I think that adults won't find something to do. <br /> <br /> When Rome has its advantages. Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are actually quite decent actresses, of course, very beautiful. I admit, when I was 10 or so, I really liked them, and in general I still like them. And I liked some of their films, such as “Passport to Paris” and “New York Minute”. Returning to the goal, both girls do not do this bad work, in fact they are very attractive. In addition, their costumes must die, and the landscapes of Rome are simply stunning. The soundtrack is also not half bad. <br /> <br /> However, where the film is shot, this is the plot and the script. The script is mostly cliché and has hints of deja vu. The plot, like most films about Mary Kate and Ashley, is very predictable, and anyone who is familiar with any other work of the Olsen twins will find several non-original elements in it. Most of the characters are thin, like cardboard, and you learn little about them, and sometimes the pace changes. Unfortunately, the breathtaking landscapes are spoiled by rather rough filming, which looked constantly in a hurry. <br /> <br /> In general, there are pluses and, of course, watchable. However, for my taste, it is harmless and predictable teenage fluff. 4/10 Bethany Cox
