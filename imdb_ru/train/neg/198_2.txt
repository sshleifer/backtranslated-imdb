Bert Kennedy was once a very good director, but you will never know this from this clumsy mess. This film not only looks cheap, but also cheap — most of the battle scenes were filmed in the far-away superb “Last Team” of 1955, and stills shot 32 years ago look more modern than anything in this picture. Those few action scenes that were shot for this film are disorganized, confused and incompetent, and look just as sloppy as the rest of the picture. It looks like a bad student film (and the budget doesn't seem to be much more). It moves like molasses, for the most part it's an acting ham or a comatose mass under the top - although Raul Julia comes off better than most other actors - and it is full of annoying historical inaccuracies. In addition, it is too long. If you're going to make a boring movie, do it in about an hour and be done with it — don't stretch it for more than three hours, like this one. If you want to watch a good film about the Alamo, check out the 1960 version of John Wayne or even the 1955 movie from which this movie stole his action films. It's hard to believe that it took six producers to make the movie so lousy. Skip this.
