Salvation: 4 out of 10. Groundhog Day meets the horror film of the Christian Coalition. Well, maybe it's not so bad. But it is close. <br /> <br /> Claire (played by Alicia Silverstone Lauren Curie Lewis) is being prosecuted and possibly killed by a serial killer (Chris Ferry, quite formidable and cruel). I say, perhaps because she wakes up, and it was all a dream ?? .. Or was it? (Cue music) <br /> <br /> The main problem with the film is that these fifteen minutes of the plot (“Quite well from the first time”) are repeated again and again. And since Claire wakes up every time, and each scene is clearly a dream or an alternate reality, I just stopped caring about what happened to Claire, and began to wonder what kind of twisted turn at the end would bring it together. <br /> <br /> I was rooting for the session (which, frankly, would have made more sense), but instead I got one of those that are too obvious, with the help of unexpected endings (“Think of the village” or “Down” ). Yes, the film is crumbling faster than the directors Donnie Darko. All the great twist finals in the horror films “The Sixth Sense,” the original “Invasion of the Body Snatchers,” “Happy Birthday to Me,” worked because viewers did not expect an explanation from the left. (Heck, even the end of the canoe on the original Friday of the 13th was worth a jolt) <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the rescue twists the turn, ending each time the scene changes. Other picky bugs are the one-note piano soundtrack (although the songs featured were decent), the obvious filling of time (Claire does the dishes, the minor plots of Claire's mother), the way Claire says "hello, does anybody," every time she thinks there is a TV show Killer around. <br /> <br /> In addition, some minor roles (in particular, Claire’s mother, played by Maureen Olander, like the zombie Mary Kay), for the first time demonstrate the actor’s low-budget roots. <br /> <br /> Both are too half smart and not smart enough. Salvage maintains your interest, if only to see how they are going to correct this mess. The problem is that they really do not.
