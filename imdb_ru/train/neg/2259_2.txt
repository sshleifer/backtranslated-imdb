As for me, I can't understand why they want to make a film about The Jerry Springer Show. It is so incredibly dirty. Some ways, unfortunately, this is a guilty pleasure. We all have to admit that we have seen at least one episode. This is part of our pop culture. I saw it in the USA recently. This is pretty bad. I admit it. Jerry does a terrible job of what I think he meant as acting. Or something like that. Jamie Pressly in this. She plays herself mostly. All she needed was her lover Kid Rock. That would be perfect then. So, I would recommend to skip "Ringmaster". Just watch the Jerry Springer Show. It is nicer than that. <br /> <br /> 2/10
