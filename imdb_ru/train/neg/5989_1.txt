wow, I paid £ 3.50 to watch this movie in a movie theater. Can't believe I wasted my time. The game is good at best, and the special effects are rough. Probably the worst scenario in history, some extremely embarrassing quotes I've ever heard in my life. By God, “sweep away” better than that. Madonna was supposed to win, and Oscar compare with these guys. One and a half hours of my life I want to return. Honestly, people do not see this, even the baby will find this film an insult to their intellect. It seemed to me that this film is very strange, because it is difficult to say which of them is more wooden, these guys from real puppets. please guys do not waste your time on this film, you will live to regret it.
