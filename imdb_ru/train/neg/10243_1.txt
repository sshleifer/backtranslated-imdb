This is the biggest pile of crap I've ever watched. NOT RENT! The creators of this film must be a band that has ever shot another film. It begins with a plot, and then quickly disappears. I think I would rather watch the paint dry out than look at the cover. The actors were terrible, the plot quickly faded away, shooting left a lot of work. Not a single good thing to say about this shitty movie. If you rent this movie, you will waste your money. I really like National Lampoon movies, but it was a waste of time. Learn to write, learn to act, learn to produce and learn to lead. I feel I have to sue these holes, which made this film for money wasted on the rental price and lost time.
