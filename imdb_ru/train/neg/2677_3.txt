This is a really stupid parody of the "Tomb Raider" and Indiana Jones, stupid humor, and so on. But in the end, this is a soft film that is expected and does not matter, because you really want sex. Which leads me to the biggest problem of all, hardly any of this. It makes you feel that you are watching TV at 3 am and play independent films, and the one that is on was made by some college student who is no good in the industry. You stayed waiting for a real sex scene for a very long time, many times you thought that something was going to happen, and then you just stayed alone. One that (perhaps two or one with two parts), which actually goes somewhere, is very pleasant. Personally, I can't recommend it if you haven't found it in the bin for a dollar or two. If you need a good movie with a plot and good acting, you do not want it. If you are looking for a nice soft lesbian film, you don't want that either.
