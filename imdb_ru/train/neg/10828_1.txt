This is not only my weighted verdict on this film, but also the main part of what is written about it. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not an absolute man in the street, I didn't hate the film, because it wasn't enough like “Police Academy 9” or something like that, I like it more than my large eyebrows or oath, I swear . <br /> <br /> “Magnolia” is poor and I am genuinely puzzled why she seems so welcome. Long bloated, self-indulgent, senseless nonsense from beginning to end, so little that could reliably be what people love so much in the film. There are several high-level actors who are fair enough, and none of them have average or worse performance. In addition, my wife (who has declared herself a hater of Tom Cruise) tells me that this is his best performance in his entire career. But the plot is so completely uninteresting, wandering between the stories of several loosely connected characters at such a snail pace that even when important life-changing events are depicted, they seem so meaningless and uninteresting that you shout for someone to blow up or something. <br /> <br /> It doesn't help that none of the characters are very easy to identify or empathize (well, I don’t think so, but I don’t like most people). All of them have been playing their rather uninteresting life stories for quite a long time, demonstrating their character flaws and emotions in very complex details and playing their deep and meaningful relationships to the n-th degree with many wriggling monologues along the way. Yadda Yadda Yadda. The soundtrack is also terrible, with that terribly annoying quality that I still considered unique to the music of Alanis Morissett. <br /> <br /> In general, three hours were just as pleasant as the fact that I was forced to watch the episode “Friends” several times, while from time to time they poked him in the ribs with a disgruntled goat nanny. A little bit with frogs is good, though.
