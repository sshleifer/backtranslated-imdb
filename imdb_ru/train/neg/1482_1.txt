MAKE 0 YOUR MEN FROM A FILM! Well, when I started to watch this bag with the credit, it was Sunday, and I was just looking for things during the show. I was introduced to a hot naked baby, and, like any guy (I'm a guy, email - my sisters ...), I was happy. But then they threw it all at the dogs, spat on it, lit it in the fire, and urinated it. Want to know how? TALKED THE POOR CHICK! The dialogue throughout the film was just awful. sounded like something that my 2nd grade brother could do right. Violence was good for some scenes, but some were just completely idiotic. The scene in the pit where he gives the guy a knife ... stupid jerk! To sum it up, this pure movie of barf soaked in chocolate syrup, known as nudity, and topped with a cherry horrible act, as soon as a porn star can deliver.
