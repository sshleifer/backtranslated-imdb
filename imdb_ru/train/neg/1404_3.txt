Arthur Aski was a great comic book master at how he communicated with his audience. His youthful jokes, silly songs and crazy dances went well because he was able to attract people and draw them into his world outside the wall. The lack of a lively audience was a clear disadvantage for him, and he never felt completely comfortable in films. He has his moments in the Ghost Train, and his character, Tommy Gander, was adapted to make the most of his talents, but the performer Aska needed to be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> Asuka’s support for the film is not strong, it includes a permanent film mate Richard Murdoch; Betty Jardine and Stuart Latham as a drugged honeymoon couple; Linden Travers is going to be a “crazy woman.” Also on board are Peter Murray Hill, who offstage married Phyllis Calvert, as the nominal lead man, who reads this role completely impartially, and the leading lady Carol Lynn, who is equally tasteless. Actress actress Kathleen Harrison can easily steal a film like a lonely woman who loves parrots, which is broken into Dr. Morland Graham's brandy.
