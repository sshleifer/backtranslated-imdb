I found Tremors 4: The Legend Beg, boring and boring. All the action scenes were stupid. The so-called "GRABOIDS" are reduced to the size of a modern domestic cat, if not less. The action was terrible, and this film was just an unnecessary film in the Tremor saga, because although it tells the story of how the graboids were formed, the story is so stupid and useless. Also, if you want to tell a story, WAY back in time, you use the SAME ACTOR (Michael Gross) to be someone in the past when he is in a real movie “Tremor” - someone in the present. God ... If you haven't seen this movie yet, don't waste time. Tremor, 1, 2 and 3, for a good time. However, this film, make sure that you are on the remote control next to you, with the STOP button working for a quick retreat from this nonsense.
