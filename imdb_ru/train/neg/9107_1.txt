I was mad who made this movie. I was even more angry, I lost the precious moments of my life, sitting still to watch it. I could get a wax job and be more busy. At least Cherry makes me laugh before it hurts. At first I was a little confused, but then I realized what was going on. By this time, the film was halfway through, and yes, I am a procrastinator, but I always want to see things through. So I stuck it out, I watched it all. Actors are not only not as attractive as in “Cruel Intentions”, they are simply unconvincing. I saw my nephew calling for attention more convincingly than the alleged lust shown on the screen in this film. If you like bad movies with bad acting, watch this.
