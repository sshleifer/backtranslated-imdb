Obviously, many talented backstage film crews worked on this film, so don't even look at the captions at the end, you will only hold them against them. Nobody was interested in watching this film, only 3 were in the theater; the two lost consciousness after 10 minutes, and they were lucky. The Monsters were unemployed worms from Star Trek 2, Wrath of Khan, and rejected projects for space beings in Alien. The filmmakers obviously did not want to eclipse the third-level monsters, so they hired highly skilled actors who obviously did not remember their lines or in some cases learned to pronounce the words before filming began. Some scenes are incredibly incapable of conveying what should happen if something happens. If you are not lucky enough to be in the theater, where this film is shown, and you have not lost consciousness, you will laugh at what should be frightening or tense moments of the film. The incredibility of several scenes will simply overwhelm you, and the regular eruption by Stephen Dorff of "Queen Mary of damned words" conveys the feeling of anyone who pays to see it. If you want to watch this movie, do yourself a favor and wait until it is in the shopping cart in the video store. If there is justice in the film industry, one of the main actors will be there to rent it out.
