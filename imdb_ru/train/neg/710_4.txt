I read Rice's novel with interest and was fascinated by his characters and heartbreaking stories based on historical truths. <br /> <br /> However, I was simply STRAIGHTED at this disastrous adaptation. Casting was based only on appearance and not on acting talent (with the obvious exception of Peter Gallagher, who was neither blond nor knew how to get out of a wet paper bag). The awkwardly clumsy and inconsistent attempts by the actors to influence the French accent were fun, but not entertaining. I found myself wincing at this turmoil and melodrama and was surprised that I had reached the end. <br /> <br /> Warning for fans of the novel - stay away from this.
