I have never published a review before, but I had to do it for this movie! This film is SO bad, I found myself trying to justify how bad it is, trying to present it as a kitsch or a parody. But it is not. This is really, unconsciously BAD. This is a serious attempt that fails superbly. Other reviewers pointed out many of the shortcomings of the film, so I will try not to repeat them, but I urge you to watch this movie. During all this, I either lost the gift of speech, literally suffocating from disbelief, or rolled on the floor in hysterics. I haven't had so much fun watching a movie for years. In fact, I will try to make all my friends see it, because this is the film that needs to be shared. <br /> <br /> My favorite roles are: - a boy (his dances are incredible) - unreasonable nudity (the director / lead actor just had to take a picture of nude nature) - the preacher's office with his cardboard and color performance of Christ - of course, the famous wedding scene with palm trees and forgotten rings (what a plot function this game plays! he clearly burns it with this incredibly pathetic match - Yes, a cheerful religious-fanatical brother with his bleached hair and fashion WeHo - And, my favorite, using Joplin's “Entertainer” intro sound the river and the "Canon Pachebelya" in D Major "as a final soundtrack - the list goes on and on - MUST SEE !!!
