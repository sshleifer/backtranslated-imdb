Why does Hollywood feel the need to remake films that were so brilliant as their premier (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes), but much worse, why Hollywood feels the need to remake those horror films that were not brilliant to start Night, Amityville Horror Like their originals, these remakes are not capable of creating an atmosphere, character or any real fears at all. The prom is so flat and uninteresting that it is hard to look at it, but for all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> This is a poorly organized, extremely uninteresting and ultimately boring excursion that fails in everything for which it is intended. It is clear that Hollywood Terror is dead. Even those such as The Hills have eyes and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre have managed to spoil their franchises in style with buckets of blood and a decent plot. The prom night is almost bloodless, and I'm not even going to mention how bad the plot is. His inability to identify the killers makes this horror film the least disturbing since ... the original. <br /> <br /> One of the most notorious slasher films of the 1980s is terrorized by moviegoers with this remake, which proves that terrible dancing in high school can be. Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow) experienced a terrible tragedy, but now it's time to leave the past behind and celebrate her stylish prom. <br /> <br /> When the big night finally comes, Donna and her best friends get ready to enjoy the last big bang in high school, having survived it and having fun until dawn. But while Donna wants to look into her nightmares and look into a bright future, the person to whom, she thought, she ran away forever, returned to the last dance. The obsessed killer is at large, and he will kill anyone who tries to prevent him from getting to his only Donna. <br /> <br /> Who will survive to see prom, and what will Donna do when she is forced to withstand her greatest fear? Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup and Dana Davis, along with a star in a slasher remake, where tuxedo-clad teens will be everywhere, nervously looking over their shoulders, go to the dance floor. A plot that will probably alienate you when you see this. Witch, if you ask me, is a good thing. <br /> <br /> Without much difficulty, McCormick diligently tries to defuse tensions in the most banal situations. At some point, the girl returns to the torch (lamp!), And McCormick tries to pump it up to the point where he is intimidated. Desperate times really require desperate measures. Since the last IKEA catalog there have not been so many pictures of cabinets. <br /> <br /> In the era of The Hills, My Super Sweet 16 and Catch a Predator, there is probably a strange, scary film to be gotten from the commoditization of glamor and the terrible obsession of a society of youthful beauty. This is not the movie. <br /> <br /> My final verdict? Avoid at all costs. No one will like the prom, it is even a disappointment for those who usually like the remodelers of hacker works. Given its complete lack of blood or fright. At night you will hurry to forget.
