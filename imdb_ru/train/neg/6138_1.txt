This film was terrible from conception to execution. Does the US need to create a Star Wars website in this remote country? Is that their premise? The US concludes that the way to access is to win an obstacle course, such as a cross-country race, where the winner can ask any leader. And who better to win this race, known as "The Game", than a gymnast? Of course! A gymnast would be the perfect choice for this mission. And do not forget that his father was an operative. Fortunately for our hero, gymnastic equipment is found in good places, for example, a stone horse in the center of a square (for no reason) among a mad city. Impeccable. <br /> <br /> But besides the terrible, HORRIBLE prerequisite, there is a clumsy clumsy romantic scene, an apparently depressed ninja, whose only job is to hold the flag to indicate the race track and the worst climax ever. After winning the race, our hero expresses the wishes of the US government. And lo and behold, all the efforts were worth it, because the US gets the Star Wars website! Hooray! IS THIS YOUR TRIUMPHANT END ?! Wow. <br /> <br /> But despite the fact that the film is so bad, watching it is very fun. One cover with a picture of a ninja with machine guns was enough so that I could rent this movie. <br /> <br /> But if I ever met Kurt Thomas (star of a gymnast) in real life, I would probably hit him in the face after a double flip with 2 1/2 turns in the layout position.
