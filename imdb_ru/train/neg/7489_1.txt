American war and Nazi films simply cannot be good. They cannot resist becoming an idiot and follow the agenda. All the Nazis are bad, crazy, too proud, and the Americans are so modest, but so capable, sensible and humane. Come on, stop this bullshit. The protagonist says something like "with this ordeal we must make aggressive war a crime." Is America a peace-loving country with a world budget of 1 billion dollars in defense (2nd China with 51 billion dollars)? Is it just spent on it without any ... ROI? Why portray America as a peaceful nation, if it is not? I really don't like agenda films - they throw art into hell and try to convince us to believe in something. Hollywood has to put a label on movies, just like record labels have this label “parental advice”. In some films, we should have the label "consultant for garbage," "propaganda consultant" or "politically correct advice." This is one of them.
