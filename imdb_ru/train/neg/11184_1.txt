This is really a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> I am writing this in such a way that some people postpone viewing it somewhere. If I do not allow one person to waste part of their precious life on watching this film, I will die happy. <br /> <br /> Unquestionably boring, though, since Al Pacino starred in it, I was fooled by the fact that at any moment there was something interesting was about to happen. Then the loans rolled, and I realized that I was completely fooled by watching this incredible nonsense. <br /> <br /> I canâ€™t believe that this film has reached the same high score as on IMDb (more than 5 stars when I last saw the vote). Do you ironically vote? <br /> <br /> Please, please do not watch this movie!
