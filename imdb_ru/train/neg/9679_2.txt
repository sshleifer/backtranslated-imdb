This film was terrible in the worst sense: you didn't care. You didnâ€™t care what happened in the plot; you didn't care about the characters. All were heartless. I ended up leaving after 45 minutes because I just did not want to think about it anymore. There is too much sex in the movie. Sex can be good; it may even make a film (hence the Karma Sutra), but the communication here was not beautiful or sexy. It was just ugly. I do not see this movie.
