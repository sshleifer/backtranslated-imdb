So, here is the main plot. In 1933, Peter Sellers - Dr. Fu Manchu, a 168-year-old Chinese man who lived for a long time. The film begins with his birthday, in which he celebrates by drinking a special elixir, which (even the film never mentions) prolongs his life. In this case, the helper clumsily drops the elixir (Kato, if you remember the Pink Panther films), and he orders his minions to find 6 rare items to prepare the elixir. This creates a global hunt for people, in which his minions end up robbing diamond museums and go to London to meet Dr. Foo’s enemies, a retired Scotland Yard detective, Nyland Smith, also played by Sellers, who are trying to stop him in what's supposed to be a witty comedy adventure. <br /> <br /> This was the last full-length feature film, Sellers, shot before his death. The terrible tragedy is that he was in it. Salespeople who are such a gifted comedian and have played unforgettable "funny" roles in the films "Panther" and especially in the movie "Party" are all that BUT in this film. This film was an absolute torture, and I could not even finish it. He is completely dying, and I continued to cringe, watching Sellers perform. After the arrival of the great work “Being there” a year earlier, how, I mean, HOW can he do it, and HOW did they manage to do it ??? As one person mentioned, the first 10:15 minutes are ok, but then everything is DOWN ... <br /> <br /> Avoid the plague. <br /> <br /> Rated 1 out of 10.
