Wet stories about the American revolution. <br /> <br /> When the farmer 'Tom Dobb' (Al Pacino) and his son arrive at the harbor of New York, they are immediately called street hedgehog Annie Lennox ... Annie Lennox? ... to contribute to hostilities. <br /> <br /> After Tom and his son were hacked away by fragments of a chain fired by British cannons, they were immediately punished by the “Daisy” (Nastassja Kinski) sympathizer of the Continental Army for “not standing your ground”. After this point, a number of distracting chapters take place at Kodak, including Tom’s participation in the Fox Hunt, in which he must carry a model of “poor old George Washington” stuffed with stuffed animals while he runs from the English captain wearing a bow a handkerchief (Manning Redwood)) and have a barbecue with a group of Iroquois Indians when they are planning the best way to get back into battle so that Al and his ungrateful child can snatch the shit from British officer Donald Sutherland. <br /> <br /> Directed by Hugh Hudson represents a unique style of filming, and the atmosphere is as thick as the London fog, but the writers depicting the evil monster’s uniforms once again reveal the patented Hollywood hatred of the British. <br /> <br /> Steven Berkoff serves as an American soldier.
