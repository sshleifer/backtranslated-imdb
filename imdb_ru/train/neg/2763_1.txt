I came to see D-War on a whim and with very low expectations. The film failed to meet them. <br /> <br /> I don’t mind stories that stretch gullibility - remember Reign of Fire? - but I expect them to be internally consistent. This film jumped from roar to roar, not stopping in one breath, and all this alternated with special effects that were far behind the likes of LOTR or even Godzilla. <br /> <br /> The mutable warrior-mystic from Korea, curiously turning into a Caucasian antiquary trader, and jumped out, like a deus ex machina, to pull the hapless protagonists out of his last mess. The special agent from the FBI, who seems to be fully connected with the ancient Korean folklore due to the excellent “paranormal separation” of the Fed, which has not yet been noticed. Lovers kiss on the deserted beaches, where someone exclaims: "I never wanted this to happen." A reincarnated couple of long-dead Koreans who "died like lovers in the stars." Mystical pendants, faceless hordes of soldier-robots (which owe much to Peter Jackson's orcs) and a snake that spends so much time roaring that every time a chosen victim is within reach, something comes to distract her. The dialogue is terrible, the game is wooden and the effect of the whole was, frankly, tedious. However, for me the crowning moment was at the end, after the final, when the music for the final credits was - Ariran! It is rather similar to how Akira Kurosawa closes “Run” with the karaoke performance of “My Way”, and let me clarify that in no way do I compare director Shim and Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> In short, I am indulgent, a scant collection of clichés and non-sexual stories that can appeal to the sense of melodrama so common in popular Quran culture, but should not be worth the price of a ticket to any serious moviegoer - or even not so serious to the viewer. I would advise to go around cinemas altogether and go directly to the video, but I'm not even sure that it is worth it.
