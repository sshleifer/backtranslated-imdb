I have not seen the first film, and if something like that, I do not have much desire. <br /> <br /> I just looked at it a few hours ago and hardly remember about it. <br /> <br /> From what I remember, it seems that the main plot of a group of very annoying people who have been living in a house with this dodgy old woman since Friday the 13th and are pursued by a plank of wood. <br /> Some people die, the film ends, I sue the man who sold me this film, because I want to get compensation for the missed time in my life. <br /> <br /> I’ll pay you £ 1 to take this film off of my hands ... oh wait, I already gave it to my friend.
