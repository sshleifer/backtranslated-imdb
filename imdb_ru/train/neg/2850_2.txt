If I understood that John Wayne was in this film, I would not watch it. It is humiliating for the Japanese, unfortunate for Hollywood and confusing any thinking person. But then most of the films of John Wayne are. Hollywood in the fifties still believed that everyone in the world loved Americans when the truth was (and remains) somewhat different. The film is dedicated to the isolationism of Japan of the XIX century. Maybe it's Hollywood, which should be isolated. In short, this film is awful like a bang. (Like "Madame Butterflies" with bad music).
