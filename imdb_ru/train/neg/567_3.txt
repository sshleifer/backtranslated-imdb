This film is one of the worst films ever made. How can Jon Bon Jovi play the movie? He is a singer, not an actor, what? Does he kill vampires with his guitar? What about the horrible conspiracy? Oh my god, this film really sucks. In the end, the Vampire Queen, played by the eternal vampire Arly Jover (Blade), is surrounded by an army of vampires, but when the “fantastic” killers arrive, only 4 vampires remain !! What happened to the other 10-15 vampires? They run out in the sun ??? What about "Grand At last" when Bon Jovi hits his head with a shotgun ??? This is really NOT. In "Buffy, the Vampire Slayer" in 100 episodes, not one vampire was shot with a pistol ??? This is really a lack of originality!
