Just imagine that the real Hitler, who was a master of propaganda and speech, would be such a mumble as Carlisle portrayed him in this film. <br /> <br /> No one would follow him, even a desperate, unemployed guy in the 1920s. <br /> <br /> This is just a Hollywood cardboard piece of propaganda disguised as a “real story.” <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for everyone who really believed in any of this show. Carlisle and the producers did not understand anything with this. <br /> <br /> Why did Hitler win so many people, a whole county for his ideas, if we were such a sausage? Why did people follow him to death? By portraying him as such a loser, they make their own film absolutely unbelievable. This film is a mix of old World War II propaganda and MTV's urban myths about one of the most important people of the last century. Imagine a film about Churchill, where the director only shows him as a drunkard for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This film is a shame, and I wonder how they could push such an actor as Carlisle into this recluse.
