When you look at it now and hear the whole language here, you are surprised that it was assigned a rating of "PG", but for you it is the rating system of the 1970s. Peter Falk spews the name of the Lord in vain six times in the first ten minutes of this movie! However, few people consider it offensive, and certainly not the scumbags who make films, and not the people who "evaluate" them. <br /> <br /> The cast is the clue to this film: Falk, Peter Boyle, Allen Garfield, Warren Oates, Gene Rowlands and Paul Sorvino are not exactly the actors that you wouldn’t find in The Sound of Music. <br /> <br /> I like robberies and a lot of director films. William Friedkin, but this scenario does not, and he is simply too much perceived as "Mucous 70s", visually and audibly. For those who loved Falk in the television series “Colombo”, it should be a shock to hear how he uses as much profanity as he does in movies. This is not the only case.
