Why is Colin Firth in this meaningless movie? Is he really so tight on money? <br /> <br /> In the film, it’s unclear what he dreams about: grief, exotic places, ghosts? Mr. Darcy's car? This is a messy mess. <br /> <br /> There seems to be some idea that Italy should be good, by itself, and that Italian can offer something as a language - but in the end the girls just want to return to Yankland. <br /> <br /> Senseless episodes on the beach, in churches, on busy roads — but what this is all about, or why it should worry someone, is simply incomprehensible. /> <br /> The film also had a daring woman. It is not clear what kind of work it was, but she seemed to be there only to make silly, inappropriate and offensive comments to the girl. Was this supposed to be about pedophilia? <br /> <br /> All in all, a pretty awful mess. I gave him 2, not 1, because there is no charm of a completely horrible movie in it.
