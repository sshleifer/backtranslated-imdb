Good, good at first: Cher and cinematography. Although I'm not a fan of Cher, she does an excellent job, and her role was well written. The cinematography was well done and conveys a sense of romance. <br /> <br /> The rest: a thin storyline, a performance by Nicolas Cage and a completely non-funny and weak attempt to portray an Italian-American family from New York. First, every time Cage opened his mouth, I cringed. I do not know what accent he was trying to use. Honestly, I haven't heard a single New York or Italian accent. It was quite surreal. And this was not because I was an adherent of accuracy, his voice simply sounded in my ears. And I like Nicolas Cage in other performances. Secondly, and this is purely anecdotal, but I have many Italian relatives, friends and acquaintances in New York, and, frankly, I got more laughter and felt more joy in appreciating the Italian ethnic family than this film. And it will be a boring night in the house. What a disappointment.
