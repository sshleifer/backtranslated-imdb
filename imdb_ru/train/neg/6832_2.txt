I would love this movie, but Van Damme repeats the same old garbage over and over again. Poo panties fight scenes as usual. The only thing that the loser ignored was that Russians are usually killed in the end. This film is a complete dog, making the highest nature, please, please, Van Damme, get some acting lessons, you need them. Anyone who loves Van Damme has problems. It seems sad that the only way when Van Damme gets any acting work is when he co-writes a film, makes a film and makes a script for a film. AVOID VAN DAMME AND HIS SWEET REVERSE EXPLOSIVE WIG I give this film two out of ten because the one with the sand was better. To add insult to injury, I spent on this manure
