It is a pity that you can not vote for zero stars on IMDb, because I would not hesitate! In fact, I would even say that this film was in negative stars. <br /> <br /> I, like many others, bought this film, thinking that since Michael Madsen is in it, he can be good ... No chance! This film was shocking! Imagine a film with a duration of “Brave and Beautiful”, well, in general, “Primitive Instinct” didn’t even come close to this good one, and I used to think that there would be nothing worse than the movie “Brave and Beautiful”. <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen, how could you do this to us? Worst of all, I did not rewind a bit forward, I hoped that at the end they would find out that it was some kind of stupid joke, that they thought it would be funny to make us watch such a terribly bad movie. <br /> <br /> How to start ...? Directing - Zero Stars, Script - Zero Stars, Actor Game - Zero Stars, Cinematography - Zero Stars, Digital Effects - Zero Stars, Production Design - Zero Stars, Makeup - Zero Stars, Casting - Zero Stars, Editing - Zero Stars, Trailer - Half Star, graphic design Half Star, DVD menu Half Star. <br /> <br /> However, I think it’s very important to watch bad movies just so that you know what a really bad movie is. So for this reason, I'm happy that I saw this movie, simply because I have a bad movie to put it at the end of my list.
