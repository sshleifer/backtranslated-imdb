For me, the only reason to look at this remake was to see how bad and ridiculous it is. There was no doubt that this was ridiculous and bad, because I saw War and Peace (1968). Let's start? Here we are ... <br /> <br /> Robert Dornhelm and Brendan Donnison - Pierre Bezuhov is a thin guy who lacks the depth of the original; Natasha Rostova from Robert Dornhelm and Brendan Donnison is a scarecrow, her image can cause insomnia; Andrei Bolkonsky from “Robert Dornhelm and Brendan Donnison” is a normal incarnation, which, like the thin guy (see above), lacks the depth of the Russian soul and the “struggle inside”; "Napoleon" by Robert Dornhelm and Brendan Donnison is a rather unimpressive leader; Robert Dornhelm and Prince Bolkonsky Brendan Donnison - a shag with an English face; Robert Dornhelm and Brendan Donnison, Count Bezuhov, are a spineless freak show ... <br /> <br /> The rest of the characters are not much better. <br /> <br /> The movements of the actors and the image they look and say is often brutal. They behave like modern EU citizens dressed for a one-day masquerade. It all looks cheap and never comes close to the standards of our Russian men and women from the beginning of the 19th century. <br /> <br /> Good fun to explore and make fun. We had quite a bit of giggling in our office when we recalled this modern product that was shown last night on TV. <br /> <br /> “User Rating: 8.0 / 10 (29 votes)” - I think many young people never watched our film (“War and Peace” 1968) and did not feel a strange sense of quality “Tarantino-Spielberg ". Remember the scene when our hussar saves his friend, turns around, shoots, and there is a boom on the bridge? Looks like a CGI blast. <br /> <br /> There is no sense or craft to make the best version of the novel that was once properly shown in our country. But I would love to watch the Russian remake of "Gone With the Wind." Hey, directors, wake up and do it instead of spoiling our classics. <br /> <br /> Now back to common sense. Seriously. What I mentioned above is not new, though exaggerated, deadly. <br /> <br /> Forcing foreign actors to try to pass for Russians (participating in very serious epics and dramas) is a blunder, and directors make this mistake again and again. Of course, this leads to numerous laughter - especially Clemence Poesy is ridiculously ridiculous, and her dancing and singing make the Russian viewer think: “This is so lame that it is ridiculous!”). <br /> <br /> To say something new, I would like to mention the pace of the film. In my opinion, this new version is very heterogeneous. The narration and scenes are not natural: they fluctuate and float, as in a modern video. Again I have to remember our “War and Peace”, where the action is so natural, and the story is so easy that you just sit and enjoy “go with the flow”. <br /> <br /> I thought that maybe the Battle of Borodino would have been great (to somehow fix the many flaws), but it turned out that it was not suitable for the military scenes filmed in 1968. <br /> <br /> There must be something good in this movie. And there is. The actors seem to be struggling to make it all work. They had no chance from the start, but they still joined the “team of losers”. Plus 1 point for this recklessness. This makes the Russian audience uncomfortable - some scenes ironically are ridiculous, although they are designed to be incredibly powerful, and the actors do their best. All this causes pity, and sometimes - laughter. <br /> <br /> What else I like about this show is the last part of it. This very clearly shows how everyone gets their wages and taxes. In addition, judging by the trailers of the film, I thought there would be a sex scene for adults in the film that would definitely kill the entire project. But, fortunately, he does not have such garbage. And this is a big plus. <br /> <br /> “War and Peace” is not “Harry Potter”, and nowadays even we, in modern Russia, do not have enough craft to properly remove it. Should I say that the moral quality of our lives has deteriorated a lot? Fortunately, in Soviet times, the corresponding film was shown. The American version of the 1950s was to some extent justified — ours did not even exist yet. Then there were extenuating circumstances. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 (1 point is given from the very beginning, 1 point for recklessness, and 2 points for the last part of the series. Thank you for your attention.
