There are several Stallone films that I like, but this film did not live up to my low expectations. It was hard for me to believe this movie. For example, a group of terrorists who crash to the ground in the desert is ready to survive for at least two days. In addition, in all this wilderness, Stallone and the company continue to run across bridges and stairs that provide convenient short cuts or story devices. In addition, the treasury cops do not seem to coordinate with local rescuers. In addition, the bad guys who could not hit the barn really high-tech automatic weapons. <br /> <br /> Initially, I liked the villain John Lithgow, but the character is such a complete psychopath that he doesn’t know care about any of his own bad guys, or kill them all. In the end, I just could not believe this character. <br /> <br /> It’s not worth paying for rent, you don’t even have to spend time watching it.
