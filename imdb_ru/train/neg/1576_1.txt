this film has it all; deft cinematography, reminiscent of Martin Scorsese or Olive Stone, tough action "heat", explosive action of Jerry Bruckheimer's film, witty dialogue of Tarantino's script and epic feeling, say, "godfather" under control, shows a fiery temperament, but also shows the real emotional depth and intensity. his performance reminds me of the image of Robert De Niro, depicting Jake la Motte in “The Frenzy Bull”. <br /> <br /> The action movie scene is truly breathtaking, not because the movie “Bullitt” depicts such high-octane, but stylish car scenes. Special effects expand the boundaries of technology and filmmaking. Independence Day set a standard that this film clearly conformed and far exceeded. <br /> <br /> In general, an excellent game from the list of actors (for example, the list of invitations to the Oscar party!), Cool locations, exciting action, and a tough script.
