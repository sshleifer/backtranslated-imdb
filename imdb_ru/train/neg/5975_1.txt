I never wanted to watch this movie, then one day, as a joke, I watched it to see how bad it was; my preconceived opinions were confirmed. <br /> <br /> For starters, I would like to question the filmâ€™s policies. It is hidden behind the mask of women "making it big in the city", but the only way women can make it big is to use their sexuality, not their intelligence or skills. These women are nothing more than whores. Are less attractive girls not successful? This is not the only right message of the film: hundreds of shots of American flags and huge wads of money. A great example of how the only powerful thing in America is capitalism and anything of spiritual, moral or artistic significance is not even considered in this film. Money is depicted as the only important thing for young people. <br /> <br /> The head of the bar declares that she does not allow drug addicts into her bar, and then she goes to the poor gallons of strong drinks for her. own neck, and then neck of its employees and clients. Anyone who knows anything about intoxicants knows that alcohol can be as dangerous as heroin and more dangerous than most illegal drugs. <br /> <br /> And finally, why scenes in which the main character is the point of sexual behavior. Interest in the public (when she undresses or with her boyfriend) is her father always involved? We watch her undress when the camera is actually caressing her legs while she is on the phone with her father. She "sells" her father just as she "sells" her boyfriend. I find it most strange. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film is immoral, fascist, degrading women and, frankly, exciting. But what else do you expect from Jerry Bruckheimer?
