For the first 20 minutes or so (I watched it on the PS2, so I have no idea how long it took), Alienator creates an interesting premise. I don’t think I’ve seen a slasher movie with an alien from another planet like a villain before. However, interest soon turns into dazed disbelief because you understand that the “newcomer” is a huge female bodybuilder in a steel bikini. Yes, Alienator is obviously funny. <br /> <br /> I do not think that I am against it. In a world of shock-horror, clearly absurd can be a good sign. However, the blatant stupidity of his premise is all that the film actually does. The Alienator is damn fun, but also a high-order shambolichesky feast. The actors lean in with unsuccessful attempts at seriousness, the potentially ingenious lines of dialogue with pure cheese stumble upon unnerving incompetence, and the direction does not summarize even one or two worthy pieces. By the time the movie ends, you can barely see the original concept in the haystack because of the total deception that the team piled on. <br /> <br /> Add to this the fact that “Alien” simply kills people, evaporating them, instead of doing any “cuts” as such, you have a huge pulsating bunch of good ideas left to rot. . You will laugh at the Alienator, but at him, not with him. If this is your thing, then go check it out.
