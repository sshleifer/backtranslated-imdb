You get a gift. It is exquisitely wrapped. The box in which it is located is made by hand from the best wood species and demonstrates craftsmanship to the smallest detail. Then it is wrapped in gorgeous paper, handmade and hand painted by the most talented artists. All this is wrapped in ribbons of fine silk lace. This is a spectacle. <br /> <br /> Then you cut the ribbon, tear off the paper, open the box and find ... nothing. This is TOYS. You either enjoy the packaging or forget about it. <br /> <br /> The film is not without purpose and meaning: war is not a good thing. Well, isn't it original! The moral is so obvious that it is even embarrassing to even point it out. And even this poor understanding is undermined by a story in which elements of war — in particular, military toys — are clearly a bad thing, as long as they do not need an exciting climax, and the film imitates war using innocent toys. It’s like someone preaching a strict, condescending sermon, and in the end says, “Just kidding.” <br /> <br /> But even as an empty box, the film does not undergo a thorough study. Yes, it is a sight with some wonderful, striking images. The sets are creative, and the cinematography catches colorful scenes with skill. But the images are cold and emotionally sterile. Like the script, the film’s appearance is bleak, at times aesthetically fruitless and surreal. This is a film that wants to praise toys as wonderful and special things, but shows that they are the creations of an empty and cold world. The film tends to be a funny, sullen way, but the humor is forced and artificial. Robin Williams, as the besieged heir to the empire for the production of toys, throws in his maneuverable manner, which seems only alien to the strange, coldly structured world in which he lives. Indeed, thematic links and the tasteless sexual hints that are scattered everywhere sharply contradict the children's fable that the film vaguely tries to present. In order for this film to work or make sense, it must be installed in its own universe, Oz, far from Kansas. Every time jokes bring us back to reality, the country of toys becomes more and more obvious deception. <br /> <br /> They say that this was a favorite project of director Barry Levinson, which he had been striving to do for ten years. Unfortunately, it is obvious why he had problems with support. Like most pet projects that have finally been implemented (RADIOLAND MURDERS, RADIO FLYER & BATTLEFIELD: EARTH are excellent examples), this seems like a blind spot in the director’s field of vision. Perhaps Levinson so often directed and re-directed the TOYS in his head that he did not have a fresh vision when he finally got to the sound stage. He has already perfected it to death. <br /> <br /> Many of the toys shown in the film are clumsy, mechanical, clockwork monsters. So is the movie itself.
