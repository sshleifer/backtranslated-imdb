If there were a rating of 0 stars, I would gladly distribute it to this terrible pile of waste. The fact that a real resume is perfectly normal and that if it were done differently, it could be brilliant, it only aggravates it. The main task of locking a group of people in an experimental chamber is good, but WHERE IS THE EXPERIMENT? All I see is a bunch of unreasonable surfers and blondes chatting about music and culture that I don’t know or don’t want to know ... The problems are miserable and stupid. The whole point of reality shows is to show REALITY. If you set a "task", do not force them to play with exaggerated food requisites and stereotypical cultural elements in "games on Friday night." make them make a real challenge. As for the "earning" of prize money, then nothing, if they really earn! These people are crazy. If only they had made the show better, the real idea would be great. But this will not happen!
