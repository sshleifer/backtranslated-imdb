This is another typical incredible and meaningless piece of a Hollywood Drake. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell in the role of Snake Pliskin’s business suit convinces me that he was the best second baseman. Ray Liotta as a psychotic policeman is absolutely predictable and absurd. Madeline Stowe is her usual cardboard personality, and she does little to be a convincing victim. <br /> <br /> Each scene in this delusion is absolutely predictable to the very end, when Kurt rushes at Rei with a vase or something, knocking him down and out. Then Kurt and Madeline make a mandatory ending of the film, and EVERYTHING, except Russell and Stowe, KNOW that Liotta is going to stand up again and threaten the couple. <br /> <br /> He does Of course, and Russell trains him 10 times with his 9 mm, which was completely unnecessary. This film could well end in a stupid scene - EXCEPT for Hollywood madness about unnecessary violence, and the more they can add or “improve”, the more they will spit.
