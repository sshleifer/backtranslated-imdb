I am a real fan of the original Cracker series and I own them on DVD. Cracker tended to be excessive at times, but Robbie Coltrane and the other cast members, as well as the screenwriters, always seemed to stand it in spite of themselves. I think Cracker is one of the best TV shows on British television of the time, and there is fierce competition: Prime Suspect, Inspector Frost, Inspector Mors, Sherlock Homes, Jeremy Brett and many others. Cracker, along with Prime Suspect, was at the top of my list. <br /> <br /> What makes the "New Terror" even more sad ... <br /> <br /> In the end, it was a very pale imitation of Cracker's former glory. I forced myself to come to terms with all of this, making sure that in fact everything was not so bad, and that some kind of spark would eventually light up. I was wrong, it was bad from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> A few criticisms: first, just to immediately get a potential bias: I was offended by the anti-American, anti-war screed, which buzzed throughout most of the show. Topper: the murder of two Americans, innocent of any crime, and a British drug addict, according to Fitz, "is understandable, but not justified." I thought, “I ran two hours of shit to hear this disgusting nonsense?” So I had a negative reaction to the anti-war / American tone caused by my convictions ... Besides politics, I had a clear feeling that this cracker was just a foothold for propaganda, and it actually helped undermine the already terribly weak scenario. <br /> <br /> Secondly, how much airtime did Robbie Coltrane receive? Fitz was a bit of a player in this, as if he were an afterthought, included in some story originally written without any thought about the role of Fitz. Coltrane could carry the show on his own broad and still rather flabby shoulders, but the writer obviously thought about other things and missed this chance, and with a large margin. <br /> <br /> Thirdly: WHAT IS A BAD SCENARIO! There was some brilliance, and a couple of pieces of real character development (Fitz’s son ranted that Fitz could not stay in his house if he was late for his plane to Australia, a detective who loved to beat his bad performers behind their heads, and some old sparks between Fitz and his Missus), but not enough to carry a tedious storyline. <br /> <br /> Fourth, where the hell was Panhallagan? Now it would be interesting ... In the end, it was Manchester, and in 10 years she would be in the ranks. Another missed opportunity (or perhaps the actress was not interested?) <br /> <br /> Well, there is still a lot (this is bad) to say, but I will end with curiosity: at the end of the show (as was shown on the air BBCA), when it was announced in the announcement that the “Director's Version” is available on BBC On-Demand, I thought that AH-HA! The director, for whom, apparently, you have to pay, could have all those positive qualities that I expected to see tonight, but never did, as a consistent, interesting plot. Unfortunately, after I convinced myself to watch the horrible free version of New Terror with the hope of seeing something, something worth seeing, just to be disappointed, I had no hope left to motivate me to pay for a second, potentially longer and tedious version. Also, it made me angry that the BBCA was diced and donated time to show an endless (every ten minutes or so) stream of commercials, and then turned around and asked me to pay for something that probably should have been broadcast. tonight. . <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I will quote the first paragraph of the review of Variety “New Terror”: it really speaks for itself: “The initial excitement about the fact that Robbie Coltrane repeats his role as a spoiled, intoxicating, effeminate character Bee The blues-off of a criminal psychologist is pursued by clumsy political writer Jimmy McGovern, who is determined to speak as part of this revival. First, he shakes his message, namely that the Americans are a bunch of tearful dudes who don’t care. Not to mention terrorism, before it hit our doorstep - McGovern’s stunned story and muffled pleasure to see Fitz back on business. ”
