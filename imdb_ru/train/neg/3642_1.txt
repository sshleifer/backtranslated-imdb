Unfortunately, the film is more devoted to making flimsy comments on social events, but has no chance to legally document what happened. The constant rhetoric that violent video games are not to blame (I get the impression that Ben Kochio is an avid gamer), or that media and music are completely devoid of influence, is an obvious message (we even get the ridiculous scene of two boys by burning ALL of them discs, talk about subtlety!), but the film is getting away with it only because it is “fiction”. Nice try. Yes, this is a great idea to reduce the influence of the media, but how do we recognize children who actually planned and conducted school shots that were not influenced by the media? or video games? We do not agree with this film, because these children are smart enough again to completely abandon the media, and at the same time stupid enough to burn down the Nazi symbol on the ground? haha, for some reason I don’t think so. <br /> <br /> The film hits you on the head with the image of normal families, almost madness to think that there were no serious flaws in the family. the dynamics of the children who actually went out and shot their classmates. Why is everyone so concerned that the killers appear to be “normal”, and they obviously do not? Absolutely false and fake image.
