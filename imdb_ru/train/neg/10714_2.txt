For the two funniest comedians, the movie was terrible. Quickly sent it and never got better! A waste of time and money! Tina Fey is such a wonderful writer that I thought she would be great in a comedy. The previews were very good, but they showed only the best parts of the film. My husband even thought that for a chick it sucks. What with this. The film was very slow and boring. I will not recommend this to anyone at this time. I would like my money back for this! Used by us here in Arizona. Thank you but no. Who does such nonsense to make people think that you are pregnant. I thought it would be so funny, I had my own children, and I helped others to have children. It could be more in line with reality.
