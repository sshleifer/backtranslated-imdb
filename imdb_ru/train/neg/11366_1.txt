The first (and only) time I saw "Shades" was during Sneakpreview. It was not even in the premiere. I remember there was someone from the director, I do not even remember who. It was a Belgian film that we had never heard of, so we were completely neutral, not knowing what to expect. Mickey Rourke is a brilliant actor, and he stands ahead of the rest. He plays an actor whose star has long ceased to grow. He helps to realize in Belgium a film called “Shades”. <br /> <br /> As soon as the film began, we noticed how many curses there were. Nothing against random swearing. However, it was much annoying. Whenever Rourke uses the word F *** to express something, it happens naturally. However, when one of the non-English speaking actors uses the word F **** or S ***, it becomes arrogant and aggressive. <br /> <br /> We quickly lost count, how many times they used the words F and S. Everyone was just happy to leave the theater. And we had to give a vote, but it was difficult for us, because it was only from 0 to 10, and we were looking for -10.
