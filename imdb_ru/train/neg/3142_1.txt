Once there was a director named James. He brought us wonderful, exciting science fiction such as the Terminator and Aliens. These films were the material from which the blockbusters were made, and he seemed to have a fantastic future when the dawn of computer special effects hit the film industry. The shown Terminator 2 gave us an idea of ​​what was possible in this new era. <br /> <br /> ....... and then it happened ................ ... 1997 ........ countless awards. ......... obscene amounts of money ............ outlandish barrage of advertising ...... ...... maximum profit ........ Titanic was here! <br /> <br /> I have never (never) been one of those who jumped on the bandwagon and was overly critical for that, in fact, I often took the opposite position of the majority, just to give an argument. “Titanic,” however, was a film from which I extracted only one positive — a film that Kate Winslet was absolutely gorgeous! <br /> <br /> Fast — the dialogue was like something from the Beverly Hills 90210, the action was more wooden than my nephew’s tree house, the images meant for horror were actually funny (a person falling from the ship and the striking propeller), historically false (don't even turn me on, because there are too many of them), they had a terrible musical theme (there with a bodyguard for cheese), and the senseless love story was so exhausting, self-absorbing and pitiful that disrespectful related to the plight of everyone else (i I was glad when he died, and disappointed when she did not). <br /> <br /> It was clearly clear from the very beginning that this picture was designed to attract MTV, chewing gum, chasing a boy with a car, teenage girls (De Caprio himself looked less like heroic than a weak member of a group of boys), who drag their sex- hungry guys for three and half hours, hoping for good luck later! Worst of all, it did not stop at this stage. Millions of stunned vultures went to look at this expensive waste of celluloid, because "its production was so expensive, it must have been great" and "Steve and Barbara said it was good, and they know their films." <br /> <br /> The crowning glory came when the Titanic swung the boards at the Oscars. Hollywood King James had a serious moment of silence for the victims of the fateful evening on which his three and a half hour farce was based. It seemed to me that he prayed for forgiveness after getting rich on an inaccurate image of the circumstances that led to the death of many people. <br /> <br /> However, if people are so stupid and sentimental that they can buy this garbage, they deserve to be robbed. Good luck to Hollywood, if that is how they want to make money, I would do it if I had such chances in life! <br /> <br /> This is right on my list of the worst films of all time with other stupid, historically false / human interests, such as Patriot and Pearl Harbor.
