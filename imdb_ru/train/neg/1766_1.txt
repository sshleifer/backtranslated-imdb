Baldwin really sank down to make such films. The script, the music, almost everything in this film is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The sound fx does not sound believable, it stands out too much (technical devices, etc.). If they are trying to make a movie about such things, at least try to put it into practice and discard unnecessary beeps, because these gadgets do not really make such loud sounds. Natural sounds, such as steps and the like, do not exist, which creates an atmosphere similar to emptiness. <br /> <br /> The directing seems acceptable for such a low-budget film (I hope it was a low-budget film), although sometimes it seems rather amateurish. <br /> <br /> Most characters seem empty and fake, they just didn’t play this movie very well. I believe that it would be better to make Baldwin speak Spanish than to force Spanish actors to speak English when we all know that their language is more alive and alive, so acting can suffer greatly if an odd language is used. I mean, can anyone finally understand how stupid it sounds when international actors speak English with a bad accent? It should have been a buried corpse in the film industry. Has the production team ever heard of subtitles? This film again manages to portray the European police as lazy and corrupt, and the society as vulnerable and helpless. I mean, if the plot again sounds like this: “Interpol cannot make nests, so let's call one American to destroy this international syndicate” or something like that. <br /> <br /> Sony Pictures follows the same path as Colombia, before it's just the production of films for hell. I believe they also have a sense of self-worth. Should buyers buy all the dirty names just because Sony releases something good several times a year ?! Maybe they should have used the same command as Di Cu Si — tell me. It is spoken in Spanish, and Paz Vega and Santi Millan do a decent job keeping the film afloat. Looks and sounds much better! Come on Sony, wake up, produce less, sell more.
