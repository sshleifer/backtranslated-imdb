Animal Farm (1954) read very well about the dangers of totalitarianism. How good ideals can be changed and distorted by those who do not know or rule with an iron fist and empty head. Unfortunately, this film does not depict any of them. What we are shown is propaganda work, in which many fingers flap and point. The animation and the direction were good, given the budget and time period, but the very essence of the novel by George Orwell is very lacking. <br /> <br /> If you are one of those who want to understand how not to adapt a novel or are simply interested in adapting this brilliant novel, then you should definitely look. I just found it to be a bit mediocre. However, the opinion of only one person. <br /> <br /> The remake is slightly lower, but not by much.
