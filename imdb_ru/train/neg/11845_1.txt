... is the only way to describe this film about things that should be infallible: scandal, sex, celebrities, power. Kirsten Dunst talks about her role as dumb movie star Marion Davis, as if she thinks she is in "Legally Blonde." The guy who plays William Randolph Hearst replays to such an extent that you want to get to the screen and hit him. Is Eddie Izzard pretty good, except that he plays Charlie Chaplin, and about 125 pounds too heavy for this role? It is hard to believe that this awkward, uneven crash was filmed by Peter Bogdanovich, but again, he did not make a film that you can watch, what? 30 years? Sometimes there is simply no turning back.
