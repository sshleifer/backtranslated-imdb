I can't believe that people thought that this stinking heap of trash was funny. Moving the attempts of humor among cruelty, disgust and stupidity, "There is something in Mary", there are few reasons to remain until the end. Of course, Cameron Diaz is very beautiful, but it will never be enough to save the film. Ben Stiller does his best to work within the plot and is obviously very talented, but the film is a loser. <br /> <br /> None of the scenes were believable. Frames were poorly calculated and poorly decorated. The Farrelli Brothers should avoid making films at all costs. I check IMDB to see what they are working on, and I know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10; bonus from the time when I smiled. In my opinion, I am not immune to humor and am not alone. My wife also hated it. The next day we saw Rush Hour and laughed stupidly. This film is just smelly.
