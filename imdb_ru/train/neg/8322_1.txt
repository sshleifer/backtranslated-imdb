I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating when I watched it on IMDb after watching it. This is truly one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of bad movies. At first it was like a good movie, but when he came to the operation, I could not believe how bad it was. This voice-over destroys EVERYTHING! Just imagine that you are being torn apart, and then listen to what he says. I saw the film in German, so I don’t know what he said in English, but ironic things like “Yes, right, it doesn’t hurt ...”? ... What is it? To tell yourself to “think about something else,” and then forget about your pain, just thinking about your girlfriend, just ... stupid. And his mother ... how the hell can she understand something like that? Someone comes to tell her that her son died in surgery (what should she have expected). Plus she found some letters in Jessica Albas's bag. plus the fact that "she knows the hospital" ... and then she will need "one second" to figure it out? What the hell? ^^ And the end ... why the police are ruining them? The patient died in surgery, that's all. This drunk doctor also knows nothing ... and then they ruin them all, even the girl ??? What for??? Despite all this, I think that Christensen did a bad job, but this is not really considered to be for me ... the mistakes and nonsense I wrote about above are a problem. I watched this movie with some friends, and we were all VERY disappointed ... As I said, one of the worst films I have ever seen ... Just do not watch it;)
