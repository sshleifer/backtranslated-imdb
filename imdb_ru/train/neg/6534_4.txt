This sci-fi adventure is not the best and by no means the worst. I agree with the statement that bad fiction is ridiculous. Fancy pink toning and unusual special effects make it a favorite for late, late, late showers. Space explorers on the planet Mars are fighting with strange giant amoeba-like monsters and other strange creatures. Pretty cool. <br /> <br /> The actors included Les Tremaine, Naoura Hayden, Gerald Mohr and Jack Krushhen. Get convenience and enjoy. Don't be upset if you fall asleep for a moment. I agree with the addition of this to the list of cult classics, so as not to miss.
