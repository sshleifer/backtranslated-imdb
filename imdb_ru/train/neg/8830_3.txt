Just too many holes in this film to be enjoyable, and many many strange, almost hollywood finals that do not fit the context of the rest of the film (this is not a spoiler, since you will never guess how it will end!) <br /> <br /> You will also need to have a thick skin for all sorts of politically correct shades. The conflict between black and white was very far-fetched and one-sided. I do not understand why the author behaved in such a way that the local black community behaves so unacceptably, does he / she try to be a racist? <br /> <br /> A really weird movie. Watch only if you want to be really annoyed with holes in the plot, and you like to discuss everything that could or could not happen. <br /> <br /> But on the positive side, shooting and acting is excellent.
