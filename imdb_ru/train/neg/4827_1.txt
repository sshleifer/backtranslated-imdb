If this film is meant to discourage people from using drugs, it will fail. I was ready to start using them, I waited for something to happen, and actually did nothing. This film is not a horror or drama. It's just the paranoia of methamphetamine users. This film can win a reward for using the word "F" so many times and so useless. That was not very well said, but I felt that they were doing Met to replace Met, which they owed to someone. Hector only worsened and became even more paranoid when the film continued, and the girl became even more hopeless. The ending really didn't make sense. The movie did not make sense, unless it showed how annoying it was to get stuck in the house among nowhere with the metishead. I relied on other reviews when I decided to watch this movie, and the rating of this movie should be well below average.
