One reason I remember is that it was shown a week after Nigel Knila QUATERMASS’s brilliant series was shown. Trailers emphasized that the main character had a disfigured hand, which is why I hoped that he would look like Victor Karun from QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT, chasing the streets of London. <br /> <br /> There is no such luck, because RACING GAME is just a rather dismal thriller with a physically handicapped trick trying to get to the bottom of investigations into corruption races. I believe that if you are a Dick Francis fan, you might like it, but if you set it up in the context of the late 70s, when SWEENEY just ended, and PROFESSIONALS were still being released, something was missing in RACING GAME. In one trailer there was a car that was driving on the other on the road, and if it was a trailer for “SWEENEY”, you would see Jack Reagan for taking the car and knocking the recognition out of slags that made a move until yourself car and blew the terrorists inside. I think that sums up what's wrong with this series
