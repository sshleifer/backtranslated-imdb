This is incredible !! ... yes, someone wrote to me that it was time to waste time to sit down and watch this movie .. it is so! Do not do that! I'm totally annoyed! I liked Wesley Snipes, and it seemed funny to me that he played the meaning of his name in the film. In any case, I wanted to watch this film (only at home, of course), but now (immediately after) I am absolutely disappointed! This was his worst movie ever. Inwatchable !! Bad acting game! Bad operator! Bad script! Only one good thought: this wonderful girl! Surely mannequin! Eeee !! MB .. 10 lines at least ?! I do not want to waste your time to read my opinion! I hope I was clear and not stable enough, because English is not my native method of speech. So take some time and watch some good films, as I try too .. Peace!
