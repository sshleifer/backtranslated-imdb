The real shame of the "Assembly" is not in a bad game, and not in a disgustingly shallow plot. The real shame is that he was much worse than the series he started, although he had one main attraction: Takashima. I would really like to see Laurel Takashima in a room with Susan Ivanova, even just five minutes. She has this sarcasm, this is wit, this double-edged personality, which is both unstable and attractive. Unfortunately, the pilot film "Babylon 5" has an incredibly boring murder story. Patricia Tallman, who never seriously returned to the series, until much later, fortunately, recovered with age, like Lita Alexander, who is no more than a tearful, exhausting telepath. I will leave you with the last thought - why does Delenn look like some kind of male frog from space (although she is female)? Thank God for the way the Minbari looked later on the show.
