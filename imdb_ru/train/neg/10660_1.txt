I feel sorry for the people who call Kamala Hassan "Ulaganayakan", maybe, for them Ulagam is Tollwood! Well, guys, this movie is a thriller without thrills. <br /> <br /> Exit your humble spot and just watch some high-profile thrillers, such as Ordinary Suspects or even Silence of the Lambs. <br /> Technically good, but the style of substance Kamal is not like a policeman, there are no thrills that pull and miss until the end, you can save 3 valuable hours of your life if you skip the movie. <br /> <br /> Kamal at his best is the best in Tolllywood
