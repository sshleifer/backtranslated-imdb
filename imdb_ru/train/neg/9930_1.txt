A merciless trite and painfully unfunny attempt to transfer Sheriff Bart's character from Mel Brooks's “Burning Saddle” to his own weekly sitcom, it's really as bad as some people claim! <br /> <br /> The laugh track serves only to remind the uninvited audience that everything in this supposed comedy is intended as a joke, and how desperate you need to laugh is really it! <br /> <br /> However, it is somewhat curious to see Louis Gossett Jr. trying his best to impersonate Clivon Little. His embarrassment manifests itself in every scene. He was much funnier in the HBO film El Diablo than he was here in this piece of cheese! <br /> <br /> Truly, the best and fun thing in Black Bart is his horse's name!
