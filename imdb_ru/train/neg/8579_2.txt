I'm afraid it's pretty awful, despite a few good performances and, in general, a competent guide for acting. This is the first and last attempt of the writer-director Su Liu. "Rub and Tug" (2002) - one of the unfortunate by-products of the Canadian program to promote domestic film production. While the program encourages decent efforts, such as New Waterford Girl, it opens the door to talentless newcomers, such as Liu, who did not need to aggressively promote this project, but it received the green light without adequately studying its script or its credentials . <br /> <br /> You don’t mind a low budget because shabby design, poor lighting, poor audio and a boring document-style selection of frames fit the subject; Workers in Canadian massage parlors. But the dialogue and plot do not give the actors anything to work with, the editor needs to collect a lot, and the viewer - any mental problems, except for the suspension of disbelief. When your story is so simplistic, the last thing you need is a tangled story-telling technique; even if nothing happens, the film is difficult to follow, and the point of view cannot be determined. <br /> <br /> Don McKellar’s ​​work as Conrad is several steps lower than his counterpart in Exotics. Lee Lindy Booth is her standard fancy airy head; as always it is pleasant, but here it is a little more. "Cindy" Kira Clavell - a pleasant surprise, a kind of Asian Shelley Duval. The only other role of any other meaning, Betty Tara Spencer-Nairn Street, more than cancels her excellent performance in "New Waterford Girl". Her superficial performance in Ruby and Snatch should limit any tendency to look for other films in which she starred; if you don’t need further confirmation of Alan Moyle’s Waterford director’s skill in working with young actors. <br /> <br /> You quickly came to the conclusion that Liu's brain of a reptile cannot comprehend such concepts as plot complexity, so the need to insert a lazy and unconvincing deus ex machina device by the end is hardly a surprise. However, it can be even worse; a sluggish story has so little internal logic that the unlikely ending is not as painful as usual. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
