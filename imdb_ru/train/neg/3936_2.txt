Wow. I thought it might be tasteless, but it was even worse than I imagined! Sometimes I like to watch a good movie about a car accident: those that are so bad that you can't look away because you want to see how bad they can become. This is really the only reason why I could leave television - a painful hobby. It was not so much an acting game, but only mediocrity or a little worse than one would expect from this composition, but also a prerequisite, and a plot that should never have been seen. The script also moans. As for cinematography, did anyone else notice that they used a “curtain drawing” device, as in the old TV show of the 50s ... but without irony? At first I thought that they must be joking, but the film takes itself too seriously to use it mockingly. Don't even ask me about the bill ... the only pinnacle is the last song of Murchiba. I guess they wanted to leave people with something for their $ 8 ... glad I saw it on TV !!!!! Just stupid! I wonder why Timothy Hutton couldn't find a lot of work lately? I guess if you don’t expect much and want to see a meaningless thriller, it would be better than spending the evening trimming toenails, which is why it deserves 2.
