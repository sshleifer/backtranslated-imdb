This classic tale of smoldering passion, filmed in 1997, reached its deserved legendary status as one of the greatest sagas on the screen of doomed and hopeless love. Pervasive, permanent and progressive magnetism between Judge Reinhold and the fact that her name is sure to make many viewers wince at the memory of their first love. A brilliant script hangs this nascent novel in front of an enthusiastic audience, stunned by the fact that abstract, almost expressionistic cinematography is deeply focused on the desires hidden beneath the surface, which are cast and flow between the principals. You can reduce sexual tension with a dim iron. <br /> <br /> A small bead of sweat on the tip of the nose catches bright sunlight and leaves no doubt as to its meaning. There are plenty of similar scenes, and bears watch again and again. As in the case of “Jane Eyre” and “Rebecca” (with which this masterpiece is so often compared), close-ups of the faces of the actors, when they experience the slow dawn of great love, which is not, will follow you forever. <br /> <br /> The classic soundtrack for RC with its creative and unique use of the solo synthesizer underlines the emotions that flow like a flowing crankcase. <br /> <br /> If I had any criticism at all, mentioning what I consider a minor flaw (and dared to risk the wrath of millions of fans who consider this classic so dear to their hearts), I would say that the distinctive feature of “Runaway Car” is its sense of increasing sexuality. Tension is briefly overcome by the road scene, which after repeated viewing seems a little too long (and perhaps even unnecessary?) to an eternal, bitter-sweet tale of love interrupted. <br /> <br /> I dare to promote what I perceive as the slightest flaw in this critically acclaimed triumph of modern cinema? "Citizen Kane" had his own "rosebud." ', Runaway Car' should have its own keyword. Perhaps the film could start with an extraordinary close-up of Judge Reinhold, who said something like “A car is the continuation of its owner!” And the rest of the storyline could be devoted to the analysis of each syllable, subtlety and nuance of this phrase. If this storyline had been completed, this film could have headed Titanic on Golden Globes that year, I am convinced. <br /> <br /> My only regret? That I did not read the novel first.
