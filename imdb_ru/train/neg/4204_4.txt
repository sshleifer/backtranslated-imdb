David Arquette is a young and naive guard at home. <br /> <br /> The seller is taken under the wing of Stanley Tucci. Arquette is the <br /> <br /> golden boy who won a big sale on her first call - to Keith's widow <br /> <br /> Capshow and her languid son Ryan Reynolds. Arkett is doing well; he appears in commercials for a security company and falls in love with Capshaw. <br /> <br /> Then Tucci and his right-wing woman, Mary McCormack, let him into a little secret - they sometimes rush into the homes of their clients <br /> <br /> to scare them and get their neighbors to buy Security systems from the company. Arquette decides not to intervene <br /> <br />, taking Capshaw to meet with his family, and walks through life <br /> <br /> with a stupid smile on his face. Then someone breaks into Capshaw's house and kills her and her son. Arquette suspects Tucci and sets up a series of traps, causing the gun of his boss head <br /> <br /> to be obtained when Tucci claims innocence. <br /> <br /> Based on the stage play, "The Alarmist" is not revealed well. The scenes <br /> <br /> in which Arquette takes Capshaw to meet with her parents are <br /> <br /> poorly played and not funny at all. They also disagree with the character <br /> <br /> that Capshaw plays as she gets drunk and <br /> <br /> sexually revealing stories to Arquette's mom Michael Learned. <br /> <br /> In addition to these scenes, Capshaw do little to give, but she does a lot with what she is given. <br /> <br /> Stanley Tucci, similar to Terry O'Quinn, is a riot as the owner of a security company <br /> <br />. He's a scumbag who really doesn't understand Arquette's moral disgust. However, when he turns into nagging <br /> <br /> after Arquette kidnaps him, he's funny. Mary <br /> <br /> McCormack seems to have been prepared for a larger role, but <br /> <br /> She basically stands and agrees with Tucci. Ryan Reynolds is too old to play a stupid teenager, but he is funny, especially <br /> <br /> tells his own sex story to Arquette. <br /> <br /> The script is soon moving from a romantic comedy to a dark comedy. <br /> <br /> Capshaw meets with her parents completely unmotivated, except that it gives her a reason to leave the city so that someone can <br /> <br /> rush into her home. Capshaw and Reynolds in the film are simply <br /> <br /> to give Arquette a reason to take revenge on Tucci. <br /> <br /> Arquette, who proved that he is a good actor, is simply terrible here. He <br /> <br /> relies on constipation that made him go through these ads <br /> <br /> AT & T, and he is not strong enough to create this weak <br /> <br /> movie around. In fact, Reynolds might be the best choice in this role. <br /> <br /> Dunsky's direction is good, nothing will get an Oscar so soon. <br /> <br /> Christophe Beck's light jazz score is reminiscent of the type of film noir that this film is trying to be, and it is really memorable. <br /> <br /> Despite the advantages, Arquette's failure as Leadership and the schizophrenic quality of the script immerse the film. I do not recommend it. <br /> <br /> This is a rating (R) for physical violence, violence with the use of firearms, some bleeding, <br /> <br /> strong profanity, brief nudity of a female, sexual content, strong sexual /> <br /> links and adult situations.
