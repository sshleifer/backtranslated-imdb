This ridiculous film offers a standard "hippie mentality" of the 1970s in the shell of a nut and is boring in the process. This is an attempt to rationalize the absurd marriages of young, innocent women with old sex fiends and washbasins. A naive young hippie, played by a mysterious (Kay Lenz) hitch, walks and sleeps with all the wrong guys, and then one day she meets the ridiculous (Holden), already in old age, drinking hard liquor and washed out as an actor and she decides that she is him If you think this is superficial, the whole film contains such scenes. She continues to say how much she "loves" him, and she only met him, she wears out and very quickly. I could not stop laughing throughout the entire film. Obviously, she just uses it as a food voucher, but the director is immature enough to think that we are going to buy, that some kind of love is actually happening. The disgusting scene where the two are naked and having sex, I had to move him forward because it almost inspired me to vomit. Throughout the film is distributed banal music proposal 70s. Avoid this if you can. Grade D.
