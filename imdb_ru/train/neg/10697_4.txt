First of all, I thought it would be disobedient to tell them that the story and the script belong to Preston Sturges. Sturges was one of the best Hollywood screenwriters until his talent died and he retired. However, it was not Preston Sturges, but Preston Sturges Jr. In fact, the story was based on the story of Robert Louis Stevenson's Bottle Demon. A good person takes possession of an evil object that will fulfill his every wish, but ultimately condemns him to hell. Everything is good. No one said that screenwriters should be original. Actors are usually quite competent, given the mediocre spelling they were supposed to translate on the screen. My biggest complaint comes with an ending. The hero thinks that he has found a way out of his dilemma, but is trying to solve the problem a little differently, trying to save an innocent person. At first it seems that it worked, but this corresponds to the code of the modern horror film, they feel that they must provide one last portion of horror at the very end of the film. This is a stupid agreement. The old horror films got along perfectly, allowing the hero to win at the end. There is nothing wrong with the fact that good triumphs over evil, regardless of what the current directors think. You can give viewers a good healthy panic and eventually make them feel happy. In fact, I think this is preferable.
