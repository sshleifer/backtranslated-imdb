Robert Colomb has two permanent jobs. He is known worldwide as a television reporter. Less well-known, but no less laborious are his exploits as a full-time philander. <br /> <br /> I saw Vivre pour Vivre dubbed in English with the title “Live for Life”. A little bit of life! Robert seems to have always had at least three women in her life: one lover at her exit, one in her way, and a deceived wife at home. Helps Robert is a liar. Among his most useful lies - "I will call you tomorrow" and "My work took longer than planned." He spends a lot of time and money on planes, trains and hotel rooms for his succession of connections. You wonder when this guy gets caught with his pants. <br /> <br /> Some may find his life exciting, but I thought it was tiring. His companions, including his wife Catherine, are all attractive and desirable women. But his lifestyle is so hectic, and he is so deceptive that you wonder if he enjoys it all. <br /> <br /> Adding to fatigue is a lot of shots that do not contribute to the development of the plot. There are extended sections without dialogue or in French only. We see documentaries about wars, torture and training of troops, alternating with live action. When Robert's flight returns from Africa, we wait and wait for the aircraft to land and arrive at the airport terminal. <br /> <br /> Annie Girardot is an outstanding performer of this film. She had the most interesting character, and she played it to perfection. It was also nice to see Candice Bergen at the beginning of her career. I can’t find fault with Yves Montand’s performance of what was basically an immoral ass. <br /> <br /> I liked some of the new techniques of Claude Lelouch. In the hotel room scene, the camera turns around the room, according to Robert and his mistress. We briefly notice them during each passage around the room. In another scene on the train, Robert lies on the top bunk, and his wife is on the bottom bunk. Robert gives his wife some important but sad news, but we hear only some of them because of the rumble of the train. I felt that his wife also could not assimilate every word because of the shocking nature of the news. I also liked the exciting safari scenes in Africa. The cinematography of these scenes and scenes in Amsterdam was excellent. <br /> <br /> I watched this film as part of a project at the Library of Congress. I called the project FIFTY: 50 famous films, forgotten for 50 years. As far as I can tell, this film, like the other forty-nine that I have identified, has not been on video, on television or in the United States since its initial release. In my opinion, it should be made available again. <br /> <br />
