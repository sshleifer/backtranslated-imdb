This is a pitiful word. Bad game, pathetic script, crazy dialogue and hip-hop music and fashion ... what the hell? The director of this film acts as badly as the film he made. If it took someone time and effort to redo everything, he might have had a chance. I bet the studios are still trying to figure out how they could screw up so much. <br /> <br /> The absolute best thing about this movie was Stacy Dash ... The Asian chick wasn't too bad either. These girls also carried the whole movie. If it were not for them, I would have destroyed my copy of this film. <br /> <br /> If someone from those who have not seen this yet and did not think, do not waste your time ... You will only regret it later.
