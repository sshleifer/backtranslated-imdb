I did not really hope for much when I went to look at it. After Mst3king fucking JasonX with some friends, I was hoping for a similar experience here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film took itself too seriously. Do I care about Jason's problems? Sorry, no. In any case, there is a legion of Ft13th films that cover this. In the end, he is a serial killer of the undead, I am not going to arouse his sympathy. <br /> <br /> Freddie was by far the most interesting aspect of the hallucination film, and what not? but, unfortunately, they were few and far between, and by the end of the film he had turned into a bad episode with the participation of celebrities, but not funny. <br /> <br />
