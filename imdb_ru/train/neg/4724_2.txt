This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I saw this at the premiere on SXSW and was extremely disappointed. The director knew little about John Lennon and even said this at the premiere. It's a drama, but people kept laughing at how disgusting the film was. This is never a good sign. The only saving benefits were Dominic Monaghan and Jason Leonard as roommates / neighbors in the Livian group. They were funny, while the rest of the film took itself too seriously. The trashy rejection of the Beatles' lyrics was just absurd. However, the soundtrack was excellent and was probably the best part of the film. If you're not one of those crazy, mad Dominic Monaghan fans, don't worry about it.
