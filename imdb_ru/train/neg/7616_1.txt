The good news is that the film was made based on the alleged Aztec myth and shows an unusually Aztec-American (if such a word exists) cast. The bad news is that he was dead at birth. <br /> <br /> If Ed Wood had retired and coached George Romaro in his classic “Night of the Living Dead”, this is what we could come up with. with. The "Legend of Diablo" is clearly suitable for any future resurrections of the "Mystical Theater of Science 3000"! <br /> <br /> I do not think that this film can even be called "B." The production figures are so terrible that I had the feeling that I was watching a long scene from a variety show or an 8 mm backyard film made by a group of schoolchildren. <br /> <br /> SOME SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The main storyline sounded interesting enough to lure me out. A rural Californian sheriff finds a box with an Aztec demon and casually brings it down on an unsuspecting community. His daughters, one hot and one home, team up with a man from the Federal Republic of Germany-Gringo and a priest to try to catch the demon in a cage. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, every zombie scene you’ve ever seen in previous movies about undead plays badly. These zombies are more like an army of Naughty Professors than like undead! Estimated infrared scenes in terms of the demon nothing special ?? and he / she / it seems to be strongly supportive (as opposed to turning forward). And the scene where the priest is luring the demon out of the cave in fast motion is ridiculous! It really is very similar to the comic effect, although I know that it is not! I kept expecting Benny Hill thematic music to begin playing, and the whole gang of zombies would start chasing the priest around the beach! <br /> <br /> Of course, the voice of Darth Vader / Field of Dreams, the agent calling the FBI becomes completely comic. Again, this was the case with most of this cheese ball! Robert Napton, the director and scriptwriter of the script, has to GET something for these efforts! (What about life-long blackball, such as Hollywood 10?) This one, as I now see, has a rating of 1.5 on a 10-point scale. I'm afraid it might be a little generous! <br /> <br /> What's good about this movie? Well, Lindsay Lofaso looks pretty hot, like the youngest daughter of a dead sheriff. That's probably why her homely older sister (Calvi Pabon) really ran away from home! Fred Estrado is quite decent as an FBI agent. Interestingly, Mario Soto, who played Rodriguez's father, is Mario Soto, who played for Cincinnati Reds? If so, he had to stick with baseball. In fact, they could not have done anything worse if they had left with the baseball theme and called it "Demons in the Outfield." <br /> <br /> If I find out that this was a college project. Cinema class, I will release an apology. This may be enough for B or even B +, if the team returned the college video camera back to campus in one piece! "The Blair Witch Project" proved that a cool, unassuming film can be made on a small amount. "The Legend of Diablo", however, did not seem to have any shoes OR to work! It was low-budget, low-skilled, low-income. The very last scene - and I mean the last 10 seconds of the film - is the ONLY bit soft creative or interesting moment. <br /> <br /> I paid $ 3.45 for rent. I could spend it on a hamburger!
