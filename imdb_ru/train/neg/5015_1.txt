As a film critic of several Dutch sites, I have to see a lot of films, and not all are very good. Some films are so bad that you wonâ€™t be surprised when they are filmed right on the video. With the taboo, I'm surprised that this is all videotaped. This is really low budget bad quality, poorly written trash. <br /> <br /> A group of young people plays taboos. They write down their most disgusting desire or deed, and later people are killed for their taboos. The question is, should we believe what we see? <br /> <br /> The film has an interesting plot twist, and I will not give it out here. But what could be interesting is to remain stupid, to act badly and for no reason. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors used to play bigger games, so why did they sign up for it? If you see it somewhere, try to dodge it. There is no logic in this film, no human sense of quality.
