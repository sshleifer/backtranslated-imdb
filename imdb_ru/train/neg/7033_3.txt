“Black Candles” is a rather tangled mess from the same director who brought us Vampires and, much later, Rest in the Pieces, among others ... I just mark the ones I saw. In any case, we have a couple making love, and then somewhere near a pin stands over a voodoo doll, and then it pierces it, and the man overturns. Not sure if it was good for any of them at that time. Let us go to the place where the man’s sister came to the house to investigate and hear the reading of the will or something like that, and, of course, everyone except her is occupied with something that, as it turned out, is worshiping the devil. It’s really hard to tell who is who during the movie, and sometimes it is a little confusing. Although, in order to revive the situation, there is a simulated scene of atrocities (I hope that it is modeled) with a black goat, will undoubtedly be a mob. Ugh. From time to time it repeats the "Rosemary baby", with the exception of the child, because the mistress always gives herbal tea to one woman, and the place smells of any unpleasant satanic herbs that also exist, because it continues to be noticed. However, herbs are not the only things that smell in this film. The end seems to be coming back to the beginning, and many viewers may wonder where they were in the middle. It’s not unsightly, it’s just not very good, and I think it all depends on what you like to see in the films, and there wasn’t much that could do something for me. 3 out of 10
