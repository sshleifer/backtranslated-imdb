CLASS OF '61 <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Stereo <br /> <br /> In 1861, students from West Point Academy are bursting except the beginning of the civil war. <br /> <br /> In the historical drama of Gregory Khoblit, the idea is obvious - virtuous people are blinded by conflict - although the production seems a bit unnatural, despite the authentic details of the period and the cast of talented beginners (Clive Owen, Christian Anholt, Josh Lucas, Andre Brauger, Laura Linney, etc.), whom Dan Futterman called a conscientious Southerner who took up arms to defend slavery, as a result of which he entered into direct conflict with his former northern friends, the film focuses so misinformed Although this is a sympathetic character, especially bold, the drama is otherwise flat and superficial, and Hoblitâ€™s leadership is more effective than inspired.
