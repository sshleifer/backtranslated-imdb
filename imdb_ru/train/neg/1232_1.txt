It says that a girl named Susan Montford wrote and shot this “film”. Not surprisingly, she has no other credits for her name for writing or directing. She made a serious professional mistake by choosing this as her career. This is one of the worst human creations of this millennium. <br /> <br /> The principal thing in this film, besides the ridiculous story about a woman running away from four weak thugs, is the blatant and total absence of LOGIC. . <br /> <br /> ** After she leaves the shopping center, she is approached by four thugs who surround her. Tell me, what kind of woman will aggressively SHOW a potential malefactor, being surrounded, and verbally insult them? I do not mean after the attack has already begun, because then, of course, it is perfectly normal for someone to fight back. But she pushed this guy and raised him to the next level. No woman would have done this if she had 1) had no weapon, 2) was not sure that she knew that the backup was very close, and therefore she was relatively harmless, or 3) the attackers were so young and weak that sure of yourself. she can take them. None of this is applicable in this situation, so she just behaved like someone who asks to be raped or robbed. And, by the way, when the guard approached, as soon as he approached Kim Basinger, for some reason did he not immediately run to him for help or shout? <br /> <br /> ** When she leaves after a guard has been shot in the head, she enters a deserted part of the city and falls. She had a good three-minute advantage over the pursuers, instead of just running on foot in a diagonal direction behind the houses and climbing fences and, continuing, she took out her red tool box and began to fiddle with the hood. I understand that she was trying to fix her car, but she should have run. <br /> <br /> (I didn’t even mean that this is a chronological summary of the film, because I hate the people who do it in their reviews, but it turned out that there is something in each main sequence of this film so stupid that I have to comment on this). <br /> <br /> ** Why does she have to carry the loud Red Toolbox when she is trying to sneak off in the dark? When she is caught, one of the jokers demands that she open the toolbox. First, she resists, then eventually opens it. And gets a wrench. This scene here is so rich in subtle shades of complete failure of the dramatic effect that I have to break it, this is one of the dumbest scenes in the whole film. When she is asked to open the box, she resists at first, as if she was planning to somehow force one of the thugs to open it with anger after she didn’t open it, just like someone in an action movie had some a device that the enemy requires from this person to touch / push / open / manipulate, and as soon as this hero refuses to open it, the enemy seizes this device only so that this device automatically dispenses the chemical substance / shoots him in the face / rendering him unconscious, that was the plan of the hero all the time. It seems that this is exactly what they were trying to do with Kim Basinger here, as she abruptly opens the tool box and quickly removes the wrench and sends one of the thugs, and somehow leaves him and the three other thugs. <br /> ** In the rest of the film, basically, you see this wife from a suburban home, sneaking through the woods and carrying her red tool box, taking out various tools used as weapons to KILL HIS OFFSERS . <br /> ** When she ran away, how did she eventually move back to where the thugs were? I think it was a scene where they had a loud radio in honor of the dead dude. She somehow crept up to them when I thought she was leaving them. <br /> <br /> ** Finally, this whole premise is so weak, because the reason why it is being pursued in the first place is because of the thugs. In the future, she witnessed the murder they committed against the security officer. earlier, and so they felt they should have killed her. So funny. As one of the thugs even said, they could simply leave the city and return to that city from which they left, no one saw them, anyway, and she probably did not receive a license plate. Even if these opportunities do not work in their favor, how does raising hell and hunting someone to kill him increase your chances of getting away with the initial murder?
