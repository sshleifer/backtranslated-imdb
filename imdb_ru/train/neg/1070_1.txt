I saw some bad movies (Austin Powers - “The Spy Who Seduced Me,” “Batman Forever,”), but this film is so terrible, so boring, that I went half the way and could not look at the others. A pity. What would not have happened if we had such a talent as Kenneth Brande, Embeth Devitz and Robert Duval, as well as the story of John Grisham? Brana is an eminent lawyer who has one evening with Davitts. Her father (Duval) is a psychopath who hung his cat, etc., D., Etc. Therefore, Brana sent him to a psychiatric hospital, and he quickly ran away. Somehow (I could not understand how) Robert Downey Jr., Daryl Hanna, Famke Janssen and Tom Berenguer are all mixed up in a story that moves slower than stationary ones. I wanted it, and, being a big fan of Grisham, I read everything about this film, and I (by stupidity) expected something interesting. Honestly, this is the worst movie I have seen to date, and I would like to get my money back. * outside *****.
