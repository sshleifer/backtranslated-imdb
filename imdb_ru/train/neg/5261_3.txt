I have read some other comments, and I have to agree with those that did not receive the ending. I thought everything was going pretty well .. until the end. It made your mind work, and then spit. I have no idea what happened in the last couple of minutes of the film, except for a complete mess. Itâ€™s as if they ran out of money to come up with a good ending to improvise. First, they had a mysterious thing that made people disappear, then they had a guy talking about Zone 51 (which makes you think of aliens), then, after they went shit. I thought that the actors and actresses coped well, the script just got messed up. In any case, if you watch this movie, be prepared to give up at the end.
