Besides all this, this movie was terrible. I expected the film to be more farcical than anything else. Instead, the filmmakers tried to make a serious horror thriller / movie, and they completely missed. There were only a few good pieces and a couple of good lines from Samuel Jackson. In addition, it was a lot of blood and a few poorly animated snakes. All the jokes on the Internet were much better than the movie itself. Now that the movie is really out, I hope this joke will die. Do not waste your time or money on this piece of overly unwound garbage. If you are looking for something funny and interesting, just go to the blog "Snake".
