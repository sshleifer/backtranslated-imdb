In the future, 1985, a government committee headed by Howard Hesseman holds hearings on the first network without censorship on television. They try programming it, which plays a series of scenes. I can name good “skit” films on the one hand, without using my thumb. “Amazon on the Moon”, “Fried Kentucky Film”, “The Meaning of Life” and “Mr. Mike Mondo's Video”. Notice how I didn’t mention "Tunnel Vision"? The reason for this is that this “film” is death in cinematic form. None of the parodies are even funny or even slightly clever. From the point of view of cinematographers, some great stupidity is needed in order not to even laugh at me. <br /> <br /> My rating: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dody Dorn becomes a complete frontal
