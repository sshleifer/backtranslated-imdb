I stopped looking lost in this episode because I thought that the deaths of Ana-Lucia and Libby were excessive and really depressing. Then I found out that they kept Libby close by to just die in the next episode! G! I can't handle it. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this show in the first season, but it definitely diminished in the second season, and I find annoying Jack and Locke’s little religious enmity. The death of the characters Rodriguez and Vatros was the last straw! <br /> <br /> I put this episode at 4/10, because this is the end of my viewing of the previously magnificent TV series, created by the legend Alias ​​J.J. Abrams. I hope his series will improve on this in the future.
