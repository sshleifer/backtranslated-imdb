Despite the fact that this is a 2001 film, this trend is in the art-house of the 90s, which was considered “old” and obsolete several years ago. Cheesy cuts and effects were painful to watch. The script is quite decent, and several scenes really fascinated me (for example, when a taxi driver leads her to the bridge at night). But the storyline with the detective, whose sister committed suicide and how he was obsessed with suicide, was just terrible. The performance of the actor who plays the married boy, Selma Blair, really bothered me. I still watched it all, which is rare for a random view, what kind of movie is it that you just see on TV and decide to watch it.
