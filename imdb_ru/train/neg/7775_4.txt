I am not familiar with the trilogy, but came across this movie last night on Showtime. The film looked very well done using scenography and cinematography, but the script was stilted and wooden. The action was rather bad - they believed that two women were in good order. You never believed what the actors said. There were stereotypes - the bible knocking of the Rev. without a hint of a nuance, an authoritative captain, a hot soldier, etc. I regret that, based on these shortcomings, I immediately identified him as a Canadian, not knowing that he was - Canadian Telefilm and loans were given away. I know that I'm a terrible person. <br /> <br /> I may have missed something at the beginning, but the hostility towards girls is never explained. Here they were besieged in the fort by werewolves, and men waste time and effort, two young women are brutally beast. FOCUS people. Behind your walls is a much more difficult situation than whether these girls are lesbians - this is just my conclusion about the hostility aimed at them. If they can aim and fire a pistol, you can put up with them. The question of their "immortal soul" can be resolved later. <br /> <br /> Besides, I suppose this applies to the rest of the trilogy, should these girls be protagonists? One of them killed an Indian guy at the end who saved one of their lives. I believe that one is just a victim of her condition, which cannot be blamed for her actions, and the other is just a killer who does not deserve her happy ending.
