This release of Masters of Horror was terrible. Obviously, Mr. Carpenter needs to learn something about rhythm and decent, believable dialogue. There were times when I literally screamed at the TV to make something happen. He may think that he creates uncertainty, but Carpenter should cut off this overly simplistic, overly simplified musical account of his (or his son) and promote the action a little. How many times did the girl say, “Oh no, I can't have this baby!” And “Oh, no, that's it”? Carpenter takes elements from much better films (“The Attack on the 13th Plot” and “Things”) and throws them here, as if we should recognize and appreciate his corporate identity. What is missing here is genuine tension and energy. As if he is moaning during the film making process. <br /> <br /> To create the best Carpenter films, stick to proven classics — Things, Halloween, and They Live. For the best masters of horror, check out my personal favorites: Family, Jennifer and Dreams in the House of Witches.
