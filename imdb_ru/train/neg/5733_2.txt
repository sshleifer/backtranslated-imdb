just watched it, me and my best half could not believe how terrible and bad it was. If someone thinks it's good, then you should be easy. I actually gave up the night to watch it, it was all done before. IE. I remember the hostel, but at least it did not make you flinch from a bad game and the lack of a storyline, the same old things that were rethought, I read so much about this movie that I even recommended it to my friends OK! no more than horror, horror, horror or disgust, as in the usual "scary film", please do not worry about this film. get mary poppins. now it's scary! I'm leaving now, go to the cinema and see something worse than this, maybe little Miss Sunny
