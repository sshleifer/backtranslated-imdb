I can't help but laugh at people who praise this show as heartbreaking and twitchy. On the one hand, it is completely unrealistic that these people will lead an ideal life after their new home. <br /> <br /> How can these families afford to keep these new megalopolises? What about their poor neighbors? Property tax must increase after this happens. Also, the noise will annoy me. <br /> <br /> Secondly, how excessive can a reality show be? It's practically the same recurring stuff week after week. We meet a suffering family, they repair the house, then surprise the family, and everyone breaks up the Kleenex boxes. <br /> <br /> Not to mention how boring the repair part is. The only interesting part of the show is to see what the house looks like, but even this segment is destroyed by fake confessional and constant sobs. <br /> <br /> "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is a show that pretends to be cordial, but it does not work. Skip this. If you like reality shows, Survivor is much better and more touching.
