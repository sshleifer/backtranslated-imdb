I had no expectations, except that I was entertained for 90 minutes, and this is exactly what I was. <br /> <br /> Of course, it was polite, of course, some of the dialogues were not ideal, of course the special effects "were a bit deceptive. That is why I liked the film so much. It is perfect for this genre of 70s horror classics. < br /> <br /> Talent has to start with something that concerns the actors and the crew, and what material is better to hone your skills on what it is. <br /> <br /> I look forward to another film from these producers and directors.
