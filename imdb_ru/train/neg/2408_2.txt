This film is about a young scientist who creates a serum that revives the dead. He first uses it on his brother when he is shot in the car. Then his brother infects other gang members. In some scenes, zombies walk very slowly, while in others they run pretty fast, which does not make much sense. Acting is mediocre, but the story does not help the film. Makeup consists of blood on the face of a zombie. The budget of this film, I am sure, was very limited. I believe that the film could have been made better if the story were more original and with a better budget. If you don't want to see a good zombie movie, don't watch this.
