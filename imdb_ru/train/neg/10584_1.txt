The only quality of this film is that it was bad enough to be comedic. Everything in this movie looks like the porn industry falling out. In fact, I have seen better acting in low budget porn. I, although I actually rented some gay porn after this classic scene: Jim: Watch ass Nick: You watch yours (together): I won't leave you <br /> <br /> The first sequence of actions shows how ! Awful production, but it's really funny: the good guys have a transformer weapon! In one scene, they all have fake HK MP5 slot machines. Next scene, replica AK-47! And then, to complete all this, they do some weapon exchange between scenes with a pair of M-16 !! I think that they had a budget deficit for weapons, not enough to go between the good guys and the bad guys. The fighting scenes are poorly coordinated and false as all hell. You must remove the pin / spoon from the grenade so that it explodes on its own. You can not launch any missile launched into the shoulder when traveling in a helicopter. The weapon you throw away does not reappear. When a pistol has no bullets, throwing it is still pretty stupid. If you do not know how to recharge them. Large slow trucks driving first gear create awkward scenes. I really can not believe that such films are really made. This film would be funny on nitrous oxide or maybe just drunk.
