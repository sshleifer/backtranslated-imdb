Flat characters that you do not need and will never care. An exciting field dialogue. No turns (they think they are, but if you didn't understand it in about 40 minutes, you are not too smart). Many well-known actors in the roles and performances, which, fortunately for all participants, will be forgotten as soon as the final credits end. <br /> <br /> I don’t mind “slow” movies, but they have to go somewhere. This is not true. <br /> <br /> The plot wasn’t what made this movie right on DVD, it’s just a pretty convenient excuse to try and kindle some fake controversy. <br /> 37 (!) Ten (10) ratings at the time of writing should be from people involved in production.
