This is the film that wants to be good, but sucks. First, what the hell are these punks trying to do with the school? I think the children do not seem to realize the seriousness of the situation. The guy Decker tells the girl that they are under his responsibility when she asks why he wants to come back for them, but right after that he gives the gun to the dude on the wheelchair and wants him to go alone to repair the telephone line. Where is the responsibility there? I understand that poor actors have to pay for food, but why not just give them the money they need to make such a stupid film, or donate this money to charity. Oh yes, and none of them know how to aim. Stupid punk guy shoots in the cafeteria nowhere like crazy. They all want to look professional, but they all suck. I also do not believe that there is no emergency exit at school, children try several doors, but they are all locked. What happens if there is a fire, and the guard Dumasse is dead? It is forbidden not to have an emergency exit to school. In any case, there is still something to say, but it will be too long. I spent some time in my life to watch shit.
