I think Philip Kaufman read the version of Kundera's novel “Memoirs”, and then started making this film. Well, of course, it will not have the beat of the original. Kundera's novels are great because of his manipulation of the narrative concept, his ability to go in and out of the stories he builds. This movie did not even try! The sequence of one Theresa’s dream, so important to the atmosphere of the book, has been reworked and has no meaning. In addition, and perhaps the less important point, Daniel Day-Lewis is very similar to Ben Stiller in this (I know this is not an entirely valid complaint, but hey). A great example of Hollywood exquisite literature.
