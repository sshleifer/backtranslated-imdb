I am at a distinct disadvantage. I have not seen the first two films in this series, although I have seen many of Larry Cohenâ€™s films. Fans of the series, it seems, believe that this is a good movie. Judged by itself, it was pretty boring. <br /> <br /> You can never really take a good look at the face of a police maniac (Robert Z'Dar), but what I saw was rather gloomy. Death scenes seem to be arranged to eat most of the film, so as not to give any thrill. Maybe if I saw the uncut version of the NC-17, I would be more impressed. <br /> <br /> The final chase of the car with Z'Dar, Caitlin Dulani and Robert Davy was pretty tense. the best part of the movie.
