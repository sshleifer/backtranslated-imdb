I thought the movie was a bad documentary. Nothing significant has been discussed. It seemed, cheaper ideas and did not give anything new. In the film, there was no surprise, no romance, or something that could really lead to science. Most scientists looked "stereotypical" and sometimes strange. The woman said that her rewards did not matter much, only to the children who were helped. She said this after a 10-minute scene, where she explained all her awards. We play "modest scientist", right? “Equations are dancing in my head,” said another. I do not understand how this explains something to us. This did not cover the significant influence of science on our culture. Science policy was barely affected. <br /> <br /> A good movie for children 10-14 years old. In addition, I felt that it was boring and unusual. <br /> <br /> 4/10
