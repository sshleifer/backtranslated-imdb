Elephants Dream was to become the flagship project of the open source community. And although in the concept it was a very interesting idea, in fact it failed miserably. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully rendered, which is probably the only saving factor. However, a huge problem for them is a huge excessiveness of light. It's terrible, although I think it helps to give the film a fabulous quality. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting a terrible voice acting. While the voice actor Proog is at least semi-competent, the voice actor Emo is terrible. I think when you have a budget of zero, you cannot afford to hire real actors. It seems to me that they hired one of the animators to make his voice. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is really not going anywhere. It seems to me that this is more like a “see what we can do” movie than a real movie. The plot goes nowhere and makes it impossible to show any interesting point. It seems that the entire film is made as a pretext for creating interesting areas. <br /> <br /> In general, it should be downloaded from the official site, but do not expect anything other than beautiful graphics.
