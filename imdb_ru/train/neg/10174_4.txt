I saw it in 1994, when it was finally released. Apparently, due to the fact that the photos of Orion were bankrupt, I think the film was not released a couple of years ago. <br /> <br /> I have trouble remembering the details, because I havenâ€™t seen them for a long time, but I remember it as a very boring movie. I kept arguing whether to get out of it. The store was not at all interesting or attractive. There was a 3rd year of emulation of America graffiti. <br /> <br /> None of the presentations is worth a look. One of the biggest disappointments since the reviewer of the local newspaper gave him a high rating.
