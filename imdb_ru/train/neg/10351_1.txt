This film barely followed the plot line of the film. All the exciting moments in the book did not even exist in the film. They ended up turning it into a fun story to “crush” the Disney movie between Meg and Calvin. It was so bad that the role was to be played by Hillary Duff or one of them. This film was nothing more than an insult to the intellect and mysticism of the book. I can't believe Disney could even get away with doing such a cheap, basic performance. If you have ever read a book, I think you would agree that it could easily be turned into the movie “The Lord of the Rings.” This film should never have used the name "Wrinkle in Time". Badly done.
