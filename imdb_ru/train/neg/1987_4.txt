It was a great idea, and the landscape was beautiful, but thatâ€™s it. It seemed that the dim Set It Off meets the West. The plot hardly had any meaning. There were so many characters and not enough time to develop their personality. Also, unnecessary things could happen that were not related to the plot and did not help advance the story further. There were also long empty moments when the plot could be explored, but used for silence or unnecessary talk. The script should have made more sense than directing. I had a huge question mark on my head when I watched this movie. But the casting was great, in my opinion. If you only look at eye candy, then this film is for you.
