Before I begin, I _love_ Eddie Izzard. I think he is one of the funniest dreams today. Perhaps this means that I enter this with too high expectations, but I just did not find Eddie funny in this campaign. <br /> <br /> I think the main problem is that Eddie is trying too hard to be Eddie. Everyone knows him as a completely inappropriate comic, and we all love him for it. But in the Circle, he seems to be going to no longer matter than funny, and has completely lost me in some places. He covered many of the topics he touches before - I even think I learned a few reworked jokes there. <br /> <br /> If you buy a DVD, youâ€™ll see a behind-the-scenes look at the Eddie tour. (interesting in places, but not very funny) and the French version of one of his shows. The end fans will like to see Eddie in another language, but the comedy with subtitles is not very funny. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Eddie, then you have already received it or are going to buy everything I say. If you just pass by, buy Glorious or Dressed to Kill - you will not be disappointed. With the Circle, you probably will.
