Let me start by reading a few reviews before making this film and knowing what to expect. However, I was surprised how bad it was. <br /> <br /> I’m a big fan of a werewolf, and I’m used to forgiving a lot when I watch it. Most of them have low-quality game effects, a bad game and weak plot lines (at best paraphrased from earlier films). So far, with the exception of some later films Howl, this is the worst of all. <br /> <br /> First, the story. He has been quoted several times in reviews on this site, so I will not go into details. However, it is completely obvious that the author (s) had absolutely nothing to do with lycanthropic monsters. As often happens when a horror film gives a writer who considers himself “above” such a fare, they try to come up with a new round of werewolf myths. This is good, but the non-horror lover who tries to do this usually neglects the intelligence and sophistication of the horror audience and ends up recording them. The plot resembles a travesty of werewolf films, and the events depicted just sound so fake that I felt that my intellect had been seriously insulted. For example, television news footage is never moved away from the reporter to approach someone in the crowd behind them. Give the characters and the audience credit for finding the bad guy on stage without using a flashing neon sign. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> As regards effects, I have NEVER seen a less believable werewolf. I would be happy with Lon Cheney the youngest in crepe hair. The beast they used is very similar to ... well, like a guy in a cheap rubber suit with glued hair and really awful animatronics. And I know that many people have already criticized CG, but, my God, that was terrible. One scene shows how a woman changes, and begins with a completely computerized version of the actress, naked, but for some reason without nipples. My first thought was: “Hey, why does one of the characters from ReBoot turn into a silly looking werewolf?” <br /> <br /> In any case, I like to look for positives in any film, and there were few. The cinematography was tolerable (the film was shot entirely digital, which is interesting), and some performances were not terrible. It was also interesting to see Tippi Hedron as the world's best-built fictional homeless woman and Kane Hodder as the bad guy. In addition, the Yellow Mighty Ranger matured and ... well, hell. And if you're looking for skin, there are some pretty tasty examples. This concludes the story of the males and pigs. <br /> <br /> In general, if you want a good movie about werewolves, try American American Werewolf in London, the original Howl, Dog Soldiers, or even Wolfen (although he has more wolves, what it was). If you are the most complete lycanthrope, then take the gander. Otherwise, skip this one.
