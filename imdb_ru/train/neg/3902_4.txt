This is truly a divine adaptation of the Jane Austen novel. Compared to the American version with Ginneth Paltrow, the script was written to resemble a book as much as possible. But the game was terrible. Apart from Kate Beckinsale, who, I think, was a real likeness of Emma in the book, all the other actors tried too hard. Mark Strong was not the "gentleman" he was meant to be. He was often rude and offensive, had no feelings, and throughout the film you could not see how his love “grows” for Emma. This had a terrible effect on Kate Beckinsale, who seemed to be trying to “regain” her leading role as well as that of her partner. Moreover, there was no chemistry between the actors. Harriet Smith, played by Samantha Morton, seemed to have no real affection for Mr. Elton, played by Dominic Rowan. Therefore, she did not seem overwhelmed with grief, as she was portrayed in the book. The movie settings are too bad. Costumes all the more. I would suggest that Emma Woodhouse will dress more fashionably and elegantly than she is here. The ending is also too long. Well, that looks like the end of a book, but it's a killer ending for a movie. And again I do not see the feeling of happiness in Mr. Kaintley’s face. In conclusion, I believed that this adaptation was true to the book, but with bad actors. It seemed that the film was made without any budget at all. I would prefer to see a “lighter” version with Paltrow and Northam, even if it was clear that it was done to be a “blockbuster” than to watch how these actors (with the exception of good Olivia Williams and better Kate Beckinsale) destroy the whole script.
