I saw this movie in my class movie. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this. I entered it with an open mind, and was even a little excited. I really like Ed Norton and Evan Rachel Wood, and the rest of the cast was interesting. I just never had a connection with this movie. The game was great, the cinematography was interesting, but the storyline, or rather its absence, was a problem. There was no central, binding theme with the film. Was it a romance between Norton and Wood? Well, no, not really. Was it a western? View, but no. I'm all in the corners of the movie, I recently watched "Brick" and I really liked it, but the place where this movie appeared was too far away. It was so strange, and if I didnâ€™t have to sit through the whole film, I would go out. The letter was not terrible, but it was just ubiquitous. By the time this movie ended, I was just terribly embarrassed and wanted it to end earlier. There was something in this film that did not find a response, I understand more unusual films, such as Fight Club, but I just did not care about the characters.
