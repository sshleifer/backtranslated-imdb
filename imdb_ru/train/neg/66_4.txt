I think that this film attracted me, both because of the plot and the lead actor, so I gave him a chance from director Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers). Basically, Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger) was created by the police, especially Superintendent Francis Hare (Jeffrey Rush), he is forced to go on the run, forming a gang and oppose them in order to clear his own names and the names of his family. This is really all I can say about the story, because I did not pay the closest attention, to be honest. Also starring Orlando Bloom in the role of Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts in the role of Julia Cook, Lawrence Quinlan as Dan Kelly, Philip Barantini as Steve Hart, Joel Edgerton as Sherritt Aaron Kiri Paramore as Constable Fitzpatrick, Kerry Condon as Kate Kelly, Emily Browning as Grace Kelly and Rachel Griffiths as Susan Scott. Ledger makes a pretty good performance, despite the fact that it's worth it, and the film does have its own attractive moments, especially with a shootout at the end, but I can't say that I liked it because I didn't look at all of it. , Good!
