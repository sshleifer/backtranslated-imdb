I see a lot of movies. Saw the original wargames many years ago and loved it. Computers that are still a “big mystery” for most of us, and the film is convincing in its own way. <br /> <br /> This one, however, looks like a low-budget special Wednesday evening. Total crap, from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The plot is so weak that you won’t believe until you see the movie (which I would not recommend first). I cannot point out one actor who really did a good job in this film. But hey, with this scenario, I would be surprised if someone could do a good job playing. A lot of cliché scenes. CGI looks like it was taken from version 86 of the year. <br /> <br /> No, I have a bad mood, I just write about it. DO NOT watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to spend on crap movies.
