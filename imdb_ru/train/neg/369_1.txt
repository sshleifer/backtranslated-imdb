I almost called HBO and demanded my money back in a month just because they were broadcasting this film. I can just see the filmmakers sitting around and saying, “Well, we need to come up with something that looks like Home Alone, only we add a lot of money for the child, hire actors at reduced rates and, oh, yes, we will make it a lot less funny! "<br /> <br /> Well, maybe not the last part, but this is basically what you got here. You shouldn't even see if someone else rents it. And how is the film for children? Forget it I would not allow my children to see it, not necessarily because of bad taste jokes, but because I would not like them to say: “What did you think, showing us this lame piece of garbage, dad?!?!”
