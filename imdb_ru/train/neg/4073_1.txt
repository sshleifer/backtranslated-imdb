NO SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> I love horror movies, but this must have been the worst attempt to do. Calling it a “movie” is also a stretch. This “random clips are obviously fake and tasteless, violent and ugly, women trying to act, sexually edited, poorly together” are not worth watching. <br /> <Watching is about as interesting as watching occasional family holiday photos, and it’s about the same quality you expect when you send your ten-year-old son into the forest with a new video camera and tell him to make a film. <br /> <br /> Awful.
