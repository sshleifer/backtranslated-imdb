I thought it wasn’t the best replay episode I’ve ever seen (although my viewing partner gave me a napkin waiting for Brendan Fraser’s moment ... * sigh *). It was nice to see Cox beyond the ever-fragile “state of coxism” that he is these days, at least for a short time. I also liked to try to place the episodes, including the length of the character's hair (or height, in the case of JD) and the youth of the earliest episodes. I can also see how Zach can be well on his way to Chevy Chase / or is it Matthew Perry? chemical slip caused by a fall (already confirmed on Conan). A quick note: the song (now stuck in my head) from a dance set caused by a janitor was Martin Sexton's Diner.
