And a few more no on top of that. Voodoo Academy is without doubt the least ambitious film of all time. What exactly is he trying to do? Tell me a story? Obviously not; as already mentioned, most of them are just legal guys rubbing themselves. Could this be an attempt at subversive homoeroticism? Well, maybe, if not for the fact that it never goes beyond the most innocuous and non-threatening forms of male contact. (Fortunately, it is repeated about eighty thousand times.) Well, this is a kind of horror film; is it trying to scare us? No, unless the director intended to do so because of the complete boredom and meaninglessness of his “work”. <br /> <br /> I never in my life enjoyed a movie less. This is the most boring and unnecessary thing I've ever seen. It's like Voodoo Academy takes the genres of horror films, zombies and gays, puts them in a coffee grinder, then passes them through a coffee filter - only instead of being a coffee filter that filters coffee beans, does it take away everything vital, spicy or how -or interesting way. The result is 74 minutes of the film, as exciting as a glass of warm water - only without the ability to moisten you after a 10-day rampage of gin that will inevitably happen to you if you watch this filthy human effort.
