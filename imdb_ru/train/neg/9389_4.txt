According to IMDb, as well as to any other website that conducts the review; this “thing” has no director. Well, that will surely explain a lot! Just a bunch of people who got together to remove some of the perverted sequences of porn and throw in the ultra-thin plot about the devils worshiping and women of sacrifice inside the walls of a secluded hospital. Hardgore is a prime example of the completely insane trash of the 70s, as it is truly made with minimal production costs and an inspiring scenario. Horror films about satanic cults were very popular in the early 70s and pornography as well, so why not combine the two? Here we have a simplified story about a young nympho girl who went to a psychiatric hospital, and from the very first night she was dragged into a network of drugs, psychedelic orgies, rape, torture and dildo-actions. Indeed, a lot of dildo. A friendly lesbian nurse tries to warn her, but her throat was cut even that night. Aspects of horror are really poorly worked out, ranging from the ridiculously not terrible masks of Satan to the fierce attacks on severed penises. Photography and acting skills are almost unbearably amateurish, but what do you expect from the film, which shots, run the sperm, and talking amputated male reproductive organs? Justin Lynn's leading lady is a pretty pretty girl with a gorgeous body, but most of her colleagues (men and women) are disgusting and over-trimmed dudes.
