Lulu (Louise Brooks) works as a typist and is missing something in her life. She participates in the Miss France competition against the wishes of her boyfriend Andre (Georges Charlia), and she wins. She goes to Miss Europe, leaving her boyfriend behind. She wins again, but returns home to Andre, because he asked her about it. After returning together, her life again becomes mundane, so one night she writes him a note and leaves to experience the glory that awaits her as Miss Europe.

Subsequently, a limited dialogue was added, and it is very fake. The actors are fine, having in mind that this is a silent film. The best part of the film comes at the end, but the story goes on too long. After seeing this, I'm not quite sure what happened to Louise Brooks's appearance â€” she has a terrible hairstyle that makes her face look fat. I don't need to watch this again.
