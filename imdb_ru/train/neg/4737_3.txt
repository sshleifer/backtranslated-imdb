I liked the first movie, Azumi. I saw Ms. Wato in many of her television appearances, and I saw my large share of samurai and ninja films. I have to say that this film turned out to be much weaker than I expected. <br /> <br /> Given the cast of the film and its production in Azumi, they could handle this movie much better. , but instead he was slow, fooling around in pieces and sprinkling a very bad, flimsy and wooden game. <br /> <br /> When they bother to refer to the first film, they made it rather loose and weak. In Azumi, the title character is the best of a group of excellent killers. In Azumi-2, it seems somewhat diminished and less impressive. <br /> <br /> This is not to say that it was a complete loss. There were several decent fighting scenes and several supernatural characters. Unfortunately, the film suffers as a whole from the simple fact that Shusuke Kaneko and Yoshiaki Kawajiri are not Ryuhei Kitamura and Isao Kiriyama. The last two really captured the feeling of "manga" in their script, while the first did not "understand."
