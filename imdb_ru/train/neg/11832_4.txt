From the creators of Shrek ???????? .. Well, it caught my attention. <br /> <br /> Well, the creators of Shrek also made Madagascar. Madagascar was half as good as Shrek. <br /> <br /> And now, “Removed from the face” is half worse than “Madagascar”. <br /> <br /> This means that swept away from the face is no good. The animation and all these special effects were very good, but the film was not. <br /> <br /> The story of this film was intended only for children. This is seriously not for adults to really love this film. <br /> <br /> But there were a lot of jokes meant for adults. I bet the kids don't get the joke. <br /> <br /> Despite this, I do not like this click. <br /> <br /> I am completely disappointed. 4/10
