and rent a GOOD horror movie. It seems that the writer had never seen a horror movie before and did not realize that everything he wrote was hatched and beaten, and in films such as Scream and Scary Movie, it was parodied to perfection. <br /> <br /> Between the scary bits is the most banal and boring dialogue ever written. Stupid "we go to prom" trash. I wanted to rip out my ears. Honestly, the dialogue in The Hills is better. <br /> <br /> There was no need to make this film. The leading lady is not interested, and I kept thinking: “She? True? Is the guy obsessed with her? Really? ”<br /> <br /> All characters behave foolishly, including the police. (Cover the place in teams of 2 people! Front and back! Not a single sleepy policeman sits in his car with the window down, just expecting his throat to be cut.) <br /> <br /> The serial killer just fancies himself to kill everyone whoever he wants, without the slightest problem. There is no resistance from the victims (or doors). No one has any protection or the slightest idea to fight back (or break the security lock on the door of the hotel room). People resemble mentally retarded sheep. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you're a fan of blood, you too will be disappointed. All murders are stored off-screen and, hmm, made with taste. (So, dick for you!) <br /> <br /> None of the killings is the slightest interesting. In most cases, they have already occurred by the time we find out. <br /> <br /> The only missing cliche was a cat that always appears in such films. "Oh, kitty! You scared me! I thought you were a killer - AIIEEEE!" <br /> <br /> And then, at the end, when the killer is time to die - well, let's say, this is the easiest and most obvious choice. Snore. <br /> <br /> The audience scoffed and talked all the time on the screen. It was too stupid to believe, and not so scary. Don't encourage this kind of lazy filmmaking. <br /> <br /> (By the way, there is no coronation of a graduation king or queen. There is no tiara. There is no bucket of blood.) <Br /> <br /> So save your money and rent a “Carrie”, “Friday 13th, Halloween, Scream or Scary Movie (any of them) to get a good fright with some original twists.
