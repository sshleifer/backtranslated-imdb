I agree with everything that people have said about it, but I have to add that the soundtrack is probably the worst I've ever heard in my whole life! There are real vocals at a time when you should listen to the performances of the actors! And the vocals are similar to the Broadway version of Danzig singing: “Darkness of the forest! O darkness of a dark, dark forest! ”Or something else that does not threaten. The singer has a terrible vibrato, and he was recorded with a high-frequency microphone through several synthesized strings and fake drum beats. It's horrible!! <br /> <br /> Yes, men lead terribly. Like women. This one bad case of gender stereotypes is so bad! Everything they say revolves around being a man or a woman, simply reproducing stereotypes to the maximum. I'm sick. Soooo boring !!! <br /> <br /> Children were so echoing in their lines that you could not understand them. And why do ghost children always have cute little bows in their hair, beautiful blue dresses and long hair? Do ghost boys always wear uncut pants with cute shiny blond hair? Not scary - stupid. <br /> <br /> Papa’s face was too spotless and clean to be the face of a man living in a cave. Good beard and bangs, na. Did you cut them yourself with a knife or stroll through the city and go to the salon? <br /> <br /> Stupid movie.
