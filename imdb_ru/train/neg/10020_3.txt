Vashaya Krishna Acharya's “Tashan” is an over-promoted, stylized product. Of course, this is one of the most stylish films, but when it comes to content, even the masses will refuse it. What for? The screenplay is as much amateur as that of a two-year-old child. The screenplay is king; without a good script, even the greatest director of all time cannot do anything. Tashan is producing the most successful advertising banner, Yash Raj Films and Mega Stars. But nothing in the world can save you if your script is soft. Thumbs down! <br /> <br /> Performances: Anil Kapoor, veteran actor. But how could he arrange such a role? Akshay Kumar is a great actor, in fact he is the only saving grace. Karina Kapoor has never looked so hot. She looks amazing and leaves you all up. Saif Ali Khan doesn't get it here. Sanjay Misra, Manoj Fava and Yashpal Sharma are in vain. <br /> <br /> “Tashan” is a boring movie. The failure of films at the box office, if you stay away.
