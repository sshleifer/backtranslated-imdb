This bomb is just one “explosion” after another, without humor and only absurd situations. Indeed, pyrotechnics to the extreme. Reality is not one of its strengths. I give him 1 out of 10. I would have made a zero, but this option was not allowed. Sorry, but Lithgow and Sutherland deserve better roles. But sometimes we all need money. And I still bounce off Tim Burton's farce about Mars. Nicholson was brave enough to admit that it was a turkey. But if it was a turkey, then this film is not even a belly. I wish I could say "give me back my money." You can bet I would if I could. But this is a problem with premium services, a variety of subscriptions.
