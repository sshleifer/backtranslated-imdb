How did this piece of shit stay on television for so long? It's horrible. It makes me want to shoot someone. It's so fake that it's actually worse than a science fiction movie from the 1940s. I'd rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense. I remember watching him when he first came out. I thought, hey, it might be interesting, then I found out how crazy it is, ridiculously stupid in fact. It was so bad that I actually took out my pocket knife and put my hand on the table. <br /> <br /> Please, people, stop watching this and all other reality shows, they are rubbish that clogs networks and cancels quality programming that requires some thought to create.
