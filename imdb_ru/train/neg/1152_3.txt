I understand that this film was trying to portray. The fact that old people are often ignored and viewed as anxiety, which means that they ultimately feel undervalued and seem to have their lives empty. <br /> <br /> I have no problems with this message, but I just feel that it could be put in such a way that it was not so painful to watch. I like a good feature film, but when the film gets too shy (as in this case), the result is often disappointing. Including pictures of a person slowly packing a suitcase that takes 5 minutes, trying to make sense, but ultimately annoying the public. <br /> <br /> Female characters are very weak, and in the end you just want to say to them: collect it. This is a film that you think should be liked or appreciated, and certainly has its merits, but I was too upset when I watched it to recommend it to someone else. It may have a deeper message than in other films of Roger Michelle (for example, “Notting Hill”), but at least it was a movie that you could enjoy watching.
