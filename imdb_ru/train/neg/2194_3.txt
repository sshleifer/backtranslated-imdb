Neat room. Very unreal. What I learned from this movie is that itâ€™s crazy to get out of control quickly to go to a weekend house might not be the best idea. I liked how Bill comfortably rolled out of the car and went down the slope without any injuries! Unfortunately, this can not be said about his girlfriend. Oh, and the police seemed to never find the car or track down the owner of the crash. <br /> <br /> Lots of protracted scenes, including a simple stripper (nightmares are still in the scene). Poor assistant guy and his dirty useless hand. I admit, I was intrigued to see that the mysterious "thing" was outside the door, but when it appeared, I just laughed. Ha ha ha !! The girl really seemed viciously sadistically resurgent. Personally, I really would like a new body after such a painful experience!
