For those of you who have never heard of it (and have not seen it in A & E), Cracker is a brilliant British television show about overweight, smoking the psyche of a psychologist named Fitz that helps the Manchester police department penetrate the heads of violent people. criminals. He is considered one of the best shows in the whole history of England (and that says something), and he was extremely successful in England and around the world in 1993. <br /> <br /> Now the original stars re-teamed with the original author to knock out another 2-hour episode. I have loved this show since I first saw it more than ten years ago. The DVD box set holds an honorable place in my collection, and I can almost literally quote many scenes of interrogation of Fitz. The idea of ​​Robbie Coltrane moving with Jimmy McGovern for the next Fitz TV movie filled me with absolute joy. <br /> <br /> I'll start with the good. One of the many things that impressed me in the original Cracker series was how quickly Fitz was identified as a character. Five minutes in the first episode with his lecture (throwing books into the air), his drinking and swearing at the guy behind him in line for the slot machine ?? and you knew, just knew who this character is. You can feel how it “clicks” in your head, that type of click that happens only when a great actor gets a great role written by a great writer. <br /> <br /> Coltrane surely stayed great throughout the show, but did I always feel that some of the later episodes ?? those that are not written by mcgovern ?? mistreated the character. <br /> <br /> The good news is this: Fitz is back. As soon as you see him in this show? make incredibly inappropriate comments at your daughter's wedding ?? you will feel this “click” again. This is it: irritable at one moment and sincerely regretting the next, always insightful, sincere to tactlessness, but incredibly funny in the process. If you love this character as much as I do, you will be delighted with the way he is depicted in the film. And this applies to Judith and Mark: in fact, everything related to Fitz is beautifully processed. <br /> <br /> The problem I encounter in this film is related to the crime Fitz is trying to solve. In the standard way of a cracker, we know for sure who the criminal is in the first five minutes ?? The surprise is to see how Fitz understood it. In this case, we have a serial killer who craves American blood. And the reason for this, unfortunately, is not in any plausible psychological trauma ?? rather, it seems that the killings are here simply to allow the author to demonstrate his personal political convictions. <br /> <br /> It’s hard for me to write because I truly believe that Jimmy McGovern is one of the greatest writers. in the world. I also have no problems with films about current issues or films that take a political stance. But in the Cracker Universe, we expect to see characters who behave like humans, not like cartoons. Instead, the Americans in this film are depicted completely stereotyped. They are silent talkers who complain about everything, treat the locals like shit and cheat on their wives ?? one of them even manages to accomplish all of the above in less than 5 minutes. Honestly, I thought that I had mistakenly switched channels or something like that. <br /> <br /> But that’s not the end of it. We get constant reminders of how badly the Iraq war is going? reminders that have nothing to do with the story and appear almost from nowhere. The murderer is so busy ranting that Bush is worse than Hitler, that he almost forgets to continue the murder; but, more importantly, he is such a mouthpiece of the political views of the writer that he forgets to behave like a believable person, and so are we ?? how is the audience ?? Do not buy his sudden transformation from a happy family man into a tortured serially killing soul. <br /> <br /> I can not say that it spoiled my show ?? it was still good television, better than almost everything else in the genre (mainly thanks to, again, Coltrane). But his constant politicization did not allow him to be as good as the real classics of Cracker, such as "Being someone" ?? an episode that was just as “problematic”, but was processed with much greater refinement and psychological depth. <br /> <br /> Two other minor points: the lack of a Panhandle is frustrating, but what’s worse, replacing it, the whole police department ?? who has been filled with such great characters for so long - is now full of vanilla. Fully interchangeable cops who lack any personality (how you could deplete the personality of Richard Coyle from Coupling I lack, but she is really missing here). <br /> <br /> In addition, there are a couple of moments when the show is lost likelihood for me. One such example is that Fitz has to narrow down the entire population of Manchester from 1 million to a hundred people based on some very strange criteria (French windows? How does a computer know if I have French windows?) ?? he not only succeeds in this, but succeeds in less than an hour. I do not think so. <br /> <br /> In general, I was a little disappointed. It is recommended to review, but do not forget to leave at least some of your expectations behind the door. However, if after this new series appear, everything would be for the better: I am convinced that McGovern can still write excellent things, and perhaps now that he has withdrawn his policy from his system, he can return to writing about people
