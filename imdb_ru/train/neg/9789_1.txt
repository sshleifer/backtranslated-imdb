They were supposed to name this film: "Accepted Brother Mice, which is slightly inspired by someone's vague memory of Stuart Little, who just read the book a little, but mostly just remembered the cover." This is the best review. <br /> <br /> But seriously, people, do a favor to your children and ask them to read a book. They may actually learn something, and not get numb about what we all know as a Hollywood film. <br /> <br /> Stewartâ€™s book is a little not about a mouse, but about a man who turned out to be very small mouse-like. He was born to his parents, and not adopted. A book about his life and his possible departure from home and the journey he is taking. There is a cat named Snowball, who thinks he is food and wants to eat it, but Snowball can't talk. <br /> <br /> In the film they messed up. I think the only thing they saved from the book is boat racing and names.
