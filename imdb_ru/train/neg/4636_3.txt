The “confidential” part was intended to maintain the popularity of the popular magazine of the same name, while the topic of labor racketing was linked to the headlines of the Congress studies of that time. However, despite the B-film cast and some good scripts, the film lasts about 73 minutes. This is the production of a cheap jack. To compensate for poor production values, you need a little imagination, especially from non-inspired director Sidney Salkov. For example, a few shots in daylight would help ease the series of boring studio shots. A stylish helmsman, such as Anthony Mann, could have done something with thick ears, but Solkov views this as another exercise on the day of payment. It is a pity that the typical low-key style of Brian Keith does not work here, as he looks just wooden and lethargic, and at the same time the cult figure of Elisha Cook Jr. rises above his head, like a drunk with wild eyes. It is clear that Salkov is not an actor director. But you must pass it on to that daring little number of Beverly Garland, who treats his role with characteristic enthusiasm and devotion. Sorry, she did not answer. My advice is to skip it, unless you like funny barmaids who do nothing but drink whiskey in the typical manner of the 50s in a straitjacket.
