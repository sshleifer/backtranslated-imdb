I admit that I only watched a few episodes, but each of them seemed completely different from the next. It seems that after the first season, the producers decided to completely re-equip the show, remove the characters, introduce new ones and rewrite the entire dynamics of the show. <br /> <br /> As you've probably already guessed, the show looks weird. Unpredictable teenager Holly (Amanda Bynes), who moves with her arrogant sister Valerie (Jenny Garth) to New York. A pretty decent premise: a strange couple + fish from water + high evil eye. <br /> <br /> Although I miss the comedy performances of the past, this show, unfortunately, repeatedly misses funny, funny marks, and it's sad because they have decent talent. <br /> <br /> In addition, they insisted on changing the show (Val lived once in the usual cast for one season, then he suddenly left, so she opens the bakery? what?) When everything changes that radically there is a feeling that even * the show * knows that it is bad. I mean, completely new scenery, written off characters and new permanent participants of the show! <br /> <br /> By the way, I know that this television show is not at all present, but Val and Holly end up living in a huge loft duplex (there is a staircase) with a terrace ... in Manhattan! Are you serious!?
