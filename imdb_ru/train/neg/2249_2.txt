This is a terrible film disaster. From start to finish, it is full of bad play and even worse direction and editing. The only redemptive parts of the film are several Streisand numbers, because the Kristofferson party is impossible to watch or listen to. The main problem of this film is that we never see the character of Christopherson at his peak or the character of Streisand, who is fighting. The first should be considered in decline, and the second growth. The final number of Streisands could be one of the greatest finals in the film, if it were properly directed and edited. The single shot of her face during the song was a terrible mistake. If the group, the audience and the wide frames of the stage were shown, this number could be dynamic and interesting. This film must have been filmed and edited by the drop-out film school at New York University. Worst of all can be a pathetic script. The final musical number is the only redemptive part of this film, and even this is completely ruined by erroneous technical decisions.
