The boy, oh, oh, oh my god, Gee, <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing in the film is the merriment of the blue effects used to create the “invisibility” of the mother. They looked like they were being shot on a cheap video, and it looks completely unrealistic, and even not so good when it's so funny that you end up enjoying the movie ... <br /> <br /> I’m NOT into In the end, I love this movie. Trying "steadicam" shots were also really pathetic. I mean, hey, if they had a low budget, that's fine. You can still make a great movie on a low budget. But, bad movie and low budget and effects. This makes for a bad combination. In this case, such a doomed combo created a stunning film “Invisible Mother”. If you have children, and your children have no taste, they may be awake throughout this.
