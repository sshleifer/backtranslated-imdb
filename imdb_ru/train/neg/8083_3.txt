Refused by Richard S. Sarafyan, this catastrophe shook the Japanese theaters before coming to the States and immediately going to the video where it was no longer seen until Turnerâ€™s networks needed anything other than commercials to fill their time intervals. 3:00 to 6:00 and find this tape at the bottom of their basket. The name Smithee is supposed to be used when the studio hacks the film so hard that the director no longer wants his name attached to it. But I am afraid that Sarafyan cannot blame the studio completely for this. Actors, mostly recent graduates of "Overacting 101", supply one line of cornball after another. The plot is confusing. Special effects are not impressive. Parts that aren't funny are just boring. The script or book must have been good - why else would Palance, Matheson, Boyle, or Heston agree to appear in this deception? But something went wrong from page to screen. Summary: Avoid. Not even so bad as to be so bad, that's good.
