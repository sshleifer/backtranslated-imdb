The First Power (1990) was a terrible film that came out in the late 80s - early 90s from cheap horror films. I found this film very boring, but in some places it was very funny. This film lacks so much sense and believability that it is not even funny. The fast justice system in this film makes Texas look weak in comparison. Lou Diamond Phillips stands over his head with this role (he plays a hard-boiled cop), and Tracy Griffith (more attractive sister Melanie) plays a psychic. Do not waste your time on it, because it is bad. What a minute, I take it back. This movie makes a great movie for parties. Look at the nun crucified on a crucified blade, she has the most beautiful legs I have ever seen on a nun who was not in the film of Jesus Franco. Yeow! <br /> <br /> This marked the end of an era for L.D.P. His star was tarnished, and he could not attract flies to a pile of dung. It was D.T.V. for him before his "resurrection" a few years later. <br /> <br /> Not recommended if you are not in despair.
