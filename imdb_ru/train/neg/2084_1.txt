if they gave me the negative number option, I would use it. This film was really terrible. I went to the cinema, expecting it to be terrible, and it somehow managed to exceed my expectations. <br /> <br /> The script was weak, the action was painful. I wanted to leave, but my girlfriend was driving and wanted her money to be worth it, I think we were both disappointed. <br /> <br /> Breast growth when the girls gained super strength and the change in hair color was simply wrong. Eddie Izzard just seemed wrong in the role of a supervillain, he seemed strangely weak and stupid. Jenny Johnsons (Uma Thurman) is crazy and weird, like Matt's friend (Luke Wilson) Vaughn (Rein Wilson).
