Unfortunately, this film has nothing to do with the original. Nicolas Cage, wooden enough for the actors, fills the screen with a variety of skills, from pluses to tops. The supporting cast is no better. <br /> <br /> The plot remains almost the same as in the original script, but much worse. Not enough details to allow the audience to understand what is for sale. It turns out that this is just an account of bad goods. Unbelief cannot be suspended, and there can be no doubt. The only salutary aspect of this film is that it is very visual, as required by the medium, and whoever is looking for, the location is commendable. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of laughter and multiple roars in the audience, literally the end. <br /> <br /> Disappointed! Wait until the original appears on television, pour whiskey and enjoy.
