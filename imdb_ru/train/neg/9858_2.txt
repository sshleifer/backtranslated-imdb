This movie is NOT funny. He simply takes the stereotypes of D & D nerds and reinforces them. All the main characters earn less than 30 thousand a year, they all live with their parents, they are all socially backward, and they have no luck with women. Jokes are horrible and unimaginable, for example, when two gamers are beaten by black dwarfs, because one of them had a hood in the style of the KKK (it was his magician costume), and the other guy had a warm-up, John Roker he does not know about the sport). You may have to be a child high school student to find something funny. Badly made mockmuntaries are so painful to watch, but obviously extremely cheap to make. I'm sorry Kelly Lebrok and Beverly D'Angelo. I believe that these are the only opportunities available for beginners far from their heyday.
