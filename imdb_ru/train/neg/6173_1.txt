This film is a blatant attempt by the left in Hollywood to portray the Reagan administration as incompetent and inept. Some mistakes may have been made during the crisis, but Iâ€™m sure not to the extent that is depicted in this unfortunate film. My first reaction was that this film should have been shot by director Oliver Stone, but this time I was wrong. There are obviously many others.
