Jason Alexander is a wonderful actor, but it's funny to play him as a pleasant romance. The fact that he dances so well, sings so effectively, and so deeply immerses himself in the party, just makes him seem even more creepy. In his more pleasant moments (with the girl at the station, in the last room with Rosie) I could not take my eyes off him, he was so repulsive. You keep expecting him to quit the cute guy act and start roaring. Vanessa Williams was a real star, the only performance that was better than the 1963 film. By the way, if you see the production of the musical, the film of 1963 and this film of 1995, you will see three versions that have more revisions (different songs, the same songs assigned to different characters and in different situations) than any other musical that I I have seen.
