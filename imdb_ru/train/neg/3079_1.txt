My favorite quote from Crow was when the car went off the cliff: “The film is so bad that even the car wants to get out of it!” <br /> <br /> It was the funniest film I've ever seen. It was serious to scare you, which makes it even funnier! If not for the Mystery Science Theater, I would not be here today! :-P
