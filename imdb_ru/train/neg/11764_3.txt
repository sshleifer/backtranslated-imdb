I must say that I was really looking forward to seeing this film and finding a new life in it that would separate it from the most boring and overly processed Mexican films. I have no idea why, but I trusted Sexo, Pudor y Lagrimas to add freshness and confidence to our non-existent industry. Maybe it’s because the soundtrack (which I listened to before I watched the movie) sounded different from others, maybe it was because he dared to include new faces (except for Demian Bichir, who was always a favorite Mexican directors) and presumably made in his script with modern social behavior, maybe because the photo I saw in the trailers was bright and realistic, and not theatrical. The film turned out to be the main crowd of spectators and a great disappointment. Here Serrano actually deals with a very old-fashioned “battle of the sexes”, as in “all men are the same” and “why all the women ...;” blah blah blah. There is nothing new in this, even in this, he uses so much in common and cliché that in the end he makes fun of himself, leaving no valuable reflection in the state of a woman / man. Full of ordinary vagabonds in public, such as safe jokes about clichés that I talked about before (they always work, always) and screaming performances (in this context it’s a well-played film) ... and by cry I mean literally sense. At first, the more convincing characters played by Monika Dionn and Demian Bichir are, in the opinion of Serrano, more pathetic. I completely disagree with Serrano, they should not have been treated in such a way that he served as puppets for his lesson ... he made sure that we get HIS message, and completely destroy their roles, which were the only solid basis in which This story could stand. In any case, this is, after all, a very interesting film, and you will probably have a good time seeing it (if you agree to manipulate it).
