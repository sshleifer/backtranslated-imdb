I can not believe that many compare this film with the film Argento. His work is much more creative and flawed - and much more fun. <br /> <br /> The director simply does not have the ability to create real tension. The scenes of the murder - and let's face it, that's what this whole genre is about - not interesting. It was not difficult to guess who the killer was, and I really didnâ€™t care when it was revealed. The cinematography is not remembered, and the highly appreciated gothic atmosphere of the 19th century simply did not attract me. Some of the actors are pretty good (especially the director and the sadistic girl who directs them among younger students), but they give you very little. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are shades of incest, sadomasochism and lesbianism, but surprisingly, they add very few spices or obscurity. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good horror movie, look elsewhere.
