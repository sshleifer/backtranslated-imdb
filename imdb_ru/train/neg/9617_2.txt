Three years ago, Rachel (Teresa Fretwell) held parties on the lake with her friends when her brother fell out of the boat and sank. Rachel's friends think itâ€™s time for her to stop beating herself and taking the blame for something she could not control. So take a brew and something to chew on, and go back to the same lake that was in Rachel's nightmares. As expected, the bloodbath had already begun when two friends splashed even before they went to the party. This film resembles a school play, in which everyone forgot their lines and "inspired" ... very bad! Writer Marcos Gabriel gave himself the role of the protagonist Rachel Leo. Besides Fretwell and Gabriel, there are some pretty lame actors and a few characters that you would like to get rid of shit before they "go crazy." Several other players who have had the courage to appear are noteworthy: Erin Gallagher, Andrew Williams, Jasmine Tris and Derek Nieves. This is one day of memory that you would not miss.
