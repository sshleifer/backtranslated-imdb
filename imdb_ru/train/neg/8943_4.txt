John Wayne and Albert Decker compete for the rights to oil in India and for the attention of Martha Scott in this republic. The film is shot from Utah, USA. <br /> <br /> Interesting western because of its characters and its more modern setting, in which Wayne and Decker play old and new factions of the West. It is based on the story of Thomson Burtis, who co-wrote the script with Eleanor Griffin and Ethel Hill. Albert Roguell directs in a manner appropriate to his career. A fairly mundane story, to tell the truth, remains the last third, where, fortunately, the action begins, and we turn to something that resembles a pulse. The frivolous approach to the romantic thread is not entirely successful, and the magnificent fistfight between the two main characters is destroyed because of the inability to disguise Rogell by the stuntmen performing the work. But hey, stuntmen always deserve a moment of glory. Hard support comes from George "Gabby" Hayes, and Wayne, as usual, has a lot of on-screen charisma, especially when rattling from his gun. But, despite his better-than-usual republican budget, the film remains interesting only for the 1940s Wayne enthusiasts. 4/10
