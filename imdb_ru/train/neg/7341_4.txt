Well, I'm not a professional movie critic, but come on ... the real story !!!! <br /> <br /> They are paving a tunnel under another store to get under the bank and stumble upon the grave. At the tomb with a passage that goes directly under the coast. <br /> <br /> Okay, I play along. <br /> <br /> But then they go to the bank and decide to go to sleep. Yeah!!! I am sure that when adrenaline passes through them, they will simply fall asleep. <br /> <br /> It blows up the whole picture !!!! How lame !!!!! <br /> <br /> Glad I didn't have to pay to watch this.
