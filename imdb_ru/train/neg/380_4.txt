I wonder if this movie makes sense? This is a big joke. Well .. This is interesting .. You can see the most stupid story, played very seriously in the form of a film. I wonder what audience this movie is mainly focused on? <br /> <br /> Priti (professional) plays a surrogate mother for a happy couple Salman / Rani, who wants a child but cannot. I wonder how it would be if this drama were a real take-off from the life of a real couple. <br /> <br /> Rani seems happy with another pretty lady in her house who was led to make a child for her and Salman. She cares for Priti and tries to push her husband Salman to Priti so that they can have a little romance. When the audience will be fed up with the nahrami Salman. <br /> <br /> Although this is a good past, this film is unbearable. Absurd.
