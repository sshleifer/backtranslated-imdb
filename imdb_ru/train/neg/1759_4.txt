This effort was like a brilliant television film ... I don’t remember being ever released in theaters ... If so, then he must have died a quick death. Watching the DVD, without leaving our bedroom, it was obvious that this film was not intended for anything more ... Ed Lauter, art historian with gluttony? What a funny twist it must have been ... I haven't seen Ed since "The Longest Yard" ... All the rest pretty much acted by numbers, led by Baldwin, except Pompeo ... She had zero charisma and seemed to be sleepwalking for most of the picture ... Pompeo's daughter had one dimension ... she played every scene like a cute little puppy ... the slowest delivery of all three year old children I have ever seen ... <br /> The pursuit scenes gave me and my wife headaches ... too many sharp blows and a blow in the corners ... If you are going to shoot a chase scene in Barcelona, ​​you may need several wide shots to use the beauty of your background, right? The whole story was rather implausible and contrived, but we liked it more than "The Life Aquatic ..."
