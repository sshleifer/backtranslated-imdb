Caught this movie on a traffic jam on Sunday. I thought it was so bad that I looked at IMDb to see what others think about it. I was not surprised by the number of stupid people who enjoyed this fluff. However, I was surprised when I looked in the comments to read the “Hate” categories, and found that they are not. I was shocked by this; I always look at the hated, because they always hate the film, no matter how good it is. Somehow this film went through unscathed haters, I say no to this and proudly declare that I hate this film! I know that I must tell you in detail about why I hate this film, but doing it will only give this film more respect than it deserves.
