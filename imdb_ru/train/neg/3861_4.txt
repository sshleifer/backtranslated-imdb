I'm not a big fan of rum / coma at the best of times. Some of them were pretty good (checking for Dream for insomnia), but this one is just more than the same, but less. <br /> <br /> With a duration of 100 minutes, I expect more than 1 laughter every 30 minutes. The only real animal laughter is when male strangers and friends instinctively help hero Li. <br /> <br /> All I can say is AVOID. I guarantee there are at least 10 other films on the shelf that deserve you $$ <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (And just because I'm a big fan of Lee)
