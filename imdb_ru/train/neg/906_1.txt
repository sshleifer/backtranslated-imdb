Yes, this film made me feel real horror when I realized that I paid for it and spent more than an hour of my life trying to watch it. The bald guy just makes an impression of a psycho - a drug addict on me, and the girl is the worst actress I've ever seen. Believe me, if you value your time avoiding this film, I understand that making a film requires money, and in some films there is no such money, but this does not justify a stupid plot and a bad game. I always support independent films when it deserves support, but such films make notoriety for this kind of films. I'm still injured. I will no longer trust any beautiful cover.
