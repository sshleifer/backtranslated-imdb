“National Lampoon Gos to the Movies” is the worst film ever made, surpassing even the brainless Plan 9 from space. At the very least, this film was simply inept; Lampoon film, on the other hand, is inept and despicable. Once films are used to respect the intelligence of their viewers. This one, however, holds a fetid, rotting carcass on our faces, and then tries to rub our noses. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer on this site wrote that the only good parts of the film are nude scenes; and I agree, Mrs. Hansel and Dusenberry flare up a little bit of flesh, and this is very good flesh. But the directors don't seem to realize that even T & A needs a good story to surround it. There is nothing like this. <br /> <br /> Wrong, the filmmakers leave the worst in the end. The third of the three segments is the ugliest trio. In this vignette, Robbie Benson plays a young cop, a passionate lover, who reports on his first day at work. He is paired with a tired, cynical oldtimer played by Richard Widmark. For a moment we are given hope that this film will end in triumph. Undoubtedly, we think that the pompous attitude of the youngster will wash away the cynic and change it for the better. <br /> <br /> Sad hope! Instead, the cynic wins the day - and the boy’s spark dies away forever. “National Lampoon Go to the Movies” and goes straight to the toilet, asking us to follow it down the drain. Nominally it's a comedy. But where is the humor?
