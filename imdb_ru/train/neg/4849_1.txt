I just rented it today .... heard a lot of good reviews in advance. BLIMEY!! What a bunch of steaming poo this movie !! Does anyone know the director's address so that I can get my five dollars back? Finally, someone came across a “Stop Loss” from the film “The Worst Film about the War in Iraq.” Honestly, I don’t think there are good films about the war in Iraq, but it was VERY bad. <br /> <br /> I will not go into technical inaccuracies, there are a hundred reviews from other GWOT veterinarians who describe them in detail. If the director had bothered to consult even the lowest electronic information on technical accuracy, he could have made the film somewhat realistic ... perhaps. I suppose the author should get a “credit” for this film waste. He or she, obviously, was nurturing the plot for this film from some vivid imagination, not affected by the limitations of reality. Does anyone besides me wonder what the meaning of this film is? Was there a message? Seriously though ..... WTF ???? <br /> <br /> I am very surprised by all the positive reviews really. This film is difficult to watch as a veterinarian because of all the blatant inaccuracies, but even if this is not noticed, the plot sucks, the characters are small (if not more), and the acting is bad at best. I think it’s ironic that this film should be about explosive disposal, because it’s the biggest bomb I’ve seen this year.
