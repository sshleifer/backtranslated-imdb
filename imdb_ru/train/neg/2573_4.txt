If you have a lot of time to spend ... that's fine. He is moving at a good pace, but to make this film you will need a little longer and a bit more background for the nanny. <br /> <br /> Acting is fine. Mariana Claveno, as a nanny, does the best job and is the most believable. <br /> <br /> William R. Moses played a pretty good role as a husband. <br /> <br /> Gail O'Grady's wife had a weak role, and the reasons for her return to work were not disclosed. <br /> <br /> The ending is stupid. Like most of these nanny films ... there are interesting places ... but on the whole it makes you wonder why you spent your time.
