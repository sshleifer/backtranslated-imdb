Five minutes after watching, I entered IMDb to warn all of you that you shouldn't worry about this movie ... genre: horror? I had moments of light waiting, and throughout the whole film I thought that “something should happen soon,” it did not happen ... when the film ended, I felt so embarrassed for the writer / director that I never Patrick Rea was not the biggest fan, this guy just doesn’t know how to make films, and after watching this excusely excuse the horror I’d left out, I wasn’t his biggest fan not to watch his other works. <br /> <br /> I was obsessed with the plot, please do not repeat the same mistake. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 2 for actors. bad direction ...
