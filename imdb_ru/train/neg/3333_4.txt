As in the early horror film, The Bougens, the insidious invisible killer becomes a disappointment when he is finally seen. Although Stephen Furst of Animal House clearly liked the role of incest, his performance is more like a comedy than horror. <br /> <br /> In the plot, extremely tired, there are three sexy women (Bach, Lamm, etc.). Lois Young) could not find the hotel for the evening, so they willingly agree to stay with the seemingly kind curator of the museum, which the late Sydney Lassik exclusively plays. If you have ever seen a horror movie, you know that the cute IL 'Sydney is a crazy lunatic, so everyone knows what will happen to pretty ladies. <br /> <br /> All three women are very attractive, especially Barbara Bach, but Lois Young (Helen Hunt clone) is the only one who can undress when Sydney watches her bath.
