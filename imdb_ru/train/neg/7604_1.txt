Of course, this is happening in the west, but the name makes it look like an ordinary western one. Instead, it's a movie about a sheriff woman. Make no mistake, although this is a bad film about a sheriff woman. She becomes a sheriff when her husband is shot; she is a bit upset about it. Her main goal is to chase the villain, who is also a woman, but the villain hires a guy to kill her. So what happens is that the hero falls in love with the killer and vice versa. Absolutely stupid, as anyone killed in this film should thank the new sheriff. She had more than a few chances to put the killer behind bars, but I think because she liked him, she would not have done that. The killer also harasses the mayor of the city for personal reasons, which are also rather stupid. This film is very boring and you should not watch it ... this is not one of the best episodes of MST3000 that they shot. I can't imagine anyone seeing this without them, because it would make it a lot more painful. Korman is a low-budget director, but even he should know better than to make people go to one place and go to another.
