I didn’t even know that it was originally a television film when I saw it, but I figured it out while working. It has the same blurry colors, soft characters and terrible synthesized music, which I remember from the 80s, plus a “social platform” that practically screams “Special school after school”. Anyhoo. <br /> <br /> Labyrinths and monsters of Rhone Jaffe were created during the heyday of Dungeons & Dragons, RPG with a pen and paper that won the hearts of millions of geeks across America. I consider myself one of the geeks mentioned, although I have never played D & D, especially I dabbled with one of his brothers. M & M was also made during the heyday of major D & D disputes - it was so exciting that people could lose touch with reality, worship Satan, not knowing blah blah. I suppose that at some point it was a legitimate concern, although extremely rare, but it dates this film terribly. <br /> <br /> We meet with 4 young college students who play aptly named labyrinths and monsters to socialize and a little time from worldly life. Except that M & M, as presented, is more boring than their worldly life. There is not a single fascination of games here, and Jay Jay’s request to move M & M to the “real world” does not arise from nowhere. This is just a reason to make one of the characters go crazy out of nowhere, although at this moment we don’t care. JJ, Robbie, Kate and Daniel should be different from each other, but they are all WASPy rich newcomers who have no problems that no one has encountered. <br /> <br /> But everything just goes on, deteriorating in many ways than one. The low budget is terribly clear (I like the sign "Entrance" and the cardboard cut-out in the forbidden caves). Robbie / Pardou shows why he is not a warrior in the most deaf and sharpest scene in the entire history, but the winnings at the Two Towers are unintentionally cheerful. Tom Hanks shouts "JJ, what am I doing here?" made me laugh for a few minutes in a row. Definitely the lowest point in his career. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it as a convincing satire, just laugh at the 80s TV junk, and you will still have a good time. That is, if you can not sleep. Most are mostly boring, but all this is worth it so that Pardu broke at the end. At least Tom Hanks recovered. Not that he could go much worse from here.
