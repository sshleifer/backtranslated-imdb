I can hardly believe that I watched it again last night after more than 25 years ... <br /> <br /> Some time ago I watched 6 films in a row “Fu” ... Boris Karloff and all 5 Chris Lee . The last 2 Lee, both directors (and I use this word fluently) Jess Franco, were disgusting. At the time I missed this one, remembering that in a sense it was EVEN GOOD. <br /> <br /> Well, I watched it. Never again. Do you know what is worse than a disgusting movie? A really well made piece of S ***. And this is what the FENDINIAN PLOT is. This is a VERY beautiful movie. EXCELLENT design, scenery, costumes, music, photography, editing, mostly good actors, some decent acting skills ... <br /> <br /> ... and certainly one of the worst scenarios in cinema history !! !!! AAAUGH !!!!! The first minute of the movie is so deceptive ... one could take it for a decent movie. And then they start singing "Happy Birthday Fu" ... and it goes downhill. Burt Kwuk (about which his master says: “Your face is familiar”) accidentally poured Fu's elixir to put out the fire, as a result of which he was sentenced to torture, burial and cut off one ear, it was closest to the funny thing they had. As if someone decided that they want to make an "obscene" film - so funny that it will be funny. It's funny, it's ... it's funny ... it's not. Actually. <br /> <br /> This is sad because in the first few minutes it became clear that someone had done a LOT of research on the Fu Manchu series to get most of this “right”. With another scenario - either really FUNNY, or dead, SERIOUS, they could have - could ... SHOULD have - have classics in their hands. The film, because of which one could forget the horror of these atrocities Jess Franco ... instead of forcing someone to dig them out as masterpieces, for comparison. <br /> <br /> At the end of the 70s there was a period when a number of classic characters from the 30s were revived in films that were terribly ubiquitous. Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, Tarzan, the Lone Ranger, Charlie Chan, even Doc Savage. I'm not sure this one could be the worst of them all. It took a lot of self-control, so as not to go forward to whole fragments of it, especially to any scenes containing Sid Caesar (the head of the FBI, who was also Al Capone's cousin — do you know what I mean?). It's not just that the ideas in the film are not funny ... they often have no meaning. For example, when they “buzz” policemen to imitate the King and Queen, and we end up seeing people “auditioning” in dance halls, such as singing, dancing, and riding a unicycle. How many drugs the authors of this thing had to take to make it all make sense? <br /> <br /> As I said, a shame ... and a real waste of all this talent, including the talent of Peter Sellers (who played Foo and Nyland Smith), Burt Kuuk (who was in the film by Chris Lee Foo at the time) , Helen Mirren (a police woman who disgustingly falls in love with a villain and damn steals the last half hour of the movie!). I'm starting to wonder if someone will ever make a "correct" film about Fu Manchu, or will the fans have to agree that Karloff is almost the ONLY?
