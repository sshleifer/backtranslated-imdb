If you hate trash, you hate this movie. And even worse, you see Patrick Swayze trying to be a cattle. I really can not stand the accents of cattle. I like Billy Bob Thornton, he was good at Slingblade, but he was annoying in this movie. And what name is Lonnie Earl? How many hips can this movie get? The storyline was stupid. I, as a rule, not so destined from films, but I hated this film. If you need a good Billy Bob Thornton movie, go to Slingblade. <br /> <br /> My mother found this movie for $ 5.95 at Wal Mart ... the numbers ... I think Iâ€™ll wrap it up and give it to my grandmother for Christmas. Maybe I just can not stand the accents of cattle, or I can not stand Patrick Swayze. Perhaps if Patrick Swayze wasn't there. I never laughed once in the film. I laugh at something stupid usually. If they showed someone their fingers are broken, I would have laughed. human fingers, broken by accident, always make me laugh.
