T.Z. The post, a college professor, receives a fake letter that he inherited $ 750,000. Now, with financial resources, he withdraws his savings in the amount of $ 4,000 and finally decides to go out and live. After receiving the luggage on the train to Chicago, he meets a traveling vaudeville group and decides to arrange a show on Broadway quite well there. On the night of the show, poor Professor Post needs to hide from his creditors, settle problems between his friend Pansy and the evil diva Eleanor and still make sure that the show must go on. After viewing the many silent pearls of Keaton, it is a pain to sit, but I felt that could be much worse. The auxiliary cast of Durante, Todd and Selwyn is sometimes very annoying, but still pleasant. Pre Charlie Chan Toler is good as a disillusioned director of the show. 90% of the script is poorly written, because MGM is trying to pass it off as the film The Brothers Marx for the Poor, where many shows fail from the outset. This film, which combines Keaton’s alcohol problems at the time, is just a sad moment in Buster’s life. Rating- 3.
