In addition to his “Tarzan” series, the prolific Edgar Rice Burroughs did write many other books, although, apart from the popular “At the Earth’s Core”, few of them were removed. The exception is the novel “The Boy and the Lion”, shot on screens as “The Lion Man” (1936), overly talkative, static, old-fashioned, slow and rather boring film, despite being filmed in real desert places. . Actually, “film” is the wrong word. The narrative does not move, but continues at the pace of the snail in sharp series of jerks. For example, at least five characters get complex initial scenes, and then simply disappear. Even more disappointing for an enthusiastic movie fan are the characters who make a sort of impression (for example, a girl who plays in the Hall with a narcotic wine), but are played by players who are not credited! Enrolled fans usually turn out to be worse than the unknown. An exception is the Australian actress Finis Barton, who tells well about the kidnapped harem girl who rescues the young master Fairy. Admittedly, most of the cast is burdened by the brutal dialogue of King James, which must be heard to be believed! But the way to play this rubbish is mocking, cunning, which seems to have happened to none of the list of untalented film players. Perhaps director J.P. McCarthy picked up the idea. In any case, it is sad to see how beautiful Kathleen Burke is forced to trade with people like Richard Carlisle (her father) and John Hall (her fiance). It should be recognized that Mr. Hall makes his statements with a little more conviction than Mr. Carlyle, but this is not a recommendation.
