So there is an old guard and a guy who dies, and then there is KEVIN, the biggest world in the world. Kevin wants to impress his incredibly insensitive, stupid and virgin girlfriend Amy. When he comes back from work to ... a random house ... he finds his "friends", sexually confusing the red-skinned Kyle and the truly disgusting slut Daphne. Soon they are joined by Daphne's boyfriend, pleased with his crazy sexy man Nick. And there are titular creatures, terrible little cunning puppets who kill people, giving them the desire of their heart. Kyle's heart desire is to mate with a creepy, nasty woman in a spandex. Nick's desire to throw grenades into the canteen of an elementary school - I mean a nightclub. Kevin's desire is to beat a skinny gangster with nunchucks. Amy's desire to be a disgusting whore. Daphne is already a disgusting whore, so she has no desire for her heart. Along the way, a really disgusting band sings a really weird song. Hobgoblins randomly return to where they came from, and then explode. “Citizen Kane” cannot hold a candle in front of this real masterpiece of American cinema.
