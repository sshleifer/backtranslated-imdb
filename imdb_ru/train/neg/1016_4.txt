The film itself is not so bad; Many comments point to the obvious flaws of the script, but it is watchable. What really gives me a boost is that people like Justin Timberlake are even filmed for films, and also for films like this one. I have to admit that I had never heard the name of this person before I saw it, but at that very moment when he appeared, I was just annoyed. The voice is shit, the face is Legolas' bad deception, his posture is terrible, and he cannot even coordinate all three of them properly. I said that I was delighted when he jumped after he left the disco, because since then I had hoped that it would only be Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey. It is a pity that I was wrong. These two, as well as LL Cool J give a very decent performance, and they are the main reason I put 4. <br /> <br /> I see many upcoming films with a small cast of Timberlake ... believe it
