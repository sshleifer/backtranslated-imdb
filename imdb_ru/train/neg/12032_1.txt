This movie was terrible. It was very hard to watch this all the time. I did not understand the meaning of the film. What was the point of this movie? The soundtrack was bad, the acting was bad, and the story was boring. The two main characters in the film were very boring, and their dialogue was uninteresting. There was no chemistry among any of the cast members. I don't know for sure, but I suspect that most of the actors were newcomers. The film could easily be reduced to one and a half hours without losing the plot. This shows how many useless scenes were in the film. I would prefer to have a root canal within two hours of a movie. I want these two hours ago! If you want to watch a good, funny movie that is suitable for family vacations and filmed by a group of Mormons, watch Napoleon Dynamite instead.
