Honestly, they did everything they could with a budget of five shillings and six pence, but the dialogue was more impudent than 9 pounds of emmental, and the CGI is now a bit of an old hat. maybe if some of the actors weren't so perfectly cut out of granite, that would make the movie a little better ... To say that it was awful would be to make this movie wrong, if you want to see something completely doable, you have to sit and spending a couple of hours of your life watching the “sickle” is very breathtaking, but in fact it’s good (although there are some big alcoholic drinks. you should see if you haven’t seen this yet, just don’t expect anything similar , the lost world "or" an Ocalipsis.
