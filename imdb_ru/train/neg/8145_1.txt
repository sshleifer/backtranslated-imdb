This film is so bad that I canâ€™t believe it was shot. People who voted for 10 or 9, 8 or even 7, are you insane? We really watched the same movie? Or the same sh ** I have to say. In this film, everything is bad. History (is there any history?) Nowhere does it go, completely incoherent, acting (some dialogues are ridiculous), musical score (what is this ****?), Editing and especially artistic guidance Pure disaster. Reminds me of old movies about mazistas ... To give you an example of amateur craftsmanship, a mermaid costume is a sleeping bag with sparkles on it. I'm not kidding, that's exactly what it is. <br /> <br /> Another example of the huge mistakes we find here: in the scene you see an extra, fat woman about 200 pounds who talks about her. cellular telephone. In the next picture, which is in a completely different place, you can see the same woman still talking on her mobile phone (!) Yes, it goes so far. <br /> <br /> Big, huge waste of money. Useless.
