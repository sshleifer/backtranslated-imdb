How did it even appear? I generally love f / f bigfoot any films, etc., but I still expect them to be written without as much cheese as this. The effect was sad, the lines were sadder. Avoid at all costs. I just rented it because it was not the case (I was looking for the film Sasquatch with Lance Henrikson in it â€” I never saw it) There was a lot of potential to make a great little movie here. I just do not understand how something like this ends. Talk to students interested in film / art / English in any high school and you will find people who can write the best script.
