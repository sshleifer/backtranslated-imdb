I am stunned that I really sat and watched it. I love independent movies, horror movies and everything about zombies. But when you add nings, you cross a line that should never intersect. I hope that the people in this film had a great time, then at least it was not a waste. You will never know by watching it. Scenario? You are joking. The acting? I think even the trees were pretending. Cinema? Well, there must have been a camera. Period. I don't think there was any real planning in the making of this film. Such a waste of time that I will not extend it by commenting further.
