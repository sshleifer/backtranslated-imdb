I went to school with Jeremy Earl, that’s how I heard about this film, I don’t even know if it was in the theater at all. I do not remember the name. I saw it, it's like one of those after school specials. The game is normal, not great. The plot was kind of weak, and the lines were pretty commonplace. So the only comment I can give to this film is “E”, I borrowed the film from Jeremy, if I were in the place where the films were distributed, this is the one that I would have passed by, and after watching it I would not recommend it to anyone middle school age. I also noticed that many times when urban children are portrayed, slang is overly used or simply outdated. Many times I think it makes their characters incredible.
