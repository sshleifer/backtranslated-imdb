Firstly, this film is not a “thriller”. Nor is it "grip, tight." Perhaps this was the scenario, but because of the slow pace of the movement it was difficult to enter. <br /> <br /> The plot itself is very interesting and original. Unfortunately, we understand how brilliant we are only after the picture is over. This leaves us with more than two hours of long episodes with music playing over them, with an emphasis on some of the fighting scenes that do not capture the viewer, and the scenes of “sneaky chanterelles” that bring in a bit more pronounced intelligence. <br /> <br /> I wish it was a fast-moving thriller box promised. It would be an outstanding film. Instead, Spike Lee did it to the end.
