When I received this film for free from my work along with three other similar films ... I was watching that with very low expectations. Now this film is not bad as such. You get what you pay for. This is a story about love, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal, everything that you want in the movie. Definitely not a Hollywood blockbuster, but for cheap thrills it's not so bad. I probably would never watch this movie again. In a nutshell, this is the film that you would see either very late at night on a local television channel that just wants to take some time, or you would watch it on Sunday afternoon on a local television channel that take some time. Despite the bad game, the clich√© and the poor performance of the camera. I had no desire to turn off the film and pretend that he never got up in my DVD player. The story has been made many times in many films. This one is no different, no better, no worse. <br /> <br /> Just your average movie.
