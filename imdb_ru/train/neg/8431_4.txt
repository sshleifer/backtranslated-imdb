Despite the fact that the actors convincingly play the role of losers who pass through the screen, the fact that it’s impossible to identify with these characters made me look at my watch just 20 minutes before the movie began (and more than once after that). The development of the plot is incoherent and slow, verbal diarrhea of ​​the protagonist’s only friend is almost unbearable, the basic quality of most of the characters' actions and the cavalier way of treating them is annoying. <br /> <br /> For Ventura Pons, it is typical to give out coarse psychologically defective characters. However, this false sociological analysis is a big step down compared to CARICIAS or Caresses, where the characters mistreat and despise each other for legitimate reasons, which are played during this film. In AMOR IDIOTA, we are forced to follow the convolutions of a truly abnormal intellect when it pursues a highly depressed and detached woman. Perhaps this is due to his own depression, but the script does not support this. I will not give the rest of the story in case there are masochists there ?? Is he cured because of his obsession, or is the woman shocked because of his own depression due to his unflagging attention? Even though I was watching all this, that for a minute I didn’t care for any of them. <br /> <br /> If you can put up with all these prejudices, ignorance, betrayal, bad dialogue, contrived philosophy, so on ?? the camera work was pretty good and seemed inspired by the DOGMA group. Makeup also seemed to be aimed at showing these players in a damp and sandy light, as this is the worst that I have seen Kayetana Guillen Cuervo in any of her films (although personally she is really attractive). <br /> <br /> I believe that if the idea is that we should be forced to see the lower strata of society so that we can be grateful that we are not part of it, then Ponce has achieved his goal. The barrage of almost identical sex scenes was a waste of the film (if the actors were filmed, but once in blue and green clothes, the background behind them could be changed in a special effects studio for pennies). True, I heard that most of the male audience writhes in their places during this, but objective viewing proves that this was not the real purpose of these scenes. <br /> <br /> Save yourself and see something else.
