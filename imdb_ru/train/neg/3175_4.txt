“So, here is this bride, you see, and she is crushed to death by this statue, which falls on her on her wedding day. Then, after a year, her ex-boyfriend falls in love with a beautiful psychic ?? and then this beautiful psychic is haunted by a ghost of an angry dead bride who wants to keep her from stealing her boyfriend - hehe - it will be fun! “Polite laughter. <br /> <br /> This is how I would like to imagine that this is how Jeff Lowell, the man who invented“ Above His Dead Body ”, presented his concept to the studio managers at the New Line cinema. how the same large corporate wigs can then turn right and give the green light to the project, allowing Lowell to direct the film and write the script. <br /> <br /> If you think that no movie can ever it may be as bad as this original premise, then It’s clear that you have one more thought. The only way it could work was if the writer just went crazy and turned it into a satirical farce without taboos. Instead, wanting to make sure that he put a fuzzy, harmless and hearty romantic comedy, Lowell is involved in boring half-measures at every step, leveling the absurdity in favor of monotonous conventionality. Virtually every production, joke and spectacle in the film is ineffectual and poorly executed, and even the actors themselves seem to be aware of their predicament. How else to explain the heartless, lifeless speeches of Paul Rudd, Eva Langoria Parker, Lake Bell and Jason Biggs in their various roles? <br /> <br /> I prefer not to blame the actors, some of whom in the past have proven their talents in better cars (especially in the case of Rudd). But Lowell and those studio managers probably have something to do.
