This film tells about a group of extra-terrestrial gay blacks who exterminate women on Earth to create a gay universe. <br /> <br /> I watched it with the intention of seeing how bad it was. However, I was shocked at how bad everything was. It was more like a movie shot 50 years ago. The game, if any, is very bad. Sets and props are so ridiculous that any film about college looks like a mega-budget. And the special effects are ridiculously simple: the jaw drops, as others have commented, but the jaw is rashly embarrassing. <br /> <br /> To appreciate this film, you need to be very drunk or in an altered state of consciousness. If I were from Denmark, I would be very embarrassed and humiliated that my compatriots shot such a terribly bad film.
