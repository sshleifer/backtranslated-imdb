A flat, ordinary thriller about an insidious woman who deceives all those whom she allegedly loves to increase her bank account. Nicole Kidman plays the deceptive Tracy, married to the adoring Andy (Bill Pullman). When Andy's old school friend, Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin), appears as a resident surgeon, the problem is not far behind him. <br /> <br /> The script fails in that it does not turn a promising premise into an effective, tantalizing thriller and an acute lack of character motivation, background and development leaves the entire show achievable. None of the actors are able to arouse interest in their small characters, especially Bill Pullman, whose very inexplicably curious Andy cannot be believed. <br /> <br /> Poor director Harold Becker remains to try to resurrect an incredibly dead project, and cannot be entertained by any of this. By the time the “secret” of the plot is revealed, you will not care. <br /> <br /> At least in Massachusetts cinema looks good. Also stars are George Scott, Peter Gallagher and Josef Sommer. <br /> <br /> Sunday February 25, 1996 - T.V.
