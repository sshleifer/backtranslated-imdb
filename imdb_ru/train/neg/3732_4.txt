Perhaps because I was so young, innocent and washed when I saw him, this film caused many sleepless nights for me. I have not seen this since I was in the seventh grade at a Presbyterian school, so Iâ€™m not sure what effect this will have on me now. However, I will say that it impressed me ... and most of my friends. This served its purpose, at least, until we were old enough and knowledgeable enough to analyze and create our own opinions. I was especially frightened by what new Christians had to endure after their admiration, when I did not receive the mark of the beast. I do not want to spoil the film for those who have not seen it, so I will not mention the details of the scenes, but I can still imagine them in my head ... and it was 19 years old.
