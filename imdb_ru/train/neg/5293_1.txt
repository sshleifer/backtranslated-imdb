I took this video after reading the text on the box, the story seemed good, and Keanu Reeves was in it! But after 5 minutes of watching, I noticed how terrible his game was: he walks and speaks so stupid all the time that it is fake and not convincing. Everything does not end there, almost ALL characters act so badly that it’s ridiculous, the only acceptable actor was Alan Boyes (David), but the guy commits suicide early and you don’t see him anymore, you don’t even know why he did it! Everything in this film shouts about low quality, I can not believe how such a thing is released! Many times I was tempted to stop looking, in fact I did, halfway through this, I decided to stop looking and turned off this thing, came to IMDB to check what others were thinking about it, I found zero comments (not surprised) so I decided to force myself to cope with the pain and return to finish it, and then come here to comment on it. The only good thing (for me) was the topic of a rock band in high school, episodic guitar playing and singing, but it wasn't worth it. <br /> <br /> Very bad acting and directing ... Awful movie,
