Bela Lugosi, an evil nerd who sends poisoned orchids to brides on her wedding day, steals the body in her fake ambulance / hearse and takes her dwarf helper home to extract ferrous juices to keep Bela's wife ever young. Some second-class actors playing detectives try to solve a terrible, terrible secret. Bela Lugosi copes well with this, but you can say that he needed money. <br /> <br /> This film is absolutely terrible, and it would be better for most actors to stick to the waiting tables, but the plot is amazingly funny. Tell someone what is happening in it, and they often laugh and demand to watch a movie. I bought a DVD at discount store 2 for 1 pound, which, in my opinion, is a fairly accurate estimate, and anyone who pays more for it will be out of his mind.
