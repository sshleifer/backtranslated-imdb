From the cronyism of the world of cronyism there is another click of the trash in the fashionable wrapper. CQ talks about an unconvincing, messy mess in a story that is nothing more than a bunch of silly cartoons, babe and straight man Davis, running around trying to make a silly science fiction film. I can't think of a reason why someone wants to spend time with this ridiculous attempt to make a film. (D)
