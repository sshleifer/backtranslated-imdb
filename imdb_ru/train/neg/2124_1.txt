This film tells the story of Eddie, mentioned in the title, and his return home to his old friends in the seaside community. The plot affects a group of friends, because it turns out that Eddie left as a means to cope with the death of a friend, in which he feels somehow responsible. But this is irrelevant, since the choice made in production is extremely poor and not fully implemented. Scenarios do not always have to be "talkative", but they should at least help the development of the story. Here, in one line, such attempts as "he just took off" or "I know that you have no love in your heart," just cause something worthy of the attention of the audience. Also, whenever the writer feels at a loss for where to go next, he switches to a musical installation of the main character, walking along the fields, to some kind of indie-mood music. Talk about trying your best. If you are interested in a good movie, a type that gives quality and content, and not just style, then this movie is not for you.
