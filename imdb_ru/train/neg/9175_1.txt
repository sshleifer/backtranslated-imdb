This is the worst movie I've ever seen. This film is really consistent with the quality of films such as "THEY" and "Cabin Fever," but even those had famous actors who did not succeed. The 50-year-old woman with a bad face lift looked like the eye of candy. (just an example of quality). I would rate this film negatively, if possible. Ladies, I have to tell you that men looked good, but not so much. If you plan to watch this movie, I highly recommend saving your money.
