I think this cartoon is one of the worst cartoons I have ever watched. I would recommend this cartoon to people under 5 years old. I liked this show when I was 4 and 5 years old, I still watched it, only when there was nothing. Now I’m still 5 years old, and I’d better do my homework than watch it. The cartoon was a little ridiculous, but not enough to make me laugh. Now I'm older than I'm interested in the witch show, they did not appreciate us. I started watching Doctor Who (12A), Torchwood (15) and Sarah Jane Adventures (PG). I am interested in what to do with Doctor Who, so I am not interested in 5-year-old cartoons. This cartoon did not last long, it was only 6 seasons, it was canceled, because there were few viewers, but some people say that it’s because the authors didn’t have enough ideas, but for most other shows they have at least 8 seasons .
