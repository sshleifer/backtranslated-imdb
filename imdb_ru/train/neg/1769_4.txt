First preview 04/29/2007 - 4 out of 10 (directed by Mick Harris): in the Stephen King film, similar to the vampire Campi, there are so many strange and stupid elements that you start laughing at incredible weirdness about 3/4 of the way to the film and you wondering if this movie could have a cult for King fans. This is a story about a mother and son who are lunatics (shape-changing felines, eating flesh, needing life, close to an extinct humanoid breed), who are moving from city to city in search of virgins to feed in order to sustain their lives. They are met as fairly normal people from the upper class, except for the fact that they are secret lovers, and cats are hanging around outside the house, day and night. Cats are deadly to them, so they set traps in their yard to try to suppress the population. We see how they break their necks when they attack (which is also the first in my film) - I hope none of the real cats were hurt in making the film. The boy pursues a cute girl he is in love with until he turns into a “sleepwalker” and then he just wants her body. There is so much uniqueness in this film that it might be better if it was a satirical comedy about suburban life, but instead the director tries to scare you every couple of minutes until you want him to just put up with it and draw blood. In the end this happens, and the film ends with a typical ending for Stephen King. The film is interesting because King’s humor is more pronounced than usual, but its oddity is also very present, and you have a film that his fans will probably like and need in his collection, but as a decent impression of the film, he really don't cut it.
