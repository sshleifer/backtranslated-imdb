I'm a bit of a fan of Lynch, so I was excited when I found this DVD. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. This is a series of short cartoons that try to show a disgusting and disgusting kind of humor. The animation is very raw, no doubt made using Macromedia. In every cartoon, a big fat guy beats up his family and behaves like a jerk with everyone he knows. <br /> <br /> For people who are not familiar with this animation, they are likely to be somewhat impressed. However, if you spent a lot of time on Newgrounds.com, like me, then these cartoons will not be different from any other things you have seen before. Many of the popular amateur artists on Newgrounds do a much better job than what was shown on this DVD. If Lynch had presented this work on the website, then he would have been perfectly combined with some of the best Newgrounds artists. But, since I saw it on DVD and not on Newgrounds, I give it 4/10, not 7/10, as it would have been otherwise. These cartoons are suitable for the Internet, but with a name like David Lynch, I expected better quality in both the plot and the animation.
