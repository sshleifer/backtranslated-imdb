I grew up watching Batman’s original animated series, and I'm an avid collector of Batman’s graphic novels. With a comic book hero as iconic as Batman, there are certain traits that cannot be changed. Creative freedom is fine, but when it completely changes the character, then it is too far. I bought one of the seasons of "Batman" in the hope that the extra bonus feature could shed light on the motives of the creators who made this show such an atrocity. In an interview about the creation of "Batman", one of the artists or writers (I'm not sure which one) said that "we felt that we should not mess with Batman, but we could mess with villains." So they turned Joker into an immature little child asking for attention, Penguin - in some incitement to the anime, Mr. Vries - who stole a precious stone, Poison Ivy - into a teenage hippie and countless other shameful acts that Bob Kane did turn over in his grave. <br /> <br /> To summarize, I would like to have more hands so that I can show this show FOUR DISASSEMBLY DOWN. He squeezes in my rating from 2 out of 10 simply because he uses the name of Batman. Warner Bros ... rethink this! You are welcome!
