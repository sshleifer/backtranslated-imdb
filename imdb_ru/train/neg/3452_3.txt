I decided to watch the film at the recent Dubai Film Festival, because it was selected in the prestigious section of the Cannes Film Festival competition. I was surprised that Cannes can be so inconclusive in assessing quality. <br /> <br /> As some reviewers point out, there are not too many shots in shooting, but violence is inherently disgusting. Imagine that you are killing your enemy / rival in front of your little son ... or forcing someone to eat a porcelain spoon to prove your loyalty. There are some hints of contrasting sons of Corleone in The Godfather of Kopolly, who seem to pop up here in this Sino-Hong Kong film, but the quality of these two is just as distinct from chalk and cheese. <br /> <br /> This movie is recommended only for violent addicts. There is no good movie. At best, this can be considered better than the normal production of Run Run Shaw for production values.
