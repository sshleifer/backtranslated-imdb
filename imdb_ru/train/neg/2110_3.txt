Now I love Bela Lugosi, do not misunderstand me, he is one of the most interesting people who have ever made a film, but he, of course, made his share of clowinders. This is just another one of them. <br /> <br /> Lugosi plays Dr. Lorenz, a doctor who received a medical license for unexplained reasons. However, he is conducting experiments to keep his wife young and beautiful. She was found to be 70-80 years old, but Lugosi seems to be in his mid-50s, so why he was married to this old woman was not explained. <br /> <br /> In any case, these procedures or experiments were to give the brides on the altar some kind of sweet-smelling substance, as a result of which they faint, but it is believed that he is dead. Then Lugosi and some of his assistants steal the body on the way to the morgue and return it to their laboratory, where it is in some kind of limbo or catatonic state. Then the abducted brides have a rammed needle somewhere in their bodies, maybe in the neck, and then the needle hits the body of Lugosiâ€™s wife to bring her back to youth and beauty. We never see where Lugosi sticks a needle or what he pulls out of brides, but this somehow restores his wife. Obviously, old age makes you cry out in pain, because Lugosi's wife screams a lot until she returns to her young state. Helping Lugoshi in his lab is the only good thing in this film ... a strange old witch and her two deformed sons ... one son is a big, lumpy, slow acting guy who likes to caress dormant brides and the other son is a mean little dwarf .. A small person to be politically correct in the modern world. At night, these three just sort of accumulate and sleep in the dreary Lugoshi Lab below. Who these three men and how they became frightened assistants of Lugosi, like many things in this film, is never explained. <br /> <br /> One way or another, a female reporter gets an assignment from her rude editor to find out where all the stolen brides are going. She quickly finds out among all the stolen brides there is one rare orchid that is found on them. So she asks around and says that a world-famous expert on orchids lives nearby, who happened to be the one who developed this particular orchid. This expert turns out to be a creepy doctor Lorenz. She quickly tracks him down and upsets his little house of horrors. I'm not sure where the police were during all this, but they came to clean up after the reporter did all the dirty work. <br /> <br /> It seems that in Lugosi films there was always some unnecessary stupid storyline that just made it all stink into heaven. I mean the world famous expert on orchids, who kidnaps brides, sending them a dope to an orchid, did he develop as known? D'OH! <br /> <br /> And then it turned out that young ladies do not need to be brides in order for the procedure to work, so why would Lugoshi not begin to abduct brides from strictly protected churches for his experiments and create all the attention and newspaper headlines? Why not just grab a prostitute from the street, as an ordinary pervert would do? This jerk reminded me a lot about the other bastard Lugosi, "The Devil Bat" .... the same stupid plot lines and bad behavior and the same stupid "reporter gets the bad guy." <br /> <br /> But Lugosi is always good - he is creepy enough and sinister enough to interest you even enough to keep watching him. The woman playing the reporter was just a terrible actor .... she didn't have any emotions, she just pronounced her lines like a machine gun, spewing them as fast as she could. Everything else is also greatly undermined when it came to the fact that they became good actors. <br /> <br /> But this thing is watchable, if only for fans of Bela Lugosi. Lugosi has always been so intense, even when the picture was a dog. He must have known what horrible pictures he was doing, but perhaps he also knew that if he had given all that he had, this intensity could shine through all the bad plots and bad behavior that surrounded him. <br /> <br /> And he was right. We, the horror fans, will always have a love for Bela Lugosi. He was in front of the camera. We give you two fucking bela.
