Hey, look, deal with this, there are much better images of the difficulties of black America than this. Although I think this story is weak, my criticism is focused on the poor performance of the story I mentioned on the hits. <br /> <br /> This was done in the mid-80s and terrible in music / Accounts department. It's funny to see Oprah as a newly minted whore. <br /> <br /> The scene where Bigger shoves Elizabeth McGovern into an incinerator. Pure classic movie. First, I don't care how drunk you are, you will react to the 1200F flame (no matter how badly you play). But they really milked this scene ... it was funny. I will tell you that, though, I was very pleased to see Elizabeth McGovern burn in a fake death; she annoys me.
