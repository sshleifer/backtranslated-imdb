Watching this movie for an action movie is more of a waste of time, because fake people act better on ships than people. It is mercy that Anthony Quinn could not convince anyone to allow him to make any other films after this turkey. <br /> <br /> But he is full of entertainment value, since Yul Brynner has hair, Lorne Green shows unconvincingly French accent and the rest of big names go around in comics.
