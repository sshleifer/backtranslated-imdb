I was very, very disappointed with this film. it started really well, and created some great atmosphere and tension, but when he finally got to the "monster" opening ... it turned out to be just a nutcase with skin problems ... again. Partying. Another film about crazy ... as if they are no longer enough. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the “creep” is really disturbing, and how it moves, and strange sounds. he makes it pretty creepy, but I'm tired of making a film like this, only to find that the monster is a man, albeit a perverted, insane, bizarre. When I saw all the control rats early, I was hoping for some freaky hybrid monster rat model ... it was such a disappointment when the Creep was discovered. <br /> <br /> On top of this, some things in this film do not make sense. (Spoiler) <br /> <br /> What the hell is a creep killing a guard? What is the point, in addition, to attach a great sound sign with the words "Hi, I'm crazy, and I live here!"? This is stupid, and it seems that it only prevents the character Franks Potente from getting help. <br /> <br /> What the hell was he eating there? I got the impression that he was really bricked up, and only an unexpected discovery in this section of the tunnel allowed him to free himself ... so that he chewed rats all the time, and if so, why did they hang around him so much? Why is it so hard to kill? He is thin, emaciated and not at the peak of his performance ... but he seems to keep going, despite injuries that are equivalent to those that damage non-psychotic characters in the film. <br /> <br /> The DVD commentary says that we are meant to empathize with Creep, but I just find it disgusting. This is quite an effective film, but it has spent so many opportunities that it makes me sick.
