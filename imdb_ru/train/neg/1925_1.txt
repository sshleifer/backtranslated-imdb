Ron Howard managed this? The 1966 caricature is charming, teaching a simple lesson to children using a simple plot. In this film, Howard gives us a Whoville, filled with greedy, manipulative, self-centered Whos. Jim Carrey is terrible, but I'm sure it's not his fault; I imagine that the script requires the most disgusting person imaginable, so Kerry sent Tom Green, and the result was movie magic. Just like “Penguin” by Danny Devito in “The Returns of Batman”, “Grinch” Kerry is so unlikely that any comedy that can be obtained by his character simply evaporates. Where the Grinch is depicted in the 1966 cartoon, with which we can all identify ourselves, the Grinch Curry is the wicked, soulless old man we all saw at one time or another, sitting in a parked car, mumbling to himself or stumbling with the babies in the supermarket with his cane This Grinch is completely devoid of any humanity, humor or insight, and his redemption sounds false at the end of the film. The whole movie sounds implausible: there is some silly Christmas lighting competition, an unsuccessful attempt to explain why the Grinch is such a jerk, digging in his childhood, and an incomprehensible mystery why some of them have such a strange extension of the lips and some of them do not . Contrary to the 1966 caricature, I think children find this film tedious, annoying and filled with contradictory messages. Did we really need to see the Slut Smurf, or Christine Baransky, like Martha May Vivier? In addition, Ron Howard filled the cast with his mediocre relatives. Add the necessary anal jokes, farting jokes, sexual jokes and other mandatory humoristic humoristic humor, and you have a film that is about as far from the 1966 cartoon (or the book that inspired it) from George W. Bush. rational, clear thought. Thumbs down on this big fat turkey.
