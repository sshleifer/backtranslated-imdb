I’ll probably get a lot of noise from the hatred of this film - I think I didn’t approach it with the proper placer nostalgia of a generation before me. But suffice it to say that “The Fire of Saint Elmo” was pretty nuts, even with regard to Brat Pack films. <br /> <br /> Here is another excellent example of a smug, smug neurosis, which is all 80s (RENT, anyone?) The plot is almost non-existent, and the philosophy is strange at best, it is poorly presented the rest of the time. The complete absence of something similar to sympathetic characters does not help the situation. There really was no growth, no progress at all. Even the climax of the suicide scene was actually castrated, because she again refused to allow death or anything resembling reality or adulthood to enter. <br /> <br /> Each cookie shape simply makes you hate them in the darkest, most predictable way possible. A stalker is a creep for no apparent reason other than a stalker, and Andy MacDowell is great. The donkey is doing everything possible to constantly remind you that he is, well, an ass. Gorgeous Slut hides a truly emotional, deep pain with a wild way of life. The poet of moods and jokes around the whole 3/4 of the film, until he can reveal (!) He is actually full of teddy bears and the sun and the rainbow. The Virgin finally becomes a whole, happy man after each Virgin wants to make one hot throw in a donkey sack before he throws her to really change (this time for real). Deceiver The bastard is deceiving until it is time to catch him. And finally, feminists pour holy water over any soul that utters a "commitment." <br /> <br /> What brings me to my last complaint - what connection did the supercement hold these people together as friends? I can not imagine myself with one of them. Now think of the whirlwind created by all this narcissism, concentrated in one bar. And they were all so terrible to each other - heads in the toilets, near rape, and slept around with the eternal. Cherry was after the two best guys started behaving like baboons after they fucked a feminist, and she said, “Hm, in fact, I no longer want to be with any of you. Let's be friends! And we can hang out on an awkward day, knowing that I can connect with one or the other at any time, but none of you will be enough to fulfill your obligations (NOT A WORD!). "And they all smile, as if to say:" Damn it, I never thought about it! What a great idea! "<br /> <br /> This is not so. It seems that there is no watching this movie.
