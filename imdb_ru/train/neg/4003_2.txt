Great disappointment. It was one of the best British crime drama / detective shows of the 90s, in which the exciting title character appeared, played by Scottish Robbie Coltrane. However, this disposable material can add little and may suffer from inevitable disappointment due to heightened expectations when the favorite show returns after a long break. Coltrane is not really paid much attention, much more attention is paid to an uninteresting killer, and in what he has to do, he seems inconsiderate, almost bored. The history of the former soldier is written in books, and an attempt to tell us about Coltraneâ€™s family life seems easy. Perhaps, if the authors had a whole series, and not one two-hour show, they would have written it much deeper. Like this, skip this and see the old Cracker from the 90s, which is much better.
