wow, this is the worst movie ever, the only reason i signed up for IMDb was for me to complain about this movie. I never left the theater or stopped the DVD, but I almost stopped this (and should have). but I watched it all until the very end, to again give up on an absolutely terrible ending. Wow, if that's all that Wes Craven can produce, his time is up. I have never seen the first and never after watching. his terrible game with a terrible storyline. Hey, it looks like someone is shining in our mirror, let's check it out. and the sad part is that when this movie was released on DVD, it was completely tested on a blockbuster forever. so I feel bad because of all the people who saw this garbage.
