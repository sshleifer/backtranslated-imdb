I really didn’t like this movie, and I left it on the scene where the British shot a gang of loyalists. The film actually blames the NI people as the cause of their own problems. This suggests that the 25-year war was a matter of intransigence and had nothing to do with the British division of Ireland and the dominance of its history, that is, E.N.I. was created by Britain in 1921, regardless of the wishes of the rest of Ireland. <br /> <br /> Characters are portrayed as unhappy fools, although I despise paramilitary loyalists who fought for the cause - while retaining their artificial privileges over the Catholic community. It is known that British intelligence collaborated with loyalists during the war, no doubt, to keep Catholics at bay and demoralize republicanism. <br /> <br /> The values ​​of the nineties about “masculinity”, masculinity, and so on. Transferred to the 1970s. Belfast and is portrayed as part of a supposedly unique Irish "psyche" that leads to violence. A silly song from a woman in a club - old Ireland green fields ... ugh ... ugh ... - gets a symbolic meaning, that is, poor young fools fighting for an impossible thing. Tedious, historical, cheap and unpleasant trash. O'Sullivan made a personal statement about the conflict, which requires serious political analysis.
