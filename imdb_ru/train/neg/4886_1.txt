Due to budget cuts, Ethel Janowski (who is played by Priscilla Alden again) was released from a psychiatric hospital (although she killed six people) and taken to the house halfway through Nadezhda Varfolomey. Once there, she immediately falls into her criminally insane deeds and kills anyone who stands between her and her food. <br /> <br /> HOLY MOLLY! This movie sucks! You know that you are in trouble when open captions are opened, and they are just the captions from the first movie, apparently taken from the TV screen. Nick Millard (under the pseudonym Nick Phillips) decided to return to the world of Crazy Fat Ethel more than ten years later and with a budget that will probably cover the cost of a blank tape and video camera rental for the weekend. Let's just say Millard's unique style doesn't suit video well. Seriously, I made home movies with more production value than this. And Millard tries to pull out a SILENT NIGHT, A CHEAPLY NIGHT 2, adding half the time to work with the frames from the first film (it looks like it was taken from a worn copy of VHS). Alden is good again, like Ethel, but the film is so inept that you start to feel sorry for her starring in this garbage. I mean, at least the first movie I tried. Here we have no music, weaker effects (if at all possible), shaky camera work, terrible sound and editing that looks as if it was done with two connected VCRs. Avoid this at all costs!
