The film remains in gray for too long. Very little is explained as the film progresses, with the result that a lot of strange episodes appear that seem to have a deeper meaning, but because of the way the stories are told, they become just strange and incomprehensible to watch. It makes you watch the movie again, but I'm not going to do that. This is what I watched this movie in the morning, I'm sure that if I watched this movie in the evening, I would fall asleep. For me, the film was like the Blade Runner of a poor man. <br /> <br /> The film leaves too many questions and incredibles. This makes the film a meaningless and short impression. <br /> <br /> Also, a strange kind of film does not help much. The film is half CGI / half real life, but it is not made half as good, impressive, spectacular and creative as, for example, in later films such as Sin City and 300. They even created half of the characters in the movie using a computer, which seemed like a very meaningless and strange choice, also considering that the character’s animation doesn’t look very impressive. Of course, the futuristic setting still looks good, and the film was obviously not cheap, but his style overestimated the content, and in this case it is not a good thing. <br /> <br /> Some lines are also absolutely terrible and uninteresting. The main God of the film constantly speaks such lines as; “I'm going to do it, but it's not your concern, why I want to do it.” Than just say nothing, Mr. Horus! It’s annoying and very easy to do in a movie if you don’t want to explain something about the plot. In addition, the deeper questions and meanings of the film are entangled in the bustle of the film and its script. <br /> <br /> The actors still tried their best. They seemed to believe in the project and were confident that what they were doing would be something special. Therefore, I can not say anything negative about them. <br /> <br /> History and film is far from original. He robs many classic and semi-classical, mostly modern science fiction films. Perhaps this is the reason why the film made a very redundant impression on me. <br /> <br /> Unsuccessful and uninteresting experiment with the film. <br /> <br /> 3/10
