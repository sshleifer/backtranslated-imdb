Yesterday I went to see this film, and although I did not have high hopes for this film, I was still very disappointed! I really can't believe that I spent 96 minutes of my life watching this movie ... it was awful !!! The storyline was shameful, and the actions were terrible (although there were such big names in it as Uma Thurman). This film relied heavily on its special effects ... but they personally did not affect me. I sincerely wished that id never watched it, and I strongly recommend everyone not to watch this movie. It’s a waste of money and you’ll end up disappointed. My advice is to save money, go shopping, treat yourself, just don’t go and watch this movie ... You will live to regret it, lol!
