I love cheese horror movies. I don't care if the acting is below par or the monsters look trite. I liked this film, except for the amazed feeling from the beginning of the film to the very end. Listen, I don't need a 10-page dissertation or a sign with large letters explaining the plot to me. But the Dark Floors take "what is this film about?" thing to a whole new (annoying) level. What is this movie about? <br /> <br /> This is not very scary or exciting, but if you have an hour and a half to kill and / or you want to experience frustration and confusion, rent this winner.
