I was very pleased to find this film in the local video library - Cary Grant in the comedy series in services, directed by Stanley Donen, what don't you like yet? This is the film that makes me think about two things: when did all the participants (including some famous names) realize that they had a turkey in their hands, and what was the worst of a number of competing aspects? I'm still thinking about the first, but my vote for the latter goes beyond the winding storyline, ahead of the verbose, sometimes pretentious scenario, an uncertain tone, the lack of consistent and well-developed characteristics and the lack of understanding between the characters. You have to add to the criticism a very uneven action, but it is clear that the actors struggled with this material and, moreover, seem to be not sufficiently rehearsed. Quite often, they can barely draw their lines fast enough. Cary Grant tries to portray his usual charming and polite personality, but at times it seems difficult and shy in his delivery. However, I must say that I was relieved when the initial assumptions that his character would be paired with the unspeakably vulgar Jane Mansfield would disappear with the advent of Susie Parker. What do you like about the movie? - For me, mainly the beauty of Parker, who also acts with restraint and dignity Grace Kelly. Generally speaking, the film is a pleasure to watch. The naval characters are very smart in their form - but you really have to be surprised by the awful black tunics of Fu Manchu they wear in their luxurious hotel room. Even Grant cannot look elegant in his. Returning to the credits, Ray Walston is doing a commendable job with his character, and I was interested to hear how pre-Hogan's hero Werner Klemperer spoke without a supposed German accent!
