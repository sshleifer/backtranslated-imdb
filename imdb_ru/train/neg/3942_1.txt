My God, what a terrible movie. The film involves all the right people, unfortunately, it is not worth watching. I saw it for free at my local library. If I paid to watch this, I would be even more upset. This movie is not available for viewing. How could Tarintino be involved in such a slow, uninteresting film? It is not surprising that this was not widely spread; it must have been a shame for everyone involved. I can make a better movie with a dated video camera and a thumb. It's boring, I really hated it. Tarintino just lost some positions in my eyes. This must be some kind of sick joke. Do not worry about this movie. If someone even hints that you should watch this, kill them.
