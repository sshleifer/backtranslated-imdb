BLIMEY! Pretty awful things. Richard Burton / Elizabeth Taylor road show lands in Sardinia and meets artistic director Joseph Losey for this strikingly ill-conceived Tennessee Williams fiasco. Taylor plays a rich, dying widow holding a fort over her minions on the island, where she very loudly dictates her memories to an incredibly patient secretary. When the wretch Burton appears stating that he is a poet and an old friend, Taylor realizes that her time is up. Extremely ridiculous - it's hard to tell if Taylor and Burton are behaving badly or Williams' intention to make their characters so unattractive. If so, the game is great! Burton mumbles his lines, including the word "BOOM" several times, and Taylor screams. She is really terrible. The same goes for Noel Trus, like Katie Taylor, "The Witch of Capri." <br /> <br /> Presumably, BOOM talks about the passing time and how fast life is moving - two standard themes of Williams, but Losey sent him so mistakenly that Taylor and Burton didnâ€™t tell the audience about them during mostly meaningless monologues, any substance that was in the film would be completely diluted. <br /> <br /> BOOM really takes amazing photos - the camera had to be out of focus to spoil the beauty of Sardinia! In the role of the second plan are Joanna Shimkus, the great Romolo Valley as the resourceful doctor Taylor, and Michael Dunn as her nasty guard-dwarf ... and he and his dogs make a series on Burton!
