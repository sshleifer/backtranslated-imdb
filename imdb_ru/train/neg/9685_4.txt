I do not know about you, but I have always felt a craving for the movie "ART". The first “feature” film that I managed to get was “Cook, Thief, His Wife and Her Lover” Peter Greenaway, who blew my mind and creative mood. The film was an absolute paradox, both beautiful and grotesque ... this is what “artistic cinema” is, exploring intellectual ideas and purposefully bringing out the intuitive to the screen. Life, real life can be like life in an insane asylum, and art, expressed by expression, shows what it is. I love films of all types, but especially those that both entertain and have something to say, whether I agree with their position or not ... <br /> <br /> "8 1/2 WOMEN" is dry, a clinical comedy where father and son collect a harem to make their many sexual fantasies come true. In the film there is only a very brief hint at Fellini, in contrast to what was offered in the preview. The film focuses on the “close” relationship between father and son, collected after the death of mothers. In the early scenes of the film, the sadness of the fathers is believable, you can feel its pain. What happens next is clear by the standards of Greenway: collecting a harem, observing love and death, as well as showing the flesh in the name of the flesh ... You can argue about this, but I feel that the film is shallow and meaningless. And the thought that it might be a comedy puzzles me. For the most part, if everything is in order, ... Polly Walker and Amanda Plummer are especially good (although poor Mandy should wear her own clothes). What the film lacks is a compelling story, and the usual Green touches of the surplus that made his other films look so wonderful. <br /> <br /> Despite insight and occasional taboos, “8 1/2 Women” is too cut and pasted to be considered art, too soft to be considered “fun”, and simply too boring to be considered worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Save your money ... I can only recommend this film as a sleeping pill. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
