I like Jane Austen's novels. I like the books and films “Pride, Prejudice, Feeling, and Sensitivity,” and I'm halfway through Mansfield Park. But I can't stand Emma. After two chapters, I was disappointed in the book, and by the end of the movie I didn't give a damn about Emma. It seems she has not changed at all. Perhaps it was a game of Paltrose (which is great in Se7en) or lack of interest in the film. I do not know. <br /> <br /> The costumes are good, but the dance was awkward compared to the Pride and Prejudice dances of Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehl. <br /> <br /> I gave him 2 mostly because the Knight was damn great, and although it was a rather ambiguous performance for Evan McGregor, I liked his singing.
