Franco Rossi's Italian six-hour mini-series “Quo Vadis” of 1985 is a very curious beast that creates an absolutely convincing Roman world, which was shot in essence (very few long shots, not big city landscapes), but muffling drama. in favor of allusions to classical literature and history, that history is constantly lost in the background. <br /> <br /> The shifting structure (most of the first episode is played out using voice by letter) and the lack of narrative urgency make the full six-hour version, at the same time demanding and unpretentious, and, of course, too often not including for that. The two main strengths are the characteristics of Petronius (who, fortunately, is called Frederick Forrest, whose own voice will almost certainly smooth his dialogue), a man who had been searching for an insightful angle to survive in court life, that he was unable to experience emotions, and Klaus Maria Brandauer's unique view on Nero as an imitator actor, each step and action of which is calculated on how his “audience” will get it. Elsewhere, Max von Sydow appears briefly in several episodes, being rewarded with the most impressive and truly touching scene of the show, where he meets a child when he tries to leave Rome. This is what the show could do with most, but too often, to smooth out every potentially emotional, inspiring, or exciting moment under his relentlessly restrained direction. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Francesco Quinn makes an incredibly anonymous hero, merging with the walls and acting as a Roman officer less than this quiet, slightly ruthless, but inoffensive guy who works in the same office as you, who never says a lot at office parties - you know, the one you think about is called Dave or something like that. The budget constraints become very noticeable as soon as the “Meet the Lions” time for Christians and Ursus in a battle with a bull is so strongly restrained that it just passes over you before the show suddenly loses interest and ends suddenly. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid this is not a trip that I can particularly recommend, but if you go to her, she is not entirely without her small awards.
