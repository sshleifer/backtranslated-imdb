The film mainly tells about the return of the Russian prostitute to her native village for the funeral of her sister / girlfriend. There are several other minor storylines that may actually be more interesting than those taken, but they are not fully understood. The essence of the film is the funeral, the commemoration and subsequent debates about the future of the crowns' community, which make the dolls and sell them to buy vodka, but now they miss the artist who made their dolls marketable. Apparently, the film is not edited. The journey of a prostitute from town to village is a painful endless train ride and a tramp through the mud. Perhaps this should strike us with the immensity of the Russian landscape. The village itself, as it is, is inhabited by a legion of widows and one man, the spouse of a dead girl. The continuation of the puppet business is problematic for all participants and ultimately seems impossible. Much of the film is shot using a handheld camera that can cause nausea. Another problem for Western viewers is that the subtitles do not include songs and crowns crying. Do not go to this film if you do not speak Russian.
