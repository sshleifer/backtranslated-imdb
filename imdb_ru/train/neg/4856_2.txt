As for my life, I can’t understand the blind sensation and devotion to this absolutely incredible film ...... and I think that I have enough qualifications to say this ... I’m a former Special Operations soldier from the age of 14 in the "image life "... This film was completely unreal and clearly written by someone who very little studied life in the army, in battle, or at the level of a team or a platoon. <br /> <br /> Three guys from EOD Wander around Baghdad alone ????? Realize ... No chain of commands ????? Get Real ... EOD cleansing buildings ??? Get Real .... EOD / Military intelligence / Sniper qualified dollar sergeant ???? Become a reality ... Wait ... I shot the bad guy and then I let the two guys pick me up without taking another shot or getting injured at all ???? Implement .... I hijack an Iraqi civilian, while I am armed with only 9 million weapons, break into another civilian house, get punched by his wife, and then return to the camp on foot in the center of Baghdad at night without as much scratching or confrontation ???? Make a reality ... <br /> <br /> The military protocol {Army} is absolutely not observed and there is no resemblance to any division of the army that I have ever encountered. Absolutely incredible and disrespectful towards EOD men and women who, contrary to this bad film, are not wild adrenaline searching for yahoos, but extremely skilled professionals who do incredibly hard work.
