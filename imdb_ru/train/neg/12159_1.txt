I can't believe that I really watched it, but I think I just wanted to know if this movie would become unintentionally funnier and funnier by the end. and did it. the culmination was the worst performance ever given by defense counsel — so much from real life that it was too strange even for a fictional story. no one on this planet can act like she is in court. and probably the worst attorney on earth. why was he in court anyway? he did nothing and absolutely nothing to prove her guilt. a simple search for her at home would lead to a search for rings. but don't go. he preferred to say "objection" 2 or 3 times during the whole process - that's all. the crazy blonde got the truth drug to prove her innocence, but not Brett. the madman almost had Brett's altar in her house, which could prove her sick obsession. but don't go again. during the trial, I felt the silent desire to remove the needle from her hand and hit her on the head several times. even real geeks don't look as stupid as “I'm innocent” like she is. and what does this film tell us? Never marry a woman with life insurance: as soon as she falls down the stairs, her husband will be thrown into prison, guilty or not. evil, evil people.
