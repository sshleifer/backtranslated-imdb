Mann superbly photographs the rocky mountains of Alberta, and Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan give pleasant experiences, as they always do. <br /> <br /> But come to Hollywood - Muni, who speaks to the residents of Dawson, Yukon, so that he chooses himself as a marshal (yes, a marshal!) and himself abides by the law, and then the militants fight in the streets for control of the city? <br /> <br /> Nothing even remotely resembling what happened on the Canadian side of the border during the gold rush in Klondike. Mr. Mann and company seem to have taken Dawson City for Deadwood, the Canadian North for the American Wild West. <br /> <br /> Canadian viewers should be prepared for a pleasant war in the spirit of Reefer Madness with this ridiculous storyline, or shake your head in disgust.
