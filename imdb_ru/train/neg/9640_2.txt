I was always interested in learning about this film, because it is so hard to find, so when I stumbled upon it on Ebay, I forked over $ 10 and bought it, now I understand why it is so rare! This film is SO bad, so badly written and hopelessly low-budget, that the end credits, which show all the cutting-edge scenes where they felt for their lines, are literally the highlight of the film. The film is about a psychic (Pettydzhon, filmed for one obvious reason, her scene is topless), who uses her abilities with the help of an experimental machine to draw objects from another dimension into this reality. When she pulls out a box that looks like an item, the military casually tosses him into the open back of a single-soldier truck to guard him, and who the hell do you know? SURPRISE! A child appears in the costume of a monster of foam rubber, instantly kills a soldier with a scratch on his face, and then runs off to the nearest town. But instead of deploying half of the county armed forces to find him and protect the public responsible for this, just give Pettydzhon and Ray the opportunity to find him on their own, but despite everything, this film still loses its credibility. This hardly evades the fact that 1 was voted for me: just because of unintentional laughter, someone should warn the producers of “Mystery Science Theater 3000” if they still don’t know about it! 2 out of 10 is really very bad!
