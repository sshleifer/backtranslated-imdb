SPOILERS (WITH RESPECT TO NO, WHICH DIDN'T SPREAD IN THE FIRST TWO MINUTES OF FILM) <br /> <br /> Robin Williams is really good at this as a friendly, lonely, emotionally weak loser Xi. He makes a very human, even a sympathetic psycho, and really disappears in character - a considerable feat for such a recognized performer. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the rest of the film is such a waste. Supporting performances (and performers) will not look out of place in the soft core of porn (it doesn't help that every character, but Sy is made from 100% cardboard). At times, the director seems to be trying to upset the unknown: from the very first moments we know a) that C is complete nonsense, b) that he survived, and c) that the cops grabbed him for the end. Thus, all that remains for us to think about is “how” and “why”, and the answers provided are not that interesting. <br /> <br /> The plot is stupid and contrived, with some meaningless moments (for example, the husband scolds his wife for her dear taste, although she seems to spend all her free time at the local supermarket with discounts). About two-thirds of the way, C does something so irreparably stupid that the question arises of how much he really cares about his scheme of great revenge. And the last clichéd explanation of his psychosis, right from Peeping Tom, is a terrible find. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is absolutely the worst. It is not overwritten, not awkward, not unbelievable and not bad in any other sense that can be considered funny, even for fans of bad movies. Instead, each line is purely, terribly functional - as if the director handed a plot outline to a newspaper copywriter and said: “Hey, I need a workable script for this — in an hour.” Honestly, it made me want to scream. <br /> <br /> This film seems to take us back to the suburban militants of the eighties and nineties when they need help (for example, “The Hand That Swings the Cradle”) and although it is certainly unpleasant, in fact it never not scary. Sometimes C's fetishism makes you feel uncomfortable, but this alone is not enough to make the film work. In the end, the lack of skill of all participants, except Robin Williams, omits this one. 3 out of 10
