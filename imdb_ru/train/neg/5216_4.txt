“Metamoprhis” is a story about a young scientist revered at a local college that is being investigated by the financial institutions of the college. This forces him to choose typical melodramatic melodies in a bad Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> The first thought that came to me after this film was as follows. "Not good, but not bad, for the beginning-mid-eighties." Of course, I then realized that this was done in 1990, which almost brought him to "4", but decided to leave it at the level of "5", which is. <br /> <br /> “Metamorphism” in several cases seems like a good film, desperately trying to get out. The game, although not stellar, but mostly competent. You may even see the occasional shine of modest quality. Work in the movie - a big problem with the film. Thinking that I looked for ninety minutes, I realized that I was watching only an hour. The special effects are not stellar, but the director seems to be competent enough to circumvent this weakness. <br /> <br /> The moderator, a slightly charismatic man who seems to be trying to mix Tom Cruise and Christopher Reeves channeling, most of all reminded me of Matt Dillon's character in Wild Things. The heroine does her job well, but is by no means different. There is the role of "naughty girls", and the actress does everything she can with her, but this is not so much. There is a child actor whose director cannot decide whether he is sullen, cheerful or just plain weird. <br /> <br /> As I said, staggering is the worst problem in this film, right up to the final battle with the bad guy, because of which the Mighty Ranger turns red. This is strange and inexplicable before the final scene, which should be dramatic, but just fun, full of every bad camera trick and replay that can be squeezed in about thirty seconds. <br /> <br /> A decent one-time look at the 'Mill Creek 50 Chilling Movie Pack'. Nothing that will take you back, and nothing that you can buy by itself.
