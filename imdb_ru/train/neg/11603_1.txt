Before the Internet, this film could never be shot, but the idea that the Internet is full of evil is the idea behind it. Unfortunately, that's all - the general opinion is that at present the Internet in these hands can create as much chaos as anybody in real life. Since the late 90s, someone has learned that you can create a virus that will shut down the computer. Meaning? Just doing something bad with a remote control, so this is the cyber equivalent of robbery with violence. What is spam without violence - does it deceive you in parting with your money for so long that it is surprising that someone pays attention to it? from it now so they get smarter and use real names, how to do something illegal is not a priority, we see the Internet get worse than weekly social networking sites or chat rooms that lead to evil and child porn sites that are illegal Thus, the idea of ​​a movie that invites people to click on a name is just the same old thing — in fact, this is a Horrorvision website which is a porn site, but this one kills people who enter their portals. The story, however, is so disconnected that it is boring and does not end there. The final film on this topic about the destruction of the Internet provider has not yet been made, but it is obvious that many MUST destroy, since they will not be closed when the money will be made. To call this a horror movie is rather deceptive, because it does not scare you to be bored.
