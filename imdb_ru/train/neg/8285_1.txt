This is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. Jessica Simpson not only lacks acting skills, but the script is incredibly shallow and lame. You really hear a serious dialogue that sounds like this: "I love you more." "No, I love you more." I stopped watching the movie (online) after the first half hour, I could no longer. Her "southern charm of a girl" simply does not work and is really very annoying; her attempts to get humor failed, and she says the lines as if she were reading the script right off the page. <br /> <br /> Poor Luke Wilson. Did he not read the script before agreeing to do this, or did he fall for the promise of Pope Joe (Jessica's father, as well as the producer of the film) about big profits? Hopefully now he knows better than to subscribe to another movie like this one. Luke Wilson is actually a good actor - I hate to see the painful expression on his face when he suffers from a bad dialogue. <br /> <br /> In addition, I think that the previous commentator who gave this film 8 out of 10 probably was either participating in the film in any way, or hired by Papa Joe to give the film a better rating. No one in their right mind would find this film attractive. <br /> <br /> Jessica has a lot of money, right? Maybe buy acting classes?
