I'm all for the “bad” horror movie, but it was just a bunch of dogs! How someone can call this movie cool or decent, I can not do it. If you like snap editing to cover special effects, a bad game and a bad script, then do it! There was no expectation, and the blood factor was ridiculous because it was so fake. I'll take Hostel or Wolf Creek over this bunch any day. My partner gave up after about 20 minutes, she knows the stench when she sees one. On the other hand, I stupidly sat through the whole film, just to wait and see if it would get better. There is no such luck! I did not send it to another Torched film, and I doubt that I will worry now
