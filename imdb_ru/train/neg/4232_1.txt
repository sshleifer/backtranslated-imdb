Karl Jr. and his father now run an army on a remote island. They capture a trio of guys who stumble upon an island. Who after some time to fight back. (well survivors) This has non-stop blood, blood and bloodbath that would be good if some of this looked remotely real, or if the production did not look as if it was made with a weekly accumulated dinner money (perhaps I overestimate them (it was probably worth a couple of days). The terrible dubbing didn't bother me much, and I suspect that if I were really drunk, then some of them CAN be slightly funny ... maybe. But in fact, after just 78 minutes, the film still seemed too long ... Oh, I don't know ... 78 minutes. Do not waste time. <br /> <br /> My rating: F <br /> <br /> Additional info on DVD: Bonus film: “Zombies of the 90s: Extreme motion sickness”; and trailers for other films released by Shock-o-Rama
