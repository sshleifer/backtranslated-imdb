I thought that this is a continuation of a sequel, and it is intended for the original in 1983. But the sequel does not take the original plot and does not destroy it. <br /> <br /> In fact, I had very few expectations for this film, but I just spent 95 minutes of my life. No waiting - I really feel clairvoyance, a bad game and so full of technical errors that I, as a computer fan, simply could not believe it. They tried to mix the war film and 24 hours a day. But it is not even worthy of a low-budget television film. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie, itâ€™s a waste of time. Instead, get the original. The topic remains valid. Do not let a lot of energy into the car. And the action and plot is much more exciting and exciting.
