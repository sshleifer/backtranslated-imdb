After watching Tobe Hooper's crocodile pearl in 2000, I showed great interest in the college / crocodile niche in the exploitation / monster genre. I look forward to a wayward producer who will continue several sequels of these delicious sweets of camp good. If only Ed Wood could bring his delicate sense of talent and dignity to these wonderful scenarios. With Ed, writing scripts, and a room full of monkeys creating special crocodile effects on the computer, all we need is a cast of crocodile feed with Russe Meyer's breasts and Rena Hook's breast implants. <br /> <br /> While Tobe Hooper's crunchy opus referred to his own films, Blood Surf decided to release a bunch of aging themes from the chat of other films. See if you can take a look at the “Revenge of the Fools” sequels to find allusions / homage / passages in Jaws, Temple of Destiny, Indiana Jones' Last Crusade, Convent, Godzilla 2000 and any James Bond movie. In addition, try to find ready for TV attenuation, where the editor was disappointed in understanding the material. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed that the earthenware jar was not able to try out his tenor sotto voce with a monologue on environmental protection ... or hooliganism, but quasi-captain Ahab from this story really speaks in the spirit . Perhaps in the coming years we will see a clay jug jumping after a firefight on a golden sunset. Or, I hope, the monkey will drop a crocodile into the toilet of the international space station for dwarfs and enjoy the exploitative waltz of the bloodshed of monkeys / dwarfs / crocodiles in weightlessness. <br /> <br /> In general, the lack of an annoying surfing strip annoyed me.
