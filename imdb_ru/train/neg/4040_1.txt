I consider myself a bit of a snob when it comes to everything, and although the cinematic experience is more suitable for explosions than for high drama, I too can be very stuck in movies. <br /> <br /> Not all feature films, however, are better than King Kong. I could easily give Kong two stars, doubling the double of this film. <br /> <br /> I think people were so excited about it because it was almost identical to the style of what you can see in the play. For a less perceptive art lover, a movie similar to a play is “great art.” <br /> <br /> This film, however, was useless. <br /> <br /> There was no story so he relied on high drama. The only drama in this film was whether the cat would fall from the roof or not. So, deep and meaningful dialogue? Not. Good game? Hardly. <br /> <br /> Being overly fair: Some of the landscapes were interesting, though: communist apartments, city perspectives (Petersburg?) and Soviet trams still working.
