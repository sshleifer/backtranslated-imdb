The only reason to give this film at least one star is how much the final made me laugh. I had high hopes because I usually love bad summer horror movies, but this was not true. In fact, this is just a bad attempt to slowly show the character in madness, which, again, is a good story, but it is bad here. There are some scenes (like the final) that shouldn't be funny, but actually made me laugh out loud. There were several times when I thought that the film would really go in an interesting direction, but it never corresponds to what it could and should be. In my opinion, if you're looking for a Christmas slasher, try Silent Night, Deadly Night.
