With an absolutely amazing cast and crew, this could be a classic. Instead, this recurring paraphrase of all conspiracy theories that existed in 1979, about the Kennedy assassination, implanted, rather pointlessly, into a vaguely incoherent plot about the assassination of the fictitious President Kegan in 1960. Many of the characters' outstanding actors are lost because they are either not enough to do this - Sterling Hayden or Eli Wallach, for example, or they are asked to go rather rudely - John Houston. Jeff Bridges and Anthony Perkins really manage to express themselves very well, albeit in different ways. <br /> <br /> The photo is great, but it does not justify an hour and a half of your life or the price of buying a DVD.
