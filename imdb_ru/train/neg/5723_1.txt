Anyone who said that this is better than a Hostel, says complete nonsense, believe me, I am not a fan of the Hostel, but this is just ridiculous. It's just another shot on a camcorder, right on a DVD, on which there are few ideas that waste your time, I can't believe how many such films are there, and I still have to watch a decent one. In the films of the 80s, horror and horror films were shot without a budget, but with a wonderful story and many new ideas, and most importantly - with the soul of the director, who had something to say. Now they just seem exhausted in an attempt to trick people browsing in Blockbuster to rent a copy until people stop doing this, then I think these films will continue to appear. There are so few ideas in this film, it’s just amazing how it was ever made, the acting is also terrible, the place is completely unconvincing, and the soundtrack is so annoying that it is hard to believe. This waste of time will do absolutely nothing, unless you want to make a list of the worst films of all time. My best / worst part of the film is when a female character is pointing a weapon at someone and threatening to shoot him, if he does not back down, you can see that she doesn’t even cover the trigger with her finger, just holding the handle. Absolute joke.
