This film might be wonderful (because it has a somewhat exciting premise), but it never rises above pure caricature. The acting game has serious flaws, and there were moments when I cringed so hard that I thought I would fall from my place in the theater. Never, and I mean, never watch this awesome piece ... In recent years, Danish cinema has received a lot of good PR, but if this piece ... crosses the border, I'm afraid no one in their right mind would want to make a Danish movie. This film is the reason why I decided to register here. I really felt that I needed to distract people from this piece .... my condolences are expressed to people who have already gone to the movies to watch it
