well, well, I can not waste time simply because of the large star composition .. I think that all I could see is a bunch of talents who spend their time on the big screen with some kind of humorous humor that I like, I do not know who? Any pathetic songs anyone will hear? what pathetic sharp turns justified by whom? race with time? do you mean wasting time Well, first you spoil your child, and then teach him a lesson. We are so ignorant of this fact, whoever said that this is a brilliant new concept, probably this is some other kind than a man, well, well, let me say that people have a good movie a message should be given, but it could well have been transmitted by a stranger sitting next to you on the bus, instead of going to such a wasteful film to get to know him. Hindi films have already proven this, and I also can't spend my time writing about non-paper waste!
