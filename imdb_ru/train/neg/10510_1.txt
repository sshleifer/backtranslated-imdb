oh my god, where to start ...... bad game .... characters that you just don't give a damn about a huge forest in the middle lane ... <br /> <br /> one big mistake ... they go all a night over these forests ... unless they walk around and around, they would be in Scotland in the morning ... when a tearful knocks down a poor wandering woman .... <br /> <br /> and their mobile phones are not working ... so what are they doing ... of course, they parted easier to get out ... so three go to look for a house that might be there, somewhere in the middle of the desert, and two stay to "take care" of the unconscious a woman ... so that they do rather than make her comfortable, soften her head, cover her or even move her away from the blossoming road, they just leave her lying on the hard road while they go and make fire Yards .... and all the time when they have a caravan, they can put it in ... <br /> <br /> and on the horned angels, who are supposed to be so desirous of the human race that they were expelled from heaven to live among us ... so what do they do? have sex with men they encounter? ......... no, they bite huge chunks and tear their heads off ... I think they are missing the point ... <br /> These are not gorgeous, sexually disadvantaged former angels, they are cannabalistic vampires ... and as for Tom Savini, who talks about how amazingly beautiful they are ... well, these girls have nice bodies, but nothing special in the facial section. the main role was much more attractive than these so-called irresistible sirens ... <br /> <br /> garbage from a 2.30 pound film from my local library ...
