This is definitely one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. I stopped looking after an hour and was very sorry about that. the game is terrible and there is almost no plot. I assume that someone came up with the strange shape of the animal and began to think about the story around it. borrowing some ideas from such films as Resident Evil and Aliens does not lead to the creation of a film similar to them. if this is the best Korean film, I would prefer not to even watch a Korean movie trailer ... <br /> <br /> By the way, these films are a good reason to believe that a high rating means that the movie promises. I think that every Korean who has internet for online games has rated this film for eight, although he has no idea what he is talking about.
