It turned out to be another unsuccessful attempt at a ridiculous science fiction channel. I'm not sure who wrote the script and interpreted the poem, but I'm sure it was some 17-year-old teenager who thought it would be great to have a crossbow in a movie. AAAAAAAH! when I saw this part, I lost all hope. Then ... they set off on a ship on which, apparently, Christopher Columbus walked! when they reach Heoroth (which should be a Norwegian honey hall), the sci-fi group of idiots decided to make it look like a big stone castle. when i saw this part .. i wanted to scream. I really wanted this film to be good, but science fiction has not released a good film yet, so I donâ€™t know why I had hopes. Oh .. and Grendel and his mother are stupid too. (this comment is off-topic about the "Grendel") If someone from the science fiction channel reads this ... there are some good tips. NOT EVERY FILM THAT YOU MAKE, MUST BE ABOUT A BIG MONSTER THAT CAN HALF PEOPLE, WHAT IS NOT THAT ABOUT SCIENTIFIC Fiction! AND ALSO, STOP THE CASTING OF LOW ACTORS, LIKE STEPHEN BALDWIN, TO BE IN YOUR FILMS! THIS DOES NOT HELP FILM, BUT WILL MAKE IT GOOD !!!
