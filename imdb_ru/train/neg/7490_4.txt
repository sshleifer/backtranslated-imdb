This film was disappointing. It was incomplete and boring. While Alec Baldwin tried to portray himself to be an absolutely fair and just prosecutor (not to mention the executive producer), the film never showed any of the defenders, and he did not try to challenge viewers through real, meaningful debates on how a country can go on such a terrible way. <br /> <br /> Of course, no one wants to defend the Nazi point of view, but this was the point of the Nuremberg route! Four hours of just beating the Nazis .... come on! This is already done! <br /> <br /> I really think Alec Baldwin should just be Kim Bassinger’s husband. <br /> <br /> Immediately after the end of the film, TNT showed the 1959 film “Trail to Nuremberg”. This film is much better.
