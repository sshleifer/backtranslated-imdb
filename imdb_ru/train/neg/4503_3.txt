I admired Rob Marshall for Chicago, but Memoirs of a Geisha turned out to be another setback in combining Western and Asian art. In general, the scene is beautiful, but after a hectic accent on exotic-oriented scenes, some may just be fed up with them. Honestly, excessive cherry overdone. This is probably the cultural difference in perception here: absolute beauty is not a spectacular type, since a truly beautiful geisha will not be an overly pro-Western pumpkin in the film. <br /> <br /> Some other comments rightly mention the biggest flaws. As a Taiwanese, I have no doubt that the actress is gorgeous. An actor / actress can play any role when he / she may look like this. Gong Lee is great, but the power of emotion she showed in this film was not translated into Japanese style. All I saw was a bitterly jealous Chinese woman. Michlle Yeoh, one of my favorite actresses, didn't even look like a Japanese. Some comments mention the specific, delicate, feminine characteristics of Japanese women, with which I cannot disagree. They are so delicate that I assume that not even all modern Japanese actresses are entitled to roles in geishas, ​​not to mention two Chinese and one Malaysian actresses who grew up in different cultures and probably did not know too much Japanese culture. <br /> <br /> Geisha is a good way to arouse the curiosity of the American audience. But it would be offensive both for the film itself and for art if the film won an Oscar for the best costume, best director or best picture.
