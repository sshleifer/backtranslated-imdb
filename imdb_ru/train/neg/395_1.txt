When I ordered it from the Blockbuster website, I did not know that it would be as bad as it was. Who knows? Maybe I forgot to take my medication ADD that day. I know that from the moment the actors arrived at their station wagon, wearing it in wide 70s-style collars, in the lower bell and fluffy hair, I realized that this misplaced gem of the disco era is nice for a garbage can. <br /> <br /> The first prediction was just how bad things should have been the narration at the very beginning, trying to explain that the cosmic forces were in the game to wreak havoc on the universe, forcing the polyester and porn-quality music to a potential viewer. From the initial scene with poorly made effects to “monsters” from another world, and then at home, which jumps from universe to universe, it was just as painfully painful as watching the “Vagina Monologues” for elementary school. <br /> <Throughout the film, a sure sign of what was going to happen was the appearance of a small ship. The ship consisted of suspicious parts that resembled old video recorders and video cameras, and attacked anyone in their path. Of course, if he moved slower than Bob Barker’s affected intestines, but he had a formidable thin pencil armature and the ability to emit a sinister green light that could stop the bullets, and was equipped with a laser that could cut simple balsa wood for an hour or two (with some help) . <br /> <br /> Moving on ... As the strangeness and bottom of the bell continues ... We learned that they fell into the "Deformation of space-time." How do we collect this little piece of scientific information? Because the eldest man tells his son that in a more or less strange manner, it recalls the memory of “how you won a big game” over a cup of joe or an icy bottle of refreshing coca-cola. Was pops a scientist? No, but he knew about horses and, apparently, intervened as an amateur in string theory and Einstein's theory. <br /> <br /> The record I was watching on the DVD was almost a bootleg of quality. The sound was muddy, and the program looked like it was taken from the screen of a movie theater with a video recorder on a mobile phone, except for this, it was really, really, very bad. (In fact, there is not enough "really" to describe it). <br /> <br /> I know that some people love this film and compare it with other cult classics. I have never seen this film in its original release, but even then I think I would come to the same conclusion: bury this film quickly.
