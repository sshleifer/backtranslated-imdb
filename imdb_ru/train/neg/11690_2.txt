This is the waistline to indulge such great actors in such a weak and boring film. In addition to all the unanswered questions published in other comments, what is so complicated about capturing burglars? Just remove the bank employees, see who was in the bank - from all angles of the camera shooting - before the robbers enter, and you have 4 more robbers among the hostages. Where is the uncertainty that every body speaks of? It was so obvious that at the moment when the hostages were asked to change into this identical form, they were all going to go out through the front door ... they saw it many times. At the very least, Mr. Spike Lee could spice up the film with a good musical score and artistic photography. The film is not worth it. Pronto!
