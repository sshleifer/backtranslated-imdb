I'm a big, big fan of John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson and Tony Shalhoub. I love Stephen King a little less, but I like some of his work. <br /> <br /> That said, I had to LOVE 1408. <br /> <br /> *** POSSIBLE SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINT **** <br /> <br /> I was walking impatiently. I came out disappointed. <br /> <br /> This is not the fault of the actors. Both Shalhoub and Jackson have very small roles, because the premise of the film puts Cusack in the “The Boy in the Locked Room” script. <br /> <br /> It was not a bad movie, but I can't call it a good one either. It was a messy mess in which there were “oh, it's just WRONG” moments, combined with “oh, it just hurts” and “oh, now it's just unsuccessful” with a very small number of continuous connections between them. Aislin's father appears once, and there is no visible connection with the rest of Mike's personal life, which we see while he is trying to survive in the room. <br /> <br /> The previous commentator described Olin / Enslin’s argument as worth observing, and I very much agree. But besides this, apart from some clever musical signals (the room almost playfully torments Enslin, and gives him one chance to get out before picking up the ante ... at this moment he gives him a countdown clock and the title line from "Carpenters" "We just started. ”) It’s basically“ things pop up when you least expect it! Like horror, which was funny when I was fourteen years old, and surrounded by friends of my age clutching each other in the summer when Jason was chasing Camp Crystal Lake. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film was "let's make him experience some of his most painful experiences," mind game, with "let's liven up pictures in eerie ways" fun cliches. <br /> <br /> **** ** END OF SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> I expected the best from this film with the name of Stephen King attached to it, as well as from the actors I mentioned above. <br /> <br /> We will never know the origin of evil. We will never see the defeated evil, although we can assume that it may have been defeated. <br /> <br /> And the final was just a sharp “What?!” Moment. <br /> <br /> Wait until it appears on the cable. I would not pay for it as a matinee, but I feel a little deprived because I paid the prices for the opening night.
