I can't say that this is the worst movie ever made, but personally I think about it, because when it was first released in theaters, (1) the initial noise was quite positive, and my girlfriend insisted that we watch him, and we actually STOOD IN LINE to get tickets, and (2) it's still the only “serious” movie I remember when the audience started to giggle at a certain point and mostly laughed at the movie to the end. As soon as we reached the notorious (and endless) fight scene with snakes, I think everyone gave up. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can concede is shooting on the set. Oh, and there are also Bo's breasts, although her game is so wooden that the nude is not erotic and does not value much more than the Playboy image. <br /> <br /> “Dramatic tension” in this film between Bo is a terrible game and a horrible direction of her husband. The fight against snakes should be one of the most incompetent "fighting" series ever filmed. However, this is one of those films that are bad enough, perhaps worth a look at the level of unintended humor. Definitely the worst movie I've ever paid to see.
