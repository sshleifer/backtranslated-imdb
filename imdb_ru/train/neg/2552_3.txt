This is stated in the documentary, it is not so, it was shot in some way, as in the documentary, but I suspect that this happened only because they get away with a wobbly camera and sly shooting. It has just been released in the UK on DVD as the "American Pie-Style Comedy", it is not the same. <br /> <br /> Basically, this is followed by a group of teenagers on spring break, when they go to Mexico for cheap booze and with a desire to get there, they finally put a virgin friend. Throw is a pair of dwarfs who are also participating in quests of the same type, and you have a sad story about drunken teens trying to get girls. <br /> <br /> Considering the rating of 18, he has very little nudity, and almost zero sex scenes, basically I think that rating is a swear word, which is plenty. <br /> <br /> If you like the rude behavior of an ass without humor, then this may be your business, if you have brain cells gone then I probably would have avoided it!
