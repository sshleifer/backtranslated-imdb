The storyline is absurd and settling, as well as settling performances and dialogues, it is difficult to keep your eyes open. I advise you to have a caffeinated girlfriend to wake you up in time for a couple of effects of Horus. Why do they introduce Alcatraz? In this case, it becomes increasingly difficult to swallow. All this time I wondered, for whom is this film aimed? A choke full of unconvincing plots (such as the captain of the US army on cannibalism).
