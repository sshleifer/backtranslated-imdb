This is one of those films in which I remember being in a tin can for many years before something happened to him. I don't think it's terrible, but not very good either. Alec Baldwin was pretty good, but the plot is rather fragile at best. The actors are pretty good at what they are given, but again you are only good at the script. Baldwin supervised this, although I could swear that he didn’t manage it all, I thought I read somewhere, or a lot of re-filming was not bad, but he definitely has potential. Although his work on “30 Rock” is nothing but a genius, he should take him some more. I just hope the show gracefully bows in the spirit of Seinfeld, but maybe not even that long. 9 years have passed. So, if you want to watch a movie from which you get little, but you really won't hate, this is for you. I can not remember when the last time the film was wrapped so long before it was released, and only on DVD. It was nice to meet Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins again, as their wonderful, but not many, people saw The Edge. Now take this great movie for real fun.
