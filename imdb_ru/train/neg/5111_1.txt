I used to be an avid spectator until I personally spent long cold hours helping to build a house for the White Family, but I was sick to see the house a year later. All the beautiful rocky landscapes were removed, the magnificent rocky sidewalk and front fountain were removed, all the pines and walnut trees in front were cut down, the sprinkler system was torn out. Now it looks like a disaster zone. They don't even live there anymore ... they live "in the city" and only go out for the weekend. It hurts me to think about all the hours that great Oklahoma people sacrificed to these people, and see the result. The story we all saw on TV was not completely true ... do not believe everything you see and hear.
