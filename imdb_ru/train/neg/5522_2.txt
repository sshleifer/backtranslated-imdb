I was looking for the right words to describe this movie. At first, I was inclined to simply move on to more important issues, since the film does not rise to the level that deserves comment. <br /> <br /> However, I stopped, puzzled by how to describe such things, and somewhat intrigued. The task posed by the question: “What can be said about such a film?” Garbage? No, this is not garbage, garbage can be recycled into something useful. Greenhouse gas? No, this is not a greenhouse gas, and greenhouse gases help plants grow large and healthy. <br /> <br /> Finally, I stopped at the phrase “Not Even Bad,” a reworking of the phrase “Not Even Wrong,” sometimes used in theoretical physics. describe a theory that is hopelessly erroneous and does not even deserve correction. That's all, Georgia. The rule is: not even bad.
