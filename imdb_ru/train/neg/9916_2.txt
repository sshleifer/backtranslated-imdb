Justin goes home to live with his harsh, hard nose a police detective, but it looks like Dad turned the top floor into three self-made apartments, each of which has quaint tenants. Justin's rectangular idealist is immersed in the world of the occult, murder, drunkenness among minors and other vile things. Ho-hum <br /> <br /> Wow, I saw the same movie that almost all other reviewers have seen ??? Intelligent, irresistible, original, intense, intelligent, brilliant ???? !! I have not seen any of this. What I REALLY saw was an uninteresting, boring, banal, extremely clich√©d low-budget thriller that was implausible and not tense at all, as the killer cabled to the film immediately when he gives his monologue / discussion / discussion. And where are these humorous funny moments? I never laughed so hard, perhaps because I was too busy trying my best not to put the film to sleep. <br /> <br /> My rating: D <br /> <br /> More info on the DVD: Audio commentary from director Dave Campfield; The second comment with various authors, as well as individual music tracks; 4 functions (creation from a set, the transformation of 1 room in 4 and inside the black circle); Interviews with Felissa Rose, Desire Gould and Raine Brown; Alternative scenes; bloopers; music video for "Addiction"; The trailer for this film; As well as trailers for the films "Shock-o-Rama", "Sally Chainsaw", "Crawling Skin", "Sinner", "Bacteria", "Creature from Hillbilli Lagoon" and "Millennium Crises".
