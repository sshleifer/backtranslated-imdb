Watching "Surrender, Dorothy" on CBS, I never ceased to wonder why Diane Keaton would like to participate in it (not because this is a television film - with a lack of tempting roles for slightly older actresses, it is not surprising why she won the Oscar ). performers such as Keaton turn to television — but because Keaton has no opportunity to shine). A single mother mourning the sudden death of her twenty-year-old daughter imposes — and gradually becomes friends — a group of young people with whom her daughter was close during her accident. Adapted from the novel, this telecast gives us a group of self-absorbed characters who could cross the street to avoid. In addition to rudeness and vagueness, these fake people are incredibly inconclusive, as is the neat script and bungalow near the beach where children live (one young man wearing muscular shirts to tell us that he is gay, hears Diana Keaton saying, ” Surrender, Dorothy "and actually asks:" This is from the "Wizard of Oz", right? "... no, genius, this is from" Citizen Kane "!). Keaton might have wanted to make this material based on the theme of confrontation death. She is trying to turn this obviously unattractive woman into the shadow of her own a lot of strange outfits, but this doesn’t suit the viewer, as Keaton was always warm and cute and flexible. woman, and becomes the odyssey of the nervous collapse of the mother, who seems to be too hippie.) who never lost anyone near her). This type of film actors are advertised on a talk show with the proviso: "This should help many grieving mothers." I can not imagine that this would help someone, because this is essentially a depressor, confused and confusing. This not normal.
