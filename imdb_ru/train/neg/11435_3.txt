I wish I knew more about this movie when I rented it. I would put him in line on the basis of Heather Graham and her strong authority as an actress (IMHO). While parts of the film were charming, much of the film seemed invented, undeveloped, or otherwise just boring or predictable. Not to mention the ICK factor that many people think that siblings were a couple ... I don't care how much of the storyline that still feels a bit, well, roughly. And Charlie, for the zoologist, she does not seem to be very tuned in to signals from other reasonable people. What was it about her (besides her hotness and some common interests) that made Gray fall in love with her? The story could have been much more interesting with more depth. The best moments are Molly Shannon (although I agree with the reviewer who sometimes annoyed her), the taxi driver in the drag and the dance sequence (if Sam and Gray were such great dancers, I would like us to see more of this because the bits that we showed were really better than most of the rest of the film). It could be better.
