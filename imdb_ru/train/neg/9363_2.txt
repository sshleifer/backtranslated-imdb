There are some fatal flaws in this film: it's incredible how someone can go through the open back door of a medical facility with a high degree of protection. Then the same person just goes around the center and enters the doctorâ€™s office, just writes poorly or edits poorly. <br /> <br /> A very, very, very predictable movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how this film was made, except that it was shot in Canada and probably got a government grant. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the person playing Aaron, Corey Monteith, did a good job. <br /> <br /> If you are not very bored and have nothing more to watch on TV, I would say it will kill some time, but otherwise it is a film that no actor would like to see in his resume.
