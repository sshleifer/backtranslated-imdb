This is an interesting treatment of the subject, which is quite controversial (just read the other comments on this film). Apparently, you either love it or hate it, and most people seem to make this distinction based on whether they believe that the time of grief and end will come, as shown in the film. <br /> <br /> In essence, the film is a prequel - they were made for about $ 1.30 each. Production values ​​are right there with Plan 9 from space, and the action is about the same level as Glen or Glenda (my apologies to Ed Voodoo). Putting aside the religious message, the story is as scary as it comes. Add even the slightest idea that the story may actually be close to what may happen in the future and become even worse. <br /> <br /> This film and its sequel did not attempt to bring to the reasons why grief happened when it happened. "Left behind" and "Omega Code" tried to understand everything that "Thief" was doing, and explain all the policies and maneuvers in the Middle East that led to this. In the end, “The Thief” did a much better job in the scary part of the film, instead of spreading too thin, trying to explain what was happening in the Middle East at the same time. <br /> <br /> Forget politics and watch this film and its continuation, because they are horrible stories. The fact that they can be horrible stories told indirectly by God makes them even more frightening. If he makes you think about the subject, he has done his work - even if you never believe.
