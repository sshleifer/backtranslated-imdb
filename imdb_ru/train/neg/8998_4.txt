Stephen Feinberg, who played the proctologist and was one of the film’s authors, passed away in early 2006. I met Steve in Portland in 1993, it was a year later, when he told me that he was a writer in Hollywood many years ago, working mainly on television promo. He asked me not to see “Tunnel Vision,” but it was too late, I already saw it! In fact, I saw it many years ago when it was released. At the time, I did not think it was a bad movie. However, considering this as an adult, my opinion was somewhat different. Yes, it is a little childish as well as from. Steve admitted that it was not a very good movie. That said he was just a little proud of the sketch of the Proctologist.
