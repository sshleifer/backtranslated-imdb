This film makes Peter an elf in a Robin Hood costume instead of a human boy in a costume, probably not in a Robin Hood costume, and ignores all the personality traits that really matter. This movie makes Wendy an idiot. And poor captain Hook TOTAL clown. And, of course, since in every Disney cartoon there must be a character who had too many hits in his head, they made one of the Lost Guys like that. The only character who was not disgraced in this film is Tink. The only star for her. <br /> <br /> The story itself? Dear parents do not even have enough time to notice that their children have disappeared !!! Probably one of the most important moments in the original story, and they destroyed it! In addition, the famous kindergarten scene between Peter Pan and Wendy is a stunning piece. There are no liners and acorns - one of those little things that makes the original story so unique. Surprisingly, he even lost his shadow, and she helped him to glue it. (Although for his shoes and for me it makes no sense.) <br /> <br /> Destroying such a great story, just to entertain the children, should be illegal. So now know if you didn’t know this before - this version of Disney has nothing to do with the original story - which is not really a child’s story, but simply a great, wonderful story. <br /> <br /> It just annoys me to infinity.
