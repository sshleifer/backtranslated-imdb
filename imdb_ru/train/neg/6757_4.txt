Strange slasher from the film Producer Charles Band. In the days of the greatest success, Full Moon Band said that he would never make "real killer films" because he felt that little puppets and big monsters add an element of fantasy that makes films better - people who kill each other, thus are real and less funny. A good philosophy and a real shame is that Band, destroying Full Moon's studio because of possible crappy business relationships, became so desperate to profit from home theater that he started doing exactly what Blockbuster wanted and therefore sacrificed creativity and originality. The team behind this also worked on “Delta Delta Die!” And “Birth Rite” - both equally soft by the standards of the full moon. Debbie Rochon is in great shape here as a newcomer to a gang of guys and dudette who decide to write a story about the "killer club". She, as one would expect, does everything possible to join her, and then proceeds to panic, because it was not a true story, and stupid Mrs. Rochon believed it, and now everyone will have to run, covered in blood and , kill each other or maybe not. There is a choice, and with respect to this film it is yours ... not recommended, but not entirely bad either.
