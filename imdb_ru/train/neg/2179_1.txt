I just loved to watch it and enjoy its total bad movie. I saw this movie through a useful sarcasm of Mystery Science Theater 3000, and I have a DVD. If you flip the DVD over to the other side, they’ll show a real film, so I gave it a chance. Seriously guys, this is grilled cheese. <br /> <br /> The action, the special effects and the plot in general are very funny and unreal. “Doesn't she need lungs,” said Crowe, noting how her head can still talk while she has no body, and Tom Servo just dreamily remarks: “No, she has neck juice!” The ending is just classic, and no one can touch this K-Porn soundtrack! I loved the "fight of cats" between two strippers. This “Meow” after the fight or the scene, whatever, was classic. In a sense, it was a funny movie. I think for horror fans you’ll probably like it. To have a good time, look at the version of MSTK3, you will laugh. <br /> <br /> MST3K version: 10/10 Brain death: 1/10
