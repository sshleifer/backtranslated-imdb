In my book, Basic Instinct, there was a perfect movie. He had a prominent role in the roles of Stone, Douglas and all the actors playing a minor role. There was an amazing photo, music and the most noisy noir style script. All this is made up of a movie that is as good as it ever will be! <br /> <br /> This sequel is the exact opposite, it cannot deteriorate, a bad game and an unsuccessful scenario combined with a completely inept direction, this is really bad, boring, annoying. The only thing that keeps you somewhat concentrated is the relatively short wait for the next scene, which is an exact copy of the original. These copies are so bad that they make you laugh, and I laughed a lot despite myself, because it was like watching the destruction of a shining monument. The only thing that is good about this terrible mess is excerpts from Jerry Goldsmith's BI1 account. Michael Caton-Jones and the moron responsible for the script even included the dialogue “Do not smoke in this room” on the interrogation scene, and yes, she sends her lawyer (who is now a lawyer)! <br /> <br /> Sorry, I saw this horrible movie that should never have been made! It damages the original, so this is bad. The only ransom value is the realization that cosmetic surgery (and I’m sure Ms. Stone has provided the best surgeon you can buy for money) can do a good job, but obviously cannot restore the perfection of the original. And what concerns the human body, applies to filmmaking. There must be a law: never make a sequel to a perfect movie!
