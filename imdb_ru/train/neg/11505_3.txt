This picture reminds me of a 1957 Kenet Mora painting called “Delightful Crichton”, when he was a servant on a boat, and on the island he became the master, and after rescue he returned to the servant. Madonna has done well in some films, but this one doesn't work. If there is any picture showing that Madonna cannot act, then this is exactly this. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if it was a delicate copy of Delightful Crichton, but she certainly looks like it, and if it is, then Hollywood must have run out of ideas, and it's sad. To provide the actors with a platform for improving their career profile, and this is not all about detail. <br /> <br /> The plot is free, and the actions are mediocre. The script had to be laid through the shredder before taking it into place. While many here preserved Madona for all of her actions, I think that in films such as "Their own league" was pretty good and pleasant, and "Who's That Girl" showed the quirkiness of Madonna's style, not shown to be before or after. Other films about Madonna are not so pleasant, and I would like to watch the series “Madonna-animation” with a character from the movie “Who is this girl”? I like the music from these two films, but "Gone" remain here below, and will remain so. <br /> <br /> everyone has a bomb, right?
