What a dog from the movie. Noni Hazelhurst's performance is pretty good, but she is among the jungle of disgusting scripting, mediocre direction and wooden action from the bulk of the cast. Many of the characters are terribly mistaken, especially ever overestimating Colin Friels. <br /> <br /> Very little work in this pretentious garbage. Most of the “character development” is accomplished with the help of a silly, irritated voice and often completely contradicts the behavior of the characters on the screen. In fact, it is difficult to even understand who they are talking about behind the scenes, because they describe such different characters that we see on the screen! How do we know that Colin Friels (Havo) should be a messy, cruel and unreliable drug addict? One of these silly voices behind the scenes tells us. Shouting out loud, the character of his character is half the film, and the only thing that lets us know is a frivolous voice! The real killer is the characters. All about them. Their clothes are perfectly preserved and look fresh from the hanger, despite the fact that we are constantly reminded that they are designed for artsy poor people. All of them are ridiculously well saying "drug addicts". No one seems to have a real understanding of life on skids or tastes, and yet this should be the case with most of them. <br /> <br /> Monkey Grip deserves no more attention than the matinee of a television film on weekdays. Rough, like this one, superbly shot and technically presented, but an insane drama, driven by a cliché, which plays out so widely to be believable and wanders for hours, practically without going anywhere. At the very least, Noni goes down to her birthday costume at every opportunity. There is no other good reason to tolerate this junk.
