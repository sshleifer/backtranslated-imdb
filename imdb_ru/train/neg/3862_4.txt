I just watched it. The couple laughs, but nothing special. Jason Lee looked like he was having fun. Gag Reel's (long) DVD is composed almost exclusively of his uncontrollable laughs. Selma Blair seemed to beat the clock in time, but then again, her character was supposed to be a stick in the mud, so “well done,” I think? Jim Brolin was surprisingly funny. (Marrying Babs cannot be a picnic.) The soundtrack was fashionable and eclectic. Larry Miller, who played Julia Stiles' father (fun) in “10 Things I Hate About You,” is also fun here. It's great, but the best aspect of this film was the casting of Julia Stiles. I could spend two hours watching her wash and feel like I just did.
