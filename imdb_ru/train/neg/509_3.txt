This film is about British prisoners of war from the second world war who escaped from a camp in Germany. <br /> <br /> I think that the “Wooden Horse” is disappointingly boring. The subject could be exciting, intense and full of adrenaline, but the “Wooden Horse” is very simple. This is a collection of simple and poorly narrated events, without any suspensions or thrills. The first half speaks clearly about how prisoners of war dug a tunnel, but the events are so simple, with not enough serious mistakes and a shaved shave to make me stand up. The second half of the film is even worse, they just move from one place to another without chasing the cat and the mouse. And can the characters talk a little less and have more action in the action movie! I’m disappointed with the "Wooden Horse", she lost the potential to be a great movie.
