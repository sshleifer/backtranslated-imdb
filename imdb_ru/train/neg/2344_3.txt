To me, it sounds like a soap opera. I think that any image of wasteful people can be considered “social commentary”. But in the end, I just don't care how you describe this movie. None of the characters are very cute and attractive. I did not feel any chemistry between Hudson and Bacall. If there is a love story, it is lost in ailment. And despite the completion of the turn, provided by the complete and immediate (and therefore incomprehensible) change of Dorothy Maguire on the witness stand, the story is not enough to interest me. No matter how much Freudian symbolism and psychology is added, this story is despicable, melodramatic and banal. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson is nobly wooden. This is the least attractive role of Lauren Bacall and one of her worst performances. Dorothy Maguire and Robert Stack come up with more inspirational ideas, but her character is disgusting, and he is pitiful. Robert Keith, as a loving, inviolable father of two villains of adult children, is the most responsive character. However, the most interesting is the stern Robert Wilk as the bar owner. He is best remembered as the opposite minion in countless westerns, but here he is an honest, likeable guy. <br /> <br /> I use my social commentary for an interesting, fascinating story and a few cute characters, thank you.
