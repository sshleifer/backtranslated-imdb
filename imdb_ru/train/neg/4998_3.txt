this is one of the best celebrity reality shows ever seen. we can see the concerts, we can see the life of Britney, I love five episodes. I was always amazed at Britney and the subject of the series. I think that some people do not watch the show at all, like us, a wonderful person. she is very funny, very gentle, and she loves her fans, and we can see how she loves her work. I just don’t give 10 because of k-fed, he’s his real jerk, he doesn’t seem to like Britney at all. I am arranging the second season of this wonderful show, because for some people it shows how Britney really is. Come on, Britney, you're the best, and you will never leave our hearts.
