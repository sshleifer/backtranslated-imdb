This film is probably the worst film I've ever seen. I study French in college and thus understand the whole dialogue, therefore the language barrier was not a problem. I must say that it is very difficult to empathize with any of the characters depicted in the film. There is only one professional actor in the cast, and I believe that there are no professional directors or screenwriters. <br /> <br /> Although I rated it as 1 out of 10, it probably doesnâ€™t deserve such a bad rating. This is just a futile attempt to downgrade his current overall rating of 7.3 to something more realistic. Perhaps 4.3 would be a more accurate rating, because a movie is really not an event about 100 minutes long and you will never return. <br /> <br /> The real shame is that I'm sure that some college student breaks his nut, making the film twice as good and half as much. However, if you want to join a driving force that seems to revolve around IMDb, you can also give Lost in Translation 10 points.
