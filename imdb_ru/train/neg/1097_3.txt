I understand that the US Army was demoralized by 1971, but this film was incredible. It was supposed to be a training camp, not an SS battalion in Sven Hassellâ€™s novel. The author must be a true army hater. The psycho-sergeant who continued beating people was in a prison cell, and the useless black senior sergeant also had to be fired. These people went abroad, the reception units were probably wondering where all the unusable damaged recruits came from, and the investigation was about to start. The scene that blew it out completely was an electric shock. Farrell, the alleged lawyer from the barracks room, would have an instructor behind the barrel for issuing an illegal order (to torture prisoners of war in violation of the Geneva Convention), actual attack on a soldier, sexual violence and non-officer conduct. Soon he just leaves. After this discipline is reduced to the level of a madhouse, and the film becomes invisible. I do not know how it ended, I went to sleep.
