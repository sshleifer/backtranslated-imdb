The ladies man is a funny movie. There are not many thoughts behind this, but what do you expect from the SNL movie? It's actually better than most SNL movies (i.e. Superstar or Night at Roxbury), Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both very funny. Chris Parnell was also funny in his short scene (one of the funniest in the film). In addition, the rest of the cast is average and only there to support Meadows. I definitely saw funny movies, but I also saw stupid ones. Again, this is not a very deep film, but it's good for a few laughs. Although it was funnier than a parody. But still, if you're looking for a rather funny movie, I would recommend this one. Just do not think about it too much, otherwise you will hate him. <br /> <br /> Rating: 6/10
