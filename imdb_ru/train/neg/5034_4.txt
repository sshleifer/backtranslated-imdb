I am very surprised to see such a high rating for this film and a few reviews that should be positive. I saw the movie and was rather disappointed. I did not find it very pleasant at all. It was slow, and not enough entertainment value. Even the murder scenes are dull, with real close-ups with ordinary knife stabs that don't look very good. And the supposedly great end of the twist is not so much, I saw that it was coming, and then the ending seemed clich√©. This film may not receive much mention, but not only does it get, it is overrated. I would not recommend this movie.
