God, only in the 70s ... Antonio Margheriti brings us this fancy hybrid of spaghetti westerns and a kung-fu film that develops around a treasure hunt. The spice of this crappy co-production between Shaw Brothers and an Italian one-time company includes humorous story-telling, random events and some very tame T & A. Lee Van Cleef's wicked wig, skin-clad psychotherapist Yansi Hobbitt serves the extra indecent moments Ugarte, a man who had to make much more incomprehensible European genre performances than he), I want - a witty dialogue, funny background music and absolutely laughter sound effects accompanying various small events (especially each jump made by Lo Li). <br /> <br /> While this little piece of action falls right on the territory of Turkey. It's nice to see Van Cleef and Lo Lee on one screen, and you can't deny the duo's charisma. Do not expect too much, and you will get a lot from it. <br /> <br /> This is my truth. What is yours?
