I saw the original German version without duplication, and was surprised at how bad this film really is. Thinking that I had seen my share of bad films, such as Guli 2, Mad Grannies, Zombie Lake and the like, nothing could prepare me for this! It was really hard to sit out in this film, because there is no plot, no good game, and even the special effects are not convincing, especially the so-called zombies who wear nothing more than white makeup and old clothes, their good set would not be destroyed by the ketchup stains and marmalade. <br /> <br /> If you really want to spend 90 minutes of your life, then follow the rest, do not do it, because you will regret it!
