This is the story of two guys who found a copy of Funky Monkey. Finding this seemed strange at the time, believing that there were still posters for the film at the local Cineplex Odeon cinema. After watching such classic works as “Everything is fine, but free” and “Project X”, these two guys decided that the monkey movies are awesome. <br /> <br /> These guys had a long trip when they watched this movie. There was some kind of monkey that Stunt MAN replaced when action sequences were required. It was obvious that the monkey was not trained in the school of Shakespearean acting. Perhaps replacing the monkey with Ben Affleck might have helped the guys think. <br /> <br /> Perhaps a strong helper will help, like Jackie Chan or hell, maybe even Hulk Hogan. Fortunately, in this film was an amazing martial arts master and similar to Jet Li Matthew Modine. Although some may argue that Matthew Modine does not come close to Jet Li, camera stunts prove that he is no worse. When it becomes apparent that an unprepared chimp cannot cope with the film, the film relies on Matthew Modin to be a real star. <br /> <br /> I mentioned that there is some kind of stupid child who develops a relationship with Modin and a monkey? Is it likely that the child will learn confidence and even pick up the girl in this film? Even Matthew Modin should be jealous of this (because using the selection line “I'm the second violin for a monkey” doesn’t seem to work with the ladies.) <br /> <br /> Soon after watching this In the film, two guys got a phone call from Matthew Modina, who told them: "Seven days."
