Although there are many familiar "television" titles associated with "Sleds, called Man," there is nothing extraordinary in the film itself or in any of the performances. In fact, the only thing that distinguishes him from the 1960s-70s television series, such as Rat Patrol, is the large cast and much more violence. <br /> <br /> James Garner is the biggest star, and he apparently decided that he should try to break away from all the light comedy material that he was engaged in (Maverick, Support Your Local Sheriff,) " etc.). ). Unfortunately, his earthly attraction works against him, because Sanky is a character without humor, written to earn on the popularity of the western character of Clint Eastwood's spaghetti. But Eastwood's things were not so flat and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> I believe that “Sledge with the name of a person” could be attributed to a spaghetti western, although the pace is too slow to really fit this subgenre. Fans of the slow-motion TV series “Fight” will feel an instant connection as Vic Morrow made the film and wrote the script with Frank Kowalski. Add a few trendy slow frames and cross-dilutions that draw attention to themselves, and not serve the purpose of the story. <br /> <br /> The plot is a standard “big robbery” (insert “Military van” here), where Sledge is preparing to steal a lot of gold at 300,000 dollars. His gang includes Claude Akins and Dennis Weaver. The problem is that during the movement of cargo is protected by 40 unauthorized persons, and during a stop it is locked in a vault inside the territorial prison. I think there was an episode of "Alias ​​Smith and Jones" with the same plot. <br /> <br /> The plot would have seemed a decent hour for television, but would very quickly become outdated, like a full-length feature film. Garner does not allow any of his charm to leak into his characterization, and the film does not generate enough tension to keep the viewer's interest. <br /> <br /> In the end, the thing collapses and burns shortly after the robbery, when the gang engages. contrived and completely illogical card game. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
