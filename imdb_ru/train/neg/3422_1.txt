Oh dear, Oh dear. I started watching it, not knowing what to expect. I could not believe what I saw. There were times when I thought it was a comedy. I liked the fact that the governmentâ€™s plan to seize the terrorist leader is to knock down one person who is unarmed from the air and expect him to catch him and run away with a rocket. If it were really that easy. I finally found the film worse than Plan 9 from Space.
