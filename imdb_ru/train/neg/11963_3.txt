I like Billy Crystal, and I thought it would be interesting to watch this movie, since I know that he admired Alan King and they would be funny together. I thought I had seen all the Billy films, but I could not remember this one, and now I know why. It is so full of clich√© and fake emotions; You can smell every scene coming (and leaving!). Billy is not even often funny. He is too busy trying to cry with fake tears or to show his fear about how much his father let him down. Alan King himself is pretty likable, as is the plot of becoming complementary to the movie. But what a coincidence that Billy accidentally visited his father, just at the moment when there was a serious health crisis, and so on. D. And so on. Or that two busy doctors can simply stop their practice to go to the moon in Los Angeles And when the end comes, boy, it comes quickly! As if the writers realized that they had driven themselves into a corner, and the only way out was to make a scene of death. Mostly disappointing a few flashes of good mood.
