If John Waters had written and sent “The House of 1000 Corpses” after repeatedly hitting the head with a heavy object, the result would probably be something like “Bloodshed.” In the first half hour, he is a little fascinating, but then he turns into a kind of faceless buzz of constant screams when people make their genitals to each other with electric knives, cutlery and pliers. Susan Adriensen (Sno Cakes) is incredibly annoying, and Terry West (Elvis Bullion) is almost as bad at what he does in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best thing about the Bloody Strait is that it will not take long for most viewers to forget about it.
