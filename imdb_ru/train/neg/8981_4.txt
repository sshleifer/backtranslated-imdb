This primary version / robbery of OKLAHOMA! / ANNIE GET YOUR GUN / CALAMITY JANE is not that unusual or innovative. Marketing and introductory comments can be there to save what is actually a rather bad movie, a musical western shot on a sound stage and similar to a live TV show. I do not find the use of a background cyclorama illuminated in various scenes with yellow, or pink, or red, or ... all this groundbreaking. As already noted, for me it is more like a film shot on a television budget: the whole sound stage with a minimum set with the support of lighted cycles! (Compare with NEW FACES (1952). The actors, nevertheless, come out pretty well. And this style was much better implemented when Paramount took LIL ABNER in 1959. do they think?
