Once again, as Charlie's Angels, Inspector Gadget and Thunderbird, the series turns into a feature film and collapses for all hundreds of viewers. In fact, the cousins ​​of the duke, Luke (Johnny Knoxville) and Bo (Seann William Scott) in Hazzard County, spend a lot of time behind the wheel in General Lee. But they need to gather their strength and not allow their family farm to be destroyed along with almost the entire city by the nasty Jefferson Davis "Boss" Hogg (appointed by Razzie Burt Reynolds) to make room for a huge coal mine. On the way, they get help from their sexy cousin Daisy (nominated for Razzie Jessica Simpson) and Uncle Jessie (Willie Nelson), while they are being prosecuted by the equally sneaky sheriff Rosto P. Gainey and the police. Also starring Joe Don Baker as Governor Jim Applewhite, Jack Polick as Deputy Cletus Hogg, David Köhner as Cooter Davenport, Michael Weston as Deputy Enos State and Linda Carter as Polina. I think the only reason I add an extra star to the film is because of a couple of impressive car stunts and, of course, Simpson's gorgeous body (I admit that her legs are not exactly Catherine Bach, but still!) But besides, it's pretty boring. He was nominated for Razzy for the Worst Picture, for the worst director Jay Chandrasekhar, Worst Remake or Sequel, Worst Pair of Screen for Simpson and her Daisy Dukes and Worst Screenplay. Pretty poor!
