The first five minutes of this film showed potential. After that, everything went straight from something decent to some kind of illegitimate comedy. The best part is that I could not stop thinking about super friends thanks to Joey Kern. I would recommend watching this movie to find out how not to shoot a movie. There are so many scenes in this film that make it possible to just stop and think about whether the entire cast and the crew ceased at some point to stop caring. What surprises me most in this film is that he collected $ 22 million at the box office and was worth only 1.5 million. Congratulations to Lion's Gate for the opportunity to shoot it.
