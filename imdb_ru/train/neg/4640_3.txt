The hunters pursue, as they think, a man through the forest, although viewers see that he is a werewolf. Hunters never seem to realize this, because after they shoot him, he looks fine when they behead him. <br /> <br /> A doctor transplants the eyes of a werewolf to a person who has lost his own in a laboratory experiment. A man, Rich, has sex with his nurse (Stephanie Beaton) even before he removed the bandages. <br /> <br /> After he leaves the hospital, he discovers that his wife is cheating on him too. When the smoke machine passes the clouds past the amateur moon picture (with a fake tree branch in the foreground), it turns into a werewolf! His torso gets bigger, splitting his shirt, and he grows a giant werewolf mask on his head with red lights in his eyes. His pants remain untouched. His mouth chewing unconvincingly, although some robots (or hidden hands) in his eyebrows sometimes look ominously at him. <br /> <br /> Despite the costume of a poor werewolf, there is a lot of blood and blood in him, and they are pretty well made. The film even has pretty good decapitation. However, when a person falls from a height, a rather bad mannequin does this work. <br /> <br /> Rich has a friend named Siodmak, who is a kind of occult expert, and he also accidentally bumps into a little man with crutches named Androse, who is also such an expert. They are trying to help him a little. <br /> <br /> Rich kills the people who made him wrong. A policewoman is investigating the killings and trying to attack Beaton, who doesnâ€™t like lesbian scenes very much, so nothing will come of it. <br /> <br /> Pretty cheap, but between nudity, blood and blood, and not - a terrible story, combining (like) the most dangerous game with the Hands of Orlak and Wolf Man, this is somewhat fascinating. Available on your own or with Scream Queens Vol. one.
