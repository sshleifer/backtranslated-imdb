This is not art, it is intracity, politically correct propaganda! Jindabyne’s political intolerance goes beyond the unforgivable ... it does not see people as individuals, but rather as members of categories. <br /> <br /> This is the most patronizing and offensive Australian film that I can remember in the entire history against some rather stiff competition!). A movie with messages, every weary theme, the favorite of the fashionable leftists, is: the aborigines are the victims; white people are cruel or alcoholic; White women are not so bad, especially if they are lesbians, but they are likely to be depressive. <br /> <br /> Four men who go fishing find the body of a murdered woman (native, of course) and leave her in the river for several days while they catch trout. This is a strange decision, taken almost without discussion, as if people are animals. The only man who condemns for a short time is a delicacy ... we know this because he lives with a bisexual woman — he loves to keep his child very much — and eventually moves to a more fashionable place on the beach (far from bush). <br /> <br /> This is a film made by those fashionable urbanists who live in fear of the Australian landscape and those evil goons who live inside. This ignorance of country life is almost as shocking as her contempt. The film was shot through the distant views of the bushes, backed up by a premonition, mysterious music. By the end, it became clear that the aborigines were the only ones at home in this landscape. This ends in a painfully improbable scene of black and white reconciliation. <br /> <br /> In Jindabine, village life is reduced only to the background of history, which indirectly proclaims the superiority of the values ​​of the enlightened left-wing urban residents of other Australians. <br /> <br /> This film was shot not by people with real work, but was funded by the government corporation for the financing of cinema. It is the product of an artsy set, this soulless void, inhabited by beautiful people for whom generous state funding supports these patronizing and offensive projects (which are so divorced from real life), unlike creating popular films that people want to see. It doesn't matter if the movie is ugly, they still get paid. <br /> <br /> Save yourself from wasting time, avoid it like the plague. This film deserves incredible social commentary, not real entertainment.
