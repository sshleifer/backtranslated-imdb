A doctor who is trying to fulfill the medical dream of a transplant is secretly experimenting with corpses from a hospital with varying success. His last best chance comes when he lovingly wraps his girlfriend's head in his jacket, saving her from a burning car. <br /> <br /> I was looking for cheese, and, considering this, I believed that I had found it. It has everything that bad movie hunters are looking for - breast and brain surgery with the care of surgeons with intact white scrubs, unique camera angles (I always love to watch the rear passenger wheels of cars), crappy clarinet music and music from one of the longest scenes death in cinema history. But, unfortunately, these moments, when they are so bad, they are good, they can not cope with the segments of too bad, they stink. <br /> <br /> Jana in the pan annoyed me with her monotonous humming whispers in a hoarse whisper a little less than angry laughter, and the fact that she was kept alive with some Colombian home coffee and 2 DD batteries. <br /> <br /> I couldnâ€™t even entertain myself with the disgusting and moral excuse of Dr. Bill. Usually such a ham makes these films obligatory for viewing, in my opinion, in this case I'm sick of it. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film, in my opinion, was in the 1960s, when I was shopping in the body, and I even fell asleep during this. <br /> <br /> Don't waste money on this - there are the best bad movies to entertain your sick sense of humor.
