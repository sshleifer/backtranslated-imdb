Hearing so much about the 1990s Cracker TV series, without seeing any of them, I was looking forward to it with impatience. Of course, the combination of Jimmy McGovern and Robbie Coltrane could not go wrong. How wrong I was! <br /> <br /> The controversy supported by frequent, repetitive and violent memories was insurmountable. The production tried to be super modern, but the flashing boxes and even the children's font were annoying. Robbie Coltrane slept for two hours, inventing inexplicable and unlikely “ideas”, and the police were portrayed as one-dimensional, clumsy idiots. As a result, the tension never escalated, and the scene close to the final (without details due to fear of spoilers) was a ridiculously bad part of the television drama that I had seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> No, I don’t want to see it anymore, but I’ll go back to the 1990s series DVDs to see if they fit their reputations.
