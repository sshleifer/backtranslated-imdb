I rented this film because I was looking at a section of horror films for those films that no one had heard of and which could have become a gem. I have seen it and since I am a fan of violence and blood, I have received it. He received an EM rating, which means: extremely mature. Thinking that this rare and high rating was completely intended for violence and everything else, I understood. A warning was written on the box: “Extreme violence”, “Extreme language” and “Nudity”. "Extreme violence" struck me. The film ended up becoming a rather tame film. There were one or two bloody scenes, but I saw the worst in the movie PG-13. Of course, the amount of blood in the film does not matter, right? You also have a plot. Well, the plot was boring and there was nothing special about it. Do not give up. I am telling the truth. I can't imagine how someone would really like it to such an extent that they would say: “I am going to take it off again.” There were moments when it made you move, but I will never see this movie again.
