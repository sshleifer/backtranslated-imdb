I saw Chance disappear when he first appeared, about four years after moving from San Francisco to New York. It may have been a perspective of several years, but this film seemed to capture the essence of the city and its inhabitants better than anything else I had ever seen (I still see). It concentrates on one particular community — the Chinese — but this is normal, because most of the city’s soul is refracted through settings, faces, and perhaps above all the voices of the characters. <br /> <br /> This is not a San Francisco tourist. The situation is modest and casual: a taxi, a Chinese restaurant kitchen, a row house of the Richmond district, apartments in Chinatown and small business offices, piers, the Philippine Elders Center. This is how the city looks and feels day after day for people who live there - even now, in the era of the urban development of Silicon Gorge. Unlike, say, “Dirty Harry” (in its own way and from a great film from San Francisco), everything is filmed at the street level: we begin to understand the points of view of the characters from the point of view of their surroundings, and not some freakish shooting. . <br /> <br /> Van was apparently shot at B & W because he didn’t have the money to do something else, but one of the brightest visual elements of the film is the natural light he reaches . Often the harsh, all-pervasive quality of sunlight is one of my closest associations with San Francisco: it seems that it exposes everything, reduces buildings, hills, other landmarks on a scale and, oddly enough, makes people you miss out on the streets more individual and potentially closer to you than they could have in another place. Wang's photo perfectly conveys this and even helps the plot in some moments. <br /> <br /> Wang captured the spoken and spoken style of Chinese and other San Franciscans better than anyone, I think. If there is such a thing as the real “accent” of San Francisco, this is what you hear from the balding broker of taxi medallions (I think) that appears talking on the phone in one scene (listen to how he calls the person on the other end ”ya dingaling! "). <br /> <br /> The story is sharp and, despite some very small mistakes, it perfectly underlines the aspirations of people living in old immigrant communities, including justified political and ethnic grievances and small ironic fun that help fuel them . All this is delicately transmitted. - Perhaps, therefore, some respondents believe that the film is winding. It is not enough to say that the quest of two taxi drivers behind Chan becomes a search for something more personal. <br /> <br /> In the end, Chan Is Missing ends with a series of Chinese tours. a quarter supported by a stupid novelty song from the 1930s (I guess) about San Francisco and all its insane diversity.American caricature, yes, but for some reason also not completely in itself.
