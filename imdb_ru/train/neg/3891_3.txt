I think that my favorite part of this film, the one that illustrates the very meaninglessness, stupidity, and senselessness of the process, comes to the climax of the movie. Dr. Ted Nelson and his unmarried friend Sheriff finally drove the smelter into a landing on a power plant ladder. Keep in mind that Nelson was looking for MM for almost the entire movie, and that MM killed and ate a few people at this moment (including his boss), and Nelson is well aware that MM is cruelly insane and longing for a man. flesh and blood. <br /> <br /> So, the sheriff directed his weapon at MM, which, and I give the film and Rick Baker, the details for this, the most disgusting and terrifying object in human form that we have ever seen. And he shouts to Dr. Ted Nelson’s very important question: “WHAT ARE WE DOING NOW?!?!?” <br /> <br /> The camera switches to Dr. Ted Nelson and it’s obvious that Ted has no idea what to do next. Apparently, Ted was so interested in the problem of FINDING A Flying Man that he never thought that he could take with him some restraints, a lasso, or a straitjacket, or a net, or some darts with a tranquilizer, or maybe a New Age ribbon from Vangelis to calm the wild beast. <br /> <br /> So the sheriff panics and shoots, the melting man goes berserk, and fun comes. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this explains why NASA has been working with the Space Shuttle program in sub-lunar space for the past 30 years, and not going back to the Moon or Mars, as everyone knows that they MUST be doing. I dont know. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a lousy, lazy writing and directing, which undermines every aspect of this film. It's hard to say how good the actors really are, because the film has complete contempt for its characters. <br /> <br /> Two other incredibly painful sequences also increase the stupidity of the process: there is a scene in which the roughest old couple in the world appear, trying to steal lemons from a grove, only to be torn into pieces by a melting person. This scene is a nadir in the movies of the 70s. I can guarantee that you have never looked at a more meaningless and annoying installation with the strange people in your life. And the attack of the Melting Man on the woman who lives in the house where the horse, which writes on the walls, is resisted is not amenable to any attempts to process it. (By the way, I think that the famous director Jonathon Demme in this episode is the husband of a peasant who goes first to check the house and never comes out again). The only thing that keeps the actress from literally chewing the scenery is the fact that, as I said, their horse clearly wrote to her. And we have to watch her tantrum for at least two minutes longer than any SANE director will keep the shots. <br /> <br /> Burr DeBenning must defeat the IMM director and photographer. I remember him from the old episode of Colombo, where he looked MUCH better than he was here - no one thought about the lead, but firmly and unobtrusively. But no one can be as unattractive in real life as his director makes him look here. <br /> <br /> Everyone else is a little better, except for the old couple (and shut up, I know that they were played for fun, but I don’t laugh!), but not much. <br /> <br /> This definitely falls into the category of "The trouble that you cannot look away from." However, I would look at it again before I would look at many other abortions of the 70s and 80s (remembering “Moon Beast Trail” and “He Lives at Night”), and the lighting in MST is very fun, so If you have a chance, look at the MST version.
