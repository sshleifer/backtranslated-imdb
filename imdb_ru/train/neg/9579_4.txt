Here is the terrible version of SCRATCH: THE QUEEN OF THE DESERT (they desire!) Starring Melinda / Mindy (RETURNING THE LIVING DEAD 3) Clark is in the role of Candy, an inhabitant of the desert who removes a bank robbery with his boyfriend Johnny (Jason Darr). He finds himself in a prison in the south of the border, which is ruled by a sadistic head screw (replaying Robert Englund in a wig). She and her beloved domestic poodles are hiding in the petrol station monastery until recently fallen meteor turns them. The dogs turn into an unpleasant queen bitch, and Candy develops a VERY long talking and killing forked tongue that she cannot control. Thugs seeking stolen loot and other diverse skulls add additional complications. <br /> <br /> First, Clark is great and does his best to make this film. You look at her and see someone very funny in the episodes of farce, very convincing in horror scenes and VERY sexy in different wigs and disguises, including a stunning tight latex body ... and wonder why this actress is not such a huge star. It is a pity that the rest of this cult attempt does not live up to its promises. <br /> <br /> Blame the director / screenwriter Skiamma, who believes that one outlandish premise is enough to endure a laugh ... but his vulgar joke Annoying minor characters and silly dialogues will not replace a real sense of humor. Another nail in the coffin; the film looks cheap, lots of bright colors and scenery are strangely muffled by dirty photos and dusty desert places. Fortunately for Scam, Clark makes a film of his film because she alone makes you look.
