I chose this film on the cover, thinking that an adventure awaits me to the level of “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom”. Unfortunately, I was waiting for a virtual yawn. Not like the yawn that I had before. This yawn was so great that I could hardly find anything of quality in this film. The cover describes amazing special effects. There was not one. The film was so light that even the stereotypes were horribly depicted. This gives you an idea that you can solve problems with violence. Well, if you want to teach your children this. I do not. Stay away from this. If you are looking for family fun, you can find something more inspiring elsewhere.
