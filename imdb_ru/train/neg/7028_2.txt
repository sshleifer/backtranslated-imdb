Somewhere between Food Court and Zip's, there is a store of explosives in the shopping center of this movie. <br /> <br /> This is the only place where the title character <br /> <br /> can buy the bomb, which he laid at the mall in the boring finale. <br /> <br /> In a fictional city there is a new shopping center, built on some land that was <br /> <br /> condemned. A nice girl (I didn't catch her name) got a job as a waitress <br /> <br />. She lost her boyfriend as a result of a fire at the place where the shopping center is <br /> <br />. The villainous mall owner hires an arsonist <br /> <br />, responsible for the fire, as a security guard after his first security guard <br /> <br /> dies. Rob Estes, a few years before “Silk Pursuit”, is a photojournalist trying to find a story. He contacts Cute Girl, <br /> <br /> and their common "funny" friend Paulie Shore and tries to find out if Eric is still <br /> <br />. He lives in the basement of a mall (?) And travels through the air ducts <br /> <br /> and offers various people who upset his former girlfriend, including the arsonist. In the end, he kidnaps her <br /> <br />, and bombs participate in the final and everyone who runs off the stage <br /> <br /> in front of a big heel. Morgan Fairchild is preparing for the mayor's trip <br /> <br /> ... yes, she is the mayor. <br /> <br /> Of course, you probably didn’t need a plot sketch, since the whole <br /> History is in the title. Someone named Eric revenges people <br /> <br /> like a ghost of a shopping center. It also means that there is no <br /> <br /> waiting. We know that Eric is behind this, but we still have to see <br /> <br /> Estes and the Pretty Girl go through a stupid investigation. <br /> <br /> See how Fairchild, whom we know, was in collusion with <br /> <br /> the owner of the mall, pull out a gun to our heroic duet in the middle <br /> <br /> a crowded party, but no one says a word as long as she leads them to her office and her possible death. The fictional city is huge, but no one's name. <br /> <br /> A policeman ever called, everyone relies on the security of a shopping center. <br /> <br /> Eric has been hiding since the mall was built, but I'm not sure where <br /> <br /> He seems to be living in a basement, but you think that <br / > <br /> some builder would find it. He also built his love lining well and found several outlets, as he has electricity. It could be better than your own apartment! <br /> <br /> Fans of Pauly Shore, both of you, pay attention. He pulled the guard <br /> <br /> out of his cabin, pushing the camera. Yes, stop scanning "Celebrity Skin" and "Playgirl." This is where you’ll see a grainy black and white <br /> <br /> snapshot of the south bank of Poli, though not at the weekend. <Br /> <br /> This is just rubbish, and the proof that I can only rent a <br /> <br /> whatever you want in the video store to stay in the horror section. This <br /> <br /> film is not Eric's revenge, but the director’s revenge for what I’m <br /> <br /> stupid enough to watch it. Here is my revenge: I do not recommend it. This will show them! <br /> <br /> This is a rating (R) for physical abuse, violence with the use of firearms, blood, <br /> <br /> some profanity, female nudity, short male nudity, and some <br /> <br /> sexual content.
