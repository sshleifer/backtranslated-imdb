Despite the fact that he received some favorable press after the game in the International Toronto. At the film festival there were many reasons not to expect too much from this. One is the ultra-low budget Canadian film. Two is written, directed and starring the same person (usually a bad sign, if it is not Woody Allen, George Clooney or one or two other respected directors). But, despite the fact that I looked at it with low expectations, it still turned out to be a much greater disappointment than I thought. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell - a bad script, a bad game, terrible direction! Do not waste your time or money on this turkey. It claims to be a comedy, but I only laughed twice. In addition, terrible music sounds everywhere. How this caught the attention, I will never know.
