Randall "Memphis" Raines is a retired master thief who is forced to return to the "game" when his younger brother is threatened with death for not fulfilling an order from the British criminal authority Raymond Calitri. The job involves “lifting” 50 cars in 24 hours, otherwise Calitri will accept his punishment. Therefore, Raines quickly assembles a team that he can trust, and proceeds to perform the task. But the police are on it, and some of the cars on the list are not easy to take. It would seem almost impossible to complete the task. <br /> <br /> He has the cast “Out in 60 Seconds”, Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Robert Duval, Will Patton, Delroy Lindo, Vinnie Jones, Giovanni Ribisi, Christopher Ecclestone, Scott Caan and Timothy Oliphant. All of which deserve the best. Enough acting horsepower to power the Porsche 998 Turbo. The trouble is that this is a very big case, when too many cars flood the parking lot, the characters Mucho, there is not enough zest. Based on this, we have no doubt that this is a Bruckheimer / Simpson staging, a balker script riddled with loud noises and cheese blows, a shotgun edited and directed by a sledgehammer, elusively controlled by Dominic Sen. In fact, this is a great budget remake of H.B. Indian film Galitsky 1974 with the same name, which laid the potential of making a film based on adrenaline. A potential that, unfortunately, is never realized. There are one or two impressive moments, probably stupid, but nonetheless pleasant. But if you excuse the pun, the film will never come out first hand, he will be more pleased with the work with many characters who are unhappy with attempts to make the boorish script {Scott Rosenberg} work. <br /> <br /> Car fans will get something from this {first-class eye machine}, as well as fans of unintended comedy films {check Ecclestone's tribulation moment}. But no, everything is very bad. 4/10
