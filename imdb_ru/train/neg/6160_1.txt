I would not say that this is * a bad * movie. Unfortunately for me, I feel that the more you know about fencing, the worse it becomes simply because it becomes absolutely unreal. I have been fencing since I was 14, and this film portrays it very badly. F. Murray Abraham is good (and seems to have some fencing experience), but most of the other actors — especially students — are simply lost.
