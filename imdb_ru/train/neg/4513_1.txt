Despite the fact that the book was not strictly accurate to the real situation in which it was described, it still had a sense of Japan. I find it hard to believe that anyone who participated in the making of this film has ever been to Japan, because he did not in any way feel like a Japanese. Almost everything about it was terrible. I admit that the actors were usually pretty good, but they had no chance of saving it. Before the beginning of the film, I was surprised that there were only ten people in the cinema on Friday night, shortly after the opening of the film in Japan. 30 minutes I was amazed that they stayed. I stayed to have the right to criticize it. The whole film was underlined by my moans and suppressed by the laughter of my Japanese girlfriendâ€™s distrust. Everyone I saw, leaving this cinema, had faces of confusion and disappointment. <br /> <br /> The creators of this film you owe me two hours.
