I saw this film for several reasons, the main of which was Mira Sorvino. With her on the set could not be so bad. And it even seemed that there was some kind of mystery in it, and Olivier Martinez was her boyfriend at the time, and he was pretty good at The Infidels. The plot unfolds in Spain, so it can be an exotic entertainment film from one of my favorite actresses. <br /> <br /> If you think about the same thing, let me warn you: this is really a terrible, uninterestingly boring movie. The only adjective that comes to mind is pitiful. <br /> <br /> The plot is invented with plots that add nothing to the narration. They are trying to build a slasher / thriller with a view of fascism in Spain, but they fail terribly. Turns are not credible, and the so-called investigation leads nowhere. <br /> <br /> Thin characters! I didn't care about anyone. Moreover, they are annoying and rather hateful people. <br /> <br /> The action is atrocious. Mira, what's wrong with you? Why Mira? You are an Oscar winner! Keep dignity! Her character was weak, but this is no excuse for such a terrible presentation. It seems she went all night in a dream. If I think about it, I think I saw her eyes slowly closing in some scenes. I used to think that this woman is sexy. Well, she's not here. If you want to look at any skin, try Romy and Michelle, because there is nothing to watch. And that accent? Oh my god ... <br /> <br /> Olivier Martinez is even worse. It is too painful to recall his speech to describe it here. Sorry, but I can not. I suffered enough with this garbage. <br /> <br /> This whole movie is depressing! It's so bad in every way, it's amazing how it was done. The lousy team that created the lousy script and made some money in the name of the actor. Do not give in. <br /> <br /> Avoid this! <br /> <br />
