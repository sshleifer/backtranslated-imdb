My first review of 2010 is “Into The Blue 2: Reef”. The story of two divers Chris Carmack and Laura Vandervoort, who love to explore the hidden treasures at the bottom of the local reef. One day after a day of research, a couple played by David Anders and Marsha Thomason are approaching them. They tell young divers that they want to hire them to explore the reef and find a rare artifact about the hidden treasures of Columbus, which are reported at the bottom of the reef. <br /> <br /> The next day, four of them dive into the bottom of the reef and find nothing rough after a whole day of diving. A few more days passed, and the two hired divers learned that they were part of a large deadly conspiracy into which they could not escape, otherwise they would be killed. They were hired to find two large containers. In one of them there is a nuclear reactor, and in the other - a core. <br /> <br /> The film also has a story about how another person (the brother of the main character) is trying to improve relations with his girlfriend, I believe that this part of the story was a waste of time, it also includes a very the steamy sex scene between a couple, which for me is a complete waste and should not have been shown. <br /> <br /> However, besides that, this film has a good underwater photo, and the colors blend well, so it gets 4 stars. Into The Blue 2 - continued only by name. None of the original actors or characters are returned, he has a stupid plot, stupid characters and a boring climax.
