When I go to the video store to make a movie, I usually trust IMDb’s views on the movie and have never seen a movie with a rating of 7.0 or higher on a site that I didn’t like. <br /> <br /> Sydney Lumet, the legendary director of some of the best films of the 20th century, really made a mistake here by making one of the biggest mistakes a cinematographer can make: filling the film with completely incredible characters without any real redemptive qualities . <Br /> <br /> I like movies with spoiled characters, but no matter how bleak someone is, we all have a little light, we are all shades of gray, some of which are darker or brighter than others. Mr. Lumet crossed this line, filling this film with completely non-sympathetic and almost masochistic black characters. <br /> <br /> Hank Ethan Hawk is now an immature, irresponsible man, thirty years old, divorced from marriage to his wife, who hates him, and daughter, who thinks he is a loser, which he is very much. His indecision and willingness to let others do the dirty work for him, because he is too cowardly to do it himself, leads to the fact that their bank robbery plan falls apart and the mother is killed. By the time he confronts his older brother at the end of the film, this is more pitiful than uplifting. Ethan Hawke plays his character well, but he doesn’t really like to work, as he is portrayed as a man with a shoe with a face all over, and he doesn’t really care that he is here. <br /> <br /> Speaking of which character’s wife is equally bad. Almost every shot of the film in which she is being shot is that she verbally scolds him for rent and money for the maintenance of the child, as well as insults his already non-existent self-assessment. Seriously, that's almost all the character does. Her behavior, similar to the harpy, borders on ill will. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney plays their father, Charles, and although Mr. Finney has been a great actor for many decades, he spends about 90% of this film with the same mouth open on the face of a grimace on his face, as if he suffers from the worst constipation in the world. For a man who was an actor just as much as Mr. Finney, you think he would be more prone to emotion. Although he does not show this much, his character is supposedly overwhelmed with grief and full of anger. And when he stifles Andy at the conclusion of the film, it’s like the way Dr. Frankenstein exposes the monster he helped create, out of his own suffering. <br /> <br /> Marisa Tomei does not give a special relationship to her character. Stuck in an unhappy marriage with Andy and started an affair with his brother for an incomprehensible reason. When Andy’s world starts to spin out of control, she logically jumps off the ship, but that doesn’t really make her less selfish or self-serving than any other character in the film, but probably at least with the most common sense. <br /> Finally, we come to Andy, who is always played by a good Philip Seymour Hoffman. This is the only reason why I rated this film as 3 instead of 1. His speech, heroin-addicted, wasting financial leader, who committed the “committed crime” of robbing the insured jewelry store of his parents, was mesmerizing. Its origin is from the calm general planner of the erroneous scheme to the unstable, abnormal maniac killer believable and tragic. Hoffman's character eventually becomes the main villain of the film, but it is difficult to root it, given the alternatives - the emotionally castrated younger brother and father, who recognized himself as a bad early parenting, which led to his son’s possible psychosis and indirectly, unintentionally killing his mother. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this film really only needs to look at the excellent work of PSH and his family train crash. Just do not expect that there will be some characters for whom it is worth cheering, because in fact they are not.
