Interestingly, everyone who (so far) thought that the film was like did not have any expectations - I think this is the trick. In contrast, I had optimistic expectations, and that was a mistake. As soon as I saw how close the camera was to the face, I realized that we were in the hands of an extremely amateur director - this is always a clear sign of them, they think that to keep the camera about two inches from the actors skillfully, effectively or intensively. The actors in this film, however, had only one facial expression each. <br /> <br /> If you close the camera was not enough, the lack of light in the film killed her. The film seemed to be completely shot in the dark. So now we know that the filmmaker was also a lover of rank. “Oh, oh, oh, we're going to light the film set with a flashlight!” It will make all this intimate! ”No, because of this, it all seemed invisible. <br /> <br /> In addition to serious technical flaws, there was absolutely no history other than a hint of an idea that never developed, and nothing new about this kind of relationship. was lit. (Perhaps this is a new kind of film for Germany, but forget about it in Los Angeles.) <br /> <br /> The fact that this film received a couple of film festival awards does not indicate the quality of the film, but spoils the quality of these particular festivals. I can assure you that this film will not win anything at the festival where I saw it. In fact, twice during the film, it seemed that it was finally over, and people began to get up to leave (this was one of the side effects of the cinematographer’s "full darkness" technique). But when the movie started, instead there were groans. And as soon as the film finally ended, it became clear that it didn’t matter whether it ended in any of the two previous moments. An earlier final would save viewers from even more monotonous household scenes (folding sheets, cutting vegetables, putting honey on bread). Yes, we understood, the life of a lonely old man was boring - but we understood it at the very beginning. <br /> <br /> I recommend that viewers skip this; he has absolutely nothing to offer sophisticated movie lovers.
