Spoilers ... if this is possible ...,,,,,, As a rabid fan of Robin Williams, I found it necessary to buy this film as the first appearance on the screen. Wow ... I couldn't imagine a more stunning movie. In fact, the film repeats one bad joke after another, which your uncle Artie will tell you after dinner, and dramatizes them. Robin Williams plays a lawyer in a 30-second parody. <br /> <br /> I’m all for obscene humor, but this humor wasn’t pleasantly vulgar or rude ... it was just overwhelming own every part of the movie.
