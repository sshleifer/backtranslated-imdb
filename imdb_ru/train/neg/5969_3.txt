*** SPOILER *** Do not read this if you are thinking about watching this movie, although it would be a waste of time. (By the way: the plot is so predictable that it doesn’t matter whether you read it or not) <br /> <br /> If you are interested in seeing the “Ugly Coyote” or not: don’t! It costs neither money for a ticket, nor VHS / DVD. You could say the typical "Chick-Feel-Good-Flick." The story itself is as shallow as possible, a funny and uncritical version of the American dream. A young, pretty girl from a small town enjoys great success in New York. Several desperate attempts to give the film any depth of failure, such as the father’s “tragic” accident, Violet’s “difficulties” with her boyfriend, and so on. McNally (director) tries to make the audience feel pity and sadness, but they have no chance to succeed in this attempt because of a bad script and small game. Moreover, Piper Perabo is completely unable to convince one of the militants "Jersey" to sing in front of an audience. The only good (and rather funny thing) in “Ugly Coyote” is John Goodman, representing a small ray of hope of this film. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this film. First “Gone In 60 Seconds”, and now this ... what happened to such wonderful films as “The Rock” and “Con Air”? THAT was true about Bruckheimer. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a superficial film with good looking women, just to relax in the evening, you'd better go see “Charlie's Angels” (it's much more fun, more entertaining). and self-ironic) instead of this click. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down (3 out of 10).
