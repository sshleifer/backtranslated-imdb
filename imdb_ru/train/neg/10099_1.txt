Thank God! I did not spend my money on rent, but downloaded! This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life, with visual effects, unnecessary bleeding and nudity! Away from other zombie films such as Night of the Living Dead and others. The film has a lot of holes and mistakes. Well, if you have time after reading this comment, please view the director’s profile (Ulli Lommel). Seeing that I myself explained why the film is like this, I mean that every film shot by Ulli Lommel gets a rating from 1 to 2. And now I don’t want to look for which films he is director, but I can finish it all, having said one strong sentence. Even for fun, or time, or even in an extreme bored situation, please, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.
