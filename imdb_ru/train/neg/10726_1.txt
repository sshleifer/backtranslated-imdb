I agree with the previous comment, the beginning of the film is pretty good, and you will know what is coming ....... That is nothing. All open storylines remain open; two characters that at first glance seemed important to them are completely excluded, except for one or two very short scenes. I wandered, if Illya would not have done better to just completely eliminate them ... As for the one remaining character, nothing has been done with her either. She just visits some terrible place, and suddenly the film is no longer about her, but about some geriatric witches who spend their days making dolls of bread, drinking homemade vodka and, apparently, flash to each other. Some may say that the film shows a disintegrating society well, like IFFR judges, but for me it's just bad taste, bad camera work, a lousy script and terribly bad management. Therefore, I cannot be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to evaluation: 1!
