One thing that struck me in this film (and not so well) was that Nathan Stoltzfus, who seems to be proud to be the main historian on the subject of Rosenstrasse, was one of the historians working on this film, given how most of the real events have been changed or ignored. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer said that von Trotta said that she never wanted Lena to put Goebbels in bed, but in that case, why did she give everyone the impression that this happened? Why not point out other possible reasons for the liberation of men, such as the catastrophe at Stalingrad or the fear of the Nazis that the international press based in Berlin would hear about the protest. <br /> <br /> Also Why did the whole storyline play second fiddle for a weak family storyline that repeats over and over? Of course, something as amazing as it can carry your own story! In some places it seemed that the film had two plot lines that seemed to really have little in common. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film failed in its goal, which was to draw attention to the little-known act of resistance, which is a shame, because if done better, it could have a major impact.
