As Hummer, I was afraid of the time when I would have the courage to watch this movie and the next “Holiday on buses”. I saw the movie "One Bus" and considered it one of the worst films I have ever seen. He was full of horrible comedy that tormented British television screens in the early 70s. <br /> <br /> I am ashamed to say that in fact in this film there were parts that I was laughing at. I don’t know if it was because I was now familiar with the characters and enjoyed some situations, knowing how they would react. I found Blakey especially amusing, although I could not swear that in the trilogy he utters his catchphrase phrase: "I will get you, Butler." <br /> <br /> After watching “Holidays by Bus,” the jokes started to wear thin, and these three films can be compared to Hammer’s early Dick Burton trilogy, in which the second film is the best (although this is probably they can be compared). <br /> <br /> Only people who would like to watch this film are probably fans of the series who will no doubt like it, and Hammer fans like me. I would like to say that this film is not so bad, and I can think of the worst comedies of Hammer.
