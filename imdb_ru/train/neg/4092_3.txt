I like the movies Fulci, I really do it, and not in some boring ironic way, but I understand that they seem hopelessly inept and distorted for many people. <br /> <br /> Conquest is where Fulci tries his hand at epic fantasy. genre and in fact fails. Structurally, this is similar to most of the Fulci films you have seen. Some things happen, others happen, and sometimes one scene can be tangentially connected to another. In fact, it's like Conan without sets, without a script, without real actors (yes, Arnold Charzenfarts is hardly an actor either), without a budget, silly looking dog soldiers and a lot of blood. <br /> <br /> This one was hard to get through, and I could live without a smear of Vaseline on camera so that it looked like a Hair Metal music video.
