The Danish film "Slim Slam Slum" surprised me by the fact that I was the worst film I've ever seen. I did not think that I could top my list of bad bad b-films, but this one deserves gold. It's not funny. This is a bad game, it is badly filmed and the storyline is bad. The only positive thing I can say about this film is that there are three girls in it. I truly believe that this film can spoil another Danish film "Stjerner uden hjerner", as the worst Danish film in history! And this is really something. Congratulations in advance!
