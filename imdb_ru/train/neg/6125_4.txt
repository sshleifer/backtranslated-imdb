This is the best film a couple Derekov has ever made, and if you think this is a recommendation, then you haven't seen any of the others. There are the usual ingredients: this is as bad as their other efforts, we can observe how Bo often undresses or auditions for wet t-shirt contests, the story is just ridiculously idiotic, and the film takes itself too seriously. And then: orang utany in Africa? <br /> <br /> But this one has something for it. Bo looks great, production values ​​(decorations, costumes, etc.) are pretty good, and this greatly increases their value for the camp. In a strange way, it is actually quite funny, simply because it tries to be serious and fails so badly.
