Of course, this is not really a blockbuster, nor is it aimed at such a position. “Dieter” is the name of a rather popular German musician who is loved or hated for his acting skills, and this is exactly what is said in this film. It is based on the autobiography "Dieter Bohlen", written a few years ago, but should not be accurate in this. The film is filled with offensive sexual content (at least by American standards), which is either funny (not for other “actors”, of course), or stupid - it depends on your humor or on whether you are “Bolen” - fan or not . From a technical point of view, there is nothing to criticize. Speaking of me, I think this film is a good film.
