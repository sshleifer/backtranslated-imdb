Recently, I have been exposed to both this film and “King Arthur” on DVDs, chosen by others for the evening “entertainment,” and together they do not achieve anything more than simply confirm the growing view that the modern public the cinema is completely lacking discrimination and satisfied until they get an "action". Both films were full of rubbish. <br /> <br /> What happened to the character development? What happened to the meaningful dialogue? What happened to ACTING? And, watching something that vaguely claims to be “historical”, no matter what happens with the attempt to catch some measure of accuracy, some realistic idea of ​​the “political map” of that time, even some small fragrance era, especially in its social attitude. Why do they all have to display the 21st century America’s value set? I read disclaimers on boards that "little was known" about the dark ages. Not this way. Significant amounts are known, with a significant scholarship scholarship of that era, but these jokers simply did not bother to do their homework. <br /> <br /> I only wish I could vote 0/10
