Grintham Grace is penniless after the death of her husband, so she turns to growing Ganja to pay bills. It sounds promising, and the ever-reliable Brenda Bletin does not disappoint, but the material is sitcom-thin. In fact, there is a scene where Grace asks for her young gardener, "Give me one" (talk), and he thinks that she asks for sex, and behaves awkwardly. Yes, it is humor, so the nun is bored. Saving Grace, it seems, does not know what she wants: a stunning cinema and a majestic pace evoke memories of Ryan's daughter, while the carefree whim of the country's citizens can be removed from any episode of the Antique Roadshow. It accelerates after the first hour, but by then it is too promising to take care. Unpredictability can be the culmination only due to the presentation of the most shameless Deux ex Machina I have ever seen.
