Because this is all she does during this entire film - undress for no reason. When Tarzan was bitten by a snake, she suddenly takes off her clothes. So, when is boa poison poison poisonous? This whole movie is spoiled. They could not correctly identify the types of animals for this film. How does the Orangutan hang around these chimps? He must have escaped from the set of a much better movie. A group of people cannibal tribe looks caucasin. Why? And why did Bo and her dad draw if they were going to eat later? It was probably just a shit excuse to show her breasts and curves again. Her dad comes up during the hunt and acts silly around a bull elephant standing too close to it. Any real African baby elephant who wasn’t in the circus would have trampled on this asshole’s ass. Any intelligent hunter would start shooting as soon as he saw it. And I can't help wondering if the camera was on LSD, because it continued to show various scenes that moved in slow motion, without a good reason. It made no sense at all. Constrictor boa, with whom Tarzan struggled in the water, looks like one of those 12-foot rubber snakes can be bought at the local Spencer Gifts.Tarzan store in this film, perhaps from Bo, who has played herself like that. Sorry, but this is an excerpt from Tarzan’s classic black and white film with a similar but better story. Not to mention the plot. In this there is one scene. I saw that everyone forgot to mention. * (SPOILER'S WARNING) * In the scene where he is trying to save Jane and her father, he is standing too close to the stream of running water. Looks like he's urinating on someone under him. Eww! In addition, he and Jane are fooling around on the beach, with perverted monkeys jumping and clapping their hands. She really took very well the death of her father. If you see Bo too naked in this film, you go blind.
