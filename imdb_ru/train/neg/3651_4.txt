I was expecting a very funny movie. Instead, I got a movie with a few funny jokes, and many of them just didn’t work. I did not like the idea of ​​attracting the descendants of Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty. It was confusing. It would be funnier if they had Moriarty instead of resurrection. Some things were funny. Burt Kwouk was very fun, as always. McCloud on horseback was funny. McGarrett from Hawaii 5-0 didn't even look like McGarrett. Connie Booth is obviously very good with accents. She is from Indiana, but played well in English and from New York. Unfortunately, she was not represented in the script. I was expecting a more funny movie. Instead, I got a rather confusing movie with a bad script. Rather ironic, since Booth and Cleese were together on this. Maybe they were going to break up in '77.
