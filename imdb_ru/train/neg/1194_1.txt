I have seen many films in my life, but not as many as this one. This is a film that makes fun of fat people, has no real story, bad actors, is not amused, and much more. Is this a movie you would like to watch? Probably not! <br /> <br /> I think the filmmakers tried to be original and creative, but it seems that it was created by a 12-year-old child who has absolutely no cinematic skills. The so-called funny pieces are as funny as the through cakes on people's faces or the breaking wind. Of course, if you like this kind of humor, then this film is for you !! <br /> <br /> Don't waste money on this movie!
