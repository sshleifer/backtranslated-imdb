Pretty crazy bastard with a black actor trying to figure out who killed the falsifying trumpeter who was just about to go to Hollywood to make him big. Was it his wife? His girlfriend? His future girlfriend? Her father? His butler? Newspaper guy? Who knows? And who cares? The result of this is just not a little happy, and the actors here do not give me the mood to take care of a particular case. Why snake venom as a weapon? Who knows? What's the difference? With music, everything is in order, but it is not enough, and most of it is quite "let's get it over with." It is not worth your time. There are the best movies with a black cast.
