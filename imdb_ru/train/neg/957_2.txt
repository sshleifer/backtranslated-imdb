So, I got this as an assignment for Trent Harris, who sometimes teaches in the films section at UU. I think this is his only real way to get someone to watch his movie ... <br /> <br /> The documentary section was delayed at the beginning . Yes, the child is crazy from nowhere, but this is not enough to keep it interesting. <br /> <br /> Seeing Sean Penn wearing ONDJ is the only event ... and in about thirty seconds it loses all humor. <br /> <br /> When Crispin Glover withdraws from Larry, storytelling was better, but I just couldn't stand it anymore ...
