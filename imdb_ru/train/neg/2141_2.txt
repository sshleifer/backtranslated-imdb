I didn't like watching this movie with my girlfriend, who, like me, is a fan of the first one. This movie is straight down sucked! He lacked the magic of the first. You could actually understand every word spoken in mice, the animation is cheesy, the palace is very different from the first movie, there are new characters that were never mentioned before and were terrible, fortunately, the prince did not have many lines that kept him stupid Basically it's like the Lion King 1 1/2, except for the different stories told by the mice. The reason why I put 2 out of 10 is that the songs that are not performed by the characters were the most enjoyable.
