This is one of those dramas that are so bad that they almost seem very funny, the script is absolutely dark, terrible direction, lights pure fittings, the only thing that brings it from the true, so bad that it is a good feeling, is that the design is very bad ; it does not add any tension to the story, although it tries, but at least does not destroy any speech. There are problems of continuity of street shots seasons everywhere. And finally, last but not least, acting is terrible. For professional production, this is very similar to a university media project, about which you should feel sorry for those who should have put their names in it.
