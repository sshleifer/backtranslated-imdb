It is not surprising that the historian Jan Kershaw, the author of Hitler's pioneering biography, who was originally the scientific adviser of this television film, dissociated himself from him. The film is historically too flawed. Mistakes begin immediately when Hitler's father, Alois, dies at home, and in fact he died in a pub. In the film, Hitler moved from Vienna to Munich in 1914, while in fact he actually moved to Munich in 1913. I could go on forever. Hitler's childhood and youth are depicted too short, making it difficult for historically ignorant people to understand the nature of this frustrated neurotic person. Important people of the party’s early time, such as Hitler’s father’s friend Dietrich Eckart or the party “philosopher” Alfred Rosenberg, were completely missing. The characteristic of Ernst Hanfshtengl is very problematic. In the film, he is portrayed as a noble character who almost despises Hitler. The script, obviously, follows Hanfstangl’s own view on the very look he gave in his biography after the war. In fact, Hanfshtengl was an anti-Semite and crazy about his "Fuhrer." But the biggest problem of the film is the image of Hitler himself. He is described as a person who is constantly unfriendly, has neither charisma, nor charm and constantly orders everything around him. Watching the film, one wonders how such a disgusting person could ever get any followers. Since we all know what an evil criminal Hitler was, naturally, every scriptwriter is tempted to portray Hitler as completely disgusting and charismatic. But the facts are such that in private he can be quite charming and entertaining. His comrades did not follow him because he constantly shouted at them, but because they liked this strange man. In addition to all these historical mistakes, the film is well-made, the actors are first-class, the filming and production design give a believable impression of the era.
