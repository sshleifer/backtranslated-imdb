A sign of a classic film is that it is aged like a good red wine. In this film there is no Cabarna and, of course, there is no Casablanca. I agree with other reviewers that the children in the film are an unfortunate mutation, which now torments us at night in comedy series, and the dialogue is unnatural and is being preached. But let's look at the outdated theme of the film. <br /> <br /> Over sixty years of history comes wisdom. Starting from the Patrol on the Rhine, author Lillian Hellman was exposed as Beeden plagiarism with her so-called real story "Julia" from her book "Pentimento". As one of the most odious of many Western apologists of the USSR, it is obvious that its theme in the play and film was to encourage America to take action, to save the bloody Soviet dictator Stalin and international communism from the fascists, who had just proved their military superiority in Of Spain. <br /> <br /> As one reviewer correctly noted, this is not a pro-American play and a film, as Lilian went to the grave to the American hated communists. This film tells about the familiar smug stupidity of the intellectual elite that then made up the left-wing Americans, just as now the lunatic left of The Daily Kos, and Michael Moore accepted the conspiracy theory and again provided help and comfort to those who destroy America.
