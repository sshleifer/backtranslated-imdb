As long as you can tolerate it! If you like to watch people wake up, get up, dress, take a shower, cook dinner, watch each other, have sex in the dark, and then go back to bed to sleep ... if you like sticky apartments, narrow bedrooms and the kitchen, long minutes of silence ... if you like to be bored for two hours, feel the thrill of "this intimate fake art", then you will like it. But if you do not, just try to watch a good movie, there are thousands of them. “While you're here,” but do we want to stay? This German film received the award of the Turin Gay Film Festival: Italian journalists still do not understand why the jury made such a bad decision, since there were many talented films presented at the festival. Maybe it's good with the German, because they do not often receive awards? Well, "The Life of Others" did ... but that's great, but not gay. So maybe this is a fashion issue. Germans again "in"? No matter what? Or, maybe, only in the view of some directors' hustlers?
