I think they really allow the quality of DVD production to get away from them. I rented this DVD in 2 movie stores, and the second time I managed to play it on the third DVD player I tried. <br /> <br /> Does anyone else have this problem? It is really difficult to give an objective review of the film after such a hassle to play it. On the one hand, I had never seen a Finnish horror film before, so I was somehow upset that the film was shot in English. In addition, since it was never clear what was wrong with Sarah, she simply fell behind, and so I just hoped that someone would shoot her face and make all the horrible events disappear.
