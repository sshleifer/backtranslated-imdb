A “Bulletproof” movie can only be used once: it reminds you how bad a bad movie can be. We often see films that we describe as “pretty awful” or “not so good”, but then you come across such a film, and you can see that, although all these other films are not “good,” they are not that stinky . bad as bulletproof. It was a birthday present from someone who spent less than two seconds rummaging through the DVD crate at our local supermarket to fulfill my commitment (i.e. give me a present). It could have been an accidental find, but it’s not so: it’s so banal, it’s so poorly written, it’s badly directed, it’s so badly that I’m surprised that everyone involved wasn’t arrested and dismissed for 10 years. God, it's terrible. I suspected that after about 30 seconds, but I continued, because sometimes - sometimes - bad films are so bad that they can be fun. This is not one of them. This is just bad. I stopped looking after 45 minutes, and tomorrow I'll throw it in the trash.
