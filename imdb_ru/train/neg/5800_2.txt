As a fan of horror films, I try to watch all the significant news of this genre, especially those that are products of my national cinema. And I can say that “The Power of Fear” (or “Vedma” in the Russian title) is one of the weakest films among them. Firstly, even a small child is not afraid, he moves so slowly and so predictably that there is no room for real horror. Honestly, this is bad in all respects: from a stupid plot (I don’t know why Russian producers / directors decided to turn the classic story of Ukrainian witchcraft into some kind of unconvincing and funny modern American fighter. I absolutely agree with the previous reviewer - it does not bother a bit) and the work of terrible and raw actors. All the actors, including the presenters Valery Nikolaev and Yevgeny Kryukov, quite famous in Russia, look like wooden dolls or something like that, and it seems to me that they didn’t even bother to play at all, only spoke English without any either expressions. And in the end I don’t really understand why they shot this film in English with Russian actors? I think it was their wrong turn. At the very least, they could play some American or English actors for starring roles so that they look more convincing. I can say the same about the so-called “backgrounds of a small American city” that were shot in Estonia and look like this. The only positive thing that I found in the “Power of Fear” is the visual effects. They are not great, but rather good for a Russian film. And the music is fine, at least it doesn't annoy me. That's why I give him two stars. In general, if you want to watch a good horror movie ?? Do not waste your time and money on this boring movie. And if you are looking for something that claims to be the title of Russian horror, I would advise you to find a copy of "Viy or the Spirit of evil." It’s really a terrific movie based on the same novel as The Power of Fear, but much, much better.
