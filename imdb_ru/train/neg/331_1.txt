Without a shadow of a doubt, I can say that Going Overboard is the only worst film I've ever seen, and yes, I saw Cujo. Adam Sandler is an abomination as Shekki Moskowitz, a copycat who works on a cruise ship. This is the plot. <br /> <br /> That's it! Nothing else makes sense in the film, it’s like a lunatic’s breakfast everywhere, and not in the style of a stupid naked gun, but rather as a disappointment, “drop both tv-style shoes”. even General Noriega appears, for no reason I can understand (this is, of course, not for humor). Add a note to Miss Australia, who has the worst Australian accent I've ever heard, and you have something that I won't call the worst movie ever made because going overboard doesn't even fit the basic definition of a movie . I highly recommend watching this movie, as it will raise the reputation of every bad movie you’ve ever seen. I guarantee that the first thing you say after watching a bad movie is: “At least it wasn’t as bad as Going Overboard”.
