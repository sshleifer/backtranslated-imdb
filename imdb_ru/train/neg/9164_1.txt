I must preface this by saying that I am a huge romantic. So I really wanted this movie. Therefore, I am writing my thoughts to save the rest of the frustration I felt while watching it. Leap years tell of the fateful story of Lee-Ann, who falls in love with courteous Jeremy and commits to meet every leap year. A very romantic premise based on a great story and cast that doesn't feel like you're watching another Jack Neo movie. Then why is it so bad? First, I feel that the filmmakers thought they were making a music video, because they decided to replace storytelling and any real emotions with stupid montages, predictable actions and cliches. I am both upset and embarrassed by being one of the first in Singapore to watch Leap Years, but those of us who are in the cinema would agree that our muffled moans on decent shooting shows speak volumes. I was hoping to watch a romantic movie that would surpass Forever Fever, the best Singaporean romantic comedy at the moment, and The Leap Years are not even close. Some blogs call it "Stupid Years", which is harsh, but ultimately true. Do not waste your money or emotions like me. The film will make you forever renounce love.
