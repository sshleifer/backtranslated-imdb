OK. I know that all the films about the 80s with John Hughes were one-sided, so the expectations for this film were rather low. <br /> <br /> However, looking at this nonsense, I can do something "seems to be in my head: <br /> <br /> I just watched a Rob 80s 80s movie, which was not nudity and only hints of sex. <br /> <br /> The game is terrible characters are boring and flat, the image of Oxford is an absolute insult, and the rowing scenes are uninteresting, without incident and inaccurate. <br /> <br /> If you don’t have some weird Ellie Shidi or Amanda Pace (or I think Rob Lowe) is a fetish, there’s really no reason to see it.
