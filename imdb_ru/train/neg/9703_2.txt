For those who are too young to know this, or for those who have forgotten, by the end of the 1980s, Disney had practically abandoned the idea. People didn’t watch their films anymore, and the company didn’t produce ordinary useful material ... at least not what people expected. The main problem: profanity. <br /> <br /> Yes, the idiots who make Disney films during this decade will produce films with obscene words - including the name of the Lord in vain, if you can believe it - interspersed into this “family of films.” This happens twice here in the first 20 minutes! <br /> <br /> This film, in addition to language problems, also has an unpleasant tint, which makes it almost impossible from the very beginning. Fortunately, Disney woke up and released a lot of great materials after of these decadent films of the 80s. ("Touchstone" is Disney, just under another one and meme.)
