I gave it four purely from its historical context. It was considered lost for many years, until it suddenly appeared on Showtime in the early nineties. <br /> <br /> Mo is a straightforward man, and Larry and Curly act as a duet. Spade Cooley has a couple of rooms. I think it has something to do with work on the ranch. I'm not entirely sure, because the plot was so minimal that I did not remember anything. I vaguely remember that this is a western musical comedy. Even Rough seems to be going through the motions. In general, there is nothing special to recommend. <br /> <br /> If you are not a Stooge fan, do not worry. If you're a Stooge fan, stick to shorts.
