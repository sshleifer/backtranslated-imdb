Spoiler!! I love Brana, I love Helena Bonham-Carter, I loved them together in "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" - but THAT- <br /> <br /> I can understand the actor's desire to stretch to avoid the romantic stereotype. Well, they did, but actually - the script worked, Bonham-Carter’s clothes were insanely luxurious, and the episodic accelerated “insane” sequence could be an excerpt from the Beatles movie, or with old Rowan and Martin Laf. In. <br /> <br /> I didn’t understand - other commentators say that Bran’s character was a dreamer. I have never felt this. He was a loser, and not very bright, and, of course, not endearing. A business with a disguise of a bank robber was just painful to watch. Of course, this is not fun. <br /> <br /> Realistic (it can be assumed) attempts by Bonham-Carter as a realistic speech are more difficult to understand than the first 15 minutes of Lancashire's accent in the film “The Complete Monty”. <br /> <br /> The poetic ending, when he was high on a hill, and she was buried under the monster of his plane, was too organized. Was there angels choir or just a soundtrack? <br /> <br /> Go back to the classics or something with a spine and arc to it. Donate it to PBS. <br /> <br />
