This film looks like it was made for television. For years I was waiting for a movie about Ruby Carter, because I liked to see him on the old MSG, and it was a shame to watch this movie. I have a lot of respect for Mr. Washington, but he was terrible and boring. Thereâ€™s nothing good to say about this movie, except that I liked the song.
