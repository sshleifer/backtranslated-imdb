As a gamer, I can't say that I like this movie. Actually, I hate it. I tried to look as unbiased as possible, but when it comes to this, it seems rather offensive to my social group. <br /> <br /> For me there are several reasons why. <br /> <1. Characters seem unnatural. I have met many players from different backgrounds. I don't know anyone who would act like any of the characters in the film. As if the film's producers took the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and put them all in 5 people. Most players are quite sociable people, some lead a rather active life. <br /> <br /> 2. Style does not work. A suitable style is not well suited for the plot of the film. An actual documentary about gamers will work better. Although he looks good (that is, neatly folded), he is not very good. <br /> <br /> 3. The dialogue seems forced, unnatural. It also seems that there is no real world context in it. Gamers, I swear, I admit it, but we do not have Tourette syndrome. <br /> <br /> 4. There is not enough humor. While self-deprecating humor is the basis of my group and several other groups I have come across, this is less self-deprecating and more like toilet humor. Similarly, most gamer humor is full of jokes and anecdotes, not toilet humor. Most gamers will be offended and avoid those who joke. <br /> <br /> 5. The biggest problem for me is basically this: accuracy. I do not mean rules, but dynamics. This film will invariably be compared with even lower-budget films “Gamers” and “Gamers: Rise of High Cost,” which portray players as real people playing a real game. The difference is that Gamers: The Movie represents a situation in which you want to defeat mindless players against The Gamers, when you can say something like, “Ha, I know this guy ... Yes, it definitely looks like Gary. "
