There are people who will illuminate something! This is the only explanation I can offer as to why the film “The House of the Dead” exists. And this is just a scary part of the whole movie. It's so bad that you go to the cinema forever. I seriously wanted to turn it off and switch the TV to the “Drying Paint” channel, but I was willing to put up with it with my word. I do not know why I do these bad things with me. <br /> <br /> As if it makes a difference, this is the main essence of the “story” A group of twenty people are so desperate to go to some island in the Pacific Northwest (actually, in Canada, because it’s cheap) for Rave of the Century (about 8 people and crazy music), they pay a little $ 1000 rocky old fisherman to take them there after they miss the main ferry. It must be some kind of nonsense to cost all this test! The fisherman warns them that the island is also known as the Isle of the Dead (wait, I thought it was the HOUSE of the Dead?) And that they were all doomed. <br /> <br /> First mistakes here. Why is there a tiny rave on some remote island (Centuries of mine!)? Why would anyone be willing to pay a lot of money to get it? Why pay even more to the old rocky fisherman to take them back when they could just return with the others? <br /> <br /> As soon as they arrive, they discover that the rave (consisting of 2 tents, a small stage) and port john was broken, there was blood everywhere, and no one was around. What would any rationally minded person do? Run for your life of course. But no, these ignorant, apparently blind people decide to go in search of them. Soon enough, they discover an old, decrepit house, inside which is 50 times larger than the outside. Then another half-hour should stumble in the forest as a pretext for killing some of the less significant characters, and after a long exhaustion, they return to the house again. Characters, as in the film, go nowhere. <br /> <br /> In this terrible catastrophe there is an abundance of meaningless dialogue, disgusting acting skills, demonstration of mumibulatures and many clips from the once popular arcade game of the same name. Why it was generally accepted as a good idea with directors, I will never know. Movies have nothing to do with any of the scenes and only worsen this garbage even more, if at all possible. <br /> <br /> This has nothing to do with the game, with the exception of the cheap one-off line at the end. This makes Resident Evil look like cinematic glory. Hell, even the Double Dragon film seems like a multi-Oscar compared to this trash. The only one who comes out of it with his dignity, still intact, is Jürgen Prochnow. He could just take his money and run, but he tries his best with a terrible scenario and brings tiny pathos into his character. I'm afraid other actors suck. Characters are idiots and deserve death. <br /> <br /> In addition, if you turn off swearing and senseless nudity, I see no reason why this film should not be shown on Saturday morning television. This is not at all scary. Pirates of the Caribbean are worse than the skeletal bad guys in this movie. And where did all these bad guys come from? At first there were only a few people on the island. I think this justifies the reason why they decided to use the footage again and again. I am not joking, you will see how the same zombie dies dozens of times. <br /> <br /> Who is ultimately to blame for this scandalous waste of celluloid? None other than the director Uwe Boll. His control over the film is missing. You can clearly see that the actors have no idea what they should do, and that the zombies do not really take it seriously. It seems that the actors read the cue cards, as they constantly stop in the middle of long sentences and keep talking as soon as they see the next card. It all seems very unnatural. <br /> <br /> Plus the film was shot as a two-part mini-series. I really saw the best television productions. And don't make me start editing. The film is rambling with thousands and thousands of meaningless shots and dozens of senseless panning camera. No real skills or talents were invested in creating this at all. This is really confusing and astounding how these horribly bad films can be made, and George A. Romero can't even get anyone to answer his calls. “House of the Dead” makes some idiotic reference to Romero in a lazy attempt to become “postmodern,” but it’s annoying that they think THAT is in the same league as the REAL zombie movie. <br /> <br /> For what it is worth the fact that the anamorphic image of 1.85: 1 looks great, and the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is clean, but very impressive and serves only to utter much more used ADR. The DVD comes with add-ons, but why torture yourself. Isn't this review warning enough? Stay away! You are all doomed, I tell you! Doomed! Doomed !!!
