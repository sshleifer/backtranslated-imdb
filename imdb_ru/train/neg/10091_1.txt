I can not believe that this film was ever created. I think that at some point the director is trying to make it a piece of art, but this only aggravates the situation. Zombies look like they put too much eye makeup. Zombies only in the movie for a few minutes. Finally, there may be five or six zombies, definitely not a nation. The best part of the film, if there is one, is definitely merit, because the agonizing experience was finally over. Once again, to repeat other user comments, voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense in the entire film. There is also a scene with a snake and a Romanian girl who doesn't make any sense at all. This is never explained.
