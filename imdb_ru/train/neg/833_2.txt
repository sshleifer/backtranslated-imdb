There was no particular story in this film. It was loosely based on the events in the first film of the Lion King. It is assumed that this is how Timon and Pumba met due to their loneliness. But it is not much more. <br /> <br /> He mixes some scenes from the original, and then talks about how this movie changed them a bit. But still, is it so? I was hoping for something else. Instead, all I have to show is an empty story with a little explanation. <br /> <br /> I think if you wanted to see other meerkats in the universe of King Lion, that's all. But besides this, this is not very true for animators. Disney really should stop this direct video production. It really was pretty boring and could use Jason Statham. "D-"
