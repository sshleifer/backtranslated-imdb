** SPOILERS ** Redicules slasher film that makes no sense with a killer wearing a black robe and wearing something like a Peter Lorre rubber mask. At the beginning of the film, almost in the very first scene, it was said that young Beth Morgan was in rehab because of intense drug use after her boyfriend was killed in Tennyson Collage about a year ago. <br /> <br /> It was also revealed that the FBI agent Sacker (Jeff Conavey), who was obsessed with catching the killer, the daughter, was also killed in Tennyson at about the same time. By the time the movie “Do you want to know the secret,” didn’t explain that these two Connecticut murders were related to the Florida massacre about half a dozen collage students a year later? except that the killer, at least in the murder of Beth's boyfriend, wore the same silly Halloween clothes. <br /> <br /> During spring break in the state of Sunshine, six students spend their holidays in a beach house, and before you know it, they begin to shoot down one by one. Starting from Brad Clayton’s computer geek, Chad Allen, the murder even spread to the city, with the result that many people who had nothing to do with the target student, including police chief Gavin Jack McGee, were uncovered. <br /> <br /> A masked killer saves Beth permanently in this strange ceremony in an abandoned church that looks like the Florida Everglades. Then he finally reveals who he is and his intentions, which make as much sense as a movie, but nothing. Trying to scare your audience, all that makes a film is to confuse and confuse a lot of not-too-convincing killer scenes. The most effective of them with the victim Oz Washington, Tom Jay Jones, survived at least three attempts on his life and eventually ended up with agent Saker, the hero of the film. <br /> <br /> Oz also had a brutal cut on his leg from a large piece of glass that nearly cut it in half and crippled it, but later he miraculously recovered after he was arrested for a murder he did not commit, in fact, he had it two more times, with the murderer, not as much with him as with a slight limp in his walk! It also didn't make any sense, why did Oz and Beth go on their own to catch the killer and catch the killer instead of calling the police using the mobile phone Oz had? <br /> <br /> Beth's boyfriend, who loses his head over her, in the Hank Ford film, Joseph Lawrence, is also very unconvincing, like the two girls in the beach house. They, along with Beth Oz, end up being victims of murderers and then somehow disappear from sight! for a moment you didn’t know if they were really killed at all or whether it was some kind of hallucination on the part of Oz or the local police. To the final scene behind the wall, where they popped up in the church. <br /> <br /> We also get an idea of ​​the previous relationship between Tina and Hank with her, drunk and acting disgusting, trying to figure it out. with Hank, when Beth comes in without Hank and Tina, even noticing her. This seemed to upset Beth even more than killing her boyfriend at the beginning of the movie!
