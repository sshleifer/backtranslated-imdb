I saw "Paris Je T'Aime" because a friend really wanted to see him, so I went with him. Upon entering, I was indifferent to the film, but, leaving the theater, I really regretted that I had spent 2 hours of my life sitting in this cool performance. "Stories" are almost completely forgotten, except for the fact that most of them were terrible. What does Gene Rowlands and Ben Gazzar have to do with Paris? The endless parade of American actors definitely gave this French film a surprisingly non-French feeling. The cliché about Paris was endless. Yes, most of them played with clichés about Paris, but, spending so much time ridiculing French clichés, they directly and regretfully promoted them again. Yes, Paris is a city of love. We understood. <br /> <br /> The worst episodes were: director Wes Craven (Oscar Wilde); the one with Nick Nolte; mime (worst?); hair products one; one with Juliette Binoche (Willem Defoe, like a cowboy in the center of Paris?); a vampire (when I think of Paris, I think of Elijah Wood). The one with Natalie Portman, who really looked like a Mentos ad, was stupid (a blind young man should know that Portman was just playing a role when she called him). And it went on. It seemed endless. <br /> <br /> I didn’t like Coen Bros. It does play with these Parisian clichés, but I didn't find it funny. Just annoying. Gus Van Sant was interesting, but it was so insignificant (and the zest was obvious) that it could hardly be registered. <br /> <br /> There were only two “successful” segments, and they were one of the immigrant nannies leaving their child in kindergarten just to look after a child for a rich woman. Good irony there. And a segment about an African who is slaughtered. This is the best segment in the entire film, but this segment has nothing to do with Paris. This story could happen in any city in the world. <br /> <br /> The last episode in which there was a plump middle-aged woman was also quite interesting, but the basic tone was bad. They wanted to celebrate her limited knowledge of French, but this segment sounded condescending. <br /> <br /> The whole project was forced and not inspired. Almost like the French government sponsored this film to promote tourism. In general, from 10 to 15 minutes of interesting things, “Paris Je T'Aime” was a terrible cinematic experience.
