This film, despite its “independent” status, is a stupid Hollywood version of mother's and daughter’s sickening relationship. At first it was not so bad, but somewhere during the film - around the time when the daughter meets this guy, I think - it turns into a cheesy film connecting the mother and daughter. I'm sorry, but I don’t know a single mother who has such a relationship with her daughter ... although it’s probably better.
