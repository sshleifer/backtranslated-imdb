What were they thinking at Cannes? One of the most annoying movies ever. Every detail of this film, no matter how meaningless was shown. If I had to watch her put on these shoes again, I think I would scream. If the purpose of this film was to show how pitiful the life of Rosetta was, then it was covered during the first fifteen minutes of the film, and then the captions were to work. But no, we had to see countless extra scenes over and over. All this was filled with unattractive and non-sympathetic characters. They deserve the suffering of Rosetta. And to think that I missed “Bunches” to see this overly-promoted film of boredom. It was like watching grass grow, only it is more exciting.
