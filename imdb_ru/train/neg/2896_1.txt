I could not sit out the whole movie. Do such families really exist somewhere? There were many comments describing this family as similar to the models of LL Bina and the like, and I think this is a great description of how they behaved. <br /> <br /> More incredibly incredible writing / action occurs when we meet a character mentioned in high school as a "pig", which, of course, turned into an awesomely gorgeous 20-year-old plastic surgeon with a Harvard education (but only for doing good in the world - not for money), and she sleeps with Steve Carrell on the first date. That's when I stopped watching ... <br /> <br /> If you can completely stop your disbelief for two hours, then you might like this sentimental, self-indulgent waste of time.
