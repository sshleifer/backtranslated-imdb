Elvis left the building, and he was lucky because he did not need to watch this unfunny bastard. Backstage scene director Joel Zwick finds ways to make the unfunny screenplay even less fun. Filled with unfunny death, banal characteristics of gays and hacker jokes, this film is more desperate than funny. This is such a film that gives hope that Kim Basinger will follow Doris Day to his early resignation. Let's remember her as she was (talented), and not who she became. David Leisure, delightful Dennis Richards and the rest are all wasted talents here. Zwick finds a way to minimize his talents at every turn. The guy who plays Elvis is more like Homer than King. The only thing that is really great is a young girl who plays Basinger as a child. She really looks like her and is actually pretty good. The only other reason to watch this movie at all is to look for Tom Hanks' cameo. The cameo is not so funny, but at least not painful. One has to wonder whether Zwick has compromising pictures of Hanks or something that would make him make this film.
