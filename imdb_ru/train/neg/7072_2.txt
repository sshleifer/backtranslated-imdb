My name roughly sums up this bunch of crap. I should have realized that this is a film about Fred Deer Ray - but I thought: “Hey, boy can be better than his usual trash,” was I wrong? It must be the worst movie ever made for kids. The action was terrible, there was no humor, The Direction was the worst I've ever seen, and the special effects wouldn't seem out of place in the Disney movie of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> WHAT HAPPENED WITH US A DEE-WALL STONE! Who once had such a promising career in the 80s. The movie veteran and former child actor Russ Tamblyn was a terrible villain, and the budget was so low that it was completely unbelievable even in a children's film. <br /> <br /> I didn’t see a sequel made in 1999, nor do I intend to <br /> <br /> if you want a good film for children, see “HONEY, I AMIFIED / CHILDREN EXPLOSION / CHILDREN ”OR ANY FILM“ DISNI ”<br /> <br /> MY RATING IS LIKE 19 YO: - 2/10 <br /> <br /> RATING AS FILM: - 3/10 BETTER!
