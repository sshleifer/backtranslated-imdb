A film with a very dense road and comic relief provided by excellent John Cleese (although he does send his performance to Fawlty Towers). It seems that he overturned because of the upper farce to slushy sentimentality in the blink of an eye, and the worst part of the film is that Martin and Hawn must “find themselves” who they are, etc. Look at your own peril and risk.
