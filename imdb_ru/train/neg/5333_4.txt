A soft mess posing as a comedy. Elvis Presley plays an Indian bull champion who leaves a rodeo to stay at home in his parents' deserted territory in Arizona, where government suits have just invested in a family cattle herd (who badly needs a herd), director Peter Tewksbury badly needs some narrative skills, although he lacks appreciation, which he compensates for inaccurate comedic edits (his social commentary is not entirely accurate, but Tewksbury has a satirical twist to his wildness, and there are several about funny scenes). Despite the colorful supporting turns of Katie Jurado and Joan Blondel, general tomfoolery spinning out of control, and too many screams and screams to maintain a lot of interest. As for Elvis, he is free and harsh everywhere - and although it's nice to see how he is having fun on the screen, you need to ask yourself if he just left films at this moment. This collapsed picture has a great feeling, damn it, to this, and although the spirits are high, the return is mostly low. * 1/2 of ****
