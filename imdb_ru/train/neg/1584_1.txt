I read The Running Man from Kings as Bachmann and I felt like the main character John and his family. This movie could be SO much more. Problem? It was installed during a great passion for militants. I watched the movie and suffered all the time. I felt nothing for the character and less for his cause. Yes, it was funny scenes (or ludicrous), although I think it did not save the film in my eyes. If you are reading a book, you can feel the climax and fire in Johnâ€™s heart when he is finally taking revenge. <br /> <br /> I give this film a small number. Perhaps it would not be so low if I did not read the book.
