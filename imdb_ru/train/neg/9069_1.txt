(David H. Steinberg) The script originally had some clever moments that could make a good romantic comedy, BUT BUT, oh dear! What ever happened on the way ??? !!!! <br /> <br /> I will tell you what happened. Originally it is (Animal House - 1978) and (Porky's - 1982). Although it was a long time ago, but they are pioneers, godfathers of a new genre: a rough teen comedy. Then came the 1990s. After important cases that have become colossal hits (repulsive, I add), such as (Problem Child - 1990), (Dumb and Dumber - 1994), (Nutty Professor - 1996) and (There is something about Mary - 1998) which I think that the idlers are influenced by the top of the era and the prophet of the next era, the one and only (American Pie - 1999), which undoubtedly is incomparably an icon of the genre. After that, I think that every comedy of this kind should be so dirty, with disgust, that the youth would admire, otherwise it might not be in fashion! <br /> <br /> I believe that (idlers) had first a clever plot in the form of a script, and then its creators should add a really large amount: rudeness, filth, strangely shameless sex - in those days - as easy as pie! As if they were to fill each scene with free elements, such as: masturbation, oral sex, urination, etc., just to look a la style. They are completely unnecessary elements in history, but, of course, THEY are so necessary to make a profit and catch the latest fashion in the creation of comedy films for teenagers. The problem is how it all replaced any possible comedy in that. <br /> <br /> Some of her moments looked literally awful, and, as you can see, this is the essence. It's all about the views and performance of Jason Schwartzman; unforgettably disgusting to the limit. Thus, the ambitions turned from this romantic comedy into the creation of what was not done before, from the pure-skinned images. To be more like a horror where you ask all the time; what will be worse? (vomiting, farting, etc.); This is currently the easiest combination to create a comedy. <br /> <br /> Although even if you hated her, you need to love something (mostly for courage), for me it was only Gina Gershon’s cameo scene. Somehow, they designed it as a whole to achieve a disgrace for a disgrace, like a moody dream of a teenager. Although most of them were close to someone's nightmare. <br /> <br /> What upset me was the fact that in essence it was a real potential work, and not another cheap, yet another stupid comedy, as it was finally possible to do. Well remember the details of the theft of the exam (the first 2 minutes), so the main plot of the film (the eccentric trying to reach the girl by blackmailing tough guys) follows the scheme (the boy loves the girl and the girl loves the other boy), because save it Nothing but frank sloka. It dealt with its stuff, like a bunch of dirty college guys who have nothing to do except to do crazy pranks with everything they want to do. It all ended up being there, and I apologize to say this, smiling shit! <br /> <br /> At the end, he said something (you can imagine!) About how this time and place is also for an impostor or a weak person to win, just like this comedy. Sounds good, but another best movie; who could reassure my opinion about it as being clever .. One day! And do not need to understand a lot that the creators of this film were real idlers! Maybe stupidity is a way to be smart in Hollywood, but even if ... The final result here was not, at least, witty in any sense of the word. <br /> <br /> PS: his screenwriter (David H. Steinberg), who also wrote the story (American Pie 2), has an IMDb home page where you will find “Additional Details”. his usual "plot keywords": Sex / Vulgarity / Rough humor / ... They just forgot to write Urine, taking a shower or exposing 70-year-old women!
