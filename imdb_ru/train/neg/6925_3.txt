I feel much less generous with this film than others. The image of the crazy in this century is always done in such a way that they are so bizarre that they are different species. Their antics are so outrageous that they are completely fictional. Each is Napoleon or some other historical figure; or they are addicted to chickens. They make or beat each other. As if the screenwriter said what I can do for them, not realizing what insanity or even mental illness is. Look at the wonderful human image in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", where diseases are believable and real. I once worked in a state mental hospital. I haven't seen any of these guys. They are too smart and prudent to make them come to life.
