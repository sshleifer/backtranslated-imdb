I went to this with great anticipation. Unfortunately, the dialogue is completely stupid, and in general the film is far from inspiring fear or interest. Even a child can see the missing logic of the character's behavior. Today’s children need creative stories that would inspire them, which would make them “dream” of events. This is exactly what happened with films like Ye.T. and Star Wars ten years ago. (How many children imagined that they would become Jedi Knights and light their lightsabers?) Don't seriously waste your time and money on this.
