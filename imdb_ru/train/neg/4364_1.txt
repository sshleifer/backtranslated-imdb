I find it hard to understand why this piece of garbage was repackaged. The only saving grace in all this is the body of Ariown in her sexual uniform. Her humor should also be appreciated. She is a definite plus, but, alas, it will take a mage to save this garbage. However, she must be positively recognized for her heroic efforts and true professionalism. I can not say the same for her colleague in the film Lilith with her aching voice that irritates your nervous system. It looked disinterested and it seemed that only her presence on the set was all that was needed. Everyone says, except for the speech Ariauna, this is really complete nonsense.
