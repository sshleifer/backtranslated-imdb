John Carradine, John Ireland and Faith Domegg, who as players have all seen the best days in the best films, come together for this class G horror film about life imitating art in a mysterious mansion. <br /> <br /> For Carradine, it was in those. During the last two decades of his career, when he appeared in everything that concerned theory, it was better to continue working no matter what you did, and get those salaries. With this magnificent sonorous voice, Carradine was always in great demand for horror films and this man was no different from what he had appeared in. <br /> <br /> He plays a caretaker in an old gothic mansion that was directed by director John Ireland for his latest low budget film. There is even a cemetery, but with the missing. Faith Domergue is Irelandâ€™s aging star, and Carol Wells is a young inventor. <br /> <br /> In the last twenty minutes or so, most of the actors are dead, who are not dead yet. The script is so incoherent that I am still trying to understand the point. I will not spend more gray matter on it.
