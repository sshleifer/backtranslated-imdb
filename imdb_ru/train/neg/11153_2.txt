Another example from a long series of films made by people who think that knowing how to work with a camera is the same thing as telling a story. Within 15 minutes, the entire package is decomposed in just a few lines, so there is absolutely no mystery that removes the whole aspect of uncertainty. The only half-competent actor is killed in 10 minutes in the film, so we stay with stupid characters running around and doing stupid things. Low budget films cannot afford expensive special effects, so parts of the CGI, which is not surprising, are not impressive, but were at least a real attempt. The creature's costume is terrible, as can be seen when it falls on the pavement, and the director continues to emphasize his eyes, which are not even red in the color shown in the mirror images. The dialogue is awkward and boring, with some lines reminiscent of Foreigners or the Terminator. The last sequence of actions takes place in the police station, also a robbery with the Terminator, when everyone hides in an office separated by glass, into which the Dark Wolf does not crash. In the end, the girl calls the hero a “good defender,” but he gets both of her partners, the original Defender and at least three other civilians, not to mention a dozen policemen, all killed without getting a decent shot. bullets and automatic. But the real argument in favor of a bad letter: they could kill the beast immediately after the initial credits, when he kept the stripper, at the same time flashing red eyes. Instead, they took him into custody?!?
