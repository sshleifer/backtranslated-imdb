I'm a big fan of horror movies, and zombie movies are my favorite movie. However, Zombi 3 is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Needless to say, I really enjoyed it, it's the best bad movie I've seen in a long time. This story bears some resemblance to the “Return of the Living Dead” by Dan O'Bannon, but although this film was intentionally ridiculous, this one is the opposite. It has some of the most ridiculous acts I have ever seen, especially from the main character of the scientist. His scenes with the general were just hysterical. In addition, the effects are substandard and in many cases sloppy, and the death scenes are often just stupid. This, of course, makes it even more fun. POSSIBLE SPOILER - Worst of all is the scene in which the guy opens the refrigerator door and sees the severed zombie head, which then opens his eyes and somehow flies out from under the REFRIGERATOR (obviously, clumsily pulled out with a small amount of rope), clinging to the guys neck, killing him . Do zombie heads have the ability to float in the air now? He defies all the laws of physics known to man, and this is one of the most absurd things ever filmed. This is just one of many really silly moments in an idiotic mess. I can't believe he got such a high rating here. If you're a fan of bad movies, do yourself a favor and rent this sucker.
