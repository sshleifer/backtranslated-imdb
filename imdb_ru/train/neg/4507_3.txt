Despite the overall pleasant story and expensive production, one wonders how the director can make so many clumsy cultural mistakes. Where were the Japanese dressing and cultural consultants? Apparently not in the payroll. <br /> <br /> My Japanese friend actually loudly laughed at some of the cultural absurdities that she watched as she unfolded before her eyes. In a subsequent conversation, she said: “Imagine that a Finnish director is shooting a film in Finnish about the American Civil War, using blond Swedish actors as the allied army and the French as confederates. skip the hoop and wear a hairstyle of the 1950s. Maybe some people in Finland may not be aware that the hoop skirt “skips the hoop”, or recognize Jane Mansfield's fancy hair, but in Atlanta they would not believe their eyes or ears .... and laugh in the aisles ... be damned great story and picture. <br /> <br /> So ... watching a geisha’s memoirs was painful for anyone familiar with Japanese cultural nuances, a real geisha, or a Japanese dress, and that was the theme of the film! Hollywood is amazing for its short-sighted filmmaking. They often correctly understand what big money is, and the details that really hone the grace of films are embarrassingly wrong. I thought the Last Samurai was the crown achievement of how bad a good movie about Japan can be. Memoirs of a geisha embarrassingly better and worse at the same time.
