As far as I can tell you, despite earlier comments by other commentators, this film is currently available on DVD. I found it just a few weeks ago. <br /> <br /> This is on the Value DVD label, and I paid 98 cents plus tax. I found it in a store 98 cents among the racks with plastic bowls and disposable chopsticks. Surely you, people who bought back excess money for the super-popular Swedish import version with a limited edition, do not feel that you had ??? I thought so. <br /> <br /> This movie really cost 98 cents. 99 cents, I can start arguing with you. But clearly worth 98 cents. And remember this statement about getting what you pay for. Only for slashers.
