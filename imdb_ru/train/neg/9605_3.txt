This Italian film of the 70s is not even in a class with “Dog Soldiers”, “Howl” or even with this terrible American werewolf in Paris, BUT ... it's fun to watch. I'm talking about watching the main actress, a stunning blonde, furious in her festive costume. We're talking about graphics, complete nudity ... obviously, she is a real blonde ... humma humma humma !! The story is a scream, SFX is childish, and the action (for the most part) stinks. The only value of this film is all (and many) scenes of nudity and sex. Tamed by HBO standards, but still interesting to see when you find yourself without a date on Saturday night. OK ... HERE SPOILER ... NO werewolf (except on the initial scene of the heroine's ancestor (??). The girl simply represents that she is a werewolf ... in other words, a clinical lycanthrope.
