In 1993, the "visitors" were a huge success in France. So, the sequence was inevitable, and, unfortunately, this sequence is among the worst ever created. <br /> <br /> This is a film that does not fulfill its promises. In fact, this should tell one story. Jean Reno had to leave in the twentieth century and return Christian Clavier to the Middle Ages so that time could normally take its course. The problem is that Clavier feels completely calm in the world of the twentieth century, and therefore it is rather difficult to make him return to the Middle Ages ... Instead, the film tells a few more stories, but it fails to follow the main plot. As a result, the film becomes sometimes erratic, sometimes a bit erratic. <br /> <br /> But the film also suffers from the actions of almost all the actors. Renault and Clavier fall into the trap, which, however, they can avoid in the first film: they go beyond and become annoying. Then why did director Jean-Marie Poiret draw Muriel Robin to the main female role? He made a mistake because she seems awkward and absolutely pitiful. The rest of the actors are not better: Marie-Anne Chazel does not exist, and Christian Buzho is unbearable. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are some good moments in the film with effective gags, but it often falls into vulgarity and lightness. This affects some sequences and dialogs. It also seems empty because Poiret returns the elements that ensured the success of the first film. Thus, a young girl takes Reno for a close relative of her family and asks him to take part in her wedding. <br /> <br /> Difficult and disappointing continuation. Anyway, what is interesting in this film, otherwise commercial? <br /> <br />
