I couldn't help but recommend a Christmas movie more than this useless piece of nonsense (believe me, double negatives are needed here - it's so bad). This film had trouble with the opening credits, when it turned out that the screenwriter was the same person as the songwriter. The musical numbers are too long and not good for anything (“Thank You Very Much” has a decent melody, but the lyrics are stupid beyond words). I will gladly endure the chains put on by Scrooge in the freakish hellish sequence of the film, than reliving this insult for musicals. <br /> <br /> The only entertainment part of this film (by the way, completely unintended) is associated with Alec Guinness as Jacob Marley. Dressed in a silly white suit powder, Guinness frantically jumps over his scenes, trying to make him look as if he is floating like a ghost, or to show his complete contempt for the need to be in this horrible film. Albert Finney, meanwhile, combines the best of Alistair Sima and Charles Lawton to create his desperately disgusting character Quasimodo / Scrooge. Scrooge of Finney is so disgusting a man that it is impossible to believe in his transformation. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this filth of filmmaking at all costs.
