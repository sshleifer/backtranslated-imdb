I noticed that this film took on a lot of insults. Perhaps some of them earned, but it was not so bad. Well, I'll be honest: I never want to watch this movie again. It was a bad movie. But I do not hate this film, he tried to tell a story. Like a drama, this film could work really well. I just think that the filmmakers wrongly determined which path to take when they did this (they should have added more funny parts if they wanted it to be a comedy). With the census it could be a great movie. But as a satire, it did not work in its current form - many scenes did not fit into the context of the plot: for example, the scene of robbery does not make much sense in history. However, it was not the worst independent film ever made - is it in the Top 10 Worst? This is debatable.
