These are films in which psyche of one sort or another tries to damage the reputation (and ultimately completely destroy) of a naive person in order to capture his life. Fatal Attraction, Pacific Heights, The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, One White Woman and the Thousands of Movies Made for Television are some examples of this. But while some, especially Fatal Attraction and Pacific Heights, may offer at least some extremely paranoid, intense characters or several plot twists, the Unlawful Entry reproduces everything in the book. And if it were not for the fame of his stars (Kurt Russell, Ray Lyota and Madeline Stowe), this film would have gone down to mediocrity faster than the mini-series Daniel Steele. <br /> <br /> Russell plays Michael Carr, a continuously naive guy who calls for help from a couple of officers when someone breaks into his house and tries to attack his wife (Madeline Stowe). Unfortunately, he quietly expresses his anger at the fact that he feels so helpless in a situation with a wrong policeman (Ray Liotta), a typical psychopathic villain who has no restrictions on his power. At first empathizing with Carr (probably only pretending to do this), the policeman made friends with the couple. But pretty soon, the cops want to get Carr out of the way, destroying the guys life in almost any way (which is pretty easy when you're a cop, and when you're a cop who installed a guy's security system in his house) to get hold of and, apparently, get hold of him wife This seems less goal-oriented, and itâ€™s more like the policeman just wants to prove his strength. In other words, the wife is more like a trophy than the end. And this story is fully unfolded in the book, you can probably predict every incident before it happens on the screen if you have seen enough of these films. From the "shocking" moment, our main, naive character understands that he was the victim of credit card fraud (a perfect psychopathic villain), until the final turn "he is not dead."
