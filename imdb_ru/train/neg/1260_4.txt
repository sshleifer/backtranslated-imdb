Yes, CHUNKY, this is the nickname with which she marks the romantic leadership of Donna Reed by Tom Drake! So let's clarify this right now. With her first role in “GET-AWAY” (1941) and her last “Dallas” (1984-1985), Miss Reed can NEVER be described as “CHUNKY”. Not such an attractive and slim actress. Whose roles are in M.G.M. rarely justified her talents. <br /> <br /> Ms. Reed supports the cast of competent actors who, unfortunately, have to jump through this supposed comedy with “chatter”. Clearly M.G.M. was beyond their depth, making this type of film. The type best produced in COLUMBIA, PARAMOUNT, RKO and even UNIVERSAL. Neither the “touch” of Ernst Lubich, nor the wit of Preston Sturges could save this film. Quite a traditional romantic comedy, in which there were all signs of pre-war (World War II) efforts. <br /> <br /> If Irving Talberg were still alive, the script would either be rewritten or not visible at all. daylight. It really fits into the "safe zone" of Louis B. Meyer, where there is nothing interesting for a family holiday. A form that could not withstand the post-war challenges of the “De Havilland Decisions”, the loss of their theater networks, television and would have helped reduce MGM Fortunately for Donna Reed, her best days are ahead of her climax in the film “From Here to Eternity” (1953) and her victory at the Oscars in the category “Best Supporting Actress”.
