This is a worthy attempt, but the guy who wrote the screenplay seems to be a little unaware of what exactly makes a zombie movie cool. No, these are not CGI errors and development companies. In fact, I'm not sure that this was a software company - I saw it without subtitles, so I had to guess what they were talking about. In any case, my point was that instead of wasting my time on animating some kind of silly mistake, why not add more zombies and more actions. 2/3 of 20 minutes consist of newsletters, mistakes, guys who scream about something. And even worse (duller), most of the deaths occur behind the scenes. I understand that this is too often found in movies without a budget, but then there were some very impressive effects (well, sort of) that made me wonder why the director (or screenwriter, whatever) decided to focus on how the epidemic started - it is short, in any case, nobody cares.
