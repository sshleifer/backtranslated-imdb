Whatever his name (writer and director), he should be locked in the hope that the garbage will never be repeated. This is one of the worst films of all time. Sometimes films are bad in the sense that they are really good. Not this one. It was so bad that I got angry. Seriously. A drunk 10-year-old could come up with a better script. What a waste. ALL the actors were completely uninterested in the work, the CGI was barely acceptable, the sequence of scenes was completely backward and damaged a little story, as if he simply decided: "I want this to happen, and this should happen." But I do not care how we got there, just shot and pasted. In any case, I go back to my trailer to pick my nose, if someone calls me, I am not here. Shame on you, what is your name. Shame on you.
