If you have not seen ZOMBIE BLOODBATH, you have not seen. A contest like “make your own horror movie in one day” may not lead to the introduction, except for this insult to insult the intelligence of any viewer. Mr. Sheets forgot the story, the plot, the right dialogue, the fact that people need some acting talents of BASIC, and the honored lighting designer obviously forgot to appear. It seems that it is recorded on the coolest of the cameras and copied on even the worst equipment. The effect of makeup consists of black mascara for zombies and yogurt, which is poured on the heads of people to imitate the melting of their skin. This is nothing but a home movie, and very bad. Just have fun watching friends, family members and neighbors who were ready to come on the set. I can not understand why this mockery of the product is indicated in ANY serious newsreel or on the website - I have home movies about wedding parties that are much better and more interesting. A complete waste of time, money and energy. Continuing ZOMBIE BLOODBATH II is just another rubbish.
