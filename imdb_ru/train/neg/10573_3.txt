I was subjected to this film for a class relationship in my school. As I understood, this was nothing exciting and nothing new. Although he is trying to be original, focusing on his teenage father, not his mother, showing the problems that dad must go through. He had an interesting side, but he did not match his originality, because nothing else in this film was original. We have a main character who has an older sister who, like in any other film, has something similar against him, we have a mother who is waiting at home who is expecting too much, and when he gives more, she feels offended and leaves him in the dust then we have a father who is always gone. Then with the girls we have parents who want everything and expect that she will be perfect in everything she does. As for the story, as I said, it was interesting, but the lack of good acting by the whole cast and the absence of any good writing or storytelling. All this has fallen into cliché when a little nerd schoolboy begins to study with a girl, they get together, have sex, and then boom, we have a little child. Maybe it would be better if the script was much better, and if the actress was improved, I seriously got more emotion from the Leather face and his chainsaw than from any actor in this film, and that’s pretty bad seeing the Leather face crappy movies and terribly acting. So far, the only interesting film about teenage pregnancy that I've seen was Juno. So far, the comic side of this serious situation has turned out to be more interesting, but it still gave the same message. As I said, the idea was original, most of these films are focused on teenage mothers, but this one decided not to do this, instead it focuses on the father’s drama, but again originality does not save this film from mediocrity. I really hope that someone decides to either remake this film with the best actor and best screenwriter, or just make another similar film, because this film was wasted.
