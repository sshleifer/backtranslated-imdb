I had to leave the theater. After an hour, all I saw was that people cheated on their wives, threw them like dogs in a rut, and used the f-word like a diabetic, using Equal. <br /> <br /> No thanks. <br /> <br /> This was especially unpleasant, because the film could have done a lot. Any of the characters would be quite interesting if he was given more to do than commit adultery, talk about it and swear to each other. <br /> <br /> Several times it looked like it was going to be a kind of character development, all that happened is another sex scene. The development of the plot for the 1st hour can be summarized as 1) several murders occurred, 2) Winnie sees the scene of the murder 3) Winnie looks gloomily across the Atlantic / East / Hudson River 4) Winnie cheats on his wife and 5) Joe (the most responsive character in the show) kicked out of his parents' house. Moreover, I did not wait to see. <br /> <br /> Photography and the interaction between the characters were great, but for them there was nothing. The flow of sex and vulgarity was hardly worth waiting for another hour for something to happen. <br /> <br /> Sorry Spike. Take a few lessons from Notting Hill or Shawshank Escape. Any one of them is better off exploring social and interpersonal relationships.
