The combination of Priyadarshan / Paresh Rawal was golden with such as HERA PHERI and HUNGAMA, so I entered the movie (in an Indian multiplex) with high hopes, especially after slippery promotions. Unfortunately, like HULCHUL before, this film was a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> As others have commented, the premise of the film, which from the very beginning was outdated, is simply stretched and developed without any development. or additional layering. After a while, you just want the film to end so you can go home (if I watched it at home, it would be much easier to reduce my losses). Akshay Kumar's performance is average at best, and John Abraham should not try to play comedy again. The comedic aspects of the film were generally quite weekly. I remember only giggling, like twice the whole movie. Definitely, there was not a single laugh in the stomach, which absorbed me in HERA PHERI or even to a lesser extent in AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA. Pares Raval had some of his expected classic moments, but overall, since his role and character did not have much room for growth, he had little influence in this film. <br /> <br /> Neha On Dhupiya, which only appears in the film, was fun to watch while she was on the screen. And some songs are fun. Especially the opening and closing songs of ADA and KISS ME BABY respectively. Otherwise, you better just pass on this movie.
