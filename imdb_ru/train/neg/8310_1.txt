Another extensive conspiracy film in which they are trying to accuse the US government and the Armed Forces (especially the army) of every catastrophe after the Great Flood. Anyone who has ever served as a soldier in the US can see how fake this film is. Uniforms, equipment, sets and manners - everything is wrong. (And, of course, all senior officers are either corrupt criminals, or complete idiots.) Impudent propaganda without attempts at objectivity. Over the past few years, most of the presented theories have been refuted. Uses all the clich√©s, rumors and urban legends from the Persian Gulf - they are all presented as the Gospel. (The truth is that no one knows for sure why some GW veterinarians are sick, while others are healthy as horses.) PS This is not new. War is NOT fun, and I know that veterinarians from World War II, Korea and Vietnam also suffered from quite serious diseases. (And the government must take care of all of them.) Sensational films like this will not solve the problem!
