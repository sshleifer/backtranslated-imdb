I had the biggest enthusiasm for previewing this movie. After all, this is one of the oldest and most complex stories known to humanity, and it was one of the first epic tales I read in childhood (even before Tolkien). I have to say it was a huge disappointment. They completely turned the plot into a joke and turned it into one long soap opera. The elements that were true to the plot were scattered in such an indiscriminate manner that the audience laughed many times over a silly script that simply spoke out in words in this battle of all battles. It was a huge disappointment to see such a complex character as Achilles (who has a strange combination of almost similar to the Matrix of forces, absolute ruthlessness and male lovers in the original poem), turning to "Fabio on the beach" in the image of Pitt (who with a good script and great efforts could would turn this into the most complex and original warrior figure ever created by Hollywood). The actors were actually decent, trying to make the best of the funny script. In fact, it was a waste of talent (Peter O'Toole stole the show, and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were pathetic). Compare this with LOTR or Gladiator, and he does not even hold a candle for them. Ladies do not have enough points, but not enough battle scenes for the film, which tells about one long battle and siege. I would not recommend someone to pay to see this story through the mud, like one of the characters (at least they understood this part correctly).
