This film (along with Wrynn) is a small gem among the redrawing photos that were still shot for horror films on 8FTDF "HorrorFest". And yes, this is really weak praise. Because there is nothing worse in the film than future authors who think that the atmosphere replaces a consistent plot. <br /> <br /> And that's all you get with The Abandoned. This is a film that was made almost entirely in the directors head Of course, it would be nice if he transferred it to the film, but it happened instead. This is a very cute movie with a few real scares, but the last one is exclusively for lattes, siphoning cinema crowds.
