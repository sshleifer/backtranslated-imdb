Should every good story be improved with added banal Broadway music? Obviously, those who cannot invent their own plots think that classical literature is only for robbery. I confess that Oliver Twist and similar stories are not my favorites, because, of course, it’s true that Dickens often wrote things that leave you depressed, and this was a great example of exactly that ... So, of course, take this serious story and add nauseous music and put it in place with each character from jumping orphans to meat grinders and suddenly it uplifting? Argh. Bring me a basin. <br /> <br /> Four stars in my rating come from casting, which I can compare with the rating of my beautiful lady. Each of these films had a cast that the gaming version could be proud of, but then they had to go and get them to sing (see Complaint above). Unlike “My Fair Lady”, those who sing here can really do it, and they, fortunately, spared us the singing voice of Oliver Reed (sorry, if I am mistaken, it was a long time ago). <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint that I’m told. Why embarrass everyone except the truly shameless, putting stupid songs in a completely good story? Rarely was this done with good effect. Generally it destroys the story. It was with that. Yuri still does not know whether to save this story, but considering all this, it is impossible to say.
