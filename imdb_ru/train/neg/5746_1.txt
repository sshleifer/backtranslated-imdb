About the worst movie in distribution right now! I love zombie movies and I saw it in the used stand, so I thought, why not? Oh my god, shame zombies and fans of the genre! The one who made this film must remove his video camera and go to the film school! There are so many blood hounds who have invested time and effort into their films, and they have something that is not worthy of this film. I know what it takes to make films, and I’m sure that there was a lot of money and time spent creating the meat market, but not one of that money and time was spent doing it well. You need actors, a script, a real camera, to invest in some books about how to make independent films. I don’t know how your DVD came out, but whoever did it, he’s either a really good friend, or hit his head against a wall. In bloody films, this quality, not quantity, is a weak effect! I was so angry that it was actually in the shops, and I could not get my money back. Please, if you have seen this movie, write here and put an end to the sloka. I know that I am very sharp, I only had 10 lines, so I'm trying to get to the bottom.
