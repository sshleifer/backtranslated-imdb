Perhaps television will sometime become as cruel. Maybe the “Big Brother” was just the first step towards Stephen? Richard Bachmann King described the end point. But enough about that. If I spend too many words talking about the serious topic of this film, I do exactly what the producers hoped for when choosing this material. The same with "6th day". No matter how primitive the film is, it provokes a discussion on its topic, which serves as an advertisement to producers. Let's NOT be passionate about it. The social criticism proposed in this story is only an alibi, which allows you to create a speculative, brutal film, more for the sale of the video than for the movie. <br /> <br /> I did not read the book. I do not dare to criticize Stephen King without reading it, but when I saw the film, I thought that they could not make such a terrible film from a good book: in a typical 80s. In the 80s set of music and some minor actors, Arnold Schwarzenegger turns out to be a policeman fleeing the killers on a violent television show. Audience welcomes. <br /> <br /> Together with Predator, this is by far the most stupid Schwarzenegger film. 2 stars out of 10.
