One of the worst movies I've ever seen. How to determine the “worst?” I would prefer that both eyeballs be pulled out and then be forced to dance on them than ever to look at this pathetic dirt again. Anyway, One-Hit Wonder Zwick runs a movie that simultaneously insults Elvis fans, saleswomen Mary Kay, Las Vegas, gays, FBI agents and the rest of humanity with any intelligence with a crappy, sloppy farce so compelled that it deserves to leave him. How Elvis Presley Enterprise could authorize the use of rights to Elvis songs in a film with a central premise that sounds like: “Elvis Presley's only good imitator is a dead man” is outside of me. The worst part of this mess — and this requires some work — is a distorted scenario: in 1958, the words and songs of Elvis are quoted, which he will speak / perform in the 1970s! Worst special effect? This Oscar went to a jerk who decided that the grave of Elvis, potentially the most photographed / recognizable grave in the world, resembles a pyramid with a gold plate pasted on top and is somewhere in the middle of the park. Potentially, the biggest audience of this film will be Elvis fans. However, the rampant stupidity (Nixon gave Elvis the DEA badge, not the FBI credentials ... and I could go on and on) actually undermines IT’s traditional wisdom. Ugh. I used the word "wisdom" to describe this stupid film. This is really a horrible, horrible movie.
