Nicholas Walker - Paul, the local city of Reverand, who is married to Martha (Ally Chidy), but also an ordinary womanizer and decides to fake his own death in order to escape with his current love Veronica (Dara Tomanovich) However, he gets an attack of amnesia (hence the name of the film). Sally Kirkland is also on hand, like a crazy old coot who longs for a good reverand in shades such as "Misfortune." It's sad to see that a pretty good cast is wasted like this. Last but not least, John Savage is in a terribly forgettable role as a low-quality private detective. In the film, announced as "black comedy", you need to bring BOTH elements in the specified film. While it does bring the first to the peaks, unfortunately, it does not contain any of the latter. In addition, you can not emphasize with any of the characters and, therefore, absolutely not interested in them. From a technical point of view, this is not a bad film, but simply extremely forgettable. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dara Tomanovich becomes topless; Sally Kirkland also shows a bit of skin. <br /> <br /> My rating is: C- <br /> <br /> Where I saw her: Showtime Showcase
