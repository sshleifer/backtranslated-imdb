Even Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd could not save this film from laying eggs the size of an emu. Based on the Phil Silvers classic series, he bombed because: A) it was updated before the 1990s, and B) the simple premise of the series was turned into a confusing, weak and silly script. <br /> <br /> In the original series, the talented actor was used to portray attractive characters playing simple but funny jokes. To turn this premise into a film of the 1990s, problems arose, and it shows. No one could pay me enough to sit through this bitch a second time.
