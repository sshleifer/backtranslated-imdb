This film sounded like a good premise: 9 people faced their fears of winning a million dollars. Unfortunately, this was not a good movie. There are several scenes that are too long and really meaningless, like a dance scene. Several scenes are just an excuse to direct the camera to female parts of the body. The game is bad, but some lines are funny with their horror. What is really strange is that, towards the end of the film, it turns into a 5-minute western film, and at the end several turns were meaningless with the rest of the film. It seemed that the director simply added the material, because he thought it would look cool, while conveniently ignoring the plot of the film until that moment. It just didn't make much sense. The only creepy thing was that older people were dancing along the corridor, but it didnâ€™t even come close enough to make up for this whole mess.
