Absolutely putrid film-slasher has more than one redemptive quality. He has camp counselor Angela (Pamela Anderson, she’s like a murderer; her jokes, when she’s wasting people, doesn’t even amuse her) on the warp, who kill adolescents who at least disobey or resist her prayers for good behavior. We're carrying out a whole series of boring, ordinary murders, such as cutting one child’s throat looking for Freddie’s clawed glove, a child who gets a chainsaw, one girl who is drilled, one that is shoved into a crapper (filled with leeches), one who is fried and so on. <br /> <br /> He has no original idea and it’s just a waste of time. This is if you do not want to see tits Valerie Hartman (who plays the allied whore). Most of the violence happens off-camera, so even this will not satisfy.
