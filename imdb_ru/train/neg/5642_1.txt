This title is more like filming than a movie that was supposed to be released for public viewing. For Defoe and his wife, it must have been fun working together in the film for the first time, without taking into account that people could really watch it. I felt that it was spent 90 minutes, since I was looking forward to the development of the plot or even the beginning. <br /> <br /> Try to fit this film into the genre, and you will not succeed, because there is no beginning, middle or ending in it. I have seen “feature films” before, and this doesn’t even mean being clever, abstract or original, it seems to me that this is completely meaningless. <br /> <br /> I think it speaks for itself when the only people who rated this film 10 were under 18 years old. There is no doubt in the constant meaningless erotic scenes that the film insisted on us. This is if you can call it erotic. It certainly had no taste.
