This film is deeply idiotic. A man wants to avenge a crime, but when he avenged, they always send a video camera at him. What kind of person with a brain cell in his head would sit there and do it for so long in front of a video camera? <br /> <br /> Just the fact that this scenario could never happen, except in cases where someone can not get dressed. destroyed it for me - but it became more stupid !!! <br /> <br /> I think that the writers have some serious habits that prepare their brain cells and make them miss holes in the plot. to end. <br /> <br /> SUBJECT: a man seeks revenge for the death of loved ones, but in the middle of the plot something goes wrong, and the unexpected unfolds. <br /> <br /> Unless these people writing this story were stupid enough to write completely unrealistic plot twists that could never happen this way. I say to writers: ask for help to a serious mental problem.
