The idea of ​​the story is excellent. Unfortunately, the performance fails him. <br /> <br /> First, the film lacks speed. It should be an exciting ride, but it is slow and more than boring. <br /> <br /> I think the problem is mainly in the script and editing. There are not enough obstacles and turns to increase tension, and there are scenes that are not very effectively promoting history. <br /> <br /> Producers should have seen this in the script and insisted on the main rewrite. Unfortunately, when the producer is also a screenwriter and director, this obviously will not happen. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting seems flat, and it depends on the director - all the actors have. I was quite competent in other projects. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because with the best writing, editing and directing it could be a really good thriller.
