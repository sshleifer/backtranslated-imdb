They show it in some kind of network. This is good shit. Although itâ€™s not as bad as the B-movies that they show on the science fiction network on Saturdays, but still quite a lot of crap. Acting is bearable. The plot and writing is rather inconsistent with the standards, and the pace is too slow. Each minute of the film resembles that part of the film where they turn into things in front of the captions, and not the peak of the film, the denouement. In addition, large parts of the cast look old for the age at which they play. All this is predictable, boring and not worth watching. Save your time. Even watch it for free is not worth it.
