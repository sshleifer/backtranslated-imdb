I agree with most, if not all, of the previous commentator Tom (bighouseaz@yahoo.com). The Zatoichi series is an excellent study of character combined with a great sword fight and excitement. <br /> <br /> I have seen Zatoichi 1-13,15,16; I believe that 14 was not released in Zone 1 (USA). The Rogue Disillusionment. The storyline was complex and seemed to be a jumble of many previous Zatoichi plot lines. At some point I wondered if I was watching a remake of the previous Zatoichi movie. <br /> <br /> This film is disappointing because it starts to depend on the effects (head twisting, severed limbs, blood) and less about the nobility of Zatoichi's character. All previous films were successful, based on the storyline and action, and won a large number of fans, without resorting to effects. <br /> <br /> I just hope that the remaining Zatoichi films DO NOT follow the same trend. This is the first Zatoichi film from his studio. I highly recommend all previous Zatoichi films - and recommend them.
