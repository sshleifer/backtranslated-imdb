"Feast of All Saints?" Where...? When ... <br /> <br /> Was the storyline and theme of All Saints Holiday edited? <br /> <br /> What a waste of a great title! In this story there has never been anything that would be associated with the "Feast of All Saints." There is nothing in the story about the "Day of All Souls" that this term refers to. Why use this heading if you never intend to include any storyline or theme about “Day of All Souls” or “Feast of All Saints”? <br /> <br /> Incredibly bad script and amateur letter <br /> <br /> How did they attract such talent to this clanker? Scripture is so amateurish - characters who have known each other all their lives go to great long speeches about the history of their lives for the public. Not at all like people talking to each other. <br /> <br /> What was the director thinking about? <br /> <br /> Directing is also bad! The forced and overly deliberate style feels like amateurish. In one of the scenes, the character shouts “Get your hands off me” and no one touches him! However, the worst directional scene is the incredibly exciting battle scene at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> Excessive bloodshed in a very fake, stupid battle scene <br /> <br /> In the most fake battle scene there are so many dead. Looks like a live parody on Saturday night! You can see the extras waiting for their signals to pass through the camera. Everyone plays their own death scene like 4th grade boys - exaggerating every little sigh and twitch. The blood on the victims of the battle is so excessive and careless that it seems that someone used a ketchup dispenser and just splashed red lines on the costumes. <br /> <br /> This whole battle scene looks like a parody of a really cheesy war film. You almost expect someone like Will Ferrell and Mike Myers to ride a horse and bring some zest. <br /> <br /> Who in real life will behave this way ?! <br /> <br /> The funniest of essays, directing and casting is actually the focus of the scene: <br /> <br /> A little girl stands under the body of her hanged father - who is terribly disfigured and literally dripping blood forms his gaping wounds. Even a complete idiot would know that he is dead! Nevertheless, she - very monotonously - repeats over and over again "Daddy, Daddy ...", looking at someone offscreen. She said it with the same plausibility and passion as might have been expected from a child who is not an actor who had been following the line for the cameras all day. <br /> <br /> Even if the poor child had some acting skills, the scene is absolutely incredible. The little girl WASN'T even in the middle of the battlefield after several hours of slaughter — surrounded by hundreds of dead bodies while she stands there quietly !! Natural instincts would make the child scream and get scared, running away from the carnage! <br /> <br /> We have to be horrified or laugh ...?! <br /> <br /> One particularly stupid detail that gives the scene a satirical tone is the father hanging from a huge hook through his mouth and cheek. He looks like a fish on a hook! Unintentionally funny details make the whole scene fake and stupid. <br /> <br /> In Fantasy La-Land mothers and daughters of the same age! <br /> <br /> Another fun detail: you see the main character — the mother of the little girl — at the end of the scene and in the next scene, which takes place over 20 years later, she looks that way too! She is still young and beautiful, and she is as old as her daughter! <br /> <br /> I almost turned off the film, because the direction and the script were just awful, but I tried to stick them out, because I wanted to see the situation in Louisiana, and I like all the actors. I don't know what these wonderful actors thought when they took these roles! <br /> <br /> Who was the target audience? <br /> <br /> The excessive amount of blood and the brutal violence in the opening scene is strangely out of place with the tone of the story of the soap opera that follows. It is also a strange way to start a film that, for the rest of the time, seems intended for women reading romantic novels. A strange discrepancy in tone!
