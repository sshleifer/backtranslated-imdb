Despite the great cast, this is an unremarkable film, especially from an aviation point of view. This may be somewhat better than the blatant von Richthofen and Brown, but not by much. Blue Max has remained the best of a small market in the last 35 years, while Darling Lilli is fun if not taken seriously. It is interesting to reflect on what ILM can do with Zeppelins and Gothas in a new high-quality aviation film from the First World War.
