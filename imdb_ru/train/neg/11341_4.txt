In a sense, this is a disaster, Fellini works throughout his life. The border between the absurd masterpiece and the garbage of free associations is very small, and which category the film ultimately fits to often depends only on personal feelings. Nevertheless, “Casanova” left me in a cold admiration with their sets and a little more, which cannot be more adequately summarized by Bukovsky: <br /> <br /> “Casanova also died, just an old guy with a big dick and a long tongue and no courage. to say that he lived well is true; to say that I could spit on his grave, not feeling, is also true. ladies usually look for the biggest fool they can find, which is why the human race stands where it is today: we have created intelligent and persistent Kazanas, all empty inside, like Easter bunnies that we bring up on our poor children. "<br /> <br /> As far as I understand, this is precisely the position Fellini takes with regard to her subject, taken for granted, with great sympathy, but nonetheless with disgust. <br /> <br /> The environment of Casanova consists of decomposition and incestuous behavior, topics that Fellini considers sharper in “Satyricon.” The plot sequence is characterized by soft porn, but without consistency, and Donald Sutherland is ugly and slimy to such an extent that it distracts. <br /> <br /> However, it may seem that Casanova looks silly. And I urge anyone to formulate this point without being obvious; Fellini could not. More than ever, he looks like a dirty old man here - surely a maestro, but one whose impulses satisfy themselves more than anyone else. I find it hard to imagine viewers who like this movie. It was a story that should not be told.
