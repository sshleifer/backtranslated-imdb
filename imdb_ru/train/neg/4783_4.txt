This is another bad movie that you should probably avoid watching. The plot may be much "thicker" than it really is, and it would be better to make it in the form of a blockbuster-style film. <br /> <br /> The actions leave much to be desired, although you cannot understand that this is the case. <br /> <br /> This is one of those that you watch on TV late at night, perhaps in the US, simply because you can not fall asleep. Look if you want, but don't expect too much from him.
