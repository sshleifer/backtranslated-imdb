This is a western fighter. James Start leads a star cast in the beautiful northwest, which is filmed in splendor. The scenery and costumes are gorgeous. There is action and adventure. Stewart plays a rich herder who faces dishonest government in the old Northwest. <br /> <br /> The main flaw is the stereotypical cynic Hollywood has always turned into a hero. Even when this film was shot, the cynic was a stereotypical hero, and the one that portrays Stewart really has few saving graces. He is kind to his two partners, and this gives him an extra dimension of trust and sympathy. <br /> <br /> However, he is so bully to everyone else that it is difficult to really take care of him or accept him. It is very similar to the one-dimensional spaghetti of Western characters (not so bad). <br /> <br /> However, minor characters are quite pleasing. Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, Harry Morgan and others make this worthy of attention.
