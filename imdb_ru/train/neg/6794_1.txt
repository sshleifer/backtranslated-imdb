Friday the 13th step! Officially, there is a movie worse than your hated show. I won this film at a college competition, and it was a waste of money, even if it was free. Jack Jones is shot as a truly terrible singer who is trying to find killers or something like that. At least on Friday, the thirteenth, I was never bored. I would rather snatch my nails than see it again.
