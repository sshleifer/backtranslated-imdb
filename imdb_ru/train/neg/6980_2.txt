Historically accurate? Hmm ... Maybe ... if you mow, and the light falls on the object just like that. But the basic accuracy does not compensate for the grim, heterogeneous and inconsistent plot, the set of cardboard dialogues and the unsatisfactory conclusion. The main characters are simply characteristics; embarrassing stereotypes that range from “mysterious and noble” Native American Indians to “stuffy but sadistic” British officers. A pitiful and unworthy performance of an exciting period in American history. I want my money back.
