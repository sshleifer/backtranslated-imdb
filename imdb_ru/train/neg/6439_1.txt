Honestly, it easily enters the top 5 worst films I have ever seen. Partly because it takes you so seriously, unlike ordinary frivolous trash, these films want you to be emotionally involved, feel the characters and take care of the intended plot. None of this even comes close. <br /> <br /> **** SPILERS FOR YOUNG ****** <br /> <br /> There are three main reasons why this film is so terrible: 1.) Inconsistent and completely meaningless plot. 2.) Annoying "MTV" filming style. 3.) Idiotic characters and holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> Let me clarify. <br /> <br /> 1.) Apparently, when they made these films, they could not decide whether to make a film about church conspiracies, stigmata or possession. So guess what? They combined them! The ateist is obsessed with a dead man who then forces her to expose stigmata to expose the church conspiracy. How an ordinary person is able to overcome death and take possession of another person through his rosary is never explained or even discussed. Now, instead of just saying what he wants to say, he gives her stigmata. WHAT FOR? Why not just spit it out? Instead, we see scenes of screaming things with sharp voices, cutting out mysterious messages on cars and writing messages on the walls. Apparently, this priest was also a cruel guy, because the possessed young lady also parries on one of the characters, speaking in the same harsh, harsh, “obsessed” voice that we all have heard countless times. Does it also begin to bind my second complaint, because whenever a young lady gets stigmata, she also defies the laws of gravity, floating in the air and throwing everything and everyone around her as if they were due to an earthquake? Why is this happening? Who knows!?! I guess the director thought it looked "cool." <br /> <br /> 2.) This film contains dozens of shots, in a slow motion, of course, birds appearing from nowhere and flying away, and the most annoying thing is that water is dripping. In the apartment of this woman is constantly dripping water! CONSTANTLY! Logically, the place is likely to fall apart with so many holes. To sum up this complaint, towards the end, and for no reason at all, the camera takes pictures of dripping water, in slow motion, in the opposite direction !! WHAT FOR!?! I have no idea! It has nothing to do with anything, and once again, I bet it's because the director thought it looked “cool.” <br /> <br /> 3.) One of the main characters says that he became a priest in order to explain the holes in science. It does not make sense to me. I would have thought that going to church would be enough, but no, he had to go through the whole rigamarol in order to become a priest. I just don't buy it. Secondly, there are many holes in the plot, some of which I will describe below. For a start, when she first gets stigmata, the scene ends up being unconscious and bleeding. Then she is in the hospital. Who called the ambulance? The other is closer to the end, when the previously mentioned character of the “scientific priest” talks to the spirit that owns the girl. He says: “Take me as your messenger!” Not a word for word quote, but you understood the idea. His answer? "You have no faith, only doubts!" So, because of this, he has aestheticism! The theist has no faith, much less than any scientific priest! And yet, there is the fact that the object of the plot of this film is the Lost Gospel (I think St. Thomas) can be bought at local bookstores. Characters are ready to kill to suppress this document, but you can go to the bookstore and buy it. Maybe this should have happened in an alternative story, where it is not widely known, but the film never tries to tell us, or even hint that this is an alternative event of the disclosure of this document. <br /> <In conclusion, this film is terrible to an impressive degree. This is my sworn enemy who I feel the need to insult at every opportunity. I hate this. Final grade: F
