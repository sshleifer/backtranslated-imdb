Now for the truth, its very very weak storyline — for the Walt Disney film — is complete nonsense. When Robinson appeared, films were everywhere, I was shocked how poor he was. This is how "Alice in Wonderland" went wrong! It feels like they lacked the ideas that some mixed up with crazy rubbish to try and get away with - and they don’t. After that, I sat there, wanting to end. My younger brother lost interest halfway and was confused by this story. The characters are weak, and after the appearance of the Robinsons you don’t care about the ending, you just want the movie to end. This is a film to forget and quickly forget. If you have free time, do not waste it on it.
