So I want to rent a DVD and come across this movie called “The End of the Game”. The film stars James Woods and Cuba Gooding, as well as a brief overview of the political thriller. Then worth a look. Or so I thought. <br /> <br /> Boy, was I wrong? <br /> <br /> The end of the game is the funniest story I've ever had to endure. Now, being something of a nonsense, I cannot tear it apart, as I would like, without “destroying” it for those who have not yet experienced this monster. But questions like “Why did he / she / they do it?” And “Where did they get the resources to do it?” Too much, after the unintentionally funny conclusion of the film. <br /> <br /> As for acting, do you know in those films where you can almost feel that the actor realized that he had made a terrible mistake by signing up for a movie, and then it shows in their performance? This is one of those. Accompany this with a ridiculous scenario and a seriously erroneous, annoying indication, and you have a recipe for cinematic poison. <br /> <br /> Of course, it didn’t get to the cinema, and for the same reason you shouldn’t let it in your living room; it's horrible
