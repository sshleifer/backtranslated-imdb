Basically, the dentist's husband-wife team and their 3 daughters deal with treason. The package is interesting, the game is good, and the music, although sometimes abrupt and without direction, is quite steep. <br /> <br /> The problem is in the plot. The husband's dentist throws his wife backstage at the opera before the show (she plays a minor role), and then returns to give her something, but sees her with another man. The rest of the film talks about his excitement about this episode, his visual hallucinations and the macho alter-ego (Denis Leary, his former patient) and his fear of confronting his wife so that he would not have to “do something about it”. “I’m not going to tell you about the ending, but let me say that the film doesn’t go anywhere, and the final looks like a whimper. There is no character motivation: why does it change him? He’s a dentist, he looks decent, a good father. Does she do it? Don't expect any answers to this question. Why does he want to save the marriage despite all this? Who knows. What goal does vomiting all children serve? Where does this film go? Good performances by Campbell Scott and Hope Davis (and Denis Leary in as a comic relief) completely disappear due to and this nonsense, who doesn't know if she wants to be an American beauty or a family film. The root canal is more interesting. Avoid it.
