When I was a teenager, when I first saw this film, I thought it was one of the best films ever made. Of course, the reason for this is Bo Derek and her various states of undressing in this film. However, now that I’m older, I can honestly say that this film is terrible. Keep in mind, Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful, and she and her husband, director John Derek, will make sure that you see her a lot. But when you remove this aspect from the film, it becomes one big boring journey. And Tarzan, well, he is as muscular as you think he should be, but when he first sees Jane (this is Bo, of course), he doesn’t know what to think. And this is despite the fact that Bo is wearing a wet transparent shirt, which is visible on her breasts. Tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet to have this problem. If you are looking for a movie to drool over a beautiful naked body, then this can fill the ticket. If you are looking for a thoughtful, interesting and useful film, go to another place ... almost anywhere else in it!
