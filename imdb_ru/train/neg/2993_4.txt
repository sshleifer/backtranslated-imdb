I thought Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 was a pretty good horror movie. When the body of a terrorist infected with a stolen chemical was discovered by the US military, the corpse was then cremated, releasing the virus into the atmosphere over a small island. Soon, the infected locals turn into zombie thirsty for flesh, and a group of soldiers on vacation must team up with a group of tourists and sit in an abandoned hotel, trying to fight off the aggressive living dead. I did not find this film as good as the original Zombie Eaters film. But it was a good horror movie with a good fighter. I did not think it was one of the best in the series. 4/10
