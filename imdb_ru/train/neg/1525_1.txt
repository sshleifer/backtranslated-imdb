I watched this during the weekend, because there was nothing else, it would be more interesting to bite off the legs and, perhaps, less painful. I urge everyone to watch this, to see how horrible a movie can be, of course, it was deliberate. I shrank from every vain attempt at humor, carried out in such a childish, unrehearsed, poorly executed way, that it was incredible. This is a movie that makes Spiceworld look like Goodfellas, I think I'm exaggerating? Well, give it airtime and think again. Scary, terrible. If this is not a joke, then the director and anyone responsible for this should be removed and immediately removed after they are forced to watch this movie again.
