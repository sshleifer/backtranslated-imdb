Well, we all love the dukes of daisies, but what happened to this composition? Let's get started, Jessica Simpson as Daisy, thereâ€™s not a single country in this girl, and Daisy was indifferent! Uncle Jesse was probably the closest to remind the original. No offense to Bert, but I never noticed that Boss Hog was so tall. That was part of the Boss Hogh humor was its size. They even tried someone like Danny DeVito?!? Well, now take it, they shot Jessica Simpson. Has anyone looked at her husband? He compares Luke Herzog with a tee !!!!!! Cleary, these producers did not look at the appearance of the old actors. The screen never attended the dukes !! This made the film off from the start. I give it HUGE thumbs down.
