The Succubus, an edited version of the Necronomicon Geträumte Sünden, is a struggle to sit down, even for a scant 76 minutes; more of this terribly boring and pretentious European horror, and I may have fallen into a coma. <br /> <br /> Jess Franco once again delivers a really awful piece of trash from the 60s, which seems to have been made by actors and the crew from class A class hallucinogenics, since not one second of this mess made any sense. Apparently, this is one of his best 180+ films ?? It is hard to believe that there is a worst effort. <br /> <br /> Incomprehensible plot tells about Franco's usual topics about sex, violence and lesbianism and adds a bit of S & M for good measure, and yet he still copes. stay boring tedious. <br /> <br /> I can leave this for quite a while before entering the world of sly Euro-horror again ?? life is too short to look for a hold like this.
