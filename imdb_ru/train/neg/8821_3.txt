Why oh why don't they study? If you have a good, juicy trick of exploitation, use it! Do not go idle, trying to think deeper and deeper; you just look stupid. <br /> <br /> “Christmas Evil” is a story about Harry Stadling, who saw too much how his mother kissed Santa Claus (a father dressed as ...) when he was a child. So, of course, Harry becomes obsessed with Christmas, and finally, when his disappointment becomes too great, he breaks out, dresses like Santa, and wanders around the city, handing out toys to small good children and viciously killing anyone he considers naughty. <br /> <br /> Simple enough and not bad for a start. (In the end, how many other horror movies on holidays are using the same joke?) Unfortunately, this film wants to be more “Santa, a portrait of a serial killer” than “Silent night, deadly night”. Two-thirds of the film is spent on documenting the slow but inevitable breakdown of Harry, when I would be ready to buy a room by the time the first titles began. You know that a bad movie got into trouble when you make the killer just end it. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Harry’s descent into madness could be convincing in the hands of a competent director, but alas, we have a boyfriend named Lewis Jackson. Apparently, this is his only film, and it shows. The action quickly moves from scene to scene, without setting shots or clear views of the actors to tell us where we are and who we see. <br /> <br /> Even after the movie begins to roll, we still felt Harry’s piles of self-pity, insecurity, and neurotic behavior. “Christmas evil” is more depressing than frightening.
