One of the real clinkers of Boris Karloff. In fact, the dying Karloff (looks about 120 years older than him) is a scientist who needs money to complete his experiments before he dies. After moving from Morocco, where his funding was transferred to someone else, he goes to the south of France, where he works as a doctor, trying to raise enough money to prove his theory. Desperate for money, he makes a deal with the rich young wife of a cotton baron who dies. She will finance him if he helps her poison her husband so that she can take his money and continue with the gigolo (who, I think, is married). If you think that I understood it after watching the movie, you are mistaken, I had to read what other people published in order to find out what happened. What for? because in this film I lost two minutes. I had no idea what was going on with his numerous characters and many converging plot lines. Little is written, and much is not said until the end, by that time I really didnâ€™t care. This is a boring mess of interest exclusively for the work of Karloff, which is rather strange at times. Honestly, this is the only time I saw him go out into the quaint territory of Bela Lugosi. This is not every scene, but several, and it makes me wonder how much they hang out.
