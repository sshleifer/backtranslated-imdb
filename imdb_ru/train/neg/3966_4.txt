Of course, I am not a connoisseur of horror, which is my partner, but a well thought out, clever click is worth the time. In short, my quibbles: <br /> <br /> - The dialogue is often weak and sometimes unbelievable, coming from this character. <br /> <br /> - Unpersuasive game. <br /> <br /> - The storyline never caught fire. <br /> <br /> The authors pulled out passages from half a dozen mainstream films, threw them into a teapot, cooked on slow fire enough and tried to feed us, poor things, as a result of the mess. /> <br /> Long and short, though not exactly terrible, it was definitely not worth absorbing one of my NetFlix rentals.
