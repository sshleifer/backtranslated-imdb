Christmas story - is a classic holiday and my favorite movie. Naturally, I was delighted when this film was released in 1994. I saw him on the opening day and was ready to have fun. I Gone, Rebel, Averted. In this mess, oddly enough, there is no expectation that the truth will sound in the Christmas story It is best to buy a Red Ryder BB Gun than a Chinese top. And this is not funny at all. Charles Grodin is good, but Buck stops there. The result: 1 star. Don't even worry.
