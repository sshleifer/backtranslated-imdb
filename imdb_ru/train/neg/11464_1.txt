Although I do not claim to be an expert in marine life, I must say that anyone with minimal intelligence cannot agree with this concept of a whale (and not even of a mother!) Who has an idea of ​​revenge, because witnessed how his dead friend made a forced abortion by people! I mean really! This is basically the whole plot. Richard Harris must have been very hard for the roles to take on this garbage. This is such a film that is so bad that if you pay 50 cents to watch it, you will want to get your money back.
