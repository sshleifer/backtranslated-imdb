I found that Horrorvision is almost invisible. It took only 70 minutes, but I pressed the fast forward button again and again. The acting was from school "if I scream and say that I am very intense." And at best, this story was a scenario that has not yet been disclosed. <br /> <br /> Although I never go to Full Moon for a great movie, I have never seen them produce as bad a piece of garbage as this.
