When Richie first appeared on the scene, his films were called funny, witty, well-made and original. If one can compare the hype he aroused with his first two attempts, and the almost universal hatred caused by his last two walks, it should be taken into account - was Ritchie discovered? Is he really so talented? Does he really have original ideas? Or is he just a pretentious and selfish director who really wants Fincher, Tarantino and Leone to be combined into one huge and unorganized heap? After watching Revolver, you could apologize for the fact that everything went wrong? What happened to his great sense of humor? Where did he get all these mixed and convoluted ideas? The revolver tries to be clever, philosophical and concise, he tries to be an intellectual psychoanalysis, he tries to be an intricate and complicated thriller. Richie really makes great efforts to achieve all of these many goals and puts large pieces of the script into existential reflections and numerous plot twists. However, in the end, all this serves to create a highly fragmented, unstructured and ultimately unfriendly film for viewers. His plagiarism is so sinful and frank that, although Richie, at least, is trying to make his own spin, he should be punished for even trying to pass it off for his own work. So in the end, the audience will get a terrible script, intertwined with many pretentious models and clumsy subjects. <br /> <br /> The revolver is ultimately a non-original and soft film that stole countless themes from such masterpieces as Fight Club, Ordinary Suspects and Pulp Fiction. He aims high, but inevitably shoots at empty spots. <br /> <br /> The revolver deserves to be shot at. This is a really bad film disguised as a copycat masterpiece from the copywriter author. However, he fails on his farcical face and simply fails in everything he wants to be and achieve.
