In the UK there is a DVD published in 2002 with the code HRGD002, there is no ASIN on the disc, VFC 19796, there is no IFPI code on the inner rim. <br /> <br /> Probably a live program from VHS. <br /> <br /> It makes no sense to comment on films for adults. But this one contains a minimal plot, and the characters are believable. He was shown in the United States in ordinary cinemas. <br /> <br /> I saw him in Pensavania back in 1975. <br /> <br /> As such, it deserves a place in the encyclopedia of films, the DVD has no special features and subtitles, and probably was made using VHS tape as a source
