Please make me forget. You are welcome. You are welcome. This is the worst movie I've ever had the misfortune to watch. I consider the film an insult to my brain, as well as to my back side, which both suffered from the fact that I sat and watched this film. I have yet to see how much damage this has done to my vision and my ability to make sentences. What a load of trash! And don't start me about acting ... Someone please help me forget !! "Strange science" - come back !! Everything is forgiven ... <br /> <br /> I am "proud" to give this film the first one here on IMDb ... And I voted for hundreds of films ... Many of them since ** But this is so bad I can't even believe it. Someone actually came up with the idea and thought it worth becoming a film? Did someone actually read the script and decide to produce the film? Did someone read the script and audition? Someone saw the film and decided * not * to put it on the shelf to collect dust for eternity? * These are * questions that I want to get answers to. Not a philosophical question about this tree in the forest, well, you know ...
