“Fox and Child” is a new film by French director Luc Jacquet, who brought us the Oscar-winning documentary film “March of the Penguins”. She focuses on a young girl (wonderfully played by Bertil Noel-Bruno) and her blooming friendship with a fox. <br /> <br /> There are some really fascinating moments here; badgers roam, trot chases a fox through a snowy forest; One scene, in particular, when a fox is tormented by a pack of wolves, is quite tense and sometimes even frightening. However, they are simply not enough. <br /> <br /> Beautifully shot; the cinema is awesome. Bubble film look wonderful. This is undoubtedly a very lush production. <br /> <br /> The English version is narrated by Kate Winslet, but the little thing that the dialogue there was already very poorly duplicated. The bill is also too fluffy, or at least I like it; and the script, although thin, seems to jump from one scenario to another, eventually leaving me almost bewildered. <br /> <br /> Although the film is based on a good moral and quite quiet performance of Noel-Bruno is quite cute, the real star is the fox. Those exciting moments focusing exclusively around our furry little friend are huge. However, again, they are simply not enough. <br /> <br /> - To keep abreast of all the latest novelties of the film, including reviews, news, discussions and more, be sure to visit www.mybluray. com.au
