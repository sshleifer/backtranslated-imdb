David Lynch’s rough and gruff stare at South Park presents a nightmare of disturbing cliches about middle-class suburban families. The father is a disgusting monster with three teeth and a disproportionately large round hole in the mouth, from which the most terrible guttural noises emanate, the son and mother are constantly horrified, rambling, for whom horror is a way of life. A number of equally absurd characters are presented in the series. <br /> <br /> Lynch is not famous for his comedies (for example, On the Air, Wild in the Deep of My Soul), and I don’t particularly like comedies in general. However, there were several scenes in Dumbland that made me laugh out loud. There are some tricky pieces of animated cinema - when Lynch conveys a wide range of reactions to his characters through the syntactic arrangement of pictures, in contrast to facial expressions (which never change in Dumland). <br /> <br /> I believe that Lynch really tried to give his audience a direct, albeit disturbing, animated comedy here. Interestingly, he decided to follow in the footsteps of a recent wave of humor with ultra-low eyebrows (that is, most of the films of Will Farrell), while adding elements of malicious social criticism, classic cartoon violence and crude humor. Although the mixture here does not work very well, it is nothing like Lynchyan. <br /> <br /> Worth watching Lynch fans.
