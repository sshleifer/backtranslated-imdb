Hmm .. I was rather surprised that someone actually gave this film high marks. <br /> <br /> Let's face it ... Tori Spelling is not a great actress ... and this film simply proves the degree of her "talent". " The plot of the film was weak ... I bet the jerk who came up with this concept was some kind of perverted spy volume. If there is something good in this film, I would say that it is the daughter of Tommy Chong, just because she is his daughter ... and then there is the male lead in the soap opera who looks decently good, something makes him attractive, but stops helping his dramatic abilities. * Why does IMDb require at least 10 lines? How many more ways can you just say "This movie sucks"?
