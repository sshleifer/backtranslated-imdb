First of all, I have to say that I worked for a blockbuster and saw quite a few films, and it was difficult for me to find something that I had not seen. Taking this into account, I want everyone to know that this film was the worst movie ever made, it made me miss Gigli, the daughter of my boss and any other trash you have ever seen. BeLyt must be out of his mind, I found only one person who loved it, and even they could not tell me what the film was about. If you can decipher this movie and tell me what it is about, you must be either a writer or a fortune teller, because there is some other way a person could understand this shit. <br /> <br /> FOR GOD'S LOVE REMAIN!
