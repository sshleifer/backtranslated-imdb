Brainless movie about a beautiful, but brainless couple who decides to make her dream come true and take people on diving tours. The couple almost immediately makes the wrong choice of customers and mixes with some people trying to return the items that we see, falling to the ocean floor during the sequence of initial credits. It would be much better to look directly at a video movie if it were not so interested, first of all, in looking good. The performances are intact, and the plot is actually quite good, otherwise the director and producers would not redirect the plot to make sure that we see a lot of slim people in bathing suits (or that I guess the reason for "without rating the nickname of several fleeting naked breasts). The film never causes tension and does not rise above the level of an unforgettable television film. If you don’t notice it, you won’t throw up your eyes, because the eye candy is pleasant, but we really need to stop producers from making films that are I have an excuse for paid leave.
