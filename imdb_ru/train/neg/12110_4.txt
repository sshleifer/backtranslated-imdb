What is most striking in this semi-musical set of the 1920s in Berlin is the amazing cinematography and editing. This is the pinnacle of the line from the First National in these departments. This story is mildly engaging and similar to the plots of two other Miller films (SUNNY, SUNNY), ​​where the working girl meets a rich boy with family disapproval, complications and a final fight. All four musical numbers are grouped at the beginning of the film, and we go a long time, without any further musical buoyancy. Miller sings the “I Think of a Baby” part and repeats, because you. Also, NEVER BE BLUE AND THAT YOU ARE NOT FIRST. <br /> <br /> Miller is very fascinating and delightful here, rather reminiscent of Irene Dunn in his manner and delivery. Sadly, she does not dance because it is her forte. SALLY remains her best film, with this gap as the second and rather poor SUNNY, significantly inferior to the second. Her life was tragically cut short by a sinus infection before hospitals and antibiotics made such tragedies preventable. However, it is worth watching these films to see the main star of the twenties Siegfeld.
