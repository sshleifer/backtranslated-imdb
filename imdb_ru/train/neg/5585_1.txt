The problem is the role of the characters in the film. "Man to Man" shows that the British anthropologist kidnapped two pygmies and took them to Scotland, and then realized that they were not animals or subhumans, but in fact equal to themselves. The problem lies in the role of the pygmies in the film - two people who are abducted, they are treated like animals, and at the same time they are given such a superficial stereotypical role in the film ... The kidnapper (British anthropologist) turns out to be the hero of the film because he "manages" treat the pygmies ... I have no idea how the two hostages feel, from their point of view, with their ordeal ... I think this is a shallow film with a one-sided fundamentally racist look ... never manage to move away from the look " white people "
