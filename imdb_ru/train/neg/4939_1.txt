Peeew it stinks! As everyone knows, this is based on some Geico commercials; that no one knows why? At best, these videos were funny when you first viewed them; hardly any feed for the show. (The Geico talking geckos are a different story. Now this could be an intriguing show!) And why did ABC - as reported in the press - actually agree to buy the rights to the cavemen characters from Geico for this? In the end, the idea of ​​cavemen fighting in the modern world is hardly unique to television; More than ten years ago, Phil Hartman had a permanent role on Saturday evening in the role of the “Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer”. And this is how this concept works best - as a random installment. But the regular series? Fuhgeddaboudit. (In the 1960s series, The Time is Now, cavemen were also used in the concept of the modern world. It lasted one season.) <br /> <br /> One of the directors of the show, who was also responsible for advertising Geico, was recently quoted saying: “We were so excited when we were filming our commercials, because we felt that we had something unique and we had more interesting stories.” Wrong. <br /> <br /> In the annals of bad television, he was destined to take his place along with “I and the Chimpanzee” of 1972 as one of the worst in history. The main actor in the embarrassing Chimpanzee fiasco was actually hiding from the association after it was suddenly canceled. Without a doubt, our cavemen friends will follow their example.
