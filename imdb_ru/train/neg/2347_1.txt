First, let me state that I am a big fan of Ashley Judd; That's why I was curious to check it out, its debut role. There are no arguments in favor of the fact that her talent is obvious, and her performance is excellent. I think I also see how professional critics liked the aesthetic content of the story. However, I like to think that films are meant to entertain us, and this is where this film fails. <br /> <br /> Halfway through, I found myself thinking: “How much longer do we have to watch a bored store girl idly standing near an abandoned gift shop, rearranging goods? It seemed like it would last forever! <br /> <br /> Then, I thought, maybe this is one of those films where the director is trying to put the viewers to sleep in a relaxed state, before striking them with a dynamic event. There is no such luck. The film continues to the very end. This is a boring, boring, no-adventure story. <br /> <br /> I don’t say this because I’m a drug addict. I like all kinds of movies, especially romantic comedies. But I expect to be entertained. <br /> <br /> Add the fact that cinematography and sound quality are comparable to your neighbor’s bad home movies. Depressing! <br /> <br /> I just don’t understand how someone might like this movie. Zero entertainment value. The longest 114 minutes in my life. <br /> <br />
