This film - just one of the worst films ever made, and is a cursed accusation not only of the British film industry, but untalented hacks at work today. The film was not only mass distribution, but also a good cast of British actors. What went wrong? I don’t know, and I just don’t care to participate in the debate, because the film was so terrible that it didn’t deserve thought at all. be warned and stay away from this garbage. but obviously, I need to write ten lines of text in this review so that I can also detail the plot. The man’s nob is tuned by his evil friend and colleague from his father’s company and thus leads to a meeting with the Russian mafia, cunning accents and silly, very stupid plot perversions. I should have asked for my money back, but could still have been shocked by the experience. if you want a good crime movie, look at the usual suspects or godfather, how about blocking, stock ... this is the peak of a modern British crime movie .....
