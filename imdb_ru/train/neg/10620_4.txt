Despite some exciting (and bold) sequences, NBTN simply never starts. There are exploding boats, pin murders, mass suicides, pathologists with body parts, and all kinds of classic mystery / horror scenes, but they alternate with long periods of pure exposure. Everyone in the movie looks boring. This is a shame, because many of the episodes would have been considered bold at the time it was filmed. <br /> <br /> Add to this the “too correct” British characters, and you feel that you have fallen into Sherlock's Holmes Film. <br /> <br /> Finally, the cinematography is very ordinary. There are many opportunities for beautiful pictures of the countryside or complex pictures of someone dragged into a huge bonfire, but all this is unimaginable and boring. <br /> <br /> Definitely only for fans of Lee and Cushing.
