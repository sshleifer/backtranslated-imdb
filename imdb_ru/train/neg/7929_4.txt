I think if you are fond of fantasy and horror, it can be interesting. The game was fine, but not great. It is assumed that two pregnant girls should be fifteen, but they are clearly played by senior actresses, who at the time were twenty-one twenty-one. The plot is fine, but the story jumps a bit, and one can only guess whether you are in Boston or Pennsylvania. The priest seems to use the strain rate between the two. The Catholic Church is portrayed as a secretive sect to investigate events that occur only with those of this faith. What if two girls were Protestants? Will Catholics take care? Therefore, something came up. Who knows, one day the Catholic Church may even find out what the Bible teaches. If you miss this, do not think that you have lost something.
