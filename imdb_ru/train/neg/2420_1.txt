I usually comment only on films that I like, portraying “everyone to your taste”, but here I want to make an exception. The premise of this film, which somehow seems to be lost randomly, is that these two selfish adults have every right to go to Las Vegas, get drunk, get married, and cause untold suffering to their respective descendants children. Even considering the culturally sanctioned intoxication, they have neither the courage nor the sense of responsibility to wake up the next morning and cancel what they set in motion. After all, love is all that matters, isn't it? To hell with everyone else. Whether things really “work at the end” is not the main thing; it really doesn't matter at all. The fact is that disrespect for others, especially if they are young people, and especially if they are in a state of dependence, is highlighted and thus strengthened by this film. These "parents" could have done much more innocuous actions that would in one instant put the army of social workers on their heads.
