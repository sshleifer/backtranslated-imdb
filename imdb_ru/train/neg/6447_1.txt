I bought this film for $ 5 in a special store at a local video store for one reason only, Chase Masterson, but I had to crush the top five, throw it in the toilet and blush. The film tells about twenty things that reached their peak in high school and reunited on the anniversary of the death of their idiots friends who got drunk, wandered into the woods and died. The problem is that the reptile monster is hunting them one by one. The acting is terrible, these useless people, apparently, were thrown on the show 90210 and Dawsons Creek. The direction was at the level of twelve, and the script was probably written by a thirteen-year-old. The whole set looks like someoneâ€™s backyard in Malibu. People here who praised this film are obviously friends of the director and / or actors. Avoid this heap of trash ALL prices.
