The actor asks: “What is my motivation?” To understand his or her character. After viewing this “dokudram”, this vague and random farce, the viewer wonders what someone's motivation was. <br /> <br /> This inept brainchild of daytime television (the Oprah Show) missed a great opportunity to explore Powerful issues for a mile. <br /> <br /> His characters were superficial, the storyline was far less socially useful than the Simpsons episode. It portrayed the investigative police unprofessional and incompetent. There was no explanation in it why the court might refer to the main character, a female molester, otherwise, as if he were a male peasant. <br /> <br /> Why did this unrepentant woman start “caring” for a second-grade student, start a novel with him when he returned to her sixth grade? Why did the boy’s mother testify for her? The simple answer is overwhelming narcissism, as well as the rationalization of generations and greed. The film gave no hint of it. <br /> <br /> Why didn’t the viewer have been told that the victim’s mother had sold the interview rights to print and television tabloids, parading her teenage son on “Today’s Show”? This lawyer, Mary Kay, cashed money, she herself appeals to the law "Son Sam" to benefit from their crime, selling its history to the highest price? <br /> <br /> Why was it not explained that Lieturno's father was a former right-wing congressman, American independent presidential candidate of 1972, president of the society John Birch? In 1983, John Schmitz's political career ended when his own student from a local college discovered that he had children, and this became known only when this owner disfigured their little son? Still, the father of Letourno led his children out of the “too liberal” Catholic schools, fighting to prevent all schoolchildren from giving any sex education? <br /> <br /> One month after her conditional release, she is again pregnant with a 14-year-old child. The second daughter of Old, Mary Kay, received 7 1/2 years in prison for numerous conditional violations. Then a prophetic editorial about a sad novel appeared in the Seattle Times: “After two miserable hours, Leturno was sent to prison, and this obscene melange from the curse created for television ended before the casting began.” br /> <br /> Of course, shooting this parody began in 18 months.
