*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** If you look at a movie based on one premise, you might think that you are watching a horror movie that targets an ordinary animal. The plot is as follows. A group of documentary directors is sent to the island to shoot a documentary about shark surfing or blood. (I live in South Africa, so it was released as “Blood Surf.”) However, it seems to have a somewhat interesting idea that, if it were investigated further, could have improved the film somewhat. However, this is not the case, as the surfing part of the film is minimal due to the fact that their documentary is interrupted by a rather large salted crocodile. <br /> <br /> The script is absolutely terrible. A good example of this is that whenever someone is eaten by a crocodile, which is a frequent occurrence in this film, nobody cares. The most that anyone did in the film was to roast the victim on the stage, which was supposed to be hot, but in the end it turned out to be ridiculous because the dialogue in this film was rather dubious. Another thing that is really annoying in this film is that they represent characters who are completely superfluous of the film itself. They represent a group of pirates who, as you can see, add another 10 minutes to the merciful short film. <br /> <br /> You can say that acting is mediocre. It would probably be much more impressive if they didn’t have such a terrible scenario for the job. In general, there is not a single person who has a terrible effect on me. It seems that every person was a haggard caricature, and thus, none of these actors had any influence on me. <br /> <br /> It is said that the crocodile itself is huge, exactly more than 31 feet. and this sense of size is well depicted by the obvious crocodile fake they provided to us in the film. The death of a crocodile at the end of the film is so ridiculously false and contrived that it makes the stomach turn. With a huge cry of bravado, the hero of the film announces that he has a plan that, as it turned out, will fall from the hill and force the crocodile to pierce himself with a well-located thorn at the foot of this hill. <Br /> <br /> In general, I would say that this film is the one that needs to be watched so you can believe how bad it can be. What seemed like a good idea at the time, suffered from a terrible script and an overwhelming sense of low budget, which all served to create a truly terrible film.
