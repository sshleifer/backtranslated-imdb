Meet Peter Houseman, professor of rock star genetics at the University of Virginia. When he doesnâ€™t play around on the court, he goes crazy and drops his panties in classroom lectures. Dr. Houseman is working on a serum that would allow the body to constantly regenerate cells, allowing people to become immortal. I would also like to be immortal if I looked like Christian Bale and got the sweet feminine love that only VU can offer. The range of old and ugly university professors does not care about the popular Houseman and covers the financing of his project due to lack of results. This causes Peter to use himself as a guinea pig for his serum. Much to my amazement, there are side effects, and he, this, metamorphosis! into what is built into our genetic DNA, which has been suppressed for "millions of years." He also sleeps in love with Dr. Mike, Sally, after a day of exploring her. She has a son. His name is Tommy. He is an evil little boy. <br /> <br /> Metamorphosis is not a terrible movie, just not a very well thought out one. All the while I watched it, I could not ignore the fact that it was filmed in 1989. The appearance of the film is the quality of the late seventies no later. It does not help that it is packaged with 1970s films, as Metamorphosis is part of the 50 frightening classic entertainment center. In principle, there is no difference in the quality of the film. The last five minutes - pure bad cinematic cheese, which, at least for me, saves the film from a lower rating. Pay attention to computer terminology, such as "chromosonic anomaly". Not surprisingly, Peter's experiment failed. Your computer can not record! This is a worthy performance, accompanied by a trip to your local tavern.
