I argued about whether I should tick the spoiler box. Since 99% of this show has probably already been viewed by any follower of Scrabbs, it probably does not fall into the spoiler category. <br /> <br /> Clip show. Hmm We all knew that Friends were going down the tube when they started with a clip show ... and after five and a half years in the Scrubs they left and fell into this hole. <br /> <br /> I’m wondering if the writers simply couldn’t bother writing this week and just said to themselves: “Let's show other funny things.” It did not work. <br /> <br /> First, showing that people have fallen is not funny when taken out of context. It’s not funny to see Todd hanging out in his banana hammock, if we don’t know WHY he hung out in his banana hammock. <br /> <br /> Secondly, for what was supposed to be a collection of fantasies by JD, one of them was Turk’s dream, the other was not his fantasy either, although I had forgotten which one. <br /> <br /> And this is the problem. This episode is completely forgotten. We have seen it all before. A collection of clips of dancing people? What for? It's not funny. <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to admit that two of my favorite moments of Scrubs were featured in the latest collection ... Doctor. Cox realizes that Ben is dead ... and JD tells him how proud he is. <br /> <br /> But even the repetition of these moments did not save this episode. Resume speaks for itself. <br /> <br /> The worst episode in history. Bill Lawrence, PLEASE do not let your show go just like Friends, keep it fresh, fun ... or wrap it up.
