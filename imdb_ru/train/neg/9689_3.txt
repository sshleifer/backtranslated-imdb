In one respect, it looks like the "Wizard of Oz" with a black and white image of Paris and a color pattern of the Riviera. But supposedly we are talking about possessive love, destructiveness and moral decay, while in reality we are talking about designer dresses, pictures of Riveria, a variety of large expensive cars and musical and dancing interludes that Vincente Minnelli offers on one of his weekends. Watchable, but a wonderful example of a desperate, dark plot material and brilliant style, moving in different directions. (Was this the “Talented Mr. Ripley” model? Does anyone feel intimacy between Jean Seberg and Matt Damon?)
