It was a painful example of a cheap, boring and non-original show created by Australian TV channels to fulfill local content quotas. The letter was really terrible, and I am not surprised that the authors are those responsible for the worst Australian film in the history of Honest Wally Norman. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this series was funny — never — not even — even slightly funny. He was just tired and bad, and, worst of all, he really thought it was funny. Watching this was awkward. <br /> <br /> Something very strange is that 10 out of 10 were shown on IMDb. Try to find a (real) review of the (real) Australian viewer of the show (there were not many), and this is impossible. Or crazy. There are loaves of bread that are funnier than this show. <br /> <br /> Avoid the show at all costs, and if it comes out on DVD, remember that the laugh it deserves was unintentional.
