I think itâ€™s safe to say that this is the worst movie ever made. When I saw the trailer on TV, from the second second I immediately realized that it would be a piece of ****, and it would be better to avoid it, but I was somehow dragged by some friends, I entered the cinema with little expectations, but I hoped that there will be some cheap laughs so that I won't sleep during this movie. The so-called "jokes" in this film dismayed the face, they mostly consist of people hitting the face and eggs, a child looking weird and acting like an agitated gangsta, and typical racing jokes that we often see in today's junk comedies . The film is obvious, and the story is not only impossible to believe, but predictable and boring. Characters are extremely annoying and highly stereotypical. I never want to see this **** movie anymore, I would prefer to take a bullet in the leg than to be exposed to this piece of wood again. If someone I see says what they liked, I will hit them physically in the face.
