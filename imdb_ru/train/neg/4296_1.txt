I was going to say that this is the worst gay movie I've ever seen, but I can honestly say that this is the worst movie of all genres I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> You know that you’re in trouble when the film begins with the director’s “personal note” asking for “understanding” the «many problems’ audience that the new director faces. The audio track is so bad in many scenes that it is almost impossible to follow the dialogue, and this is from the DVD version. Bad lighting, bad scenery, bad photography, bad script, generally a bad game - all this makes this film invisible. After several attempts, I got to a bad end and immediately distributed the DVD, which I foolishly bought. I am sure that there are many problems facing the new director. But do not try to slip this unsuccessful attempt as a finished product. From the details of IMDb, I see that it was not only the first attempt of director Richard Natale, but also the only one. This is the only positive thing I can say about this supposed “movie”.
