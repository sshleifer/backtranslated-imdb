Steven Seagal .... how could you be part of such a horrible movie? I rented this film because your films were usually pretty clean. I have lost a lot of respect for you in such a terrible movie like this one. Very, very bad taste! I am ashamed that I even made this film. Stephen, if you continue to appear in films like me, I believe that your career is over. My husband and I enjoyed watching many of your movies, because you can always “get the bad guy” with a few manual maneuvers and make it clean ... and the language is pretty clean in your movies ... but this one is different . I'll think twice before making another your movie.
