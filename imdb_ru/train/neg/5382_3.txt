Undoubtedly, this play, created by young minds, can very much please the crowd of the 20s, who is still trying to find its place in the world, obsessed with all the neuroses. However, I cannot imagine that a large number of the narcissistic navel, banal humor or a banal subject would especially attract someone over 30 years old. Another problem is that the minor characters, which the directors obviously have nothing but contempt for, spin up to such absurd caricatures for a comic effect that they cannot be connected in any real way. <br /> <br /> However, you need to give a few style moments to directors who obviously grew up in the video generation, and use all imaginable editing techniques in the book to decorate a story that does not exist anyway. First, beware of festival favorites. Secondly, even though we live in the YouTube era, not everyone talks about their worldly life and deserves consideration on the big screen. But these young cinematographers have every right to make their own film, and if others find something in it that can be identified, then so much the better. However, I could not help but think at the end of this film, as this last generation, just now coming of age, will live in the real world that presents so many problems and complications. At the age when every child is constantly being convinced how special he is and that they all deserve 15-minute contact, resilience and ability to cope with difficulties are not the strength of this generation.
