Mary Lou is a whore whose spirit seeks revenge on those who let her come to her fiery death in the distant 1957. <br /> <br /> The film basically takes place in 1986. The film falls into the strange trap of the 80s. / Stupid special effects, including some strange looking crazy horse. <br /> <br /> In any case, the spirit of Mary Lou does bad things to people and tries to capture the body of one person. Regardless of whether it succeeds or not, you will have to look to find out. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is mostly boring and based on a bunch of useless characters. This is also not a sequel, the only thing in common with the first is the name of the high school. It has an average. horror film, retreat, blood, senseless nudity, attacks on the Catholic Church. Base material, boring movie. <br /> <br /> The game is decent enough to give it 3 out of 10. You can spend your time doing something else.
