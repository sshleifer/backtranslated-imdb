Seeing Versus earlier, I had high hopes for Alive. The description of the movie on the back of the DVD cover sounded promising. Live did not deliver. VERY slow development. Many features with actors and cool visual effects. The premise was intriguing, but the gain did not offset the growth. Could do a lot more at the end. Most of the film is just sitting around. Simply put, the three of us were able to sit down and watch this film, and by the 50-minute mark we struggled to get to the end. It really needs more shock elements. If you're looking for fights like Ichi the Killer or Versus, save yourself some money and a lot of frustration.
