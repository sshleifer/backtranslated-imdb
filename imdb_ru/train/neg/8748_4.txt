It was interesting to see how accurate it was written on fashionable buzz words, but very naive in the corporate world. The Justice Department would catch more large giants of the corporation if they did such naive things to win. The real corporate world is much more subtle and interesting, but at the same time sinister. I seriously doubt that ANY corps will actually kill someone directly; even mod more indirect nowadays. In the real world, they kill people with nicotine, pollution, additives, poisons, etc. This film must have been developed by some garage fans, I think, and the studios did not know the difference. They just wanted to capitalize on the Microsoft antitrust case in the news.
