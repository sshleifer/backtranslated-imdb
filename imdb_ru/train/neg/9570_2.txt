For the first time in many years, I felt the need to go into IMDb today to clear myself of this film by writing a review, because it was just a disappointment to watch. The plot sounded amazing when I read it, I was expecting a minimal mysterious thriller, phantom claustrophobia hunt. Unfortunately, all this is so badly smoothed by a mundane, tedious love story and too many far-fetched and gloomily-stupid “people don't say such things as this except in bad films” - that is just painful. <br /> <br /> Here is a brief overview of the worst insults of this fragment of the film: <br /> <br /> - the script so much depends on coincidences and inexplicable and unforgivable stupidity. The main characters are just ridiculous. No, in fact, it is angry. And lazy. <br /> <br /> - Related to this: cheap thrills. Long parade "just in time." <br /> <br /> - The main characters. Well, it seems that the screenwriter has never experienced real people in real life, but instead got all his knowledge from bad films. Thus, his characters are boring, lifeless second generation cliches. They are simple conspiracies, fillers without the slightest individuality. They are "a man and a woman in parting who still love each other." I have never seen this before, except for 100,000 films, and it does not become more realistic or enjoyable. Think of the simplest two-dimensional Hollywood fare, and you get it. There is not a single character in this film that is even fresh, charming or interesting. <br /> <br /> - A contrived, vague resolution that sways very badly and requires one push to overthrow, although the word “resolution” here may be inappropriate, because the film is a swampy mess that won't go anywhere. By the time you're done, you don't care. I just rewound the last third of the film because it was just unbearable to watch. <br /> <br /> OK, that's it. Whatever the redemptive features of this film, it all sinks into incompetence. Do not watch this shit.
