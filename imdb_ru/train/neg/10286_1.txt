Roommates Sugar and Bobby Lee were kidnapped by threatening dudes when they went shopping once, and they were taken to a secluded island where the girls were reluctant to tell the thugs that they last visited them when they were ten years old and that they were lies a fortune. All this is largely reminiscent of a film that recalls one long memory of the girls' first visit to the island and the ensuing fight with a family-eater. <br /> <br /> This film was extremely awful for all participants. The bottom line is that I started to feel bad about poor Hank Warden, who really deserved MUCH better. As much as I didn’t like Barracuda (it's on the same DVD), I have to admit that this film makes it look like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: one pair of boobs (they may belong to Kirsten Baker) <br /> <br /> My rating: F <br /> <br /> Dark Sky Extras DVDs: vintage promotional ads for various foods; and trailers for the films “Children of Bonnie” (with nudes), “Turning girls”, “Part-time wife” (with nudes), “Psychic killer” and “Eaten alive”. The DVD also comes with the 1978 "Barracuda"
