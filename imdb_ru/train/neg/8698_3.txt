Well, I remember watching the first one, and the boy made it sucks. After watching it, I just laughed it off and said to myself: â€œOh, man, just another budget B-film with a low budget. Then, after about a year and a half, came the second part. It sucked even more. But I just laughed it off and said: "I will never see this part 3." Then, about 1/2 year later, the third part came out. I was stupid enough to rent it, and boy, I just snapped after watching. God, I never understood how many films can suck these days. Just save $ 7.50 and don't rent out the whole series. Believe me, it is worth every penny.
