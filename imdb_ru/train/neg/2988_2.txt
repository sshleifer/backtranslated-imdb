First of all, I really liked Zombi 2 from Lucio Fulci. This film was rubbish. I could not look at it. The storyline was a joke, acting was a joke, and the fact that Zombi 3 has nothing to do with Zombi 2 is even more fun. <br /> <br /> We jump from Voodoo to DEATH 1 People BACK TO LIFE. Anyway, this film is not worth $ 1.00, it is worth renting it. I really liked the Lucio Fulci films, but this one was terrible. If Zombi 3 is an indicator of what zombies 4 and 5 will be, I think I'll just skip them. <br /> <br /> Zombi 2 - amazing flick.
