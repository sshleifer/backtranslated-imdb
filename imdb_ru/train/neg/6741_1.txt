Seriously, I'm all for funny romantic comedies, and Miss Congeniality is just as easy for me as Goodfellas ... but this film? It makes no sense !!!! And I'm not even saying that the voluntary suspension of disbelief seems to make no sense. Why does her family live in England? Or at least why she doesn't have a British accent? She, of course, feels comfortable with her father, and he surprisingly forgives that she has not been around for the past two years. (On this issue, no one so long did not agree with the fact that she was absent for so long). And what about the goofy clothes at the bachelorette party? I'm not even going to go into the fact that the escort for which she paid falls in love with her - this could be overcome with the help of better filmmaking. I simply say that the characters, the setting and the plot are not sufficiently developed to create even a somewhat coherent story. Oh, and the worst part, in my opinion, is the consistent use of the most unflattering angles on the nose of Deborah Messing - I would sue the filmmakers in her place! I mean, to be honest, Iâ€™m all for women who are who they are, but why, in seven loyal years of watching Will and Grace, I never noticed how incredibly strange her nose was? Oh! Because these producers are kind to her! In this film, as in my other least favorite film, Armageddon, the creators of the film are to blame, not the actors. I can see both Messing and McDermott in these roles with the best writer, director and producer. <br /> <br /> This easily gets my vote as one of the worst films I've ever spent time on. I'm just glad that my friend lent me her DVD, so all I wasted was time. If there was a way to make this review zero stars, I would do it.
