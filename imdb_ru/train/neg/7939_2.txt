From the decrepit ranks of the already oversaturated subgenre of “Hillybilly Horror” comes this sad story about a resting family, terrorized by inbred goons. Sounds familiar? Well, this should definitely be for anyone, even with a little knowledge of the horror genre. Here is absolutely new. It seems to make sense in the film to dispose of all the old worn cliches (deformed hicks, a peaceful family that became a murderer with a cannon when a push comes, a rebellious daughter, the only "abnormal" who has a good heart, and so on ...) even hesitant to make it a waste of time. This is a forgetful gloom, but quite a humorous leader, J.D. Hart once starred in a film called “Films That Suck” at the beginning of his career, and in fact, a rather ironic omen. <br /> <br /> My rating: D-
