There seems to be some kind of curse in gay movies. Namely, happy endings are not very common. Beautiful things are excluded, funny movies tend to end in ruined relationships or untimely death. And some, for example, Come Undone, just end ... period. <br /> <br /> The creators of this terrible nonsense should learn something about the plot, direction and timing. During the first ten minutes of this film, I felt a little bewildered, and even more so after the first glance at the character Jeremy Elkaim, who had a small psychic session. It seems that this film was randomly assembled without a single attempt at continuity or consistency. There is no real way to know when you are viewing a real or some kind of ethereal memory. I could only take so much before it became truly unattractive. <br /> <br /> Stephen Holden from The New York Times called this film "... stunningly beautiful and completely real." Well, it seems that Stephen invested money in beer glasses before watching, as it really is far from beautiful. Because of all the praise of this film, I was expecting something worth seeing. Unfortunately, the film lived to its name. And by the end of the film (which gave no permission, I might add), it becomes clear that the writers, the director and the film have everything they need.
