Alicia Silverstone (before "Clueless") plays a modern, crime-obsessed teenager trying to uncover the brutal murder of a local girl. Pat Verducci wrote and made this film, which is not particularly good, but surprisingly serious about its main character. Silverstone is attractive and successful in creating an interesting young woman here, despite the tricky subversion of the picture. The cast (including Kevin Dillon and Michael Bowen) is not bad, although the violence in the last act goes overboard. Not a fun camp holiday, but nothing really memorable. * 1/2 of ****
