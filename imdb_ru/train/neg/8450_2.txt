What happens with ITV Drama. First of all, “Lose Gemma” is quite simply the worst television drama I have seen in recent years, and now “Ideal Parents” are completely fighting from beginning to end. Whoever is responsible for the commissioning of this nonsense, he should receive there P45 special delivery. <br /> <br /> In most drama / thrillers, the requirement to suspend certain levels of faith is necessary for the storyline to evolve, but “Ideal Parents” took it to a new level, by the end of this nonsense I stopped so many beliefs that I felt that they force-feed a truck with Magic Mushrooms, as if the writers decided to try and create a Drama by Number, which raises some serious issues - Religion, Education, Greed, Fear, Murder, Pedophilia. The only problem was that the great Eric Morecambe once said, playing the piano: "I play all the right notes, but not necessarily in the right order." For your next guys from Script, I suggest you read some more scripting books than Writing a Script for Dummies. <br /> <br /> Due to the ridiculous scenario and the complete absence of tension in the leadership, the acting was quite restrained, not the fault of the actors, since the cast was at the highest level. But I suggest that all the actors participating in this pitiful performance instruct their agents the next time the Postman tries to deliver the script from the ITV Drama Department, make sure the mailbox is securely closed!
