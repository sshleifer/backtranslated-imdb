The mystery is solved very early, and the film becomes a direct novel. I almost stopped watching him after 5 minutes and 10 minutes and at the first break. My husband, who is a Hallmark & ​​Lifetime fan, gave up at the first break. <br /> <br /> Forest River is a corporate city whose main business is Aikens jewelry, which makes all kinds of holiday decorations. The company's patriarch recently passed away, so the future of companies may be in question. Soon we meet Noel, who is more likely to be on Wall Street than on Main Street, and the mysterious Justin, who meets Noel after the big snowman she blows up, crashes into Justin's car. After we meet with Alison Aikens, having done due diligence for the Board, we will prepare our story. <br /> <br /> If you can't bite through all the history arcs for the first commercial break, you have not seen enough of this kind of festive movie. Maybe this is good.
