This is an awesome horrible movie. There is so little point in this that he begins to create a kind of strange internal logic. Well, it would be if he did not continue to jump up the side alleys, until finally he began to hesitate under the weight of his own indecision. The film can not decide, whether it is a straightforward film “Man Turns into a Monster” (as in the films of the 1950s, “INCREDIBLY Insert the Verb ING MAN”), or a horrible film about the conspiracy theory of big business, or a mystical film. contact history with the afterlife, or ... or what? Make your choice. This is just a mess. Grotesque from above and shoots in all directions, leaving loose ends slam everywhere. Like Tob Hooper was taking David Lynch pills. Unfortunately, he did not take enough.
