Wow, what can I say about this movie? This is a lousy piece of shit. I am surprised that he was rated as high as before. What is wrong with this movie? Here is the best question: what is wrong with this film. <br /> <br /> The story itself is just crap and clich√©. This is basically what it is about ... Some sort of know-it-all, without friends, are chosen, killed and returned as a scarecrow of revenge. "Everything" is packed into 86 minutes of useless movie. If you have not seen this movie, do not waste your time watching it. In addition, the second is not much better, so do not worry about watching it too ... I appreciated this movie three, because I liked the outfit stuffed, and not because there was something good in the movie. I think you understand the picture.
