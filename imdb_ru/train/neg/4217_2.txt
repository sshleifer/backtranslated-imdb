It was recently on the bright classic of the AMC movie, and I had to laugh. I had high hopes for this adventure, which follows in the spirit of “Journey to the core of the Earth” and “Mysterious Island”. I was very disappointed not only by the acting skills, but also by the stupid plot line read in the comic book of the five-year-old child. Be sure to pay attention to the wires that hold on to the Pterdactyl wings when they grab the Ogara, a half-idiot, pre-modern man who gives support to lost adventurers. The ending left it open for further rephrasing of the same effects in "People who forgot time." Do not waste your time.
