Note. I will reveal the key part of the story, but if you looked at the cover of a DVD or any promotional material, you already know about it. <br /> <br /> This film seems to have been written by an eleven-year-old boy who is not very smart and probably very tired when he wrote this. The author does not know the difference between a chemical and an organism. <br /> <br /> Forget that the UN and the NSA seem to have a show in Hungary. Forget the fact that when these top intelligence officers chase someone whose simple touch will kill you in about a minute, they don’t wear protective gear (even gloves). This is nagging in the context of this film. In the scientific world in this story, 2 + 2 = 6.34 and gravity moves sideways. <br /> <br /> The fact is that the people in this film (with some exceptions) do not behave the way people behave. Almost every time a character reacts to something, it’s inappropriate. The love story (of course there is) makes the scenes of the soap opera look like Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I can’t believe we spent free movie rentals on this thing.
