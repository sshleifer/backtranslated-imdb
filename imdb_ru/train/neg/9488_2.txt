I saw some very horrible horror films in my time, and although this is not the worst of this group, of course, in the lower half. The script starts well. The young doctor goes to the hospital as an intern, hoping that this will lead him to a better job for him and his future wife. Honey ah? Then the film goes straight to the toilet when you realize that something is killing patients. It turns out that in the basement there is a demon who collects the souls of people. Task 1 doctor, 1 nurse and 1 guard from the entire hospital staff - pull this mentally ill downstairs, perform a ritual that simply involves cutting out the tongue, and then lets the demon haunted house go out and steal his soul through the magic of raw special effects. At this point, the film becomes so ridiculous that I begged him to finish. There was still an hour left. It looked like a half-hour episode of "Tales from the Crypt", which somehow stretched out for a half-hour shitty holiday. From Tiny Lister, which is trying hard to imitate John Coffey (The Green Mile), before Tracy Scoggins plays the stereotypical frigid nurse Ratchet, this film falls through at all levels. I gave it 2 stars only for a TWO reason. 1) His fianc√© is pretty hot, she eased a little pain by the end and 2) The film actually looks good, much better than the current trend of horror films made with Wal-Mart quality home cameras. <br /> <br /> In the end, avoid this shit, even if you have a blockbuster blockbuster pass (which I do, and I still felt deceived). As a bonus drinking game, you and your buddies make shots every time Matt Stacy (Dr. James Bishop) shakes his head during a conversation. You will be drunk after 15 minutes in the film.
