Two houses, one street, one phone booth, one car, the girl next door, the boy next door and zombies. This list of ingredients should be enough for a great horror movie. All you need is some blue light, background music and ... done. But not in the hands of the Dutch director Van Rooveroy! <br /> <br /> I like to have "bad movie nights" from time to time. The idea is very simple: drink a little, find friends who love movies, and immerse yourself in the worst that movies can offer. For such an evening, this world of dirt is one of the best. Laughter is guaranteed! <br /> <br /> Strange, but van Ruwer still defends his film as if it were a great achievement. To be a witness to this, you need to listen to the track with comments on the DVD. Again: disbelief and laughter are guaranteed!
