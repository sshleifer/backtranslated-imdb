What with indonesian music films? I have never seen Indonesian music films like those made in Bollywood. They miss the spirit of the story and just a bunch of "so-called" poetic lines. <br /> <br /> This love story of two children who are separated, and then met again after several years of change, does not have any special comments. This is a simple plot plot (but, nevertheless, it is focused enough) with “intended to” musical plot lines here and there. <br /> <br /> Confusing characters who need to be rescued by a brilliant game are ignored. The main actress may try to revive the character, but this is the best thing she could do when she tried. As for the casting, I do not feel the need to include a Balinese student in this story and, of course, these are not the only unnecessary characters. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is why I want to watch this movie? Maybe because of the mango ...
