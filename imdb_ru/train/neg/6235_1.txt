Well done, Al Gore! You are the first person to make $ 1 billion from the lies of global warming! Just like all the other man-made fables in the world, this one is there with the best lie to devour so many people. Of course, pollution is not a good thing, and I would like all trees to grow, but global warming is a business! It employs thousands of people who are very misleading. <br /> <br /> Google it! There are only a lot of things that simply do not add up, but well done by Al, you failed as a politician, but continued to earn a lot of money sucking in the world. <br /> <br /> What's next? Is Santa real?
