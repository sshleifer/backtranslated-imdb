This film should never have been shot. <br /> <br /> What a shame for the budget. <br /> <br /> Please hire convincing actors and make the right movie. Very thin plot and unconvincing lines. Almost funny, and it's a shame for an action movie .... <br /> <br /> Definitely not worth watching. <br /> <br /> They continue to reproduce the same “frames” of the flight of the Stealth aircraft. long away. You saw it once, and it was not worth repeating three or four times. <br /> <br /> It's time for Stephen Seagal to stop making a movie. <br /> <br /> His films Every time things get worse. <br /> <br /> Black Dawn and Submerged were already bad, but this movie is even worse.
