I had high hopes for this since I like Tim Roth. I was not happy with this movie. I liked Ang Lee Hulk a few years ago, so I thought it would be something more. At first I was very disappointed with the performance of John Hurt here. He looks as if his eyebrows have been modified for this. His performance was not convincing. He was not as good as expected. Tim Roth is cool as always. I do not think that Gama really followed the original storyline. I think the best part of the movie was the end. It was some cool action. The only problem with the original was that it was too long. This one is not so long, but at times it got a bit boring. I remember some time ago when Walmart was selling this film really cheap, and I was always wondering why? Now I know. I was hoping to be demolished, but it is not.
