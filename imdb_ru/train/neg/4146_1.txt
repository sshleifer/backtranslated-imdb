After watching this thing, then reading the summary on the back of the DVD, then remembering the real movie ... I was dizzy. I thought maybe I fell asleep and I dreamed that I was a child with Down syndrome waltzing in an endless forest where people drive 11 miles an hour and stop without any purpose other than random tasteless lesbianism. From where (zombies?) Appear from nowhere and (vampires?) Who (seduces?) Purebred citizens on their way to saving the world. Neither zombies nor vampires collide with each other. The only fight I remember is to take off her panties with that walrus Bonnie Giroux. Coo Coo ca FAT! All of them! Maybe it was because we looked at the widescreen stretched screen and were too lazy to change it to the original resolution, but it actually made it more fascinating ... In conclusion, my thesis about the final thought had more consistency, plot, development character, antagonism, the subject matter and then acting the whole movie. This made Bloodrayne look like Citizen F *** ING KANE
