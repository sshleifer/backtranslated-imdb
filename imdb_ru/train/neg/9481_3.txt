James Bishop (Matt Stasi) is sent to the "mental hospital" for medical residence by Dr. McCourt (Bruce Paynes). There he realizes that the “Ripper” kills many interns who give their souls to the devil in a cult promoted by Dr. McCort. This story is so absurd and stupid that it is impossible to write a resume. The conversations are so ridiculous, especially when Helen's character, blond fiance James Bishop arrives at the shelter, which is almost incredible that the writer had the courage to include them in the script. What about returning James to the hospital to bring in files of dead patients? And the cast, consisting of ham actors and actresses? Honestly, I do not know what or who is worse in this film: the script, the director or the cast. The correct answer is definitely all of them. I saw this movie on cable television and wonder how a producer can spend money on such garbage. This horror movie becomes very funny, given the absurdity of the plot. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): `Demônio '(` Devil')
