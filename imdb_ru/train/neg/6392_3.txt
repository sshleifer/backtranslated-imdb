Goremell Gordon Gordon Lewis fans should look elsewhere if they put together this film because its usual blood buckets are spilled around because there is a little bloodshed in this film. Instead, Lewis decides to try to tell a bizarre story, relying on special effects that could be doubled if the actors gave up their pockets for change in one day. Oddly enough, despite the cheapness and very bad behavior (especially from McCabe and Mitchell), the overall outlandishness of the plot holds attention everywhere. Imagine what this film looked like with a decent budget! In general, it strains the tastes of champagne on the beer budget.
