The time spent watching this movie was wasted. I do not like science fiction. I do not refuse any genre per se, since good work can be done in any genre. This film, however, is not a good job. I can not blame the visual effects (if they are not related to the makeup of aliens), and the special effects are impressive. The story was not horrible, for a Trakkish comic. But the visual effects were obviously where the interest / attention / money of all manufacturers went. The direction alternated between sluggish and confusing (there was absolutely no assurance as to who did what, with what and with whom, at least in one important moment). “Acting” was basically very bad. There was no reason for most of the line reads, except for the hint “So it was on the page, and the director told me that I had to be insane / sad / scared / anyone. Good, so it was an SF series pilot. ” Since when is this an excuse for corrected uncertainty in areas when it should be seen as essential to the dramatic environment? I'm surprised the pilot sold the show. Or is the money also in the hands of techies?
