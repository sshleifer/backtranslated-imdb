It's amazing to see how Nikhil Advani manages to attract people to the theater until the very day of the release. I mean ..... look at the cast here, the promotion is great, pretty good songs and trailers are fine. This makes it a full house on the first day, but only when people come and watch a movie, they understand that their money cannot be returned. The house is filled on the first day, the film will be released next week. <br /> <br /> This film, inspired by the film “Actually, Love”, as they say, did not cope with the whole cast. They tried to put big stars, but in the end they could not even achieve at least one average result. The stories are empty and stupid, so the audience cannot contact any of them. This is a big disappointment for all those who love big stars or, for that matter, Nihila Advani after his great success at Kal Ho Na Ho.
