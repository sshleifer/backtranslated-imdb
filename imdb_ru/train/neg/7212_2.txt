Why every horror director wants to imitate Exorcist, is a complete mystery for me, since William Friedkin's The Classic is a film with a re-evaluation and, in my opinion, not so tense or shocking. Yet here is another pure robbery, this time a Spanish, who shamelessly repeats the story of a young girl who is obsessed with pure evil and rebel against her own family. Paul Nashshi (who, I must admit, looks quite hot here) plays an honorary priest, who is approached by John Gibson, because his sister Leila’s behavior has changed dramatically since she met her new boyfriend. At first, the priest does not believe this, but when John's body is found with a twisted neck, Leila’s demonic behavior becomes more noticeable ... “Exorcism” is not only very unoriginal, but also unbearably boring! Here Nasha and director Juan Bosch had an open opportunity to make a scene from religious subjects, full of upheaval and bloodshed, and yet the result is a dull and bloodless drama that almost puts you to sleep! The last twenty minutes contain several atmospheric moments, albeit very stupid, and there are quite a lot of stylishly filmed female nudes and meanness. The absolute lack of a budget is not a real excuse, because Paul Our has already proved that he has enough imagination to make up for the lack of money. This is just a terrible movie, the end of the story. Other European looting "Excorcist" - "Antichrist" and "Behind the Door", and they also suck!
