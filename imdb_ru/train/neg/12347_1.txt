This is easily the worst film of Ridley Scott. Ridley Scott is a great director. But this film is a black mark in his career. Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen both absolutely do not fit into a super-aggressive film about a girl going to the army. Very stupid. And there is not a single scene that would be convincing anyway. Making such a movie is really not difficult. Everything that the team does could be the idea of ​​everyone. The authors also did not have much inspiration; many silly dialogues that didn’t make any sense at all; and some brainless actions. I highly recommend staying away from this garbage. I hope that many of the talented people involved in this project understand that this type of film does not deserve their attention, and that in the future they will work on more honorable and smarter films than this useless mess.
