Another cruel, wicked fantasy from Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven is a mystery: it is difficult to say whether he takes his dirty impulses seriously, with sardonic intent or acts in complete oblivion. He also seems completely ignorant of the fact that all the brilliant visual effects in the world (and they have some outstanding ones) cannot hide the negligence of history, dialogue and performance. Kevin Bacon plays a corrupt scholar who has discovered invisibility and uses it to bring himself to moral bankruptcy. Bacon is usually a handsome actor who sometimes shows his dark side (“Wild River”), trying to compensate for his boyish appearance; however, given the material, Bacon is not so hated to coerce. The other leaders are Elizabeth Shu and Josh Brolin, none of whom are gifted enough to make a strong impression on them, and who, being forced to engage in meaningless dialogue, are embarrassed. The culmination is the study of predominance, and distrust must really be suspended.
