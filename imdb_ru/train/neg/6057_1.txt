Can anyone prevent John Carpenter from permanently and deliberately destroying his reputation? How low can you fall? Looks like this man has lost his sense of dignity. <br /> <br /> This episode looks like it was taken by a filmmaker student, itâ€™s not even worth talking about THAT was bad, because it was just a borefest, directed by someone without talent as a director or without any kind of motivation ... <br /> <br /> Come on, Mr. Carpenter, please go right away with the rest of your self-esteem and stop pouring trash like that in a bad tradition from Escape from Los Angeles to Ghosts of Mars. <br /> <br /> Get drunk instead.
