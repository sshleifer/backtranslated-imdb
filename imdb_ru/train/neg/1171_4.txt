I can hardly believe that this inert, rude and poorly staged film was created by the director, whose other works I liked a lot. The experience of “Lady and the Duke” (and no other word except “endurance” will not work) left me in a foul mood, a state that is relieved only after reading the IMDb user comment from ali-112. Romer not only tried (successfully) to get us to see the world through the 18th century French genre art, but, as Ali pointed out, he demonstrated (at the cost of alienating his audience) the effects of both class consciousness and the revolution that she inspired through the eyes of an unattractive elite woman of its time. The director did something that was undoubtedly difficult, but I wondered if it was worth the effort it took for him to do it — or for us to look at the dismal results of his work.
