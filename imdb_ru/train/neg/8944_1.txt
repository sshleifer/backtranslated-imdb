I saw this film last year in Media class, and I must say that I really hated it. I was in the 10th year (and at the age of 15), so maybe it has something to do with it. But for the English language this year, in the 11th year, we had to read Animal Farm, also George Orwell. In addition to the fact that the book is based on the "Revolution", my opinion is that this is a terrible book, and I also hated it. <br /> <br /> But in 1984, I think it was the most disturbing film of mine. Iâ€™ve ever seen it, and I think that George Orwell is one of the most insane people who ever lived on this planet. . I apologize to everyone who loved his work, but I, unfortunately, no. The themes in the film were well depicted, but the way the entire film was put, and the events that took place in it, did not meet my standards. This is just my opinion, and I am sure that many other people really liked this film.
