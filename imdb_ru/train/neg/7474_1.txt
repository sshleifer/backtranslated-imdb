This program did not do this for me, although I am a fan of the genre. The main factor that disappointed me was that there was not a single scene in which the main character did not dominate. This made it a bit two-dimensional, and I gave up before the program was finished. <br /> <br /> I was hoping to leave my criticism there, as I am not a film critic, however, the guidelines for IMDb state that you should put in 10 comment lines. It reminded me of Hudson Hawke in how the main character is present in each scene, and I hope that the authors of this program will be able to use more variety to interact with the audience. I do not doubt the talent of any cast and film crew, just after seeing things like a telegram, I came to expect great things from the police drama.
