Spoiler Alert Well, I think this movie is probably the worst movie ever made. Probably in Ed Wood's style (without a heart). Lightning is terrible. The music is very bad (piano and org ... come on!). Acting ... well, no acting skills! <br /> <br /> There is a guy who actually goes into the woods to track down his missing wife and find time to have sex with a stranger. <br /> <br /> The killer is a fat, not scary clown who could not get away from the turtle! <br /> <br /> All the cast members are stupid, and the director easily inserts all the clich√©s of killer movies into the movie. <br /> <br /> The end is by far the stupidest ever made. Think about it: the guy (Ken Hebert), who possesses acting skills, is about the same as his composition (he is the brain behind this flop), invites a colleague and two friends to his cabin for the weekend and kills them. .. On Monday morning, he returns to his office, as if nothing is happening. <br /> <br /> The tragedy is that Mr. Hebert is trying to make us believe that this is a family business that lasts a whole generation (his uncle is a clown's killer) <br /> <br /> So, of course, the cops will not interrogate him after his colleague disappeared ... <br /> <br /> ALL. <br /> <br />
