THE CHOKE (aka AX in the UK) is a slasher, supposedly created as a DVD movie. I say “presumably” because the title of the film does not have the letter “V” in brackets, which indicates that it was created for a DVD movie (even if it looks like). <br /> <br /> The plot is simple the band holds a concert at the former meat factory, and they are killed one by one. <br /> <br /> I think the majority will agree that the film will never be a masterpiece, but this does not justify the shortcomings. Here it is. Even direct DVD movies, such as BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE (which has a very low IMDb rating), have many redeeming qualities and are sometimes considered one of the so-called “so bad, they are good” films. However, THE CHOKE is far from a serious slasher (for example, HALLOWEEN) or the film “so bad it is good” (for example, “Killing a nail”). <br /> <br /> The film really begins well with the character killed with a drill. The effects of blood were very gentle, but understandable, given the very low budget. But, from now on, everything goes down. <br /> <br /> There are so many flaws in the PSC that I could talk about them all day. But a few obvious ones stand out, and I will go to them. <br /> <br /> The aforementioned concert, which the band holds, seems to start with the presence of about 50 people, but after the music stops, it seems that only about 8 people are left (and yet they should all be locked up! ). <br /> <br /> Characters in this film are not at all pretty. Most of the band members are aggressive assholes or just plain weird. No one cares about what happens to them, and even their supposed friends forget about them when they are sent. The highlight of the film is the presence of a homeless person who seems to view the meat factory as a kind of church (seriously!). He utters some really funny lines for no apparent reason. But, unfortunately, even his presence cannot save the film. <br /> <br /> Too many scenes where people walk and talk without any characteristic. About 65 minutes of the film is about how the characters walk and talk. Characters disappear for a long time without explanation. Like other DVD movies such as CROCODILE and GRIM WEEKEND, the characters spend a lot of time cursing aggressively at each other, without any provocation. There are many supernatural surges (mostly from male characters), and one of them almost leads to full-scale combat. In fact, it can be said that the format looks like this: characters walk - killings happen - characters walk - killings happen. Did you understand. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is terrible, and it seems that several lines are pronounced without the use of an f-word. Perhaps it should have been funny, but this is just sad. And more importantly, we all saw how this was done a thousand times earlier (as a rule, with much greater effect). <br /> <br /> The film is completely without any expectation. The corpses are the only evidence that the characters are in danger. Maniac runs freely, and the characters behave like real morons. They make a small attempt to leave the factory or find a weapon to protect themselves. And most of the time, they don’t even pretend to be scared. <br /> <br /> In the same vein as in the MASSACRATING ROTATION, the killer is not noticed at the time when the murders are committed (with the exception of the final murder, when the identity of the killer is revealed). A random weapon appears out of nowhere to kill the victim in question. No one saw the haunting characters at any time. In DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, it made the movie funny (unintentionally, of course), but here it’s not at all funny. <br /> <br /> And as another reviewer noted, the soundtrack includes music that is very bad, even for those who love punk rock. Separately, look awkward dancing under it. The score (in the end, there is no music at the beginning!) It consists of a group of Sugarbabe imitators who sing a very bad song that is completely unrelated to the film. <br /> <br /> Don't get it wrong done in this review. This reviewer likes bad movies (such as “MASSACRES ON THE NAILS” and “MASSACKER OF THE BACHLOR PARTY”), as well as classics (for example, “HALLOUIN” and “Friday the 13th”). But it seems that CHOKE tried too hard to fit into one of these categories, not fitting into any of them. And even though the movies go straight to DVD, this is a bad effort. <br /> <br /> The good news is that the film contains pretty good murder scenes. But when the surviving characters do not take the situation seriously, these scenes quickly lose their significance, as the intensity they provide disappears from oblivion. <br /> <br /> Fans of traditional slashers of the 1980s should take steps to avoid this film. And fans of the classics, such as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH, should do everything possible to avoid it!
