For me, this may seem a bit harsh, but unfortunately, so far in his directorial career, this is true. Just see what he has done so far. They barely overcome the mark of 3 stars. <br /> <br /> Why did I watch this movie? 2 reasons. Lucy Lawless and Star of Heroes Greg Grunberg. Lucy was outstanding in this film, her performance carries the entire movie. I hope that she will get a “blockbuster” and go to the big leagues of actors, she clearly has the skills. Greg was not very impressive, the typical television acting style. <br /> <br /> The film is strangely called horror. The only "horror" - short memories, and they last a maximum of 2-5 seconds with a small amount of blood in them. Personally, I would rather call it “drama / thriller”. <br /> <br /> But no matter how interesting this story is, poor direction, editing and acting (from Lucy) destroy it. You have no real connection with the actors, which is very important in a story like this. You just sit and watch, not feeling anything. It's like watching a bad television soap ... in fact, I think that a television soap would be more interesting. <br /> <br /> My advice: stay away from this movie ... or better yet, just stay away from everything Michael Hurst is associated with.
