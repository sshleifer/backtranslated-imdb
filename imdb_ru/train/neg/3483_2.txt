Surviving Christmas (2004) Ben Affleck, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Catherine O'Hara, Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, Jennifer Morrison, Udo Cyrus, D: Mike Mitchell. Expelled by his girlfriend, desperate yuppie does not want to be alone for Christmas, so he decides to return to his childhood home, imposing a dysfunctional family that now lives there, and bribes them to impersonate his family. Affleck's unpleasant and one-dimensional view, which mostly acts with a screaming smile, makes his character look like a mentally unstable bastard, but Gandolfini and O'Hara breathe life into this mess. Even for a farce, his stupidity is clumsy, it makes little sense from scene to scene, and his sentimental messages are as false as Affleck's smile. 91 min., Rating PG-13. * Â½
