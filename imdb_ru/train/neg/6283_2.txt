What an incredible fall for Sean Ellis. <br /> <br /> You have gathered a bunch of your friends at home, they are all upset about the subsequent work of Sean Ellis. You have a vague idea of ​​the plot, there are no spoilers that could kill the fun, very high expectations. <br /> <br /> Late night, the perfect atmosphere for a movie of this type. <br /> <br /> It takes 15 minutes, and you start telling yourself that he has to pick up the phone, and at 25 minutes you start wondering if you should just go to sleep and save it at another time when you can completely evaluate the expected non-existent thin touches. In half an hour you realize that half of your bloated audience is already asleep, and call it during the day. <br /> <br /> A few days later, when you exhausted all the other materials to see, you would return to this, this time in the middle of the day, hoping that your mood would not let you fall asleep this time. After 10 minutes, you find yourself moving quickly along incredibly long intermediate transitions and images. Any other material that I would have already refused, but there is a cashback and its legacy. But this legacy can carry you for so long, this is a new level of boring filmmaking, imagine a short story extended to the novel with descriptions, that's what it is. <br /> <br /> A decent cast is wasted, there is no cinematography that leaves you in awe, like a cashback. There are films that annoy you, there are films that lack certain aspects, or are simply ridiculous, unfortunately, this is just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Final words, stay away.
