This show offers interesting places as fast as a travel channel. This is declared as a reality, but in fact it is a pure soap opera prime time. He tries to use exotic locales as a facade to attract people to a fake competition, and then continues to attract viewers to the participants' soap opera style. <br /> <br /> He also borrowed from the early pioneer of the CBS game show Beat The Clock - inventing situations for its members to try and overcome. Then it rewards the winner's money. If they can animate it with a little interaction between the characters, even better. While the format of the game is in slow motion compared to Beat The Clock, the real achievement of this series is to avoid reality. <br /> <br /> This show contains elements of several successful past programs. The reality of television is unlikely, but if you hooked participants, locale or competition, this is your cup of tea. If not, then this whole series, as I said, is slobbering gravy. This is another show hiding behind a reality TV label that became the trend from which it started in 2000. <br /> <br /> This is a smooth and high-quality production, so it can last for some time. After all, doing this work on Gilligan Island, Green Acres, Beverly Hillbillis and Brady Bunch. It simply does not hire professional actors. The level of intelligence is about the same.
