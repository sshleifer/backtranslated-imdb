Incredibly awful movie. I watched some of this on T.V. recently. My jaw dropped as I watched the horribly conceived plot and listened to the stunning chatter. Not a single line from the master of one-liners could come close to creating something resembling a chuckle. It was so bad that I wanted to exhale Rodney Dangerfield's body, slap him and shout: “How could you?” I know that many films were made in a hurry, hoping to earn on the popularity of this or that actor or theme. But please, Hollywood, show some respect for your audience. It's sad and scary that people had to pay to see such a prank. The bottom of the sump, even on Sunday midday television standards.
