This film has left me forever impressed. I watched him as a freshman in high school and was at home alone that night. I think I lost all respect for Robert Reed as an actor who was a big fan of "Brady Bunch." I also thought that the role of Chuck Connor was horrible and angry. However, this film had such an impact on me that now I am a volunteer in the women's state prison, I study the Bible and church services and try to change the lives of women, one at a time. What fascinates me is the fact that so few people watched this movie. None of my friends watched it, and my family still does not know when I discuss this film because they have not seen it.
