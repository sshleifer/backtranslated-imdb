with this attempt by the ABC family to hit the blockbuster "cheaper by a dozen" comes the disgusting number of banal dialogues, small storylines and stupid returns. With two good actors among many who so desire, this film was a big disappointment. This is the same Hollywood bastard of an already bad conspiracy. Then, because they needed a lot of actors, that meant they were likely to be more lenient. So acting was not five-star. The plot moved pretty quickly, and the turns were bad and had terrible deadlines. The combination of characters and the "final relationship" was also too soft and clich√© for me. Take care and rent something better.
