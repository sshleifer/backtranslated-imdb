I watched this movie in DVD format. My copy may have been damaged, but I was disappointed by the lack of a menu screen for the DVD. I will say that my original reason for watching this movie was Claire Forlani. While it is funny to watch, I feel that she did not meet my expectations, which I still found in her other films. In fact, I was equally happy to see Arkin in a humorous performance. Two other actors with whom I was not well acquainted, so I can not compare their performance, but they were also quite pleasant. Acting is the only nice quality of this film, in my opinion. The plot line, while some might say, is a little convincing, had no direction. I feel that the main problem is connected with the script, and not with the direction of this film. If you like any of these actors sufficiently, then I recommend this film, but otherwise leave it alone.
