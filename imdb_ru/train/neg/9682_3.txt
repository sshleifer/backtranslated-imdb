To overcome the death of his wife, an elderly man does what anyone in his position naturally does (at least in Peter Greenawayâ€™s film): he and his son live in their home with eight and a half (one has no legs) women embark on a sexual odyssey. This is a film about Greenaway, in which there is a lot of pretentious and uninteresting chatter and, of course, unnecessary male nudity. In fact, father and son share a bed, sleeping in the nude. Gross. In addition, who wants to see the old man completely frontal? For those who are not in the homo-erotic scene, one of the women likes to do nasty with horses. There is no story - just a random collection of boring scenes.
