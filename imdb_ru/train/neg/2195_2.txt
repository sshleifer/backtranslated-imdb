“The Brain That Will Not Die” is one terrible piece of film that stinks from the opening credits. He has all the classic signs of bad behavior: an incredible storyline, terrible game, low-quality scenery and lighting. The plot is as follows: when the doctor and his bride have an accident, she is beheaded, he lifts her head and takes to his laboratory, where he puts her head in a saucepan with some special liquid that keeps her alive. I bet about Virgnina Lit, who played with her head in a frying pan, was forced to spend a lot of inconvenient time, putting this pan on her neck and squatting under the table. In any case, the doctor then tries to find her a new body and hires two strippers so she can choose one to get a new body. Bad through, so bad, it was torn to pieces at Mystery Science Theater 3000.
