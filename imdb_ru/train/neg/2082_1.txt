What a waste of time and money! My hubby and I watched this movie - after watching the previews and thought that this “could be funny”. WRONG! This film lasts about 90 minutes. The actors got into a poorly written script and could not get out. The jokes are weak and tired, and even the absence of Wilson’s bare back can help in any part of this film. Special effects ..... no. I almost expected to see the wires and wires holding the Mind in its flying scenes. And when the effects, apparently, could not master the scene of a flight or a battle of superheroes with an accelerating bullet, they covered everything around with a swirling swirl of a blurred screen - which hid terrible effects pretty well. Wilson's assistant was an unpersuasive excuse for a man, and Wilson had no chemistry with either Uma or his office colleague. Sex scenes were not sexy, and funny - not funny. I guess I just expected too much from these actors. None of the characters was truly responsive, so I didn’t care about any of them. The only memorable performances were the kids who played Bedlam and the G-Girl as a teenager — at least they had some kind of chemistry. In general, a film about super stinko - I would not even recommend it as a rental - it is still a waste of money!
