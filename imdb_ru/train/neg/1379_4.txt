Monica Mitchell's satire of show business has a bit of laughter and some deliberate violence. I would not say soaked in blood; but there is an insult and injury. Max Matteo (John Cassini) is a characteristic actor who has an unusual adaptable presence on the screen, but he has a terrible record of choice for the parts he follows. There is always a producer's nephew or a seemingly trivial reason for not getting the role he is looking for. Well, the best thing to do is get rid of competitors ... Max becomes obsessed with such thoughts. A rewarding career is just punch, push and punch. Other actors: Rene Rivera, Molly Parker, Jennifer Beals, Frank Cassini and cameos Eric Roberts and Sandra Oh. Well, is this show business ... or is it?
