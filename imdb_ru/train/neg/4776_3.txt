I had to write a review of this film after reading another commentary that this is the best film by Sidney Poitier. Poitier has just returned from a ten-year break in the cinema, and he is clearly squeaky here. 11 of his films are mentioned on Wikipedia, and they do not include it. 5 of his films hit the list of the top 100 AFI films, not counting this. Berenguer and Poitiers, Rub√© and the city infantryman intend to hunt down a dangerous psychopath before he crosses the border with Canada. Some of the comedy attempts in this film are clearly failing, and the connection between Berenger and Poitiers was very attractive and awkward (not supported by a completely tasteless script). Kirstie Ellie (as a hostage) was underestimated and almost completely ignored when she was on the screen. Some attempt is made to the unknown, for example, when you have to try to guess which of the 5 people on fishing is the killer (they are all villains with a typical composition). I understand that this is a complete appeal to most fans. I guessed who it was, and I did not try very hard. <br /> <br /> If you're a Berenguer fan, watch Sniper (1993), you'll even see how Billy Zane pompously works with his stuff. This is much better. In general, I would give Shoot to Kill 3/10. It is not bold, and it is too simple for me
