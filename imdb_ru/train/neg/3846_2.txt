It is assumed that the W. Somerset Maugham's Human Bondage is a classic of the English language. If so, then much should be missed in the movie version here. Philip (Leslie Howard )’s attraction to Mildred (Bette Davis) is so inexplicable that the script looks like a retelling of the relationship after a breakup from a human perspective. As a family lawyer, I heard many such stories; the man portrays himself noble and always right, and the woman hellion, who had no other purpose than to exploit the man. <br /> <br /> Indeed, unless someone wants to make fun of the filmmaker’s social assumptions, this is an awkward movie to watch. Phillip even indulges Mildred when she gives birth to a child of indefinite paternity, but the real high point comes when Philip allows Mildred - furious and now questionable sanity - to run freely around his apartment, with predictable results. Bette Davis was attractive for about five years of her life, but this period did not occur here. In fact, by the end of the film, she is very similar to the character of Baby Jane, who will play thirty years later. <br /> <br /> I note that the character of Howard is always immaculately dressed and well-groomed. This tells me that Philip craves respectability of the middle class. Someone like this could not run away from a woman with a Cockney accent fast enough. Phillip for most of the film is a student; such a person would be more believable if he were younger and had disheveled looks that talk about low income and low self-esteem, which often accompanies the student status - English Raskolnikov, as it will. And he balanced it, allowing Mildred a little charm.
