What else can you say about this film, besides the fact that it is just awful. Tina Louise and Adam West - the reasons why it is worth seeing, but that's all, but their talents are wasted in this junk. some scenes of Adam, for example, when he is running, because you cannot see his face. If Adam was confused by what is in the Zombie Nightmare, think what he must have felt when he appeared in it ??? If it was before or after, I'm not sure, but, nevertheless, Zombie Nightmare is a classic (first read the version of Mystery Science Theater 3000), compared to this. The gang is very annoying and replays some of the actors. Robbery "Wild" with Marlon Brando in the lead role, of course. Tina looks amazing. Hope she and Adam got a good salary !! Pass!
