Much has been written about Purple Rain, the seemingly "indispensable" bio-film of a musician, but I am here to tell you that the film does not deserve high praise. <br /> <br /> First of all, let's get one thing, Prince is a great musician, and music is an area where purple rain is superior. Even the score is fascinating, and if it were filmed exclusively as a concert film, it would be a great experience, unfortunately, it is not, and therefore the film has some problems. <br /> <br /> First of all, this is a terrible acting / writing, the character of Prince “Kid” is supposed to come off as some type of mysterious loners from a few words, unfortunately, it only comes off as trite and incensere. A good lonely character should have at least some talkative moments, unfortunately, Prince’s character rarely has a few words of dialogue in the film, and it’s hard to believe that he will get a girl that way. Here everything seems a bit strange, and it is a shame, because you can say that this is a character who is in a terrible conflict and lives a very difficult life, but we are never allowed to enter it. <br /> <br /> An amazing aspect of this film is how much of this happens at the concert. The life of Prince and Morris seems to fade into the background from the performances presented here, which I think makes sense from a business point of view, but it’s tiring to have a two-hour film where, apparently, half of it happens on stage, especially when hero get pushed over for that. <br /> <br /> So let's summarize: this is not a very good movie.
