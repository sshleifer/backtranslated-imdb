Yes, I know that I am one of the few people who want to trample this film into the dust of oblivion. Let me tell you why I feel this way. In truth, if it were advertised as a film “Zombies” or the like, I would like it. But now I am completely speechless. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ... Although I'm not sure what to spoil * Let's start with the first HUGE flaw. If I didn’t know that the film is called “Darkness is a version of VAMPIRE,” and if I hadn’t seen the episodes where some people seem to suck blood, I wouldn’t see a connection with vampires. I mean, FANGLESS ???? Give me a break !!! <br /> <br /> Second bad moment: what about Metal? It seems that all young people, but mostly the so-called "vampires", are addicted to different types of metal, judging for the most part by their shirts! Don't get me wrong, I've been doing more extreme forms of music for almost 15 years, but nobody is going to scare me by showing me some ridiculous teenagers in Iron Maiden (from all groups !!!) T-shirts run, pretending to be vampires! “Pathetics” is the only word I can use here. <br /> <br /> Third weakness: actors. Wait a minute. What are the actors ?! You mean the director's wooden friends! Words would be a waste here. <br /> <br /> Yes, well, the film is very terrible, but what's the difference? It would be a strong and pleasant moment if the "brilliant" director did not decide to create an ARTIFICIAL theme about vampires in this film. I wanted to see vampires, but some stupid-looking kids looked at me and wanted to use my baseball bat. The creators of the film were supposed to simply advertise the film with the words “B-class cheap horror without a plot, but with a lot of blood” !!! <br /> <br /> This film is blasphemy against the whole concept of vampirism. And it makes me sick.
