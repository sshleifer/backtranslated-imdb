It never ceases to amaze me how you can take a great actor and waste it in such a film. Robert De Niro is one of the best Hollywood stars of all time, but even he could not save this film. In fact, his character is almost the same as the one he played in Cape Fear, which was actually pretty good, but I can't bear it when the actors do the same game for more than one the movie. I believe it is aging, and this is the case. <br /> <br /> This movie is not surprising, but the story has been told a million times earlier. Wesley Snipes is your typical baseball player, and his vanity is evident in his characteristics. De Niro plays an obsessive fan, but his role in this film is less than entertaining. <br /> <br /> However, since De Niro is in this film, it makes a draw if you are a fan (not a pun)) who sees everything he does, no matter how bad. But to see De Niro at its best, look at Midnight Run, Goodfella, or Police, or even go back and see Taxi Driver or Godfather II. Do not waste your time on this nonsense. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3/10
