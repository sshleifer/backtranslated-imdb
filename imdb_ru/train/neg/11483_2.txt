I was completely thrilled to see this movie. I waited a year to get it cleared here in New Zealand. I shouldn’t strain myself so much because it was so disappointing and without a doubt Clark’s worst movie. There are so many bad things in this movie. First, some of the actors are great, notably Nick Stahl as The Hooligan and a girl with curly brown hair (I can't remember her name), but much of it was so unapproachable and incredibly incredible, especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He is now a veteran of Clarke’s films, and he was so brilliant in Children, but in The Hooligan he puts his lines with such solemnity that he turns his scenes into a parody practically. The script seemed to be written by a first year student. No, I'm sorry, a high school student ... one who has never seen a movie before. And I could not understand the intentions of Clark. He tried to point out the senselessness of the existence of these children? Of course, damn it, it didn’t stop him from falling into a damn good perversion. I'm not a prude, but I didn’t need to see teenage breasts and buttocks every 5 minutes. I still claim that Clark's best film is "Another Day in Paradise." This is fantastic, and I do not think it will ever be higher.
