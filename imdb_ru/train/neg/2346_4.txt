I first saw this movie not too long on the TCM series "Essentials". The eye of the looking cliché has never been more appropriate. This viewer saw little value in this. I was puzzled by the endless attractiveness Lucy (Lauren Bacall) had. Of course, Ms. Bacall was a beautiful woman, but in this film her character looks more thought than attractive. I think people like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley will rather ignore Lucy than fall into her instant fascination. In defense of Bacall, this film was shot during Humphrey Bogart’s last illness, and the weight of his deteriorating health could have affected her performance. Of course, part of this blushing on the part of Lucy was to oppose her with the depraved Marily, who Dorothy Malone played with the hilt and beyond. The scene where she participates in a wildly sensual dance while her father wearily walks the stairs to a fatal heart attack is undoubtedly the best scene in the film. Malone’s play eclipses everything else, although Jasper Hadley’s tiredness from the disappointing behavior of his two children is brilliantly portrayed by Robert Keith. In general, however, I must say that I am simply not a big fan of melodrama. The cartoonish behavior of the characters makes the story too implausible for my tastes.
