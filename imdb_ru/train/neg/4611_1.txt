I believe that Jack's great empathic ability makes him a powerful performer, as he is, but empathy, like all things, has a price — when he is surrounded by mediocrity, he instinctively lowers the standard and becomes one with it. He is a joke, like a hired assassin of a mafia (also because he doesn’t play a role for anything, he is so extroverted), and just grazing doesn’t let him fool himself. Kathleen Turner had a long career, just being tall and blond, because her acting skills are limited to what she does with her eyes, when she widely reveals them, that she is sooooo damn sexy and Angelica Houston is absolutely the same. (provided interesting) in everything, like Robert Loggia. <br /> <br /> The film is an unsuccessful draft (and this will be the only mention of the rag, which they call the script) of the gangster film, with the cast, who was probably only interested in getting to the party faster ( they must have gathered the party elite in this). What, they shot him for 1 day? Because it will be the only explanation.
