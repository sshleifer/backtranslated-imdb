I am usually disappointed with online movies. Even films that attract famous actors are usually destroyed by TV people. However, this is the worst of the worst. The scenario is weak, and the actions, especially Tracy Pollan, are disgusting. I wandered off to watch my children's school plays, and they began to play better. Pollan behaves as if she is reading the script, as she says. When she tries to express fear, anger, or grief, it is extremely empty. Due to the overall quality of the products, it was difficult for me to take this seriously. If you decide to dare, just be prepared for great disappointment. Scary things won't scare you, sad things won't make you sad, romance won't make you feel warm and indistinct, and you will probably be as excited as I am to see the end. “Die first” talks a lot about this movie.
