“This story is dedicated to women,” says the preface, “who have been fighting for their rights since Adam and Eve established a flip sheet system.” When Politics was filmed, the Nineteenth Amendment, which guarantees women the right to vote, was only ten years old. And the film tells about how women gain political power as an electoral group. Propaganda of the ban and the closure of the speeches were a major issue for women at the time. <br /> <br /> The good-natured Marie Dressler (as Hattie Burns) becomes politically active after a young woman is shot and killed. Speakeasy. She wants the liquor dealers to be closed; and is called to the mayor, giving a powerful speech at the women's rally. Ms. Dressler is supported by her tenants, best friend Polly Moran (like Ivy Higgins) and her stuttering husband Rosco Ates (like Peter Higgins). Dessler's run-through to the Mayor of Lake City attracts the resistance of men in the city; therefore, Dressler orders women to go on strike, denying them “everything” in the “living room, bedroom and bathroom”. <br /> <br /> The movie sounds much better than it turned out. Honestly, humor is not too good; and it shows some unfunny and moderately offensive situations (“You look like the Queen of Madame” refers to the characters of Amos and Andy). And the mix of shooting and farce is not very good, this time. Producers could consider making the film more dramatic, focusing exclusively on Dressler and the characters played by William Bakewell (as Benny Emerson) and Karen Morley (as Myrtle Burns). <br /> <br /> **** Politics (7 / 25/31) Charles Racener ~ Marie Dressler, Polly Moran, Rosco Ates
