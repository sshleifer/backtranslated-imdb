I'm afraid this version is pretty tasteless. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books, and it has been since childhood, but William Hurt’s weary, catchy acting style is not suitable for Edward Rochester’s bold passion and poor Charlotte Gainsbrough, who looks like a bored, irritable teenager who has dental braces! I also cannot believe that at the end of the book they excluded a magnificent scene for proposing marriage to Edward, one of the most exciting moments in literature. I really appreciate that they finally used such a young, simple woman to play Jane, a character who is supposed to be 18 years old, but if you want to see a version that comes closer to the personalities and passions of the novel, please see the 70s Version with George S. Scott and Suzanne York. York was too old, tall and cute to play Jane, but no one touched the character of Rochester like Scott.
