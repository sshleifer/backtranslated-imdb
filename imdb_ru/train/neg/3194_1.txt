I can not believe that this film was shot recently, in 1984. It has a ridiculous game, not to mention one of the most stupid scenes in the history. Who could have asked the fat Texas sheriff Joe Don Baker to accompany the Italian, whom he illegally arrested in Mexico, back to Italy? Not to mention the fact that the title of the film doesnâ€™t really mean anything about it - in fact, it is about the same general as I can imagine, as the name for the imitative action / police movie. <br /> <br /> I'm glad that I only saw this on MST3K with Mike and the bots as a shield. They note the similarity of the female leash with Elaine from Seinfeld ("None of them are spongy") and relentlessly reef on the weight of Baker. This film is probably no worse than Mitchell, but Baker's reputation here definitely precedes him: when his title appears at the beginning of the film, Tom says: "I wish I could be illiterate so that I would not have to read it." ".
