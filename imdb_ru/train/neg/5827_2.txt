Other reviewers do not get the impression that this film stinks because it is ambiguous in relation to the Japanese whaling industry (which is morally no worse than meat trade in the US or Scottish haggis), it stinks because it is pretentious. that contemporary art is gaining notoriety. However, there are some amazing images, but there are amazing images on the average bus ride if you use your imagination, so this is not a reason to go and see this nonsense. What happens in the film is very slow and often accompanied by a soundtrack that looks like a gutted cat, and then, as soon as you think it is finished, it begins again. I saw it in porn movies in Rome, which was hired for the weekend to show Barneyâ€™s film, which is a wonderful and clever way to bring back what was once a local ruin from dirty old men-in-the-MACS brigade, but to be honest, fashionable young things and a little bit older fans of Bjork, stroking a beard, would be much more fun for everyone if they just showed one of the porn!
