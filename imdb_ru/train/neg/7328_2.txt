I see many people like this movie. For me it was a film shot with the right to write 101, and this person failed a lesson. Since Lindsay Price showed the video, until the very end the film was very predictable. I kept watching to see if it would go somewhere. <br /> <br /> First we have a young widowed father. Movies / TV cliché No. 1 always kill the parent parent if the child is a girl or a brood of boys, so a single father may pass out from his dead wife and appear completely unconscious, taking care of the children. Starting from my 3 sons to 2 1/2 dads These films are usually dramas, and comedies are television shows. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 2 When an assertive woman has a video camera in her hands, she will play a big role in the film. And they will always have solutions, or even if this person is dizzy <br /> <br /> Cliche number 3. If a person who is in danger is a foreigner, he must be of Latin American origin. And they must be illegal. Apparently, there are no legal Latin Americans or illegal European Europeans, unless an element of the IRA is involved. <br /> <br /> Cliche No. 4 The mentioned Hispanic must be highly educated in his home country. In this case, he was a professor who earned 200 per month. And the aforementioned highly educated Latin American should now behave as if he now has no brains in his head, and let the blow to the head from the air work. <br /> <br /> Cliche # 5 The crime committed by a man was not really a crime, but an accident. But since in this case he lost all the feeling that he had when he crossed the border, he now behaves like a blind idiot and now puts his own daughter in danger, dragging her in a fruitless search to the border with the idiot's side. kick. <br /> <br /> Cliche # 6 No one ever runs around a bully running from crime, but some poor little cute child. This is because the parents of the child must play a large role in the film, and because the person who accidentally killed the child may have a ridiculous relationship with the parents. <br /> <br /> Cliche number 7 Tell me one movie in which one cop is not an evil vet, and they are paired with a newcomer. Even if they are homicide detectives who must be the most experienced police officers in the police. Sev7n and Copy cat and law and order come to mind immediately. And the vet, even though the rough outside has a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> Cliche number 8 Come on and collect some unemployed soap stars. Now I like Lindsay Price. But Susan Haskell IMO can't get out of the paper bag, and when she was at Marty Bridge, he swung from right to left every time she opened her mouth. It uses me to get sick of the sea. Perhaps now she is better attached to the earth, but she still cannot act. <br /> <br /> The film could have been more insightful if there were no clichés in it. I don’t think the film should be expensive or mental to be good. But it was just bad. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER **** Now I'm not going to spoil the final. Oh, damn it, I will do it, because I feel that humanity will not serve well in order to allow a person to waste time, which he will never return, looking at this film. It includes cliché No. 6 and No. 7. If a person has never seen a movie before you should have seen what will happen. The father makes an even more stupid mistake by running away from the police at the end, and he is shot dead by an enraged veteran who is suddenly very upset. You would think that she thought the poor fellow was innocent throughout the entire film, and she shot him by mistake. When she did not. Now about the little girl that her father brought with him. Guess what happened to her? From time to time, she ends up living with a family whose child was killed by her father !! Come on! You all knew that this would happen because she is a replacement child !! That is why she did not go live with the character Lindey Pryce. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, this film was offensive. Because there were so many ways that this film could explore and destroy, but he chose the cliché. Two stars for two stars, a little girl who, in my opinion, was very good, and Lindsay Price, whose character was annoying, but she did everything she could with her. My advice is to take a vise and squeeze their head instead of looking at this dirt.
