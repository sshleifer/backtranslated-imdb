Once again, Disney manages to make a children's film that completely ignores his background. About the only thing that is common with this and the original cartoons of the Gadget are the names. The most egregious mistakes are the characters - Penny does not have her book, the Brain was turned from a character into a bizarre support, Dr. Kogt is more like a show-off than an evil villain, etc., But there are others. The horrors begin from the first minutes of the film - a gadget as a guard named John Brown does not help to identify him as a classic inspector of the Gadget. And right at the beginning we see Disney’s blatant attempt to turn every story into a romance between a man and a woman - they represent Brenda, who only makes this film Disney-compatible. Add to this the fact that Claw, seen in this film, and the classic Dr. Claw are almost diagonally opposed, and you will see that this will be far from the original storyline. What could help is to improve the storyline, but, as you may have guessed, Disney also failed. The whole movie is just Nut, which behaves stupidly for the sake of stupidity and craves for Brands. As if to add insult to the wound, Disney presented a “new” mobile gadget - it does not look at all, does not function and does not look like an old mobile gadget, it is just a canonical figure of “comic relief”. Disney apparently acknowledged that the Gadget cartoons were a comedy, so they also made the film a comedy, but they took out all the clever jokes (like an assignment paper that exploded on the chief's face) and replaced them with the Gadget being an idiot, Gadgetmobile, being a wise donkey, and "Claw" brag. Someone should tell Disney that the “children's film” does not imply “no brain use at all”. The gadget should be aimed at children 10-12 years old, and not at children 10-12 months, like this film. Whatever the film, this is NOT, I repeat, NO, the real Inspector Gadget. Because I love the old gadget, I hate it.
