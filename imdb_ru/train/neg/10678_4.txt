This film looked good - good cast, evergreen theme and explosive discovery. It went down from there. Why was this shot with a handheld camera? Shakes, trembles, partially removes scenes and simply confuses the viewer. Really bad choice. As if this were not enough, the worst editing in memory involves viewing with drugs â€” mandatory if you want any pleasure from it. And then it commits the worst of all sins. By taking the viewer down through all sorts of incredible and implausible scenarios to the point of fatigue, they give up loans without revealing the denouement - ending - winning - how the hell was the motive? How can you expect success by creating thrillers without a finale? Doh This film had a promising promise, and we ended up making a face plant in the mud. What a waste of effort. The poor efforts of the writer and director.
