I'm sorry to say that it was one of the worst films I have ever seen. Although visually fascinating (for example, the use of color was absolutely stunning), it was rather boring and disturbing (see Father / Son Incest). <br /> <br /> Moreover, the music is completely absent, and if you think about these wonderful soundtracks by Michael Nyman (who wrote the soundtracks for most of Greenwayâ€™s films), then you can imagine how important this is. <br /> <br />
