The basic formula for the original series was; take someone, get the audience to love them, then put them in mortal danger. This formula worked for 32 episodes made between 1964-68. <br /> <br /> Now we jump ahead 40 years to 2004. We meet with Alan Tracy, a somewhat less eager student from college, with his friend Fermat, a young know-it-all. , Lady Penelope takes them in her pink Ford Thunderbird to the paradise island, where the Tracy family lives, for school holidays. Almost immediately, they are left in the care of Kirano and his daughter Tin-Ting, while the adults go to rescue John from Thunderbird 5, which was damaged by a staged accident. This is all part of Hood’s plan to seize the island of Tracy so that he can steal the Thunderbird machines ... <br /> <br /> ?? To rob a bank! <br /> <br /> Yes. The plot is as soft as this one! <br /> <br /> The dialogue is banal, the action is more wooden than that of the (fiberglass) puppets, effects, anything other than special and the score of Hans Zimmer ??? What was a little about the glorious theme of Barry Gray shone through Zimmer’s dim orchestration. The rest of the bill was highly forgotten. In fact, part of the bill was radioed next week and did not recognize it! I did not even bother to remain a witness to the mediocre efforts of Basted with the ultimate names. <br /> <br /> Honestly, Ron Cook worked well, like Parker, he and Sophia Miles, since Penelope seemed to have been wasted. With the right material, they could show traffic jams. The work of CGI was what I would call advanced - 5 years ago. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of the main craft were simply wrong; The original production models, at least, moved as if they had mass. <br /> <br /> Another sore point: the entire production consisted of one long set of products, from each vehicle produced by Ford to the entire contents. Tracy Freezer, created by Ben & Jerry's. <br /> <br /> My son (9 years old) liked the film, but this cross between Spy Kids and Clockstoppers, aimed directly at his age group, did not add anything to the legend of Thunderbirds. When Star Trek got on the big screen in 1979 with “Kinofilm”, a new life was breathed into the franchise, which lasted for about 20 years. With this film, Frakes missed a great opportunity to do the same with the Thunderbirds franchise. <br /> <br /> I predict that this film, like The Avengers and the Holy One before it, will plunge into darkness. for 6 months, leaving the original series in its "classic" status.
