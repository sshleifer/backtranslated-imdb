I absolutely do not see what is funny in this film. It seems, humor is intended for corpses. It is slow. The story is too simple to be true. Characters do not cause much sympathy, with the exception of a few non-important characters. Nothing surprising happens. What did the authors of this script think? â€œOooh, funny! Let's make some old woman high on the pot! Let's make them ... giggle! Let's make them ... act like little children! This film has annoyed me the most of all the films I've seen in the past five years.
