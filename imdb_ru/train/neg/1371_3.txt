I can not understand how someone can get a budget for a film so bad. It looks like the TV channel desperately needs everything. They are buried under a pile of snow, electricity is constantly flashing, but magically the background light remains constant. Where does all this (fake) light come from? This, and all these stupid quarrels between the characters. They seem to be more interested in complaining to each other than trying to think of ways to survive. He tries to create a sense of emergency, and people help. But due to the fact that this is bad direction and acting, you will not be able to correct this mistake, sorry. I join the negative feedback and I agree that this is one of the worst films ever.
