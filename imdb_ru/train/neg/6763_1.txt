God, what a terrible thing! Oliver Stone probably wanted to experiment or something else (see here the awful use of music and pictures), but what really? Everything that stands for “Natural Born Killers” seems to be a “smart” look at how the media can turn into complete rubbish, but unfortunately the film turns into rubbish itself. Please, Mr. Stone, the next time you want to criticize the fascism of television shows, using violence to achieve high performance, avoid the same with your film! Michael Haneke very cleverly said about this film that he condemns media fascism in fascist cinematic ways. How true ... Only he forgot to tell us about the severe headache that you have after sitting in this excessive load of shit!
