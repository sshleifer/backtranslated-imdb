Eitan Fox, while mostly relying on the apologetic side of Israeli politics, in the past has made some rather interesting films, such as “Walking in the Water” and just the wonderful film “Yossi and Jagger”. In Bubbles, however, he used this illogical and unfair approach to the extreme. <br /> <br /> Far from applauding this film, the people at the show, which I attended, quietly got up and left. I also quietly left, indignant at my anger at such an absurdly one-sided film, which translates self-preservation as racism and mockery of racist (and terrorism) as flashes of justified anger; it follows that evil Israelis are so offended by the Arabs that they react angrily to the constant stream of unilateral Israeli aggression against them, and therefore they should not be held accountable for their actions. <br /> <br /> This film was not worth the money I paid for the ticket (in fact, I thought I was demanding the return of my money), and was mostly an Israeli monkey from the Palestinian film Paradise Now. If you want to be anti-Israeli, then be sure to watch this film, as it really justifies just such a belief system. The fact that this film was shot by an Israeli director and, even worse, by such a talented Israeli director, is a shameful disgrace. Indeed, as far as Israel may be surprised that it is considered a rogue state, when the Israelis themselves conduct such anti-Israeli propaganda, it is hard to believe. <br /> <br /> What a shameful, terrible little movie!
