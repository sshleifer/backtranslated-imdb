I am sorry to say this, but the action in this film is terrible. The dialogue sounds as if they are reading their lines for the first time. Maybe I got the version of the “dress rehearsal” by mistake. The director makes excessive use of slow motion during special effects, perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves. The story is pretty well written, and the fighting episodes are actually better than I have seen in many action movies. The fights seem pretty real. But all this is happening, while the two leading actors again and again miraculously survive in an incredible amount of automatic weapons, grenades, cartridges and bazookas. Enemy soldiers are definitely one of the worst shots I've ever seen, especially when they see a truck running down from a distance of about 30 yards, and every shot from a bazooka is at least 50 feet wide. These bazookas need serious calibration.
