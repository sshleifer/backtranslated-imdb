This film is absolutely terrible. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story almost does not exist, the characters are full of stereotypes, and Special-FX only makes you laugh. The only remarkable thing about this film is the appearance of Rapper Kulio as a visiting policeman. <br /> <br /> If this film was supposed to be a comedy, I did not quite understand. If you want to watch this movie: please get drunk first and then get ready for a good laugh ... especially when the first Special-FX appears on the screen. <br /> <br /> But if you like movies made cheaply: this film is a must see.
