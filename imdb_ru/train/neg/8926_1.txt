I saw “Mira Breckinridge” when it first appeared in 1970. At that time I was a healthy 20-year-old who loved films and loved Raquel Welch very much. In addition, I read the story of Gore Vidal, on which it was based, and thought it was very funny. I watched the movie on the local road, and about halfway through, I really wanted to turn on the engine of my car so that I could die from carbon monoxide poisoning and not see the rest of this movie. It was not "smart" or "fashionable", it was rude and careless. All the actors were deaf and the director had no idea what he was doing. Casting Mae West was one of the worst choices in film history. As one reviewer said here, her role had nothing to do with a film or a book. Her character in the book is sexually beaten by a young stallion, which is never suitable for the legendary Miss West. Oh no, the plot has changed, so she is sexually beating him, very likely from a 77-year-old woman who watches every DAY of her age. I could go on, but why? It was a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Bluto
