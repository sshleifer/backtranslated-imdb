When the film was released, it became the most popular hit and soon became a blockbuster. But to be honest, the film is a funny clock with a storyline that glorifies a loser. The film has the tag “Priti Madhura, Thyaga Amara,” which means “Love is sweet, but“ Victim is immortal. ” In the film, the hero of the film (Ganesh) sacrifices his love for the leading woman (Pooja Gandhi), although they loved each other! Its justification is the meaning of the tag. This film had an impact on many young broken hearts, and they found this position “Victim resembling a loser” very thoughtful and, therefore, became a cult film with which they could live their lives. Ganesh plays in the movie "Amateur, rude and childishly stupid." In fact, he looks funny in the song (Onde Ondu Sari ...) when he should look stylish and cool. His appearance also does not help the leading role. His hairstyle is poorly done in most of the film. POOJA GANDHI CANT ACT. Her costumes are terrible in the film and very contradictory. <br /> <br /> A good part of the film is excellent cinematography and brilliant music by Mano Murthy, which is in fact the real salvation of the film. The words of Jayant Kaikini are also very well written. Directed by Yograj Bhat should boast, portraying songs with taste. <br /> <br /> Anyway, except for the songs, the film is very ordinary !!!!!!
