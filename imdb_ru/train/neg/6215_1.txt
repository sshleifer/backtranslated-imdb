This is really a waste of time ... the film has a weak plot, the story is fragmented and ends very suddenly with many loopholes ... although the animation is top notch. <br /> <br /> Once the film began, I tried to capitalize on the doubts, telling myself that it might become interesting at a later stage, but it was never unique. This same story was reproduced again and again, but the worst thing was that the main hole in the plot was a whole story about how to kill the villains ... The author could have done much more with the whole concept, but it seemed that or she did not have their hearts and he wanted to close the film as soon as it began. <br /> <br /> In general, too much hype, but not able to deliver.
