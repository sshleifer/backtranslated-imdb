The cliché of a dumbfounded soldier returning home from the war is mistreated here. It is a pity that the magnificent cast, acting within the framework of his high talents, cannot redeem the Soldier's Return because of his tough inability to compel the viewer to become emotionally involved. The best moments, as noted by another reviewer, come when Glenda Jackson appears on the screen; but even Jackson’s terrific cinematic power cannot pull the chestnuts of this film out of his cold, never heated hearth. Ann-Margret, she enjoys the reputation of a sex kitten and is too often accused of a lack of acting ability, finds her real and rather deep abilities here in vain - despite the fact that she speaks with an almost perfect accent of middlesex. The hackneyed score, unlike the disjointed sugar emotionality of many mini-series, annoys the chances of emotional remoteness of the script, blocking and excessive formalism of direction; with the exception of the score and the title script and the direction, the Return of the Soldier has all the right moments, but he cannot get them to work together.
