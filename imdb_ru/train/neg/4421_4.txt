The theme is definitely irresistible: a group of people develops their love for games one step further, creating a fake medieval world full of warriors, kings, princes and castles. Wargaming is an interesting phenomenon that deepens our collective need to “run away” from reality and sometimes the ordinariness of our existence — something that almost everyone can relate to. Characters are a predictable combination of the Lord of the Rings nerds and Star Trek enthusiasts. This is enough to make most people look. Nevertheless, the film very quickly turns into a view from the inside at war games with an almost stereotypical nose waving to viewers who “don’t understand it.” The filmmakers seem to take the theme of war games, and this one, too serious, than once, recognizing humor and fun, making a film about adults who play in medieval clothes and beat each other with foamy swords. Anyone who does not sit at his computer 7-10 hours a day, plays games or chooses the newest stellar destroyer to understand what the characters are talking about and why we should be worried about it. However, the filmmakers themselves, it seems, do not care that they want to focus solely on the plot of the game itself, and not on creating a strong story with a clear story that everyone understands. Moreover, the characters themselves are not so convincing, and you quickly get tired of them: a big “no-no” when you try to keep people's attention for 90 minutes.
