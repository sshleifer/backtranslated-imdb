.. THIS IS ONE! Very cool premise right away. <br /> <br /> It has an excellent first scene, we must pay tribute to it. <br /> <br /> He has solid characters and a decent enough script for a ghost story. but what bothered me was: whenever ghosts appeared, which, by the way, I really liked; how it was done, how it looked ... the only thing that was in the relationship with the ghost. Because of how everything happened in the first scene, you might think that their dynamics would be different. <br /> <br /> The situation slowed down a bit in the middle, which I felt, and the scene with crabs and spiders was just not good. But then the ending is actually very good! Undoubtedly, “The Grudge” basically told the same story with a polished lens, but without samurai, and this is what I liked in this film relatively. <br /> <br /> Please, someone with a hardened style rework this film. <Br /> <br /> Quiet Rage lovers will love this movie.
