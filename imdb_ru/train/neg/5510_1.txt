Rodney Dangerfield is not the main character of this film. He is barely at it. Most of the screen time is occupied by unfunny jokes. One of the clubs is that the character is called Jerk Off. There are also many anecdotes about erections, where the highlight is that someone has an erection. This film is as funny as the British accent of Kirstie Alley. <br /> <br /> This film began as a weak action movie: five minutes ago, stories, and then bam! Unfunny jokes. But besides the terrible composition, the film is also poorly directed, and the action is terrible. In addition, this film makes the old bad comedic cliche with a lot of well-known B-movie actors. Harland Williams, Gilbert Godfried, Randy Quaid and Phil La Mar. These are just some of the people who spend more time on screen than Rodney, although he is considered the main character. Do not be surprised if you find this film in the pharmacy for five bucks. Even this is too much.
