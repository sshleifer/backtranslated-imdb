Vampires vs Zombies was not the original name. It was actually ... <br /> <br /> Nasty lesbian semi-vampires and two zombies who were hit by cars Zombie Choir girls short skirt. <br /> <br /> Also on the box: Warning: there is no plot - only the writer and director will understand the end or anything else in this film. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I love bad movies, I love vampires. I love zombies. Hell, I even like lesbians. This film combined all three with a vague and confusing (or non-existent) plot, a terrible (I mean REALLY BAD) dialogue and random things and people who have nothing to do with (or do they ... I did not) know what was happening in the world). Oh, and I can not forget the Zombie green oatmeal in latex gloves (yes, the filmmakers were so cheap that they could not even cover Zombieâ€™s hands with oatmeal and paint). In any case, the result was this terribly BAD film, if you could call it that. <br /> <br /> It was assumed that the end does not make sense? The vampire was really a nurse, and the other girl was mentally ill? Where were the vampires Vs. Zombies? Damn where vampires were ... you couldn't call any of the girls vampires. No difference. <br /> <br /> Never rent or buy this movie. If you are REALLY curious ... well, I will understand. Seriously, even fans of bad movies will not stand it. This should be number 1 at the bottom of 100.
