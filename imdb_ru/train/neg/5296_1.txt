I'm not a big fan of cinema slashers as a genre, but even by the standards of low-budget exploitation, this one is really unconvincing. Even at the level of nudity is incredibly boring (there are both, but it's all kind of ... IU). Before the home video revolution, it might not even have been released theatrically (although it might have been, after all, Plan 9 from Space, which was played in movie theaters). There is only one good (and well-posed) line in the whole film; I guess they stole it from somewhere. <br /> <br /> The game is one of the worst I've ever seen. I mean, even Ed Wood had a couple of competent actors, and the rest, as a rule, were ludicrously boorish, who were fun to look at. In any case, most of his actors would be largely literate. Here, those who do not read their lines, like Indians from a cigar shop, sound like they learned them phonetically. And this film has one difference: he manages to be poorly prepared for the plot for most of the film, and then ridiculously rescheduled for the final. <br /> <br /> (Update: I had to single out the actress who plays the reception as an exception. She is by no means wooden. Not that she is good, but she is definitely not wooden.) <br /> br /> Even the worst blows of a slasher are usually good for a few Puritan meditations on their grotesque attack, but with this, it seems, there is even nothing that could cause moral outrage. <br /> <br /> Do you know the funny thing? They clearly expected to make a sequel! <br /> <br /> This is so bad and boring that it becomes really strange. I sat through most of the video, wondering why anyone could bother to do this.
