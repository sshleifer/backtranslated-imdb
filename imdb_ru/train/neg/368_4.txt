This movie is really stupid! I was 11 years old, and even then I thought it was rather ridiculous! I would recommend this film to children under the age of 12 years. I really didnâ€™t care, but I think he answers some very good questions that children need to know about, for example: 1) Do happiness buy money? 2) Should I lie (to my parents) about things that I think they would not approve? 3) Money buy friendship? 4) is money all that? 5) Shouldn't I tell my parents when someone tries to hurt me? Of course, this is a very unrealistic situation, but I think that if parents discussed these issues with their children, perhaps they should also watch this video to show / scare their children that lying can hurt you.
