There is absolutely no reason to waste your time on this “movie”. The original said all this and still holds. Either read the book, or study the history, and you will understand that this remake is ridiculous. Eric Roberts like Perry Smith? His sister could have done better! Having been in Holcomb & Edgerton, KS, where the story takes place, the scenery and locations were NOTHING like Kansas. The original is exciting, from the filming of the site to the use of actual participants, weapons and belongings of the victims. Unforgettable performances by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake. The Quincy Jones soundtrack and the cinematography of Conrad Hall ... The original is now available on DVD in widescreen mode. Let this turkey die a quick death.
