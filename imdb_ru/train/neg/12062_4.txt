When the great combinations of the director and actor are spoken about by the team of J. Lee Thompson and Charles Bronson, this is usually not mentioned. Probably because the output of the nine joint ventures between the two of them stretches from really good entertainment to mediocre. Unfortunately, Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects falls into the last. <br /> <br /> This is sad because Kinjite could be much better. But from life I donâ€™t understand why it was necessary to make the father of the missing Japanese woman, the guy who was getting some cheap fun, because the romance in his marriage was over. It might have been good for another movie as a whole, but it made no sense here. <br /> <br /> The simple drama of a policeman with Charles Bronson as a vice-policeman who saw too much in his work and has a strong prejudice against Orientalists. This part could also use a small explanation. But he will have to overcome this if he and his patient partner Perry Lopez are going to find a captured Japanese schoolgirl. <br /> <br /> The time of Bronson in the group of vice-officers told him exactly where to look for the kidnapper. Jaime Fernandez's stylish killer pimp is a guy and he has a story with Bronson. In fact, in the best scene of the film, Bronson made him eat an expensive rolex watch and set his car on fire. <br /> <br /> At some point, Fernandez discovered Bronson and Lopez during nightly delicacies, and this, after His fatal snack, he sprinkles this place of ultrasound that kills everyone except Bronson and Lopez. I really think that in this small incident there would be more than a couple of vice-policemen from the LAPD after Fernandez. But this is another terribly big hole in the conspiracy. <br /> <br /> However, Fernandez eventually appears before fate. I wish the whole movie was better. It was the last film of the Bronson-Thompson team and the last film directed by J. Lee Thompson. He had to go out with something better.
