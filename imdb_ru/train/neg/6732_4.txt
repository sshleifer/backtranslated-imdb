I discovered this film at IFC, and I thought it would be interesting. For “tiny” love stories, some of the stories are really drawn out in this film. The fact that none of these women had names almost makes you suspect that the actresses were talking about their real sex life, including Katie Baker and Alicia Witt. I have to admit, I want to start again to see some more romantic views on first sex, like in “Strike!” (1998), when familiar Odette Sinclair started asking about her intended first time, and Tweety asked “Was it beautiful? "<br /> <br /> Some might think that re-productions and memories will improve this film. I think it will be even worse. It doesn't have to be hardcore porn to get my attention, but somehow I just expected more.
