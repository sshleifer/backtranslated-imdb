“Fantastic Mr. Fox” is a comedy based on Roald Dahl’s classic book. Wes Anderson directs and respectfully brings the eponymous short book to the big screen in a feature film. Although I respect what Anderson did, an incredibly talented person, the film seems to have been lost in his intelligent spirit. Anderson seems to have left the story behind, knowing that he is a talented person, and if this turns out to be a bad movie, this will be his first bad movie. Just like when you go to school and have your first bad day, this is Anderson's first bad day at the movies, so I'm going to let him relax. I admit that he did have a good mind and good spirit, and the animation is good, but the film gets harder, leaving the story behind and making random shots of random things happening. Characters are good too. Jason Schwartzman voiced the clever ass, Mr. Fox (George Clooney), Ash's son, and especially interesting. The film does not quite reach a terrible level, but it is definitely getting closer and closer as you move. I’m sure that Wes Anderson will be back on the road with another amazing movie, when and where he decides to make another movie, but now, sorry, Wes Anderson, your movie was a big disappointment.
