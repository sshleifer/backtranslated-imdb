A sad, sad sight indeed - Revenge of Munster. Munster returns for the last time (Fred Givn received a huge salary to return to the role of Hermann Munster) in this film, made for television, about a pair of wax copies of grandfather and Hermann, which are robots, “terrorizing” the city as a preparation for robbing a mummy box on exhibition. With police on their heels, two elderly television icons are trying to figure out who really is behind the crimes in order to clear their names. We see them dressing in dredges, like waitresses (a minor moment in the film), the grandfather turns into a bat with a wire attached a couple of times (once even flying to Transylvania with Herman, one way or another, referring to his frequent flyer miles, I suppose), and the most annoying relative of the "Ghost" constantly sings and breaks the glass to nausium! It is difficult to determine what is most sad: it is that Givn (especially) and Al Lewis look so gaunt in every scene and so indifferent to the material. It is about the costumes of robots that have school production values, look at them. Maybe this is a ridiculous scenario. Sid Caesar is crazy, mostly unfunny antics. Or maybe this is what brought me joy and pleasant memories as a child, when I was treated with super-fashionable K-Mart makeup. In any case, the result is clearly disappointing and stupid, even for Munster standards. As for the rest of the cast, Yvonne De Carlo is quite adequate in the vacant role itself (although it demonstrates more splitting than usual for a woman of her years and experience). C.S. Martell makes Eddie Munster very unkind. Joe McDonell is an attractive Marilyn. Bob Hastings as the aforementioned Phantom looks and acts and speaks in the most absurd way. The film is very cheap, even for a film made for television.
