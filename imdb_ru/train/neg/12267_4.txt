speaking only like a movie, I didn't like it very much. not because there was no FX, or because we had the only cabin as the script for the entire film, in fact this is what made me watch it. <br /> <br /> I didn’t like it, because the game was shady, all his “friends” are happy, and then they get angry, but you can’t imagine why; then they take on different roles, one is the believer, the other is the antagonist, but they never do that! Also, the lighting was terrible, and I just mention technical issues. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, I think the film could simply say: “OK, I'm leaving here!” from some of the characters. as a woman who does not want to hear her version of the Bible. <br /> <br /> about the story itself, everyone is free to write about what he wants, and the story is proof of good writing and imagination. , I thank the author of the book for this, therefore, my 4/10. <br /> <br /> In the end, listen to this person’s story, believe it or not, just don’t waste all the time acting like you believe. him and shocked by what he says, and at the same time move around and joke, as if you do not believe him. <br /> <br /> Consistency. <br /> <br /> thanks for reading;)
