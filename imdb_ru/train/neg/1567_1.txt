I had to change my view of the worst movie in the world that just watched this one. THIS IS IT! <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, this movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> Here is a list of reasons: <br /> <br /> A hopeless plot (despite the fact that it is based on a true story). Awful game (as Judge Reinhold was thinking) Incredibly bad stunts. Child communication. Non-existent continuity. Lack of atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Get the picture? <br /> <br />
