What the reviewers and MST3K did not mention is the best part (and the only memorable scene) of this horrible movie: a very good soul rape scene, performed by a bad guy (like Ben Gazzar) on Maria (as mentioned, killed later because of ineptitude TJ). Perhaps rape is a strong word, “prison marriage ritual” might be more appropriate. The background of this chance, but of a forced encounter, is a gangster who hides Ben Gazzar, introduces him to the girls hanging out in his pool. The 30-year-old blonde misses him, but our villain must have struck her very much, because at this moment the courtship is on. His first step is to try to drown her until his mafia benefactor tells him to knock him down. It seems like a girl in high school that you didn’t like, but still wanted to know carnal knowledge ... Let's just say that he catches up with her in the booth later.
