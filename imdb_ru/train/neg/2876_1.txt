I question the motive of the creators of this fictional story about the motives of the killer BTK. Are they trying to portray animal rights activists as sick monsters? Who is responsible for this? Don't they think that people associated with this monster are suffering enough? What a blatant disrespect and exploitation of the victims! It was like a personal experiment: what worries you more, slaughter or killing people? They used the real names of some of the victims ... this film was disgusting, disrespectful and offensive! The creators of this film used this tragedy for their own purposes! People should wake up and redraw the line!
