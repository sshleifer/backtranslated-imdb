Don't let the premise fool you - it was one funny movie. The problem - it was not supposed to be a comedy. The story fine tunes you to an end that never comes. Worse yet, the installation is NEVER explained. You will leave the theater and ask "Is this all?" I rate it 2 simply because there were a few short promises, but the finish leaves you completely unchanged. Nicolas Cage coped well with this role, but there was very little work with him. Everywhere there are strange quirks and interesting twists and turns that have absolutely nothing to do with the film. Let this one come out on video before spending money.
