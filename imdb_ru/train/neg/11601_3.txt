Nightmare on Elm Street: Child of Dreams, fifth edition of Nightmare on Elm Street and worst sequel in the series, even worse than Nightmare on Elm Street 2. I was fortunate enough to get a Nightmare on Elm Street the prequels The sleep child, no doubt, was the worst, no doubt I was also surprised, since they coped well with the last two sequels. But I think that they just lost their charm, the story was just a mockery, and I was not happy with where it was. Alice just became more annoying, she is not Nancy or Kirsten, so her wearing of this film didn’t work for me on its own. Freddie also loses his panic, it was a bit silly. <br /> <br /> Alice is back and she has a child, she cannot be happier with her life. But Freddie also returned, and he would not be too easy with her, as she so easily defeated him in the fourth film. But, in any case, he wants her child to be born and be born again. Have you ever wondered if Freddie has parents? Well, this is what a Nightmare on Elm Street: Childhood Dream is investigating, and Alice will soon find out what Freddie’s childhood was like, and maybe this is the only thing that can beat him. Dream Child is just a bad movie and an insult to the show. I don't think anyone can be happy with this sequel. It was just that the story was really stupid, I mean, it could have worked, but, again, it was done wrong. I know that if you want to see the continuation of the series “A Nightmare on Elm Street”, you should watch it, but I would not recommend it, it’s not worth it, at least in my opinion. <br /> 3/10
