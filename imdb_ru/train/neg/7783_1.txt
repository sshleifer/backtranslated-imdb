Hey, HULU.com plays a late night horror show on their website, and this movie is called Monsteroid. It's nice to watch Elvira comment on this crappy movie ... Have fun with bad movies. In any case, this film doesn’t really matter very much, except to see how horrible the 70s were for the Bad Effects, Bad Dialog horror films, just making a bad film. Avoid this if you do not want to laugh at it. While you’re in HULU, watch other films that they now have, there are 10 episodes, and some of them are pretty decent movies with good stories and products, and you can watch many of them at 480p if you have a decent connection speed .
