If films like Guli are being torn down from the Gremlins, then Hobgoblins descends to a new minimum of debris, like Guli. These barely lively scammers have some kind of scheme to fulfill their fantasies (which mainly include the grotk’s sexual dreams - oh, joy), but that this has to do with something, it’s someone’s guess, except that the director indulges his strange penchant for erotica, I suspect that they show this in the 8th round of Hell. There is no real story - just "goblins - kill me!" and weak attempts at humor and a gentle attempt to awaken viewers.
