Friend, obviously without taste or class, suggested that I take a look at the work of Ron Atkins. If this is a representative of his work, I never want to see anything else from him. This is amateurish, smug, criminally trashy and smug trash. The title "whore killer" is an evil director with a low budget who kills a bunch of prostitutes. There are some nudity and some erections, but no element can save it from the hangmanâ€™s noose. The lighting is terrible, the dialogue is childish and mostly screaming, and the direction is meaningless. I saw documentation about American filmmakers at a recent convention in Fangoria. Atkins was one of them. He said that there was something important in his work, but after watching, I see nothing in it. There is also no style, and terrible video effects (such as solarization) only reinforce dilettantism. Not even so bad, it's fun. Avoid.
