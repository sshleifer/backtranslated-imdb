Collected (edited) together from dead body parts (deleted scenes) from corpses (leading), the Frankenstein monster (Wake Up, Ron Burgundy) is definitely not a sight for sore eyes (something that you will ever want to see twice ... .. maybe even once on this issue.) <br /> <br /> Most often, the relativity of scenes in WURB makes the third person narrator relevant. Even more disturbing is the fact that the characters in the WURB are incompatible with the versions of ourselves that we had at the end of the “Lead” (in the introductory section it is told that the WURB occurs shortly after the original.) At the end of the “Leader” Burgundy grew. from the very beginning of the film and embraced a hybrid co-lead / mistress. In this film, he returns to his immature tricks with the phone calls to Veronica (it is quite clear that this is more from the same scenes from the original Host, glued in WURB.) <br /> <br /> The part that makes this film is constantly a developing story, includes a clan robbing a bank, without a reason, called an alarm clock. These scenes almost hurt to look through fingers. This section has been removed from the original Anchorman scripts. <br /> <br /> Most of the other scenes in which our news team is participating on channel 4 clearly alternate / are removed from the Anchorman scenes. They go to the same party as the original, the same original scene “group quarrel over the presence of a woman in the team” and the same segment of the fashion show for cats, about which Veronica had objections. <br /> <br /> Burgundy recreates its first date with an entry point overlooking San Diego and dinner at his favorite Tinos club. None of the heroes mentioned that they were already at the point of entry and when Burgundy goes with Terinos to Veronica, he presents it to her as if they had never been before. Oh, and they wear the same clothes as on their original date. <br /> <br /> However, I have to give credit to the filmmakers - even if WURB is nothing more than a clever way of presenting deleted scenes. related to narration. Between two stories, the Ron of Burgundy is the weakest. In retrospect, the presenter may rise from the ashes of the WURB. You stay stylish, IMDb. Thanks for stopping by.
