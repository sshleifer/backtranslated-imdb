This is a German film of 1974, which is somehow connected with some women who come to the castle, and besides, I cannot tell you exactly their purpose or even what the purpose of the film is. I can tell you that there are several women who also shine like servants in this particular castle, who undress, put on body paint and spin in bongs like they were in Goth Kit-Kat Klub, and this seems to be a good part. lead time for this movie. Yes, it seems that something is happening with devil worship and vampires, and there is some girl on girlish things, etc., But the main emphasis seems to be made-up kids circling in the basement. I really liked to look at one of the main housekeepers / devil worshipers who gave authenticity to the procedural actions and made her even more ominous. Was this Wanda the Evil Lesbian (as stated in the credits)? Regardless of. If you are not too choosy about lesbian worship films, you might like it, otherwise these are rather boring things and I couldnâ€™t even finish them, I was so bored. 3 out of 10
