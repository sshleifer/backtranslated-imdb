This film was a stupid piece of shit. Everything is bad. Why do we, loving western movies, break down nine out of ten times when we shoot westerns? It seems that if you don’t see names like Robert Duval, Kevin Costner or Tom Selleck attached to the cover, you shouldn’t bother with it. For the most part, the main action of Shiloh Falls occurred in 1892, but the revolvers of the 1860s were used. Even the shooting was bad - in one of the scenes the marshal was fanning his six-shooter about nine times and could not hit any of the three big men who were only twenty feet away. I had to turn it off after about 15 minutes of this madness. Perhaps those who participated in this film could have taken some lessons in the Sunset Carson acting school.
