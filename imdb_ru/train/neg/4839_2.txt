... and to be let down more than ever before. I will not do here any direct links or anything else, but, to put it mildly, this film is pathetic. If you are trained in military affairs, do not worry. I put it on DVD with two friends who want to watch some interesting action movie. Why I could not just read the reviews in the first place. <br /> <br /> Already on the first “bomber” scene, the film has huge glitches, and they continue to appear and become more and more. My two friends, not connected with the armed forces in any way, noticed a couple of mistakes made by the director almost as quickly as I did, and asked me if some of the events were realistic. Well, you guessed it, they are not at all. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie unless you can miss out on your idiotic and repeated mistakes. 2/10 for the fact that I first became interested.
