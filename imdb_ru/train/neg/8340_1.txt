One of the worst movies I've ever seen. It got so boring that I turned it off halfway to watch the news. When I turned it back on, I fell asleep. The film begins with a dream, continues with a dream and ends with a dream. Then there are some more dreams between them. Come on, what should interest me? The film must have a reason to be interesting. The minute you felt that the film was just a dream, this is when some intelligent viewer turns off. Sometime someone insisted on telling you their dreams and what does this mean for them? That's all !!! <br /> <br /> Absolutely awful.
