What did I just look? I spent 90 minutes of my precious life watching one of the most stupid films I've ever seen. The concept of a serial killer clown is actually pretty scary, because there are a lot of people who are afraid of clowns ... but having a 300 kilogram killer clown in a nursery rhyme makes fun of the genre. I still wonder how Mark’s character couldn’t run away from a clown ... he’s 300 pounds, he eventually gets tired. The whole final made me stand up and literally say out loud "What did I just watch?" Apparently, Brandon is Denise's cousin .... and they acted in the middle of the movie, which means he had sex with a cousin ..... yes, that's what people want, so watch * shudder * . <br /> <br /> Another thing I found ridiculously stupid was the opening scene where a clown strikes a woman, and she says, "What did you do?" Well, damn it, what do you think, he just made? The last thing that was stupid is ridiculous is one second, when the main character slapped the hitchhiker and called her, and then after 5 minutes he said that the violence does not help. to the wrong guy? None of this movie makes sense anyway. <br /> <br /> The film was more or less dumb low-budget porn, which I got pulled into the purchase (all 3.99) and didn't get any entertainment out of it, except for the sex scenes. I am surprised that the fat clown did not join the orgy, might fit. I was hoping that the film would have some entertaining value, as other B films might have, but I was wrong. This is an idiotic piece of garbage that is not even worth watching. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
