Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his self-titled debut, this time a film that is performed for a laugh. While on an underwater journey, Rome discovers the body of a beautiful blonde at the bottom of the sea, her legs, as you might expect, are covered with cement. Rome immediately took up this business after being hired by the man of Mount Waldo Gronsky. Rome is immediately in danger, as he has to investigate certain types of mafia that overturn him, and he himself is recognized as the main suspect, now he must run and hope to solve the case alone. Magnificent Sinatra is struggling to sell us slop jokes and make us believe that he is a good detective, oh, not to mention the fact that he is sexually attractive to fox Raquel Welch, but fails miserably in this vanity project. The frankly ridiculous denouement that surrounds every woman is quite striking, every woman in the film is an agitated head that likes to lean in front of the camera, director Douglas, of course, pledges to crack his asses every time they flex their back muscles. There is even a ridiculous gay gay character who does not believe it was a film made by “real men” for “real men” to confirm his own sexuality, this is a shameful deception.
