Up to this point, Gentle Rain was a movie that I found the worst in history. This "blockbuster" ousted him from Asia. He has one "star" and this is John Rees Davis. He is not at all in shape to be a cool, magical flying villain whom he throws here. The rest of these people could not get out of the game in high school. No cliches were missed in the dialogue, and special effects were called as often as possible. <br /> <br /> It is fairly easy to see that someone in Asia had money, and he needed to create a tool for some actors. they wanted to throw money in. Or maybe it was a director or author who needed a loan. I assume that any career with this film is in his authority <br /> <br /> Do yourself a lot of good and donâ€™t watch this movie. A hundred thanksgiving couldn't eat that turkey. <br /> <br /> One funny scene was unintentional. The king's brother appears on the scene. King? A handsome, adult, low Asian actor. (Bad actor.) Brother? Six feet European. (Also a bad actor.) There was no excuse for this. They simply expected that we would not notice that this poor fellow Jet Li was the imitator of Pierce Brosnan in the cheap wig "Injun" straight from the old western film of the forties.
