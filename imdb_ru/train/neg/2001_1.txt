Why did so many people gather at the San Francisco Evening Film Festival in the evening Against All by Roberto Moreira (Contra Todos)? “This is a hired killer,” said my friend. "Well ... and this is Brazilian," I added. Beautiful multicolored people, tropical weather, lush rhythms and fashionable gangster plot? No doubt many temptations. <br /> <br /> Someone forgot to tell us one small detail: this is a very bad movie, really awful, and watching it is just as unpleasant as its bad. <br /> <br /> So how did Contra Todos get around Berlin, Melbourne, London, Manila, Stockholm, Cairo, Chicago, numerous small local festivals, and now San Francisco? Apparently, because of how the advertising process and the film festival scheme work. <br /> <br /> First of all, he won the first prize at the Rio Film Festival, where he was called the best Brazilian film of the year. It must have been a bad year; they had much better. Further, fast catalog synopsis and imagined buzz lead to overcrowded audiences and - since the film is not shown anywhere and therefore avoids the scrutiny of critics - it continues to go in a circle. <br /> <br /> Festival blur, aimed at the promotion of sometimes a lot of goose. The Chicago festival, called "Contra Todos," "a speedball cocktail shot straight from Brazil," called Claudia's boyfriend a "stallion in a slum area." Sonina is “the nymph-like daughter of the teenager of burgeoning sexuality Theodoro.” The film is “shot with the imperative need of a frequently used camera,” and the director “creates a genuine and tangible sense of frustration caused by inner despair and decay.” The effect is “unbearably rude and honest,” and the film “staggers” to such a blunt conclusion as the lives shown. ” Not the best essay, but it will certainly spur the excitement for a certain type of potential viewer. <br /> <br /> “Contra Todos” does relate to an assassin, actually two assassins, as well as a wife, daughter, and a reborn Christian friend. It was filmed - in an ugly ugly digital video without talent for camera work - mostly in a poor suburb, and not in one of the infested "favelas" or rural Brazilian urban slums, where such wonderful films as "Black Orpheus", "Pixot" and The City of God was not created in Rio, but in Sao Paulo. <br /> <br /> The bounty killer with family problems is Teodoro (Giulio Lopez) and his partner with the drug problem is Valdomiro (Ailtan Graça). Both actors have little experience with television, as does the actress who plays the lecherous blonde Teodoro Claudia (Leon Cavalli) and Sylvia Lawrence, who plays his puffy, ready for rebellion daughter Sononyu. These actors can go through the rear corners of several telenovelas. Who knows? - in the best film, they can even be good. In addition to them, there are several young men whom Teordoro beats up or, when he is busy, a gang of thugs. Principals do not work much, although the chamber enlarges their pores. <br /> <br /> A couple of observers, one at the Berlin Festival and one in London, saw the flaws of this film, but, alas, they “Buried in the network of hinterlands. Henry Sheehan noted from Berlin that the“ film ”(his quotes ) was the “worst of the video works” shown. “The filmmaker seemed to have chosen the video simply because it was a cheap alternative to the film,” Sheehan wrote, “and did not use a creative approach to the new medium,” he adds, and did not something else creative. /> <br /> Sheehan pointed to the film’s first big mistake: it “begins as a home drama, which should intensify when, in half an hour in a fight, Moreira discovers that his father and one of his friends are a professional man’s hit. Waiting for thirty minutes adds nothing to the film, it seems like a completely arbitrary decision and at least a waste of time. But Moreira he tries to do all the time like a little child who has received a set of tools for his birthday, and walks around, knocking everything in sight without rhyme, intelligence or skill. " Destructive, but true. <br /> <br /> In his performance at the London festival Kamera.com in 2004, Metin Alsandzhak tried to look at the positive side, but, nevertheless, he refused to have shortcomings that made it possible to call the performances “easy for the film”. The best feature. "Yes, very easily, considering that everything else is so bad. Alsanjak admitted that" this low-budget, cruel and poor story about the wrongdoers in São Paulo is deprived of any nice characters and, as a result, hope. Too gloomy and cynical to talk about the human condition, the film does not help poor subtitling ... The combination of Alsanjak Contra Todos with “Dogme” and Mike Lee did not help. <br /> <br /> Except for those meaningless first half an hour in which nothing saves from the boredom of our anticipation of the first acts of violence that when about they do not come, they just “beat everything in sight without rhyme, intelligence or skill” - Moreira clumsily tries to buy back her sudden finale, adding what seems to be fragments after it, followed by an incredible ironic final scene where one of the characters gets married. Doubt, the director wanted to demonstrate the "banality of evil" of low-level assassins in the working-class neighborhoods, but he cannot make the characters, whom he sees in general, liven up for us. And the structure of the film shows that he also cannot edit his material. <br /> <br /> (Visiting the San Francisco International Film Festival April 28, 2005)
