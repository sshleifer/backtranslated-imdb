First, the title character is not even the main character of the film. He is the assistant leader of the cult. The actor, who portrays Igor, believed that screaming out loud, laughing hysterically and having a wry smile, without taking his eyes off, is a great way to scare people. Igor also had an annoying shout (because he never spoke simply) in a high voice. He would also say idiotic one-liners. For example, when the leader of a cult killed one of his followers with a buzzing saw, Igor, seeing this, shouts: “Paul! No, Paul! Why did you do that? In another episode, Igor tells the victim that she needs to “get his instruments for the operation, because now is the time to operate him.” Besides the bad game, the ending did not make sense, because while the story accumulates that small amount of steam that it has to climax, that is, Igor gets an arrow from the crossbow to the head, and the rest of his crazy friends are killed, he appears two more times to kill the remaining "good guys." The film does not provide an explanation for this, but only tells the viewer that Igor escaped from a mental hospital. What kind??? The bottom line is not to waste your time watching this movie. I would like to return the points I lost watching this.
