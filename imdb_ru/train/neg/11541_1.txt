This film is the worst I've seen in the last 5 years. It's amazing how brilliant actors, such as the two main characters in this film, agreed to act in such an insignificant world of garbage. The film is a genre of rape / beating and revenge. The couple went to a party, and on the way back they hit a deer, and he went out to finish it when a jeep full of bad guys arrived. He did not go to their car, instead he was kicked and beaten while she was trying to start the engine of the car that betrays her, and she was raped. Then for some reason she is at her father's house, and one of the bad guys is her neighbor, so she took a shotgun and wanted to kill him ... So stupid script! Bellows Hollywood! He was against this revenge, but "She's raped," "They laugh at her," so she must kill them all ... But once in the house she was satisfied, shoving a rifle in the bad guy's ass, and left while he got off crazy and execute the bad guy. Personally, I think the director ran out of money before finishing it, because the film ends before they execute anyone else involved in this gang rape and beating, which is not a big surprise, because the sponsor has obviously seen it wanted to get my money back. LoL This film is not intended even for people who like to watch rape, because they will not see what they are looking for ... This director should be banned ... This is because this trash world was made by British cinema, which I personally like, and that is why I watched it. Don't do it yourself, you have the best things to watch this dumb movie script ...
