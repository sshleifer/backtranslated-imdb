Lame, stamped superhero action movie. I had high hopes for this film, and the genre of militants-policemen from HK is one that I don’t despise, but very rarely do I see a storyline as trite and ridiculous as this one. It would be forgivable, as it always happens in such films, when the action compensates, unfortunately, this did not happen. The action carries the unreality of the HK trademark and supernature, but it doesn’t involve much, is indecent and in fact often completely inconsistent (perhaps this is due to re-editing for the American release, it shows signs in many patchwork places). I was very disappointed.
