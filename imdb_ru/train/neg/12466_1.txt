I couldn't wait to get the DVD, hearing so much about the movie. What a disappointment! It has become one of the most intricate films I've ever watched. So many characters were introduced, some reminded others that it became impossible to follow the storyline. I could not understand how George Clooney received the acting award for the film, since he almost did not participate, at least in the first half of the film. My wife and I gave up after an hour of suffering and stopped the DVD. I could think of a quick redirect to see if the end was better, but after so much confusion I decided that the chances of improvement were slim. A staff member told me that most of the movie “gets together” at the last minute or less. I was glad I didn't waste another hour waiting. I gave the DVD the next day.
