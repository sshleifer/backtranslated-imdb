Intrusive. A remake, of course. The original was a terrible psychological thriller, which improved over time. Compared to this remake of 1999, this is a classic. There is no character development, only caricatures (whore, authoritative brain, the guy “I'll get us out of here,” oh, such a sensitive bookworm). But, seeing how they "bet" on special effects, which are the "star", I think that characters that you can empathize with are a secondary task. Unfortunately, the effects are ridiculous. Bevelled cherubs, stretchy doors, annoying dead children who cannot speak simply ... and a stupidly sharp ending that makes the most terrible thing to give you a new enema of the age of butterflies and rainbows. I will take my skittles orally, thank you. Bruce Dern, I liked you with Cowboys. Stop this.
