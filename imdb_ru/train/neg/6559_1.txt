My girlfriend chose this one; Being a South-born and educated African-American, I found the plot and premise of this film completely without trust. To believe that class and racial prejudices will be so easily and conveniently suspended, come only from someone who is completely unfamiliar with South Ante Bellum. Absolutely absurd !!! I wonder how they attracted a good actor, such as Harvey Keitel, and a good actress, such as Andy MacDowell (who knows better in the south) to participate in this shit.
