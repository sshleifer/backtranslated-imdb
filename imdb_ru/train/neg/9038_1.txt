This is a terrible work by Bartleby, though not in the way another reviewer put it, because it is “not flammable”, but rather because this version does not support the spirit of the book. It tells a story, almost painfully. Watching this, I could turn the pages in my book and follow it, which is not so fun when it comes to adapting. Rather, look at the 2001 version of Bartleby with Crispin Glover. This version, albeit with humor, brings new details to the film, keeping the spirit of the novel. Spirit is important, not trivial things such as setting, character names and costumes. The difference between these versions of the film, like night and day, is tiring and fun. This version is a lesson about what can go wrong if the adaptation is treated poorly, painfully, and stunning.
