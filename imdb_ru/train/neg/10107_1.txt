Last weekend I bought this “zombie movie” in a store and watched it with friends, thinking it would be a budget version of “Land of the Dead”. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> It seems that they have spent a significant part of their budget on the cover, which is very misleading for fans of the zombie genre. <br /> <br /> We looked to the Point where the zombie chicks come to life and get into the car with some yuppie, which is in the thick of cell phone conversations. They actually talk to a guy before one of the girls kills him; but as soon as they started driving, I could no longer stop my disbelief. <br /> <br /> Some people consider this film “so bad, it's good,” they are liars. I did not finish the film, but in one of the other reviews it is mentioned that they actually became policemen at the end of the film, and I am glad that I did not watch it to the end. <br /> <br /> It's even worse than Zombies, DO NOT LOOK!
