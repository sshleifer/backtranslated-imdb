If Mr. Crankey would appreciate it, I would be tempted to just copy his review and paste it here. But since he did not, I have to try it myself. <br /> <br /> The only thing that gives this film 1 instead of 0, is that Malcolm McDowell plays great. However, even he can not save this film from disaster. The director must have been really distracted when he was working on it, because it’s just a bunch of scenes that were combined with a very small amount of continuity - reminiscent of bad movies of the 70s. Worse, both the actors and the director seemed to invent how they were going, which probably showed how bad the original script was. <br /> <br /> Don't even discuss the storyline, although it revolves around a futuristic storyline. The corporation called Proxate Corporation, which assembled a team of non-binding people to transport hazardous cargo on an old container / slave ship to Nigeria. The computer of this ship is a child who is kept in a glass jar and connected to one of the crew members via USB 12 or something else. The company was to be called Prostate Corporation, since the entertainment value of this film is on a par with the same study. <br /> <br /> I honestly cannot find one scene that I could say was well done and had some real meaning in the context of the film. I just watched it until the very end, as I had a little bird flu, and this film reminded me that there are people who were actually in a worse position than I, in particular Malcolm MacDowell. I will not object to him, because he is a great actor, and every great actor has the right to one bad film in his career, and this one is a fool. <br /> <br /> So if this is not the only film the store hires or you are a man and you don’t have a doctor do prostate examinations this week, and for some reason you feel it’s bad, then give it a really broad a place, if, of course, if you are not really configured for the community, buy a copy to support Malcolm, and then use it as a drink stand.
