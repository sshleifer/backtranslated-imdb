I consider it my duty to love horror movies in order to warm other people about this terrible and very, very bad horror movie. Do not waste your time or money on this film, the acting is bad, the story is only one of the worst I've encountered, and the script was just awful. Nothing good was in it, in the end you thought to yourself why I was watching this nonsense. There were so many holes in the plot, and in the end they were never clarified, it was so bad, I don’t know how such a horrible movie could have been made. As I said, I like horror movies, and I was so disappointed, it was 18 years old, but you see a little blood, no panic or jumps. I was also annoyed by the fact that there were stupid things in the movie that had nothing to do with the plot at all, for example, the kisses of a brother and sister, why? That's all I can say. Just do not worry, there are a lot more great horror films, just don’t waste your time, life is too short.
