This movie is terrible. In the end, you will realize that several hours have been stolen from your life that you cannot return. The end of the "twist" is very contrived. The character development leading to this ending is inconsistent with their final actions in conclusion. Ninety minutes of preparation - with the assumption that Rob Lowe’s character will die on Christmas Eve - is explained literally in ninety seconds “No, we just deceived you” Then Rob Lowe's character doesn't even get upset about it! “I will forgive you if you can forgive me,” he is just as upset. If it took someone weeks to convince me, I was going to die, and then say, “No, I'm sorry, just fooling you,” I would raise a serious hell. I'm not upset about the distribution of the spoiler, because I can save some of you from watching. Please save yourself and do not watch this movie.
