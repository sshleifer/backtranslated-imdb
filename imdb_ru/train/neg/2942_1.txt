This is the worst movie of all time. The combination of Whoopi Goldberg (the worst actress / person in history) and the talking dinosaur ala Jar-Jar-Binks make up a painfully bad movie. This was an understatement. This movie is not available for viewing. For the love of God, do not watch this film.
