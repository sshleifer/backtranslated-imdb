This television film tells the story of an extrovert Franny, suddenly returning to Silk Hope to visit friends and family, but not suspecting her mother's death. Her sister runs the family house, but is going to sell it and leave with her new husband. Franny categorically objects to this idea and vows to preserve the family heirloom by getting a job and maintaining responsibility. <br /> <br /> Cute Ruben enters, and soon they fall in love (like you) and from that moment I kind of lost interest .... <br /> <br /> Farrah Fawcett is something more, rather than just blond hair and appearance, she can very convincingly portray a character when she thinks about it - and this is certainly proven here, as well as some of her previous efforts, such as “Limbs” and “Little Sacrifices” - a magnificent representation of the legendary angel Charley. <br /> <br /> “Silk Hope” is a type of film that never bothers with its cheap and fun TV image, and you know that there was a limit to the budget, but it is not the worst movie ever made. There are positive aspects; you just have to find them.
