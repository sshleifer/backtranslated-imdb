It was a classic case of what should never have been. Gloria was now a single mother, her husband left her because she would not live in some kind of community with him (he was angry with Reagan and wanted to turn his back on society). Right then and there I had problems with the show - come on, I tell myself, is this the noble Michael Stevic who opposed Archie Bunker's right-wing philosophy? The series continued, but it just did not have pizatstsa. No matter what impulse Sally Struters received from the whole family, she disappeared long ago. Perhaps, if the series had a different name and was presented as completely independent from All In The Family, this could work. Oh, well, this is show business.
