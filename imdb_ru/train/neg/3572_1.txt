The beautiful Z channel in Los Angeles showed this Pia Zadora film about six months after Butterfly. I had such high hopes for an actress, and then she went from bad to clearly WELL in this film. <br /> <br /> Again, this was the 80s, and I have to tell you that Harold Robbinâ€™s work overshadowed clever writers. , Jacqueline Suzanne broke into him (she hated his way of writing women), the work of Irwin Shaw gained popularity among many women, and, of course, Sidney Sheldon got his kingdom in the late 70s and early 80s, and then Jackie Collins, who made women stronger and more equal to men in all respects in her books, all the more. That's why this job smelled. The work of Harold Robbin in the 80s simply did not win popularity with the audience. Pia Zadora in one of the works of Robbin was like throwing kerosene into the fire. The supporting cast also did not help. <br /> <br /> Oooooh ... it was awful to watch, and even after 20 years it looks even worse. I had hope for Pia as an actress, and when it was all done, it hurt me. Pia would have been hard to redeem herself as an actress (although John Waters, who threw her into Hairspray, was a spark), although she has a pleasant singing voice. <br /> <br /> Hi, Pia, wherever you are. .. Hair spray can go on tour! Join the show. You may be the biggest return story. <br /> <br /> I just hope they burn this movie for you if you do.
