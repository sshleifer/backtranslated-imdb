I have to admit that I liked the first half of the Sleepers. It looked good, the acting was even better, the story of childhood, pain and revenge was interesting and touching. Superb Hollywood Movie. But ... Nobody mentioned it so far (at least in the last 20 comments) when it came to scenes in the courtroom, and the character of Brett Pitt followed his plan to save two of his friends, who are rightly accused of murder felt deceived. This film insulted my mind. <br /> <br /> Warning spoilers !! <br /> <br /> Why did someone accept their false alibi testified by a priest? If these two guys were with him, why not tell them during the investigation? Amnesia? If you were a judge or a jury member, would you believe it? Is it reasonable to distribute the motive of the killers? <br /> <br /> Sorry, but in the end the story is very weak, and it makes me angry. This film had a lot of potential. 4/10
