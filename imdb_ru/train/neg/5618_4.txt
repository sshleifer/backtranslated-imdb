I am really surprised by the amount of good marks that this anti-Christian pseudo-documentary film received. Now, I respect the opinion and faith of this guy, I myself am not in this state a supporter of the teachings of Christian doctrine. However, anti-Christian propaganda is a slightly different matter. <br /> <br /> This film has strong arguments, but very few of them, and they are presented in a biased context. I do not recommend not seeing this. In fact, I think everyone should see it and decide for themselves whether they believe it or not. And this is actually more likely than the one that the director gives to Christian teachings. Instead of an inquiring approach to this issue, this seems to be a personal vendetta in a Christian school that influenced his childhood. In most cases, it also distorts Christianity as incredibly naive or fundamentalist, among whom there is no moderation. <br /> <br /> The director uses scenes from the movie “Passions of Christ without permission”, arranges an interview with his school principal. the former school and is almost exclusively anti-Christian historians and writers. I actually found the school director the most practical person and I think that his attitude was completely justified. I also strongly doubt that any of the Christian believers interviewed were consulted after words or even before the interview they were told about the purpose of the investigation. <br /> <br /> Considering the above, there are certainly new and interesting facts found here and some very original thoughts on the subject of Christianity. But the way this whole thought is created is often offensive, extremely unprofessional and terribly biased.
