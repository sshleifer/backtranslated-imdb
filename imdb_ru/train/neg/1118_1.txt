I was terrified of this creepy movie. What an unusual dark atmosphere. And such a terrible musical score. Really promising! Indeed, in ten minutes you really sweat and feel uncomfortable because you start to fear the worst. In this film, the atmosphere reigns nightmare, and even worse - it all comes out. For an hour and a half, I tried to fight with complete boredom and fall asleep, but the monstrous soundtrack did not let me fall asleep. Nuit Noire is a truly terrifying picture - for your eyes, your ears, your intellect and, most importantly, your wallet, because the idea of ​​spending precious money on a movie ticket for this cheap amateur home video is the biggest horror of all. .
