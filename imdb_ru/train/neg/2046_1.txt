I can’t believe that this film even got on video, and that video rental stores are ready to put it on their shelves. I literally asked for a refund. Take away the fact that the film has no historical truth, and it is still the worst film ever found in the video store. It’s not even good enough to be called a B-rated movie. Do not waste your money or your time on this movie. The mere mention of the voice ended, and the terrible music made me sick. Anyone associated with this film should be removed from the union, giving the industry a black mark, but after watching most of this film, I really do not think that any of the participants is a union member.
