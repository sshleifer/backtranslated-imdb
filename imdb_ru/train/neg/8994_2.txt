This film is a prime example of the use of huge resources in the film. You have the future stars of SNL and SCTV in their prime, such as John Candy, Chevy Chase, Laraine Newman, Al Franken, Tom Davis and Joe Flaherty, who essentially make 70 minutes of rude, boring farting and humorous racist jokes. The concept of a network from the future subversive society could indeed be brought to some interesting extremes, but instead, immediately a young proctological joke joked outside the gate and stayed in that spirit of humor all the way. much more disruptive and ingenious Groove Tube or later, hilarious Kentucky Fried Movie. This film is intended only for those who want to see a temporary capsule of comedy films about the bad 70s.
