This movie could be a decent horror movie. The main character was decently made, and I felt sorry for him, and there was a decent amount of prehistory. HOWEVER, everything else sucks. Director Emmanuel is completely incompetent in filming. He uses some of the most idiotic pictures ever. <br /> <br /> - a pair of random sequences of random images scattered throughout the film. I do not know if he tried to be deep, intelligent and poetic, but it is not. That was stupid. Random shots of the trailer in which the protagonist lived, random buildings, random panoramas of buildings, random cat that leaves. WTF? And the clouds. A lot of dark clouds. <br /> <br /> - he really liked the technique of cutting the scene into different frames, and not just a continuous frame. EX: A guy is trying to rekindle his weed, and the camera spins around him. Instead of a single shot, he edits it like 10 different shots, so this is really EJ! and hips! and smart! Stupid. <br /> <br /> The game is terrible, but this is what makes the movie so funny. And the scarecrow is a gymnast, because he always turns over, turns and turns. And some of the deaths might be better. You expect the main hooligan to have a long, well-built death, but no. A simple ear in the ear. Love interest was hot. Sensual. That's why this movie gets 2.
