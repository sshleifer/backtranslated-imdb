When I saw this movie in FearNet, I thought it would be a scary movie. Apparently not. I have no idea how this movie was allowed to be shown on this site. FearNet is a site that shows scary horror movies. <br /> <br /> The acting is remarkable by all the actors. I hated that story. The story was stupid. The film begins with a man with a scroll with a stamp on it. It breaks the seal and certain disasters occur. The water turns into blood, the oceans are dying out, the moon turns red, and so on. The female character is also annoyed. Much of what she was doing did not make sense. For example, when she sees a sheet of paper with a date on it. Coincidentally, this is the date when she should give birth to her child, and she begins to worry about it and begins to investigate it and ask religious people what all this means. <br /> <br /> * A Spoiler Alert * <br /> The two worst things that happened in this film are the execution of a mentally retarded person who claimed that God told him to kill his parents, and the end when Demi Moore dies after the birth of a child and the transfer of his soul into it. <br /> Here is what is happening. The mentally retarded person will be shot and the apocalypse begins. Demi Moore enters the hospital in the midst of a powerful earthquake and gives birth to a child. She touches the head of her child, transfers her soul to the child, and then dies. Then the apocalypse stops. <br /> <br /> Why did God suddenly change his mind? He becomes enraged when the governor permits the execution of a mentally retarded man, then is he all about forgiveness, when a single woman transfers her soul to his child? <br /> <br /> * End Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The film is pretty stupid. This is another religious end of world propaganda. The game from Demi Moore, Michael Bean and everyone else is great. That is all there is. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 2 stars out of 10. Good game with a lot of nonsense!
