This is not the cast. A finer group of actors you could not find. This is not a setting. The director is in love with New York, and by the end of the film, we too! Woody Allen could not improve what Bogdonovich did here. If you are going to fall in love or find love, Manhattan is what you need. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There's nothing here. Actors fall in love at first sight, words are not needed. From the director's own experience in Hollywood, this is exactly what happens when they go to work on the set. This is a reality for him and his peers, but this is fantastic for most of us in the real world. So in the end, the film is empty, shallow and without messages.
