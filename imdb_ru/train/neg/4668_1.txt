The potential film extravaganza, established in the 19th century, failed to create. With such famous actors as Maggie Smith, Albert Finney and many others, the film had no reason to fail. However, the film did not have enough end, he had an excusable excuse for the storyline and fell apart with its continuity. The typical story of a rich girl and a poor boy, united by love and ruined beauty (or her absence) and disapproval, has the touching side of the premature death of a mother and an absent father. The father played by Finney is a worried man who torments his daughter both in life and in death. He believes that the lack of attractiveness of his daughter will destroy his condition by marrying their social status. The actors tried in vain to save what was left of the plot. Washington Square is a black hole of destruction and destruction, wasting precious time of those who are sadly watching what is happening. I give this movie 1 instead of 0, exclusively for the attempts of the actors. Save yourself, stay away from Washington Square.
