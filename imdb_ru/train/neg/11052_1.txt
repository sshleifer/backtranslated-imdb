Death Trail is the perfect movie for film students ... to find out how NOT to shoot a movie! <br /> <br /> Let's see ... what has the team been confused in this film? Worst Music Mix Worst Editing Worst Scenario WELL ALWAYS DIRECTED Worst Actor Art Worst Choreography Worst Cinema Worst Scenery Worst Lighting Worst Lighting Etc. ... it would still be terrible. All the scenes are dark (glowing people call it “black”), often the musical score drowned out the winding dialogues, which was normal, because no one had ever uttered two whole sentences without long pauses for the effect. The “evil” robot was fun ... what was it? Jazz dance? Oh ... I think it had to go tactically or something like that. I’m sure it instilled fear in the hearts of ... poor editors. And how do you edit so much footage? Impossible. Garbage is garbage, no matter how you stick it. How could anyone get this through the newspapers ??? <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that I could not watch more than 15-minute segments, it was so bad ... but I saw it all (with a lot of breaks) just to see if it had any good parts at all. NO! NOT! <br /> <br /> A great example of how not to make a movie ... you need to see EVERY serious student of cinema !!!
