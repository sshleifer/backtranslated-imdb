"The triumph of love" does not triumph over anything. It is heavy, heavy, 4 hours of torture. In fact, it is a little less than 2 hours, it seemed much longer. It pains me to even think about amateur performances by such wonderful actors as Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw. Supporting players are not so terrible. Maybe they tried to be so excessive as to be clown, but, if so, I have not seen it so. Mira Sorvino does not make an impression anyway. She (he) is just there. I assume that the play of the same name, written by Marivaux about 270 years ago, is much better. Worse could not be. Claire Peppo, the author and director of this film, was inspired by the recent production of the play. I don't know what she was thinking when she made this bomb. <br /> <br /> Maybe everything is lost in translation.
