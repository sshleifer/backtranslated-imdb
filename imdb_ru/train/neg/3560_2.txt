For me, this is a story that begins with funny jokes about Frank's fanatics, when he travels with the ladder and when he sits at business meetings ... The problem is that when you watch this movie for an hour, you will see the same fantasies / funny situations over and over and over. It is predictable. It's more like a television story where you can go and come back without missing anything. <br /> <br /> I like Felix Herngren as Frank, but this is not enough, even if itâ€™s a comedy, it should have more variation and some message for its audience .... <br /> <br / >
