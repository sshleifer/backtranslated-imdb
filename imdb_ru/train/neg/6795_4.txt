The return begins with a promising scene of the brutal death of a masked killer. The mask itself is also pretty cool and looks almost the same as in the 1990s film “Grandma”. Since then, the film has become mostly boring. We still have a few deaths, which are again good, but not enough. The reason death is so good is that it’s mad and bloody. The story behind the film is actually quite interesting and would work very well if it weren’t so boring for the most part. <br /> <br /> I would have avoided this if you weren't a die-hard collector - there’s not even enough to do it with an ordinary blow.
