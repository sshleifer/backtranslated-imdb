102 DALMATIANS [Walt Disney]: I was not a fan of the previous release, and in this effort there are all the weaknesses of the first, stupid soft storyline, terrible due to the fact that Glenn Close plays every scene as if it plays for her own entertainment and incredibly boring and uninteresting main actors. Once again, dogs are the only "actors" who seem to be "real" and it's stretched. Another wasted effort here. Grade: D
