You probably heard this phrase when it came to this movie? "Herbie: fully loaded with shit," and yes, that's true. This film is really terrible and completely unconvincing. <br /> <br /> This is the second worst film Lindsay has ever starred in after the Confession of the Teenage Drama Queen. The only good thing about this film seems to be excessive talent, which is much better than a film a million times, and is the only advantage of the film. I don’t understand how such a respected actor as Matt Dillon could be part of this film, didn’t he read this horrible script before subscribing to it? <br /> <br /> What I didn’t like in this film is also based on the fact that Herbie is surreal and fantastic, like extraordinary abilities, she climbs the wall and goes faster than the racing car, because it’s just the Beatles. I know that this is a children's film, but they went too far with him, and he just turned out to be more stupid than entertaining. Need a little realism, plus the story is too predictable. <br /> <br /> Final words: If the children are not really 5-12 years old, I very much doubt that anyone could enjoy this meaningless film. What a loss of my money. I feel cheated. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10 (class: F)
