King Maker is a film about a series of real (necessary for quoting) events that occurred during the Portuguese occupation in Indochina. <br /> <br /> Although the costumes and artistic leadership deserve praise, the film is still not impressive to the viewer. In particular, the game was extremely poor. Some actors try hard to put down tears, and accents, both real and fake, are extremely annoying. The storyline was also too dumb and too stupid to be true, and it was more like a history lesson. The film could not even capture such a royal and age-old broadcast, and it was more like an unsuccessful attempt to make an Asian version of Elizabeth. <br /> <br /> Last word? The costumes and artistic direction give the film a breath of fresh air, but the performance was extremely meager, and the actors could not even give a natural surge of emotion. In short, the film sounded more like a hullabalu than a script.
