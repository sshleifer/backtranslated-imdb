What a horrible movie! The idea that robots fight each other is cool, but the plot line is ridiculous, real human actions are ridiculous, non-existent acts and special effects (on which this type of film should depend) are archaic. I thought it was done around 80-84, and was amazed to see that it was in 1990. This is 5 years after the aliens! Well, many said it was good, considering the low budget, but I just think: “What is the point?”. it looks absolutely unbelievable. I do not mind seeing a remake with modern special effects and a completely rewritten plot, because I still like the idea of ​​how huge robots beat the crap out of each other.
