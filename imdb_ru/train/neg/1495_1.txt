I have been watching horror movies since 5 years old, starting with Childs Play. Since then, I have seen good and horrible horror films, but this is without a doubt the BIGGEST movie I've ever seen! The actors did everything they could with the material. The plot was just idiotic. Plus, it was just all bloody. I can digest a lot of blood, but it was just ridiculous! In one of the scenes, the character is struck to the rear and suffocates his intestines! The usual nonsense! Another problem with this film is that it is a boring and perhaps the slowest movie in history. The end of this is just dumb. But again, it comes with everything else! In the end, when a girl runs away from a cannibal / ancestor, she gets help from an old woman. The old woman makes tea, but when she turns to talk to the girl, the girl attacks her! She turned into a cannibal! Retarded movie
