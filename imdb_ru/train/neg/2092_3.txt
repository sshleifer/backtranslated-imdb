In essence, “Caprica” is the story of the origin of the Cylons. The premise of the show is interesting. However, the authors follow so many plot lines and clog it with too many first-person characters that it interferes with story-telling. The plot creeps on glacial speeds, dissipating how much stress he could have. Little or nothing happens in any particular episode. <br /> <br /> Daniel Greystone (Eric Stolz) is a military contractor working on a robotic soldier using a stolen chip. Unfortunately, his only working prototype is the version of the artificial intelligence of his dead daughter Zoya, who died in an explosion committed by suicide bombers as a result of the underground monotheistic extremist group "Soldiers of One". <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Joseph Adam (father of the commander of "Battlestar Galactica" Adama) is trying to keep his family while searching for his daughter's version of AI (who also died during the bombing) in the Machiavellian virtual version of Caprica (which strongly resembles the 1930 years Chicago). <br /> <br /> In addition to the useless writing, Caprica suffers from the same problem as many stories of origin. We already know how this ends (that is, the Cylons develop their own civilization and rebel against humanity).
