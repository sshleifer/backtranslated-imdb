There is no artistic value in this film to deserve a reward. Well, it also does not deserve an audience. Ironically, one of the awards is awarded for cinematography, but, frankly, camera movements are confusing, to say the least. Every frame, you feel that you are getting a “complete picture”, as if someone “cuts off your eyes” from the edges. The story is pathetic. Well, I will be honest, I could not watch the whole movie. Most of all I didn’t like it when I saw the soldiers arranging parties in the barracks, and one of the soldiers was persuaded to drink alcohol. These and many other similar scenes reminded me very much of Stephen Seagal. <br /> <br /> Listen to my advice, stay away from this shit.
