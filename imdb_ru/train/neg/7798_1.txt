This review is based on the dubbed video of Shock-o-Rama, released in an undeserved world in 2002. How bad is it? This is terrible, this is what represents “1” on the scale of IMDb - but it is much worse than that. It's nice to imagine that the original print in German can improve the situation - comedy dubbing in English is not funny at all - but, frankly, this is one of the worst amateur films of any genre that you can see. , as before, and they seem to have no opportunity to talk or think about something other than their next meal. However, they are also smart enough to work with chainsaws and angry enough to know that Western genital taboos are sure to liven up their conversation at the dinner table. The Land of the Dead by George Romero was a zombie nation that retained a slice of social cohesion; Here, zombies are nothing more than a blank canvas for perverted performances by director Andreas Sznaas. Without knowing social value at all, and even worse, having no fun at all, Zombie '90 is a bad joke for anyone who spends money on it.
