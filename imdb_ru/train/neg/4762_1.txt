I saw this movie without knowing anything about it beforehand. The plot was terrible with big gaps in information. The film did not have the feeling of a “battle of wits”. The actors simply spewed nonsense, sometimes forcing me to gnash my teeth in agony as they hummed farther and farther away. The plot was predictable, except for the fact that at the end I had a nauseous homo-erotic scene (I am not a homophobe, but because of that I had a stomach ache), even the final was predictable. And you could say that the detective was Jude Law in a suit, everything from a fake accent, terrible dental work, facial hair at a costume shop, everything indicated that it was a disguise. The whole movie was just wasted from my life. This film looked like a puppet show with Jude Law and Michael Caine in the role of puppets, and the house looked like a window to watch the show, which, in my opinion, is really impressive.
