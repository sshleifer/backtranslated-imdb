“Memoirs of a Geisha” is a visually stunning melodrama that looks more like a camp, a satire of “dragging the queen” than with real people. <br /> <br /> In the first half of the film, it is strongly argued that geisha are not prostitutes or concubines, that they are the epitome of traditional Japanese beauty. But except for one breathtaking dance, the rest of the film degenerates into “Pretty Woman” on the territory of Storyville, or at least Vashti and Esther in Purim history, since all the efforts of women in art and art are aimed at having fun much, much older drunk boorish men. Maybe this is Japanese culture, which is engaged in prostitution, and not just American guys after the Second World War. <br /> <br /> It is possible that the tension of the conversation is in English, but Ziyi Zhang barely demonstrates his remarkable flash in the House of Flying Daggers (Shi Mian Mei Fu) and Hero (Ying Xiong). From time to time, Michelle Yeo is projecting a glimpse of his guaranteed performance in “The Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Wo hu cang long)”. Only Li Gong shows some real life. Otherwise, I continued to portray Charles Ludlam in various roles, or even Killian Murphy, as in a kabuki theater, especially since the plot drags on in a fight with a cat after a fight with a cat. <br /> <br /> The alleged love story does not contain chemistry, mainly because of differences in age, and I felt sorry for Ken Watanabe most of all and hoped that his Hollywood check would compensate for his loss of dignity as the mysterious “chairman”. I remember more emotion in Jenny's Portrait, when a young girl seeks to grow up in Jennifer Jones to please Joseph Cotton. <br /> <br /> We see brief glimpses of reality when geishas portray ordinary women as photographic rides, and how timeless Ziyi Zhang experiences years of war in a very colorful kimono dying operation. In the finale there is little sense of normality. <br /> <br /> The score includes a multitude of chopped traditional melodies, with the cello Yo Yo Ma and the violin of Yitzhak Perlman instead of the traditional instruments that are beautifully accompanied by excellent cinematography, while the person completely ignores the plot and the tough game. <br /> <br /> While I was wandering around, I wondered how great Japanese directors of samurai films would have coped with this story, which probably was more formal, but much more emotional.
