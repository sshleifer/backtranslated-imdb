In the light of the recent and rather good Batman, Brave and Brave, now is the time to strike a fatal blow to this mistake in the life of Batman. Being a big fan since the first revival of Tim Burton 20 years ago, I was able to adopt different tones in character, gloomy or polite. This is simply not credible: too many effects, bad intrigue and so few questions. What is remarkable about Batman is the diversity of his skills and aspects of his personality: a detective, a criminal, a playboy, a philanthropist, and so on. D. Batman shows him only in the days of karate. And, by the way, why is Penguin capable of such virtuosity, jumping in the air, regardless of its magnificent obesity? And look at the Joker, Blanca's mix of Street Fighter 2 and the stereotyped reggae man, what kind of Batman fan could accept such a betrayal? Anyway, not me. Batman is much better off without the “The” article in front of his name.
