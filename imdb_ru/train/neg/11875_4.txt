Mmm, doesn't a big tutu of pancakes sound good? Maple syrup and canned fruit on top. Take a little. Mmmmmm. Take another bite. The other. The other. THERE IS. Eat you !!! Keep raking it up your throat until your face turns green with nausea. You just had an experience with Ellie McBill. <br /> <br /> I stumbled upon this show in the winter of '98 and immediately hooked me. Like this stack of pancakes, I ate it. But the pleasure soon stopped, because the character Ellie MacBeal (whom we see as sweet and sweet at first sight) soon becomes the most annoying, insecure, aching complainer whom you have ever met. (Call me a feminist, but I prefer my female leashes to have a spine.) The show's fun and tricks also get beaten up, the music of Vonda Shepherd (which really comes across your face) becomes annoying, and the continuous nature of changing and rewriting turns the show into hell soap opera. <br /> <br /> I advise you to take this show in small doses and get out as soon as it becomes annoying (and it will be). I made it through 2.5 seasons before my pleasure was completely spoiled. It was good while it lasted, but as a crazy, neurotic ex-girlfriend, she just became ugly after having overdue her appointment. <br /> <br /> And the next time you go to the IHOP, skip the pancakes. Order something useful, such as a fruit cup. He will sit with you much better.
