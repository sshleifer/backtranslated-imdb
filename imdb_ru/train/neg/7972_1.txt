I love movies B ... but come on .... it was not even worth the evaluation ... The ending was stupid ... B / C WASN'T REAL COMPLETION !!! .. not to mention the fact that it comes to life by itself ... I mean the absence of storm lightning or crazy demonic forces ?? Slowly, damn it, and then they just start killing characters one by one in about 15 minutes ... and I won't even start by killing one guy without a head ... and then you won't even see what Jigsaw does with its so-called "new puzzle" .... If only you have nothing better ... I would see how the paint dried before recommending this film "God forgotten" to anyone else ... oh, and to make its even better, in another film totem, you can see a guy who throws one creature out of the window in the basement scene ... it's b lo damn funny, and probably the only good part of the show this movie wasteland
