Even Bob Hope, accompanied by a bunch of great actors, cannot save this poorly written attempt at a wartime comedy, since his patented time has very little work to do. The plot includes a Hollywood movie star named Don Bolton (Hope) and his attempt to evade military service at the beginning of World War II, followed by his enrollment by mistake in confusion when trying to court the daughter of a colonel (Dorothy Lamur). Bolton's agent, played by Lynn Overman, and his assistant, who is depicted by Eddie Bracken, are credited with him, and they participate in various escapades related to the exercises, shot on the hills in Malibu, California. Paramount has made significant contributions to these efforts, hiring some of its leading experts, but the leadership of usually reliable David Butler was sluggish, and this should be due to the missing comedy element in the script. The shift towards the end of the film, to create an opportunity for heroism by Bolton, is still born with a bad stunt job and a camera showing. Oddly enough, Lynn Overman gets the best lines, and this veteran of the skimmers does them very well. Dorothy Lamour looks great and behaves well, and it's always nice to see and hear Clarence Kolb as her father, whose voice is unique on the screen or radio, but they can do little to save this film as damned as it is with an error in Script assignment.
