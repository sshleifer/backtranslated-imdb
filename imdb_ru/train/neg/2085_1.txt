This is one of the worst films I have seen recently. When a person says that he wants him to have super-powerful ability to orally have fun, I largely think that the film is in the field of children's fantasies of 14-year-old men. The bedroom scene was excessive and turned the intimate moment into a farce of biological functions, akin to letting gas flow in public. From the very beginning, every second scene was a discussion about how little they had had sex, how much time had passed since they acquired it, when their next sexual relationship would take place and with whom it should be. On top of that, the dialogue and acting was very poor and very forced, not felt, and they filled their lack of content with dull sex scenes. It could be really funny, because the concept is actually interesting, but here it is poorly executed. Please do not even think about taking anyone under the age of 16 if you need to go and see him.
