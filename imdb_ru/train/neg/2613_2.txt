This sequel is completely uneven, incoherent and incoherent in the “plot” (if it really is) and tries too damn to be modern (absurd, 21st-century style songs dominate) and pretty (yawn: there are too many fictional, exhausted jokes with animals.) The actors in his film are secondary to the plot for minors. Even Glenn Close (and she is usually very good) is watching this film, parodying itself as the original De Ville and leading role on Sunset Boulevard! This is a film that is not even pleasant to watch. This is a very good example of a bad and meaningless continuation. Even Basic Instinct 2 had a plot, a characteristic and an acceptable game. This is not This is bad.
