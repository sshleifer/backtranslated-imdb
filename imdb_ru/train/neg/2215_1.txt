This is a sad film about this woman who thought that her ex, whom she loved so much, was probably dead, but in fact his father-scientist had just cast a spell on him to turn him into this really nice shark guy. . It seems like in Beauty and the Beast. Perhaps he can use the stage for ballroom dancing and maybe a few singing candlesticks, but instead there are some pretty rough plants. They make this one girl really itchy, so she lets herself eat the shark guy instead of scratching the entire movie. The scientist guy is a good dad who is trying to reunite his fish son with a shark with a woman with whom he was engaged, he even arranges for them private time for sex, but the woman is really a pet snob and thinks that the shark is an ugly monster and wants nothing to do with him. She refused love! Just because he was a shark! I thought it was pretty sad how all she had to do was kiss him and he would return to normal life and they would live happily ever after, but this is not such a movie.
