Every year I watch hundreds of films, including many low-budget amateur abominations directly on DVDs that no one in their right mind would ever want to see. I saw thousands of films in my time, many excellent, many forgotten. Zombie Nation will I remember forever as one of the most hopelessly funny horror films I've ever seen ?? in fact, I still have not recovered from the experience of viewing it. <br /> <br /> The next day it seems to me that this is some kind of strange dream. Did I really see what I thought I saw? Why does the police work in the warehouse? Did voodoo priestesses really recommend zombies eating cheeseburgers? It's safe? It's safe? It's safe? <br /> <br /> I wouldn’t recommend Zombie Nation if you want to watch a “good” movie, nor would I recommend it as “so bad it’s good.” However, if you are entertained by the prospect of watching, probably the most unreasonably horrible movie ever? this is for you. Now, when someone asks me what is the worst movie I've ever seen, I’ll say Zombie Nation. <br /> <br /> Seriously ?? I think making a boring movie is more of a crime than a bad one, and Ulli Lommel deserves praise for creating a movie that really stuns you with its ineptitude. He really is Ed Wood Jr. in the digital age, and I, for one, cannot wait to see if he will make another film as ridiculous as this one.
