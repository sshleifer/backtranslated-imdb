Yes, indeed, it could be a good movie. Love porridge, (sorry for the poetic license, but not a triangle!) An interesting story, unfortunately, poorly told. The image is sometimes strange, sometimes normal, the picture looks crowded and short-sighted. The sound needs more attention (usually in Romanian films), light and color filters are sometimes poorly chosen. The soundtrack is short and does not help the action. About the acting game ... sorry, but the best actress is the mistress of the house. Others act immature and cannot convince the viewer. A game is poetic, when it should be realistic, and realistic, when it should be poetic. This is a picture for adults, told by children. Worry, only if extremely curious.
