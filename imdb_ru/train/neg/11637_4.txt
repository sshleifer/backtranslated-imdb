Uwe Boll did the impossible: he created a game adaptation that is at least partially true to the game; he turned a game filled with antisocial and offensive content into a film filled with antisocial and offensive content. So, as an adaptation, it is a success. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we are still dealing with Uwe Boll, so don’t expect the film to be really good. while he has his moment, “Postal” very quickly wears his greeting and becomes a pain to accept. <br /> <br /> In its essence, Postil is a satire for the United States, as a twelve-year-old child did. It seems that Ball thinks that offensiveness is linearly proportional to comedic value: the more offensive, the funnier and the more exaggerated funnier. This leads to a film that sets new levels of bad taste, being extremely hit and miss. Yes, some jokes work, but it looks like it's just luck. Among the main points is the director, making fun of himself, and people who are very badly hit by trucks and other vehicles. Low points include ... well, pretty much everything else. <br /> <br /> After the initial surprise passes, the Mail simply becomes a bore for observation. Yes, there is a good joke, and a good minute is ten minutes, but everything else consists of hordes of annoying characters who shoot and chase each other everywhere, which seems like an eternity. <br /> <br /> It is likely that you worked like a short film, but it is simply not enough for what lasts more than 90 minutes (although it seems that it is twice as long). There are good ideas and good attempts, but they are hopelessly lost in endless and meaningless action scenes and content, insulting only for the sake of this 4/10
