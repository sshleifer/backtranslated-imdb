If I had never read a book, I would say that this is a good film. BUT I read a book. Who ever wrote on the screen, destroyed the storyline. There are so many changes that it was not worthy of the name. Character changes, plot changes, timeline changes ... <br /> <br /> First of all, who were Henry and the investigator? They were not in history. Henry had Mitch's identity, but Mitch was not a police officer. No, you did it like this, Rose, helped “drown” his body and used it as a blackmail for Zenia against Roz. The real so-called blackmail was that Rose thought that Zenia was sleeping with her son and wanted her to leave him. Her son was also blackmailed because he was hiding, being gay from his mother. Her son was not even mentioned in this story. I also do not believe that he was his lover, Rose’s secretary. <br /> <br /> Tony and West were not together at the beginning. In fact, he was the first with Zenia when he was in college. Black apartment was their idea, Tony just went to visit. Here Zenia and Tony meet, become good friends. Tony hides his love for the West. Then Zenia went west with the money from Tony, then West and Tony got together. In the end, to marry, at some point, the West for a short time again leaves from Tony to Zenia. Just to be heartbroken again. Then go back to Tony. Zenia's blackmail for Tony was that Tony wrote a test paper for Zenia. As a college professor, she didn’t want it to work. I will say that the character who played Tony did it wonderfully. <br /> <br /> Charis's character was blond, not that it mattered. Zenia did not deceive her about cancer while Augusta was alive. No, she was there when Charis had a lover named Billy. Augusta's father, he was a deviant in the Vietnam War. In the end, after Haris had been taking care of Zenia for several months, something that had actually been the abolition of drugs. Zenia and Billy have a romance right under Charis’s nose, and they take care of both of them. Then Zenia turns in Billy to the government, and leaves on the ferry with him. Not with Augustus, Charis was pregnant with her. Haris also had a split personality, her real name was Karen. <br /> <br /> Zenya did not die from being cut into pieces ... she fell or could have been thrown back (we never knew) from the balcony and landed in a fountain. Her blood was almost pure heroin, and, most likely, she took a little ignorant and fell like money. This time she really was dying of Cancer. <br /> <br /> There were no memories of childhood or anything that aroused sympathy in the reader. The book was stripped to bare bones. Then do it in someone else's vision. Why can not you just write your own story in accordance with the fact that you made the film. It was quite different, and I’m sure more could be done.
