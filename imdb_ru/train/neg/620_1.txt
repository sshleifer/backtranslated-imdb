I saw it not long ago, and I must say: this film is terrible. I watch shit movies for fun. Scarecreow is not fun. Scarecrow is stupid. You have an incredibly banal villain who likes screaming horrible puns when he kills his victims (actually worse than the one in this sentence). He has his own luck story, which he uses to justify his killings. “Everybody is bullying me. The only girl who thinks that I am not a trailer loves one of the guys who bullies me. I want to kill everyone. Wow. OK, I'm exaggerating. But the mere premise for this film is enough to put it at the end of the list of crappy movies. <br /> <br /> In addition to what I just said, the child’s mother is erratic, he enters his mother and her current boyfriend dresses, the mother’s boyfriend tells him to leave, the child refuses, insisting that he doesn’t going to leave your house. The guy drives the kid to the corn field. He is killing a child right in front of his mother, his mother is screaming in horror, the guy is: "Oh, God! I did not want to!" Then he tells mom not to talk about it to the police. The kid was killed under the scarecrow. Thus, like any child who is killed under a scarecrow, he returns as a scarecrow killer with revenge. His victims were "never pursued in this way ..." (official Scarecrow line) <br /> <br /> Worse, this film was shot in as many as 8 days. That's right, 8 days. I was going to give this film 2, because, despite this, it has one or two saving moments. (These are spoilers, so I won’t spoil it for you if you really want to see this shit.) I could forgive a little for a bad game, terrible special effects, a horrible script and a bad camera job, but I just don’t respect the lack of effort at this level. <br /> <br /> This film is not as good as I imagine it. If you want to see an example of how not to make a film, or if you like to watch bad movies like me, then watch it at your own risk. All others should always be at a safe distance from this movie.
