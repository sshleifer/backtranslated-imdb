I saw this. This is not "good", but interesting in an understated way. The boys in it are quite naturalistic, but ... the graphic / gratuitous scene of the final group rape is disgusting and - oh yes - the arbitrary addition of WWII cadres is insulting. The real atrocity is real - this film is just brutal. However, the film has a look that can attract you. But it seems to me that this is the “New Clothing of the Emperor,” but in fact the opposite is true. The film looks good, but the direction, plot, content and final feelings that you remove from this film are meaningless. If the feeling can be empty - this is it.
