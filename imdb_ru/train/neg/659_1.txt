This film is a good example of the extreme lack of good screenwriters and directors in Hollywood. The fact that people were paid for making this junk shows that the entertainment industry lacks original ideas and talents. The idea that the audience paid to watch this movie (and as the idiot I rented the movie) is also discouraging. <br /> <br /> The obsessed teacher (3 years ago) kills the teenager's family because he wants her. For no reason, he kills mother, father, and brother. From the first five minutes you see a bad game and direction. Over the years, the obsessed teacher breaks free from prison. HMM - usually a bad letter - no one in the city he terrorized knows until the last minute. The obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a Fur Seal and can sneak around, sniff out people and with a knife is a super killer. Of course!!! Now the obsessed teacher for no reason kills the maid at the hotel, pins the messenger with a knife and begins to hunt down the friends of the teenager. Now there is an ideal way to make a girl love you. The obsessed teacher sneaks out of the hotel - again this is stupid, someday the policeman will recognize his face - but he is walking right past them. Now he kills two policemen near the teenagerâ€™s house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> There is not a single positive point in this piece of garbage. If any other profession issues a job of such poor quality, they will be fired. Yet these idiots make hundreds of thousands of dollars to write and send this garbage.
