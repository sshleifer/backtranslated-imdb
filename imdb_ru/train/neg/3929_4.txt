If this is all that Vatkhovski can offer the Matrix as a prehistory, then I really need to question the demands of all fans who believe that the films are meant to be recorded at a deeper level. The second revival, although visually stunning and beautiful, the plot is clich√© and ridiculous. How many times have we heard the story of people who rely too much on technology, people who are too eager for war, people who mostly destroy themselves? There is nothing new here. And I have one more question. Considering the plot of the second renaissance, doesn't it make the cars good guys ?! Machines for many generations oppressed by cruel people. They resist, win their freedom and seek to establish peaceful harmonious coexistence with people who reject them in favor of total war, in which, naturally, more intelligent machines win. If this is a prehistory, then we should not root for Neo, we should root for cars! People were cruel and oppressive, and cars were brave and compassionate. Since I do not believe that Watchowski intended to give preference to cars to people, I have to believe that the Second Renaissance was simply an erroneous attempt to create history.
