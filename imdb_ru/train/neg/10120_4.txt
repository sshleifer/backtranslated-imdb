This Hitchcock film bears little resemblance to his later unknown films and seems much more like a very old-fashioned story about morality. A young couple receives an inheritance that they believe will make them happy. They spend money traveling the world and living a very hedonistic existence. However, after some time, the excitement begins to fade, and the couple becomes meaningless and meaningless in its existence. However, from nowhere, when they are on a luxury cruise, the ship sinks and they lose everything - and eventually they become much happier, because now they value life! What a strange, stupid and preaching film! Personally, I would like to inherit all this money and find out if this does not make me unhappy! <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are relatively low compared with later productions - a rough film with low sound quality and a rather amateur acting game.
