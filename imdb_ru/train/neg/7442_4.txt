Sorry, this movie did not frighten me, it just annoyed me. It was so sad when I saw the potential, and it all fell into the background. Child! Father! Premonition! There was so much potential and a silt! zero, nada! I heard all this before. Fearfully! Not! I can scare myself alone, here, where I sit, than they might have in the film. Are there any men writing this figure that women should be so annoying? BUT? This film was quite atmospheric. Or, at least, it could be so if the director / screenwriter had bothered to do it. We could have good music, which would also increase tensions if someone made an effort. What I really want to know is why they get paid? Just give it to me and save all this trouble. Abandoned? ... No, we have betrayed
