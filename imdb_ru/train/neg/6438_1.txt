I really didn’t know what this film was about when I went to the theater to watch it (the hype about Satanism, etc., etc.), since the trailers in the last film that I saw looked quite interesting. Oh dear Roman Catholic mythology? I didn’t think about a good panic and, to be honest, I just wanted to see a really good, scary film, and not some poorly prepared religious farce who is trying to win cheap thrills when some chick bleeds every few minutes! <br /> <br /> I will try to stay away from spoilers (!), But it seemed to me very strange that an atheist who receives a string of rosary from a deceased priest can suddenly end up with wounds of Christ (not considered stigmata to be deeply religious ?? ) I mean, she hangs out with losers, loses, behaves like a typical rebel and others, and here she shows the wounds of Jesus Christ ?? Come on! <br /> <br /> Scenes with her head crucified, thrown back, screaming, blood everywhere, have become quite tiresome after a dozen times. It was neither frightening nor scary, just repulsive. However, watching him was pretty painful - these amazing scenes were very annoying ... <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION: If you are a Catholic, you probably don’t see it. If not, you still will not see.
