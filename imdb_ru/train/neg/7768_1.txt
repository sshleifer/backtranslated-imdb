This God-abandoned film is about three stupid millionaires who collect a bunch of people to play a deadly game, and the winner gets a million dollars. First of all, acting is terrible, and the film has no meaning at all. It's not scary at all, it's so stupid that it made me laugh, so he earned this 1 star. The film is not at all brutal, but rather sloppy and mostly focused on the female breast and some characters are very annoying and tearful. Plus, the monsters in this movie are so stupid and false and not afraid that I just want to throw something on the screen. Last but not least, a terrible ending. I don’t want to give it away if you’re really weird enough to see this piece of trash. AVOID ALL COSTS !!!!! <br /> <br /> Not rated (but must be R) for nudity, profanity and light odor.
