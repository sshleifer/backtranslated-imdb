Fulci is experimenting with science fiction and fails. usually in his horror-free films we still get a huge amount of blood, but not here. Summarize very funny scenes, for example, when princesses are forced to hold on to the bar for 12 minutes, and if they fall, they get electricity. the guy falls, and he has some kind of fit on the floor for about two minutes, while his friends, who are still trying to keep him, do not lift him from the floor. The city is an obvious model, but not a bad one. and the end of the explosion is at best ridiculous. And do not lead me to terrible battle scenes. <br /> <br /> 4/10
