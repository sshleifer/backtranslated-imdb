It is truly sad that this was perhaps the most budget-friendly Halestorm Entertainment, with whom I had to work. All participants should be fined for garbage, since all lost celluloid is useful only for filling garbage. Not only is the writing awful and the jokes awful, but the camera work and the quality of the film are amateur at best. The soundtrack sounds like it was created on some guys laptop. Worst of all, I experienced it all. I think, simply because I could not believe that I actually paid to buy a ticket, and that the theater in which I watched it actually agreed to show the “film”.
