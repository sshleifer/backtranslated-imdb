Worst movie I've ever seen since Gingerale. I believe this is horror / comedy. I pretty much predicted every scene in this movie. The special effects were not so special. I suppose that I can come up with an equally good effect from the fact that I am lying in the house. I would like to say something good about this movie, but I'm afraid not. Even Kulio should be ashamed of such a turkey. I think a little, I can say one good thing about this film - it ended.
