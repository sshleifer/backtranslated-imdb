With a name like “Attack on killer tomatoes!”, Anyone who does this will expect: a) a bad sci-fi film or b) a comedy making fun of bad sci-fi films. It is assumed that this will be a mixture of both, with a share of parody. Unfortunately, it will collapse very soon. <br /> <br /> You should never take this movie seriously, I understand that, but you think it's funny, right? I found that only some of the jokes or situations were funny (that is, parallel telephone conversations, the Russian Olympic spy eating steroid flakes, Superman, going from Lois, etc.). "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" tends to be a cult classic, but this does not happen. A cult classic is a film that is so different that it is understood only by a select group of people (or a similar description). "Attack of the killers of tomatoes," may appeal to any 8-year-old child with a bad sense of humor, so he can not be considered a cult film. <br /> <br /> There’s one good actress in the movie: Sharon Taylor as Lois Fairchild. She is a thin, clumsy reporter, but has a nice personality, loves to replay and is a natural comedian. Unfortunately, it is poorly used here. <br /> <br /> “The killer tomato attack” is not as funny as, say, “Amazon women on the moon” or “Kentucky Freed film”, but it’s so I have some funny moments, so I’m all Equally recommend to see it once. Avoid the director's film, it has interruptions from the producer of the film and some allegedly “lost” frames duplicated in a mock African dialect (it can be found in English on the printed tape).
