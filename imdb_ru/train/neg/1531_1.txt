This movie is so bad it made me vomit. Weakly produced, full zone of laughter. Why, in the name of God, are you faking a film that is somewhat fake (and damn ridiculous) as it is? The sets are ridiculous, the effects are so bad that they are not even ridiculous, and the game is farcical. This is a complete mystery why you even think to look at this piece of garbage. National Lampoon once created Animal House, which people still think is perfect and very fun. Now they were forced to star in television films like this clump of ****. Name your curse word, and it can be accurately used to describe this movie.
