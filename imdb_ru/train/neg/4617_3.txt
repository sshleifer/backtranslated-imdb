Eight Academy nominations? It is beyond belief. I can only think that it was a very bad year - even by Hollywood standards. With Houston as a director and Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner as presenters, I would probably swallow the lure and see it anyway, but the Oscar nominations really sold it to me, and as a result I feel clearly deceived. <br /> <br /> So is this a black comedy? Can someone tell me where the humor is in honor of Priji? This is definitely tasteless (shooting the cop's wife’s head is just another, supposedly comic break in this deliberate farce about the life of the mafia), but with the exception of the joke about “your favorite Mexican cigars” (which I imagine as an old joke for Americans who were officially forbidden to buy anything Cuban for the last 50 years) I could not find anything comic in nature - and I really tried. There are a lot of mafia clichés in my book, but cliché is not humor. <br /> <br /> Is this a kind of romantic comedy? Never. The characters and their relationships are so unbelievable and superficial that they are on a par with Ben Aflek and Jennifer Lopez in Gigli. <br /> <br /> This is a clever parody of the mafia? Not in a million years. The plot is just pointless absurd, not comically absurd, and usually it just reminds a really bad (and cheap) film about the mafia. It is more like a homage than a parody. <br /> <br /> With one-dimensional characters and a small amount of humor, written for them, the actors had to do clever accents and pull faces. Well, this is not enough; even when the face was drawn to this master of comic facial expressions, Jack Nicholson (repeated with a swollen upper lip ... now this should be a parody of Brando's soft cheeks in The Godfather? ... Oh! Who! cares? ... everything That I know is not funny). <br /> <br /> Throw in a slow, slow direction (this film drags on for 2 hours), some hopelessly stupid and clichéd dialogue, such as; “Do you remember Camora? Well, we are much more, we will track you wherever you go, ”and you have clicked your manners, and you will reach for this fast-forward button before you can say“ capiche? ”. "Prizzy Honor" is not Houston's "masterpiece" and, rather, a very bad last job. This is definitely one work in the canon of a great director that needs to be put on under a particular coat and thrown into the Hudson River.
