If this is the first of the Nemesis films that you have seen, then I urge you not to move on. The sequels to "Nebula" turn out to be no better ... It's hard to believe, considering that this record is "bottom per barrel". This movie is trying, but it's just not worth your time guys. Take a nap instead.
