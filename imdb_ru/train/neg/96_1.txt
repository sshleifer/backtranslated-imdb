.. oh wait i can! This movie is not for a typical movie snob if you don’t want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, such as “editing continuity” and “geographical matching.” I could not tell where I was in this film. In one second they are in the present, and in the next - presumably in the 70s, driving a modern SUV and wearing clothes that looked like clothes of the 80s. I think. I could not give it enough attention, because the game was just awful. I think it only attracted attention, because it has 3d, which I did not watch. If you are a b-movie lover, and by b-movie I mean a bad movie, then this movie is for you. This is a home movie, and the whole non-sensual style will make you laugh as long as you can stay awake. If you like Goddard and Antonioni more, just skip this one.
