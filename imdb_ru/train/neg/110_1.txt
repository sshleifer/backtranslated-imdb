I now have this film in the library, and I have not finished watching it. It is so bad that I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had completely lost her talent by that time, although she largely did away with this in Robin and Marian. This is the worst thing in this awfully stupid film. It really is only an interest, because it was her last feature film and because of the appearance of Dorothy Stratten shortly before her murder. <br /> <br /> There is nothing between Gazzara and his girlfriends but idiocy. Small signals, small bows and bows of a real comedy-chatterbox, for which it is the weakest and palest shadow. <br /> <br /> Who could believe that there are even the same Manhattan neighborhoods in which Hepburn dwelt so magically and even mythically? in "Breakfast at Tiffany" twenty years ago? The soundtrack from the old songs of Sinatra and the song of Gershwin, from which the title is taken, is too loud and obvious - you certainly don’t need to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the movie-music of the picture to know when the songs are thrown on you . <br /> <br /> “Returning to type” means returning up as well as decreasing, I think. In this case, the gorgeous European lady Audrey Hepburn is all you see about someone who used to be an actress and always a star. Here she even lost her star talent. If someone whose talent continued to grow during that period, for example, Ann-Margret, played this role, there would be some life in this, even considering the incredibly bad material and situations at the level of Mongoloids. <br /> <br /> Hepburn was a great man, of course, more than a movie star had ever dreamed of herself, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful movie actors. After this terrible performance, she continued to shoot a terrible television film featuring Robert Wagner's “Love Among Thieves”. In “They were all laughing,” as if she was still playing intrigue at 50 years old. Even much more conceited and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted on doing this, like Lana Turner, were infinitely more effective than Hepburn. Turner took her acting skills seriously, even when she was ill. Hepburn does not take it seriously, cannot be concerned about this; even her hair and clothes look sticky. Her last really good job was in “Two for the Way,” perhaps her most accomplished, if not the best in many ways. <br /> <br /> And the girl who plays the country singer is just sick. John Ritter is terrible, just recommending this film is nothing but to watch Dorothy Stratten, who was really pretty. Otherwise, the frequently used phrase of David Thomson’s criticism of “losing your talent” would never make sense. <br /> <br /> Ben Gazarra had lost all sexual attractiveness by that time, and therefore we have 2 films with Gazarra and Hepburn. - who could ask for anything less? Sandra Dee's last pitiful film “Lost,” which was low-budget two years later, had nothing to do with it. At least Miss Dee spoke in her own voice; by 1981, Audrey Hepburn's accent sounded silly; she continued to do “Peace Gardens” in PBS with Audrey Hepburn, and there her somewhat annoying accent works when she walks through English gardens with aristocrats or waxes, which “most of all I like when the flowers return to nature! 'as in naturalized daffodils, but in a real fictional film, it sounds ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Believing that Tiffany's Breakfast was such a deep, bright, poetic act with Audrey Hepburn, one of the most beautiful women in the world — she certainly was one of the most beautiful on-screen performances in the film “My Beautiful Lady ”, in a few episodes combining with Garbo and Dolphin Seyrig in the film“ Last Year in Marienbad ”. And then this! And her last short role in the role of the angel “Hap” in Spielberg’s film “Always” was just another female thing - trite, senseless and stuffy. <br /> <br /> I went to her memorial service at the Fifth Presbyterian Avenue Church, an excellent service, which was attended by a boys' choir performing the shakers anthem “Simple Gifts”. The only thing not listed in the program was Hepburn's sudden play singing "The Moon River" on the fire escape at Tiffany's Breakfast, and this caused a lot of emotion and real tears in the meeting. <br /> <br /> A great woman who was once a wonderful actress (as in “The Nun’s Story”) and one of the greatest and most beautiful movie stars in many films of the 50s and 60s, which became truly bad - and that's not all that in common. And, perhaps, only a great man who, while doing such things as film screenings, is trivial, nevertheless possesses a tremendous mind to want to ruthlessly point out flaws - which all her later work in the cinema contained in abundance. Most of the talk about Hepburn's misses about "My Fair Lady." But the film was supposed to be “Wait till dark”, in which Lee Remick appeared on Broadway. Never as famous as Hepburn, she was the best actress in many ways (Hepburn was completely incapable of playing something really disgusting), although Hepburn was at least adequate enough in that role. After that, all her actions went downhill.
