I rented this movie today, thinking it could be a good football movie, since I'm a big fan of football. Boy, I was wrong. This film is too religious and preached and REALLY unreal. This film pretty much says that if you are a Christian, you can easily get everything you want, for example, to become a great football player! You do not become a great footballer, you become a Christian and ask God, you do it through practice and hard work. All you have to do is ask for God, and he will give you something .... Pooh-Liz. This is not true at all, yes. I laughed a few times because of this embarrassment. The only funny part was when they were stupid (Schultz is a cartoonist? No, dude, who flew over the Atlantic, and so on. Etc.), But in reality this film was not so good. I do not recommend this, especially if you are not a Christian, lol.
