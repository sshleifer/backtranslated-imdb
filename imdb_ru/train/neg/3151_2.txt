“It was supposed to be you” is another sign that ideas are running out in Hollywood. This photo is about Charlie Hudson, a former policeman who became the author. When Charlie's fiancee leaves town, he is stuck with all the planning for the wedding. He spends a week in a luxury hotel and meets Anna Penn, a teacher who is also getting married. These two quickly become friends and intend to plan their individual weddings together. At that moment, when the plot becomes boring, Charlie falls in love with Anna, and she has to choose between safe life or Charlie. This film takes every romantic comedy ever made and makes you wait for the end of the film so that you can do something else. Mikael Vartan and Natasha Henstridge give truly mediocre performances, which makes this film even more painful to watch.
