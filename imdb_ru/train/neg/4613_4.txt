Well then what is it ?! I found the character of Nicholson superficial and, unfortunately, uninteresting. Angelica Houston's character has drained my power. And Kathleen Turner is a dirty, useless whore. The point is not that I "do not understand." Not that I didn't think that some ideas could lead to something more. This is a film in which there is nothing but the idea that we should accept these ideas, and that’s what the film is about. The fact that Nicholson falls in love with Turner is absurd, but on the other hand, it should be so. This, however, does not seem to me like.) Amusing, or b.) ... even remotely interesting !!! It was a waste of my time, so don’t let the hype get the better of you ... it’s a waste of time! With that said, the initial sequence of the church is quite beautiful ...
