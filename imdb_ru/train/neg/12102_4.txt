This film is really ONLY interpretation by Bill Maher of religion. There are some funny moments and some interesting moments, but do not go into it, waiting for an impartial discussion of religion. This is what I consider the worst documentary film - everything is organized in advance and in the editorial office, so that you can get the director's opinion, and not make your own decision. <br /> <br /> EDITING - This is very sliced, mixed with clips from pop culture and media to leverage thought. The interlocutor hardly has the opportunity to complete the sentence before it is interrupted by editing. The only people who have been given a real opportunity to express their opinions are those who say what Bill Maher wants them to say. According to Maher, when someone deviates from the Gospel, they edit it. <br /> <br /> INTERVIEWS - They are designed to represent the absolute MOST extremist religions. From the television evangelical to the final Jewish stereotype, to the chapel TRUCK STOP (Seriously. CHUCK TRUCK STOP). He chose the worst kidnappers of money, heavy extremists and those who do not have the budget to say no. And when he has a good person for an interview, he fucking corrects them. <br /> <br /> STEREOTYPING - all religions are depicted as stereotypes. Muslims were particularly hard hit. During the Muslim segment, he barely gives anyone the opportunity to speak before interrupting them himself or by editing in parts with the help of suicide bombers. ALL Muslims are portrayed as armed extremists during editing, and none of the respondents are edited fairly. <br /> <br /> COMPLETION - The message at the end is INCREDIBLY heavy, and although this is an interesting idea, it does not seem fair to countless people who are not religious extremists. Bill Maher explains himself while clips of destruction play in the foreground. It literally makes it clear that religion is stupid and dangerous, and that it will destroy the world. He also states that everyone who practices religion is stupid. <br /> <br /> With flaws in the film, he has a few positive points, and the humor, although very unfair, is actually funny. But know that the entrance is a very one-sided view, the look of Bill Maher, on religion. He finds nothing. He tells you what he thinks. <br /> <br /> 4/10 - A few good moments, but tough with an extremely irresponsible documentary style.
