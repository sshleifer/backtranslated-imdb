Surprisingly, this film still appeared on one of my hit lists. This is by far the worst No. 1 film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I was not bored before that (fortunately, no more than 1.5 hours), attempts at humor until adolescence this feature does not even come close, but one of the corners of my mouth is slightly tilted. After the first very awkward part, you tend to hope that the other parts will be at least a little better. You hope in vain that from there it will only go down. <br /> <br /> There is no story to tell in the film, and he repeats this story three times. One can only hope that by some miracle all the remaining copies of this film will be lost forever, and Trent Harris will never lay hands on the camera ...
