It's been a long time since I saw this comedy, and I forgot how stupid it is. I would easily put it in two or three of the worst Elvis Presley films. Presley plays Joe Whitecloud, a half-breed of an Indian bull rider who returns home to Arizona and a broken hut where his family lives and where his friends love to party all night long. His parents are Burgess Meredith and Katie Jurado, and his old Indian grandfather is Thomas Gomez. None of the three offers anything substantial, either comic or otherwise. The government has invested in livestock, but they lack the bull. Elvis can sing just a few completely useless songs, and he is haunted by a young crazy girl and her mother with a weapon. It's just a real mess, and the dilapidated neighborhood almost stinks of manure and does not make it much easier. One thing that puzzles me, however, is that Elvis seems to have a really good time in the film. It's hard to believe, considering that he was so upset that he was stuck in many films.
