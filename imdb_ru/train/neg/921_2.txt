I rented this one to see Vanes Talor again. She can act, but she has no chance in this clanker. The sequence of discovery is an elaborate shot of mountain landscapes. It must be from the stock archive, because the film was shot directly on videotape. Production values ​​make _Blair Witch_ look professional. There really is a funny animated statue, but no other effects are worth noting. This film is bad, but not funny. It would be nice for players not to mention this in their resumes.
