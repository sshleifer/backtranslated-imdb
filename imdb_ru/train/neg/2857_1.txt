I have seen many Sci-Fi Channel Original films since I started watching them in 2002 (my first was Sabretooth - which, in my opinion, is actually one of the most interesting features of the Sci-Fi channel). Their quality varies. Some of them are average, but decent (Sabertooth, Dragon Fighter, Never Cry, Werewolf, Marsh Devil), some are ridiculously bad, and some are really terrible. The planet of predators lies in the latter. <br /> <br /> Raptor Planet, a free sequel to the First Raptor Isle of the science fiction channel of 2004, is a subtle mess of a movie with a truly terrible game and lazy scripting. The effects that animate dinosaurs (a combination of puppet and animatronic, as well as CGI and Raptor Planet footage) are some of the worst effects I've seen in a low-budget movie. The effects of blood are even unconvincing. <br /> <br /> A group of commandos are participating in the story, who for some reason (I forgot why) travel to the planet of alien dinosaurs. That's right, dinosaurs - aliens. Dinosaurs in space. What's next, sharks in space?!? The rest of the plot is simple. Human composition is removed and eaten. By now, we have already expected this in numerous films and dinosaur novels, but this is the first movie about killer dinosaurs that I saw when I was really tired of all the dinosaur attacks. <br /> <br /> Although there are a few chuckles in this. There is one scene in which the Karnotaur chews a person (who has come alive from the original film), who in a few seconds becomes a giant predator. In addition, a little trivia, this is the scene where Stephen Baur shoots his own death scene from the first movie. <br /> <br /> Although “Raptor Island” was not a good movie to begin with, its masterpiece compared to its continuation. <br /> <br /> Believe me, when I say, this is possibly the worst Syfy movie ever broadcast. It's damn close to invisible.
