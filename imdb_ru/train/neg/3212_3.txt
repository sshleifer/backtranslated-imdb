I'm a big fan of the comic book series, but this film didn't live up to my expectations. I was expecting something like the heavy metal of 2000 ... slow motion, poor dialogue, a lot of blood ... but it was worse than I could have imagined. <br /> <br /> The storyline is almost the same as in comics, but the good points almost end there. The characters have no energy or spirit that caught my attention in the comic. The film covers only a small portion of the comic, and the portion used is slower and more boring than the later portions. The film focuses on minor events, rather than a more interesting general plot of the comic. <br /> <br /> With the right people working on this project, this could be amazing. Unfortunately, this was not the case, so now there is another horrible film that few people see, and even less like it. My copy will surely gather dust for years, until I finally throw it away.
