the only scenes that made me laugh, where those with Christopher walking in it (crazy director), in the rest of the film were just boring. In the first hour or so, nothing really happens. Jones Douglas really replays. Julia Roberts performs the routine work of the former ugly duck (yes, that's right!) On the girl next door (where have I seen this before?), Which gets the guy. to be short. I really didn't care. what happens to the main characters. If the cousin really fell from the building in a suicide attempt, the film could be more interesting to watch.
