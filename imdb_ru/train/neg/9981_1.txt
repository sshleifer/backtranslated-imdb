This film was declared a comedy and a riddle. It badly fails in both. The only mystery here is - why would anyone make such a poorly constructed film? The only comedy is the laughter that I heard when I saw how highly the readers appreciate it. Can there be two films with the same title? In the film I saw, a girl with pretty blue eyes and a plot that was not there appeared. <br /> <br />
