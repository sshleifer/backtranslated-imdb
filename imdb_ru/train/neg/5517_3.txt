I only rate this film as 3 out of pity, because it is trying to be worthwhile. I love to praise a great movie, and I'm not inclined to "male" films. Legally, the blonde was a great movie. The rule of Georgia, on the other hand, was an unorganized, weak, poorly written, unrealistic example of making a film in its worst possible form. By the end of the film I didn’t care who lied or something was decided. <br /> <br /> The most important thing in the film is a good STORY. This story is weak and never develops (simply because the subject is deep does not mean that the story is good). A good story has dynamic characters. A dynamic character is a character who undergoes major changes in character and is ready for these changes throughout the entire film. In the rule of Georgia, character changes were dramatic and undeveloped. Secondly, there were too many EXPERIENCED dynamic characters. Creating a really good dynamic character is hard work and takes a lot of time (you only have a couple of hours in the movie). This means that too many attempts by dynamic characters will pay too little attention to their personal changes. Even if I ignore the poorly written history and the garbage of weak dynamic characters, I can not even say that I liked someone. Every character was in disarray. It's good if you write “American Beauty,” but not when you're trying to make a dramatic comedy. Georgia was a terrible mother, her daughter was a terrible mother and daughter, and Lohan was a terrible excuse for a man (no, I do not weaken her because she was molested, shit happens to everyone, and we are all responsible for our own actions). “Dudley do the right thing,” the Mormon child had to have the courage not to jeopardize his religion and obligations ... and Simon, I mean seriously, what kind of guy allows a 17-year-old girl who has been bullied to stay (from if only he is an actor or politician). This movie is worth seeing if you want to remind yourself that a good movie is not!
