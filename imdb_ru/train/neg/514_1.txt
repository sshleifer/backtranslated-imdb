This is one of the most tasteless, dull, non-original and meaningless films ever created! It seems that everyone who participates in this project did not even try to make an attractive film. This is nothing more than a continuation of a tedious series of films in which an attempt is made to cash in on the success of Smokey and the Bandit, which, I think, is the best film of all. As for this film waste, Burt Reynolds sleeps throughout the film, Jim Nabors wasted, other actors are not allowed to do much, car racing is obviously captured, shots, humor is boring, and many of the scenes are more boring and lifeless than looking at the wall for two hours. “Stroker Ace” is just an extra movie, in which there is nothing unique or special.
