Any movie can become more naive than this? You cannot believe parts of this script. and its sooooooo predictably that you can tell the plot and ending from the first 10 minutes. the lead actress seems to want Barbie (but she doesn’t, the doll has MORE acting skills). <br /> <br /> The ease with which the character passes and remains in the music school makes the phantom of the opera novel seem like a historical biography. I will not even comment on the superficiality of the characters, but ONE good thing about the film is the performance of Madsen, who manages to revive a chalk-like one-dimensional character. <br /> <br /> The film is so cheesy that it sticks to your teeth. I can think that 13-year-old girls obsessed with Britney scream, "Oh, let us rest!" If we want fairy tales, there is always the book of the Brothers Grimm, hidden somewhere in the attic. ” I gave it 2 instead of just one for Virginia Madsen.
