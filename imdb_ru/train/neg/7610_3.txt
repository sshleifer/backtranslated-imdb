Actually, I don’t like films made by Sydney Pollack (“The Firm” is an exception), and I have never been a fan of Robert Redford. However, I thought that “Three Days of the Condor” should be good because of the large number of commendable comments he received. <br /> <br /> Although widescreen cinema is quite pleasing to the eye, and Max von Sidow makes good Working as an ominous professional killer, I found it all very frustrating. The film, of course, radiates a paranoid atmosphere, but everything collapses in a confusing plot, which seems to make no sense. <br /> <br /> The film also contains one of the most unsatisfactory endings that I have seen, which are actually sheets of the viewer hanging in the air. And what about this absurd romance between Redford and Dunaway? I'd rather watch Hitchcock's films five times in a row than watch this piece of trash again.
