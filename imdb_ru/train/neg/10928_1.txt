Just watched this movie, and what a waste of time. The film was predictable and slow. Basically, the Mormon bad news is basketball-sanctioned by the church. Instead of watching this movie, I should have had a root channel. The performances on the cameo, obviously, were caused by sponsorship / funding. This film had potential because of the outrageous behavior that Mormons demonstrate when they play basketball sanctioned by the church, however, since it has a PG rating, the true nature of the spectacle could not be transferred to the film. The game is terrible, with the exception of Clint Howard and Fred Willard. The appearance of Terle Bailey in the film was completely unnecessary.
