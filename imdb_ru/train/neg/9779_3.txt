Relentlessly stupid, off-budget "picture of war", created mainly to show the attributes of exciting Eva Meyer - is not a bad idea in itself - but this should be embarrassing for all who are connected with it. A ridiculous "script", performances that would not have passed the Christmas theatrical performance in elementary school, inept "fighting" scenes, a tangled guide by the usually competent documentary director Louis Clyde Stoumen - who is obviously not quite sure that he is making a comedy philosophical treatise about the futility of war or mocking T & A (by the standards of the early 1960s, anyway) about the journey of Eva Meyer's gorgeous body - and a general look of inattention and incompetence. Worth a look to see how Eva Meyer flaunts her stuff, but that's about it.
