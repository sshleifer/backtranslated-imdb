It seems that this film has become a workout training for the Coppola family. It seems he does not know whether there will be a Western "A" or "B." For God's sake, the hero's name is Hopalong Cassidy. William Boyd must be spinning in his grave. <br /> <br /> All Western "B" clich√©s are here. A pearly-toothed hero with two cannons in a white hat with a faithful steed (C'mon Thunder), a black-beard villain, a heroine in trouble, a ranch in trouble, a cowardly sheriff, bad guys on top, etc. <br /> <br /> Acting, with rare exceptions, is strictly from the school of acting skills by Yakima Kanutta. Chris Liebbert (who?) In the role of the hero and Louis Schweibert (who?) In the role of the villain look as if they felt at home in the "Running line of the 30s". The addition of Martin Sheen, Robert Carradine, Clu Gulager and Will Hutchins to the veteran team helps a little, but they are not enough to save. <br /> <br /> What is the meaning of Martin Schin / Robert Carradine's framing sequence? Should we believe that the character Tire was a ghost? What was the purpose of black gloves? It just didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> Being a great lover of westerns of all genres, I tried very hard to find redemptive qualities in this film. The cinematography was pretty good, and the settings looked very authentic. In addition to the hero and the main villain, the other characters looked genuine. <br /> <br /> If the producers were going to resurrect the character of Hopalong Cassidy, they might think about portraying him the way he was originally written. A gray-haired ranch hand from a dirty mouth with a chip on the shoulder, in the part in which Lee Marvin would have succeeded. <br /> <br /> What else can I say, except ... Thunder, about the eldest.
