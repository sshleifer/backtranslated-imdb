A somewhat awkward spy puzzle with a predictable story about the dangers of World War II. The secret is whether Jane Greystone (Nancy Coleman) has amnesia. The best acting is Raymond Massey as Dr. Ingersoll, a good doctor who has become evil. He heads a spy ring trying to get information from amnesic Jane, coded information related to allied activity. Will she tell? Can she remember? Moroni Olson (as Mr. Goodwin) is persuasive as Messi's accomplice. The role played by John Garfield (as Dr. Lewis) is simply a disaster. He seems to be so much mistaken that casting should be considered one of the worst in cinema history. Unfortunately, so talented actor plays a role that does not match his talents. The film is worth a look, despite the fact that it is half a spy and half gangster film, and despite the fact that it contains a parade of stereotypical characters. It's easy to forget, no amnesia needed.
