Bela Lugosi plays a doctor who will do everything to make his wife look young and beautiful. To this end, he feeds the brides during their wedding ceremonies so that they look as if they are dead, so that he can steal their bodies. I'm not quite sure what he does with the bodies. I do not remember that it was ever fully explained. All I know is that he extracts something from them and introduces him into his wife (I just guess that it is a spinal fluid. Spinal fluid was the rage of crazy scientists in the 40s. The rest can be guessed. < br /> <br /> There are a couple (well, really more than a couple, but I will write only about two) problems that I have with this film. One of them is the way Bela is used. Of course, he does a decent job in his own replay (by the way, the rest of the cast is just awful.) But it’s stupid to n hiding behind a hearse or slipping into a female reporter's bedroom. Also, why did he beat and / or kill every henchman he has? To make him look evil? Well, someone who kidnaps comatose brides doesn't really you need to make them look more evil. <br /> <br /> The second problem I have is the idea of ​​feeding brides. Why brides? Is a woman younger than 20 years old? Watching how Bela goes through these movements to to get my victims, I remembered the idiotic Rybak from the movie I know what you did last summer. ” In each case, it would seem that there would be an easier way to achieve your goal than using a seemingly impossible plan, which largely depends on circumstances beyond your control. (By the way, the alternative title of this film is “The Case of the Missing Brides”. I think this partially explains the need for “brides”).
