This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Robin Williams fit into the role, like a rhino in a pack, although his performance was still pathetic. Kurt Russell was more believable, but still was terrible. The plot left much to be desired, and the rest of the acting was also terrible. The only thing that was in this film for this was the trailer that spent 90 minutes of losing my life on me, which could have been better spent licking my head. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a gift and record this film, if you have one. If not, just be happy, no.
