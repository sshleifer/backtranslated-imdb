After five minutes of the film, you realize you've seen it all before. This is the boiler room. This is the FIRM. And this is the Devils advocate. And there are no new items. Except for the understandable Bill Gates-allegory. Conspiracies are always good for making films, but why should they be so extreme? The boiler room is a good movie, because at least for a while it seems realistic. In the antitrust case, everything is wrong. How realistic, for example, is your boss paying an impostor for being your girlfriend to make you work and control yourself? I would give 1, but the soundtrack is fine, so 2/10.
