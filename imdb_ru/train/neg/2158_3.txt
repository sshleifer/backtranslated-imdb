Now I see clearly why Robin Hood quickly failed. The first episode of this is probably the worst BBC ever showed. The initial scenes were about as intense, meaningful and clever as the fighting two monkeys, Robin Hood had no character, and the sword fight was just ridiculous. The worst part of the episode was that Robin Hood grabbed a cow dressed in makeup at the beginning of the episode - how many people wore eyeliner in the 12th century? No one. Since then, the series may have improved significantly, but this first episode quickly eroded people's hopes and, in fact, is a bunch of xp * p. The great hero of England was disgraced. <br /> <br /> "Will you take it?" I will not, for sure, if the BBC does not begin to understand what a wise investment is. 3/10
