It seems that in the US there are police officers from the UK who are all running around, armed to the teeth, and did you know that the CID employees change into uniform when they stop working and go through the pub! It should be one of the most unrealistic films with the worst image of the “real” British police ever imposed on an unsuspecting public. I see that Mr. Snipes may have needed money to pay his tax bill, but what the hell a good actor like Charles Dans was doing was a mystery. <br /> <br /> Worse than the worst budget B ”movie of the 50s. One and a half hours of suicide and time I will never come back. <br /> <br /> Avoid this like a real plague.
