Well what can I say. GOLD CHILD falls into the category of "so bad is good." Eddie Murphy is funny (and sometimes rather annoying lines), but you're still having fun. The dance of Chales has never been worse than its role as the villain Sardo Numsp (what is the name? ??). <br /> <br /> Who should watch the GOLDEN CHILD ... hmm ... Hard to say, but I would prefer that people who like awkward movies can have fun with a bad game, a bad plot and even more embarrassing dialogue. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
