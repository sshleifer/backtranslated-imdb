The film has a good start, depicting an interesting and strong Shannon Lee, and in the first half tells about two very nice minor characters. But then something happens, and suddenly Shannon turns into this obscene, second-hand bad girl, and the film is lost in its own context. In the second half there is not enough charisma, it is full of clichés, bad games, a terrible plot and even worse coordination of stuntmen. Not to mention the terrible actors they chose for the gang of the Chechen mafia. <br /> <br /> “Game of Death 2” was bad and clowning Bruce, but his daughter led him, making even more embarrassment than the double who played Bruce Lee then. I truly believe that she can do better than that, and I hope that next time she will take part in better production. <br /> <br /> If you are a real fan of action and do not care about quality, go on and watch this movie I personally looked forward to it, but I was just terribly disappointed.
