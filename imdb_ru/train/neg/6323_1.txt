This film is a bad memory from my childhood. This is one of those films that show children on a rainy school day, when you can't go on a vacation, and you prefer to watch anything, ANYTHING ELSE. At least it was when I was in elementary school. I just remember how I hated this movie. Of course, I have not seen him for 15 years or so, and they probably no longer use it on rainy days, but I just want to warn everyone: you better use it to put your children to sleep than to entertain them. Believe me, choose something else. Despite the fact that this topic is rather controversial, the plot is so boring and slow that I can not remember anything about it, except that I did not like it so much that, 15 years later, I felt the need to warn all of you of this
