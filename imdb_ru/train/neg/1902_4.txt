ATTENTION: OVERVIEW CONTAINS SMALL SPOILERS <br /> <br /> There is a parallel universe in which the film “Spirited Away in 60 Seconds” is a dark, sharp, controversial and independent film. Unfortunately, in this dimension, Gone ... is a bright, empty, filled with testosterone, starring moron with Nicolas Cage. <br /> <br /> For reasons that should not be interfered with, he and his large number of friends have four days to steal fifty expensive cars, only one of which has an alarm. This team consists of a guy with funny ears, who is rumored to be the new Superman; the guy who ran the electricity in the X-Files; former professional footballer and two iconic black men. <br /> <br /> Their enemies are policemen, car thieves and Bilborough of Cracker, his Manchester accent has shifted and expanded for American audiences, who are now used to this kind of thing since Daphne in Fraser. There is also Angelina Jolie, who has no character; except for being a repository of male sexual desires. It is assumed that she and Cage are an old flame, which is strange, since they never had anything suitable for a normal conversation in a 135-meter long film. <br /> <br /> Actually, the characteristics are so bad that whenever everyone has a “moment” when the violin plays in the background to emphasize the “emotion”. There is nothing wrong with showing that Vinnie Jones (who recreates his famous Paul Gasgoin maneuver with a “hand ball” and rather terrible when he is silent) receives only one line; not because his inability to speak is an integral part of the plot, but because his eloquent generalization of the film’s dubious morality after the appearance of a mute throughout the journey is amusing. Allegedly. After he struggles with this in his London rally, "not quite in action, but in the end," Cage mockingly says, "I always thought you were from Long Island." My ribs, as you can imagine, were nice and really tickled. <br /> <br /> In fact, humor is the most undeveloped aspect, from a tactless comedic cop to two iconic black characters. This is the biggest aspect of Hollywood; Why can't a black man appear on a major movie without constantly realizing his skin tone and not turning to him endlessly? The younger man, who, like the older one, speaks throughout the whole time, says: "We black people do not like the cold ... we are tropical people." Then he continues to express a desire to smoke a joint and look at the roots. He, of course, parodies the image of black people, but how funny is that? His older colleague cannot speak without referring to himself and, therefore, to his color, from a third person. "My black ass" is, "my black ass" is. Does anyone know blacks who actually say that? Did not think. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of the film sounds almost nonstop, and with increasing volume some tracks - especially “Don't Stop the Rock” (Apollo 440) —are so loud that in fact they are more audible. than sound effects and dialogue. The surround system even separates these two to such an extent that they sound like two different films coming together. There is no concept of background music, this is the sound equivalent of trying to watch a movie, while someone at the back of the cinema has a stereo system fully turned on. “Don't listen to this music, young man!” <br /> <br /> This is not the worst film in the world, and in many ways I liked it. Simply, it is predictable, lazy and reckless, with minimal effort in its construction. Obviously, box office expectations dropped significantly for this film. It seems that after several years of forced feeding, the general public is becoming aware of this fact.
