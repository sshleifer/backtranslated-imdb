What a weekend. Two days ago, I watched the first half of War Games 2: The Dead Code, now "While it Was Not." I am trying to decide which one was worse in terms of pain in the head while watching. I think “while she was gone” was worse. <br /> <br /> All this has already been said in other comments: unrealistic, illogical, and so on. D. - the only thing I really need to add is that at some point I started thinking more about evil guys. than about a woman, because I would recommend her for the Darwin Award if she really died (only the first half looked, so I don't know). Soon, I received two awards from Darwin (if at all possible) for her great folly. <br /> <br /> And, hey: Producer Kim Basinger? So, she not only knew the script, but was also responsible for bringing this waste of money to us, the people? I believe that people who spend significant amounts of money are evil, because this money could feed and clothe many people instead of hurting 80 percent of those who saw it in the cinema, and give 20 percent who are idiots A good opportunity to show how stupid they are.
