This may be the worst adaptation of the Broadway musical. Even the music was destroyed. Attenborough knows nothing about the theater - almost every shot and moment sounds wrong. I will say, however, that it is almost bad enough to be funny. <br /> <br /> Hairstyles are remarkably out of date. I cannot understand for the rest of my life what is meant (conceptually) by opening the film by the exterior of the theater, in which the Line Choir plays. Should we think that these people are auditioning for the Choir Line, which contains stories about people who audition? Oh no, the show collapses on its own. <br /> <br /> I saw the original production and listened to the album hundreds of times. Why oh why did they do it?
