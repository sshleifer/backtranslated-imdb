Val Kilmer, solid performance. Dylan McDermott, solid performance. Josh Lucas, solid performance. Three very attractive actors give decent performances. The problem is, who cares about the plot? John Holmes, notorious for his gifted abilities, a drug addict and a guy who, despite being infected with AIDS, continued to make films for adults, simply does not make an intriguing character. <br /> <br /> The story surrounds the events leading to and the consequences of the brutal massacre that occurred in Los Angeles in the late 80s, with which Holmes was associated, arrested and charged with murder and which justified. As with OJ, the blame factor, regardless of the outcome, was quite high in the “He did it” area. <br /> <br /> In this film, there is no one to sympathize, like all the mercenary criminal. There is simply nothing interesting.
