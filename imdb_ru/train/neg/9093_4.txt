I saw this film for the first time today and never heard of it before, perhaps because of its bad message. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the direction itself is pretty good, the actors played well, and the CGI (I'm not a CGI fan) is great. But this alone does not make a film. No history, no reports of beautiful exploited talents. <br /> <br /> Or should I make people remember that the art of a director is not only your vision, but also the ability to tell a story. And this is what the whole 7 minutes is missing. <br /> <br /> There are just 4 ratings.
