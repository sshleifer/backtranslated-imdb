This is a 30 minute show about one joke. Joke, cavemen don't treat rightly. HaHaHa !!! He can not dial the phone, because he is a caveman. Cavemen are not as smart as humans. Oh dear, these cavemen are so unsophisticated. There is no humor in this show. They can run away from this one joke for so long, and they already have Geico ads. This show does not deserve a time interval on the national T.V. <br /> <br /> This show is trying to be funny, but it is not. Watching this show, I thought it was similar to the Bachelor Show of the Gone Wild. That is, they go to a bar and try to sleep with many women. Crying caveman annoying. A caveman with glasses is too smart to be a caveman (HAHAHA !!!). All three have personality, but I can't understand why I don't give a damn about them.
