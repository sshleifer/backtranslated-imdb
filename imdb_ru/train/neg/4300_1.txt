Buford's Beach Bunnies did not work well in B & T films. As a fan of the genre, I was shocked to find that a small attempt was made to use the talents of young actresses. I mean it is the absence of nudity and sex scenes. What should the next generation of sad teens think about watching it on TV late at night?
