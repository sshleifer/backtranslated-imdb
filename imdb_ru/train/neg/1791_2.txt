What with the dark video at the beginning and from time to time throughout the entire movie? This is similar to someone pouring dirty water with a camera lens. <br /> <br /> Violence and nudity can alienate some people, but, I believe, along with mostly bad play, I consider it a good cult film. /> <br /> My favorite line is written by Tarquin the Vampire: "Alas, your breed is stupid." Well, no one should say “alas” in the film, unless they are English and do not live in the 18th century. <br /> <br /> Van Helsing’s and the Rally’s bad girl’s play is not bad. I also liked Master Little performed by Ron Little. Evil martial arts! Do not take it too seriously and you will like it.
