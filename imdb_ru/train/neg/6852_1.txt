This film is really incredible. I have seen so many cheap thrash films, especially a lot of “Full Moon” -Pictures, but “Dollman” is really hard. So much it turns out: a funny story, the actors are always on the verge of parodies and special effects! How long could I talk about them! This is a really bad movie, but also one of the funniest. If you're a fan of bad movies to laugh, you should see this. And don't miss “Dollman vs. Demonic Toys. It's really funnier and worse.
