When it comes to horror films, I am more than ready to suspend disbelief, ignore production values ​​below par, and skip holes in the plot in the interests of good panic. These films simply do not have a good scare to offer. It can not even be used as a camp. Bad dialogue, bad play, bad leadership, the killings were predictable and poorly organized, the music was annoying, the camera work was terrible, even the costumes were bad. I felt really bad about the actors who were obviously trying, but they had to deal with a terrible, contrived dialogue and an obvious lack of direction. I doubt they had some kind of rehearsal. It is embarrassing to look, and so boring that in order to reach the contrived "unexpected" finale, it takes a lot of exposure. This is pretty easy one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I usually do not write reviews, but this one was so bad that I had to warn others. This film is a waste of time. If you want to watch this movie, do not miss “Making from” -featurette. The screenwriter / director seems to have the impression that turning the killer into a woman was a kind of bold, bold step. (You can see it.) He and the actors spend half an hour examining this film, as if it were “Citizen Kane” of a new generation. This is similar to the way a group of three-graders listens to you behind the scenes of their Christmas theatrical performance. They really think they have created something substantial. This is sad, right? The only reason I gave this film “2” is because I think that “1” should be reserved for real atrocities, such as “Manos: Hands of Fate” and “Cosmic Insurgency”. So “American Nightmare” is not the worst film I have ever seen, but I must say that it is somewhere in the top five.
