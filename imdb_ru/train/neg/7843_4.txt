This is a weak continuation: it lacks the interest and light touch to the magnificent "Horse, called a man" in almost all aspects, and compared with each other, they hardly look the same genre. It is almost a parody of the first and tries to call various Indian ceremonies, but it seems that it tries too hard to hide the magic of the first. In this film, the tribe is lost and abandoned, having lost its homeland, modern life has invaded paradise, and they live in terrible suffering and misery. Perhaps this is the essence: the first film led us to a place where we would like to be, in a simpler time. This leads us to broken Indians in a pitiful world, and the White Man is a hero and a savior who rather nullifies the whole idea of ​​the film. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the first was that the white man learned and found that real civilization lies in values, not in Western materialism. In the second film, this is almost not enough, and in the end it turns out a weak film. <br /> <br /> Great disappointment.
