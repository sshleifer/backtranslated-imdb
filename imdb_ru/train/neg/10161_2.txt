I really did not expect much from watching this film, as people from Parkersburg WV, where I live and play, participate in it. This city is boring, like this movie. There were a few decent scenes in the film, but I was distracted by all the crappy landmarks they showed. This film could be good if it had a real acting game, but it wasnâ€™t. If you're not from Parkersburg and don't want to see what you see every day, then stay away from this movie. The dialogue will put you to sleep, acting skills will tire you to tears, and Stephen Soderbergh should lose some credibility after shooting at such nonsense. This is a predictable film without surprises. What you see is what you get, and this is a 73-minute tour of Parkersburg, West Virginia and Belpre, Ohio, without a narrator.
