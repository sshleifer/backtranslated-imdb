If I had not read his name on the cover of the DVD, I would never have suspected that this rather wacky and old-fashioned musical was made by a man so closely associated with the French New Wave. In fact, the film is so far from it that I wonder if in the 50s and 60s the authors of the New Wave absolutely hated this type of film - this is so ... so ... unrealistic. And it looks like it has little to do with many of his previous films. This is not necessarily bad, just very surprising. <br /> <br /> I was also a little surprised by the fact that some reviewers praised this film, especially when there were many best French musicals. The songs in this film were just not particularly interesting, and all the characters seemed so soft and stereotypical. If I had to meet with another rich man who was worried about how hard it was to be rich or get a good selling price on a designer outfit, I would break out. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that as an American musical, not every French musical is gold. This film is not yet another “Les parapluies de Cherbourg” (UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG or “Huit Femmes” (EIGHT WOMEN), and despite the presence of Audrey Tautou, I see no particular reason to recommend it as something other than boring weirdness.
