It is amazing how this film was nominated for seven Oscars and won one. Not because it is terrible, or because given the collective powers of the creative team behind it, they really have to earn them, but because in each nomination he was nominated for disappointment with Prizzi. Some argue that old Hollywood pioneer John Houston has lost him by this point in his career, but I donâ€™t buy it. Just last year, he signed Superb Under Vulcan, a dark character study in Mexico, which is considered one of the best he has ever done. Honor Prisci, on the other hand, is a film filled with stellar power, good intentions and a worthy script that turns out to be a serious disappointment. <br /> <br /> The general tone and plot of a gangster who fell in love with a woman hired assassin anticipates bizarre criminal acts that struck Hollywood by storm in the early 90s, but the script is too confusing in itself, the motives are off, and the whole story seems unsure of exactly what she is trying to do: romantic comedy, crime drama, gangster saga, etc. Jack Nicholson (focuses on Brooklyn, which is ideal for De Niro, but it sounds unconvincing because of Jack) and Kathleen Turner are in the main cast seems to be I'm in salary mode, just going through motions almost sleepwalking sneaks through some parts. Angelica Houston, on the other hand, feels better, but her actions are sabotaged by the motives of her character: she becomes a victim of the contempt of her fanatical father, it turns out that she supports her ex-husband, and then becomes a revengeful bitch who wants his head plate. <br /> <br /> The colors of the film are of washed quality, as was done in the early 1970s, and the direction of Houston is just as uninteresting as everything else. There is a promise behind this story, and perhaps in the hands of a director who is eager to learn that he could turn into something better, but what was left looks like a film that no one was interested in creating.
