The back cover of the DVD (missed this one when it came out) greets Hitler - Rise Of Evil as "The Triumph" (The New York Post) and "The Hypnotist" (Newsweek). <br /> <br /> Well Never mind the Mail, but really, who ever wrote this word in Newsweek in the same context with this world, hmm, art should be fired. <br /> <br /> I don't know where to start. Why try to paint a picture of evil Hitler with flowers that were not there? He was evil in order, but now his character is portrayed in such a way that it is often historically inaccurate (compared to his love for animals, a gentle and balanced attitude towards women), etc. <br /> <br /> Actors are good, so that you should feel sorry for them, as they are enclosed in their one-dimensional characters. Some kind of curse here with Peter O'Toole: this is the second time in his honorable career, when he ended up playing the old and failed leader in an unsuccessful film (or, to be exact, in television production). The first, of course, was the legendary Galigula. <br /> <br /> A list of historically inaccurate scenes alone would fill 1000 words allowed by IMDb, so I think I will leave it here. <br /> <br /> This is all right if it goes on TV and you have nothing else to do, but believe me, itâ€™s better to leave it on a shelf in your local Virgin store.
