As a relative who gives you a bad gift, the “Survivable Souls” has a heart in the right place, but he commits an unsuccessful execution. Stephen Carpenter’s writing / directing effort is freely borrowed from other best films such as Jacob's The Ladder and Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). For those who have not seen any of these films, I will not give up the premise; Suffice it to say that the situation here is not as good as in these two excellent films. <br /> <br /> Melissa Sagemiller plays the role of Cassie, who is about to go to college. Her current boyfriend Sean (Ben Affleck) and former boyfriend Matt (Wes Bentley), both friends, and Annabelle (cruel Eliza Dushku) were involved in a car accident after being pursued by two killers (?) In transparent masks. She is going through a wreckage, but during her college years they see severe trials in the hospital, and dead people appear and disappear, leaving her in a state of complete confusion: who is dead? Who is alive? What is it? <br /> <br /> “Surviving souls” look like a bad, already done, filled with blood, blood-spattered, eye-catching movie with teenage exploitation. True, he has his share of murder-persecution-victim (abundant, repetitive and stunning) scenes, but at least he is trying to create tension with ideas, rather than cliches, unfortunately, rather unfortunate. This causes confusion much more often than cohesion, as the story becomes confusing, messy and incoherent near key moments of mystery (as predicted.) <br /> <br /> Horror fans who take a copy, have no idea they are waiting for the film, who cares more about creating an uneasy facade of reality than counting votes. The authors are grateful to Carpenter for trying to create something outside of a teenage horror movie; It is a pity that he created a derivative psychological thriller. Sagemiller also deserves praise for having demonstrated strength in the central game, in fact developing her character and evoking some feeling of emotion as dissolving Cassie. It's great that the filmmakers are trying to do something else, but the film ends up a mixed and unsuccessful experiment. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
