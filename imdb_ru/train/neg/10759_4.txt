Despite the excellent touches to future design, Asimov’s smart premise and Will Smith’s credible cool performance, this film doesn’t meet expectations. Cliches are thick and fast; (waking from a recurring nightmare, a maverick cop has an icon withdrawn by a tough lieutenant, transferring more would spoil it - you can see the end of a mile) This film is also on stage - you will never feel that you have traveled anywhere; what should be a global catastrophe never leaves CGI Chicago explicitly. The robots themselves are good close ups, but the scenes of the “crowd” look more like a bad Disney - CGI overdone again and again. And if you can destroy the robots by breaking them, why should they introduce “nanites”? You know that this is a stupid movie when stupid questions start bothering you to the climax. It could be great, but it is less than the sum of its parts, mainly because of a completely predictable plot that could come from any action movie of the last forty years.
