I remember watching this film several times when I was very small, and there were parts in it (many actually) that I did not understand. I think I saw it once as an adult, and then I understood these parts. The only problem with viewing this as an adult was that it did not interest me at all. So what is this movie? Is it a children's movie? Not unlikely. It contains a language and topic that is not suitable for children. Is this a hyperbole of what each parent feels like he experiences with his children? Perhaps, but then why not focus more on the character of John Ritter, and not on the younger? When the 7-year-old child plays the role of the main character, in order to succeed in his audience, it must be a movie for seven and younger crowds, otherwise people older than this will not have any relation a child who is a whole year younger than them). I am pretty sure that this film did not work in the box office, and the reason is that it could not find a niche in the market.
