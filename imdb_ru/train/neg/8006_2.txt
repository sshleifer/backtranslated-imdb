This film combines action and horror well with comedy and drama in a unique way that teases more emotion from the audience than a typical horror movie. Unfortunately, with scattered story-telling, disappointing plot holes and conflicting scenes, this film basically made me disappointed and hardly “the greatest monster movie”. <br /> <br /> Let's start with good things: comedy, acting and special effects. From the very beginning, this film begins quickly and boldly. The opening scene - the origin of the monster - is very nimble and fast, paying tribute to the classic "ecological" disasters that have spawned so many other monsters. The speed is fast, which was a long-awaited break from the long and often pointlessly dramatic opening scene from other monster clicks, and allows the film to go straight into action. Within 10 minutes you get the "why", "where" and "how" of the beast and are ready for action. This movie is narrated. <br /> <br /> After the next short and successful episode, characters appear: a lazy son and his premature little girl, a kind grandfather and a talented sister (aunt) and, of course, a monster. The characters get to know each other in context, and their conflicts immediately become apparent, which allows viewers to feel them when the monster suddenly finds chaos in the area of ​​the river where they live and work. <br /> <br /> The monster itself looks great: an alien, but a friend - like a dog and a fish, carved by squid. The effects of this creature are unparalleled, and although it looks strange, it is plausible, and you could not “see its strings” in any place of the film. Even the movement of the monster was terribly familiar, like a growing and agitated rottweiler on linoleum, the monster penetrates the crowd, sliding on the surface, crushing and eating those who are on its way. When the path of the monster intersects with the family and there comes a tragedy, this is really a painful moment, and you may feel the need for revenge, but from that moment the appeal of the film begins to disintegrate. <br /> <br /> After the start of dynamite, the film quickly loses focus and continuity. Plots are introduced and then abandoned, characters change their position for no apparent reason, and comedy intertwines in dramatic scenes, confusing intentions, while obstacles appear and disappear, seemingly at random. <br /> <br /> With regard to comedy, let me say this: I’m ready to admit that most of the humor is probably cultural. I am not familiar with Korean humor, so perhaps everything was lost in the translation. However, as an Asian student in college and as a person who has lived in Japan for the past 5 years (still here), I would like to think that I understand Asian humor better than the average white guy. That being said, there were many parts of the film that I understood were supposed to be funny, but for me this is not true. <br /> <br /> *********** SPOILER ************* For example: after the initial assault, when the young daughter died, the family is at a funeral; everyone is grieving. A new character is introduced - a brother - and the tension rises even higher when it becomes apparent that the two brothers are at odds with each other. They both begin to grieve over their loss and begin to compete with each other because of the one who grieves more. In fact, this is a fun competition: two brothers who do not love each other so much that they even compete at a funeral - this shows the thorny nature of family love, typical of Asian comedy. This subtle comedy with a slap that makes fun of the family and ritual mourning should be funny, but it seemed really out of place in the context of the lost little girl. ************** THE END OF THE SPOILER ************* <br /> <br /> Then there are holes for plotting. There are so many moments in this film that are never explained, or, even worse, explained and frustrated only to end up powerless and meaningless. Finding an obstacle is not a good obstacle for a character, but you expect some commentary on this nature. Instead, the audience is engulfed in moments of anti-climax, when the problems simply “no longer exist”, and no one makes it clear that starting was ever a problem. Therefore, I ask you: why raise it at all? <br /> <br /> This was spread throughout the film, as problems created new problems, and suddenly the world of the film was filled with rival forces that never solved each other. Of course, the introduction of new and more serious problems is a time-honored tradition of storytelling, but if the introduction of a new arc leads to a forced reduction of another, you expect, at least, that the new arc will receive a full explanation. Not in this movie. Instead, you got several stories, each of which explained only 20% of the path, and, after all, the parts never converge to complete the whole. <br /> <br /> Again, I am willing to accept this much of this can be "cultural." Perhaps in the Korean narrative tradition, comedy is rooted in tragedy. It may be normal when stories are repeated, like a child who paints outside the lines on each page but never finishes them. It may be normal to present a problem in order to develop a plot, but then delete the problem at random without any visible solution or catharsis. Or maybe these are all signs of negligent work and bad storytelling in a film that seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves.
