Avoid this shit at all costs. Bad script, bad direction, bad game, bad editing, bad sound and bad music. Get an idea? This film is trying to be Western-style, it is not. He tries to be cruel, cruel, it is not. He tries to present a fresh look at the old genre, it is not. Actors try their best, and my heart turns to them. But with such meaningless material for work it is difficult to make something shine. For me, it all looks like a "new school of cinema, which is going to ignite the world" at the first attempt. The film makers of freshmen often bite off more that they or their budget can chew on. The best thing they can do is take a few steps back, review what is possible, and next time work within their limited budget.
