Stupid Griswalds wins the top prize of the game Pig in a Bag, and all fly to Europe, where they manage to cause one stupid catastrophe after another. Of all the ridiculous, ridiculous sequels spinning money, this one wins. The 1983 Harold Ramis film was a below average accident in which the inappropriate family went to the nightmare "Vacation" across the States. This time, Amy Heckerling (“Look Who Says”) is leading what turns out to be a terrible “comedy” that will annoy you more than make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Hughes script (with Rob Klein) Awful, and you wonder why the likes of the Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo were bothering with such a stupid project, since even Anthony Michael Hall and Imogen Coca made sense to reject the offer. Even the almighty Michael Palin is unable to take the process to any level that can be called entertaining. <br /> <br /> And yet, oddly enough, the “European holidays” were successful enough to justify the second continuation! Of course, this could not be as unbearable as this. You know, I have not seen the National Lampoon show, which was worth it. <br /> <br /> Monday, December 26, 1994 - T.V.
