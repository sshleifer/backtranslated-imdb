I have to qualify this title, now that I think about it. Checkout is not entirely useless. I had the opportunity to see him twice, and the second time I really laughed at the expense of the film. so I think it's worth something. as well as the excruciating pain that she caused me when I first viewed it. as another reviewer noted, this film is beaten in every sense of the word. not a single original idea was included in this film (which makes the commentary below about the originality of the package totally confusing me). a film is nothing more than a long line of stamps that are tied together and paraded like a film. These are definitely not the next clerks, this is definitely not original, and it is absolutely not "good, purely fun." the film is an absolute agony for the uninitiated (seeing it for the first time, the second time can be quite a funny, insulting way). when I looked at the theater, it was obvious that almost everyone, except perhaps the elderly, was completely bored or hurt by this film. during some particularly emotional scenes, for example, when Nick chewed on his mother, the audience actually cringe because it was so badly done. I even heard someone * moaning * in the theater, which I had never seen before. I don't care where you have the chance to watch this film, whether at a film festival, in an independent theater or anywhere else. do yourself a favor, skip this movie with a vengeance. unless you are like me and you just can't resist the opportunity to see what could really be the worst movie ever made
