Well, I watched this movie a little over 2 years ago, and now I pulled it from the dusty shelf to watch it again, and I must say that I really think this movie is good. This film attracted attention as a bootleg, “I know what you did last summer 3”, just like “Last hit” for Scream 4, and this film is not so bad. I mean, he had flaws, and, of course, it would be funny to release it in cinemas, but still this movie is not half bad for a midnight popcorn movie. I have some fears, and some really hot women, I might add. In addition, it demonstrates the new muscular image of Joey Lawrence, although, obviously, even the fact that he did not win any major Hollywood roles from him ... I feel sorry for this man, he had such a career in the early and mid 90s with heyday, some Disney movies and Lawrence's eternal brothers show ..... Joey Lawrence was a bit of a sitcom player, but then, like a 360-degree turn, his career went south, playing only budget films like this one. <br /> <br /> The film also takes you by surprise, it makes you think between the crew. In fact, there is a secret that someone knows, only disappointment in the end to find out the secret. It also confuses you about who the killer is, I had an idea, but I still don’t think the killer was who he was, but his motives in combination with the secret were a huge disappointment. Was there a secret that was revealed? This movie could be one of the best rated films. But I also enjoy college topics, and I also went to spring break in a summer house in a mansion the size of a beach house, similar to the one here, so it just made me feel sentimental about this film. <br /> <br /> A so-so slasher Good for a midnight movie.
