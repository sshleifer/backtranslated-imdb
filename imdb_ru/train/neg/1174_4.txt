"The Lady and the Duke" Eric Romer is based on the magazines of the English aristocrat who survived the French Revolution. But this is nonsense, with its strange, painted backgrounds and mannered colloquial tone. Most remarkably, this portrait of the era of terror takes place almost entirely in one distance from the real action; In this film you can see very few ordinary people and a bit of chaos, poverty and terror that unfolded in the living room of the persecuted but spoiled aristocratic classes. The result is often boring and, ultimately, does not give an idea of ​​the forces that sometimes lead societies to the verge of destruction; This is a disappointing film from a famous director.
