First, Zory Barber (Zeke) may be one of the worst actors I've ever seen. As a character who should be a fashionable, country martial arts writer and proud to be mysterious, why is he so hyper, overly dramatic and just awful? Did he know anything about his character before filming began? Is the director? Don't martial arts teach discipline? In addition, this film does not hit the target because of its slop jokes and insane humor. Hand in the toilet? <I> needle </ i>. Masturbation? Hm <i> Fast Times in Ridgemont High </ i>, <i> American Pie </ i>, the list goes on .... Bad dialogue: in one sequence, Eric says: “This is not my business, <i> but </ i>. ... "and 30 seconds later, Mia says:" Why is this your business? “Bad editing: shooting at New York for at least five minutes of a movie. <Hr> It’s also impossible to believe that the four main male characters would be a close-knit group of friends in any world. I cannot comment on what makes everyone laugh but if you like low eyebrows, simple humor in the bathroom and insults, by all means, enjoy.If you want something smarter, but on the same line, see <i> Boomerang </ i>. If you want a solid romantic comedy you can get by, choose <i> Tao Steve </ i>. But Anyone who thinks <i> Whipped </ i> is witty and accurate in dating, well, I can't agree at all.
