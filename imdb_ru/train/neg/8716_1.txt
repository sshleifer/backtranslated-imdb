I do not know where to start; the game, special effects and scripts - everything is as bad as you can imagine. I can not believe that the production staff has reached the point that he said: "Our work is done, the time for its release." I'm just glad that the first two in the series never made it to the UK. In fact, I would recommend watching this film so you can appreciate how well most films are made. <br /> <br /> I don’t know how other IMDb users would be scared when “terrifying” dinosaurs fight down the corridors with rubber arms flying around.
