And that's all there is. This thing is slow. Actors have abilities, they are simply not interested in making efforts. The plot is not so great, and it is hampered by the above-mentioned slowness of all this. Accents, if any, are British. Many of these people must be Danes. Good, good, accents are not so important. But there is a language. I don't think they used words like “yes” and “ok” in the days of Beowulf. And this, supposedly, cool weapons that the king gave him? Did he ever recharge this thing? Has he ever seen it? Or was Beowulf just a bad target? Well, his goal, at least, corresponded to the computer graphics used to create monsters. Those too were pretty off. Bad special effects. Bright spot? Just the one I can think about. Marina Syrtis has held on well for many years.
