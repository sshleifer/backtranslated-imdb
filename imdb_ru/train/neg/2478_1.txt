This movie is S-L-O-W. Most of the film actually waited until it starts. <br /> <br /> The situation was grim, the script was grim, the cinematography was grim, the plot was grim, the budget was low (not that all low-budget films were bad, but there was nothing useful in this film). <br /> <br /> The plot was more consumed by a vengeful, slightly abnormal hunter than the real Wendigo, who appeared very briefly at the end of the movie. This in itself was disappointing, since this “Wendigo” was just a fancy combination of wood and deer. Everything about the movie was boring. <br /> <br /> The parents of the little boy seemed rather alienated and at times seemed completely detached from their son. Whether it was because of a bad game or a bad script, I'm not sure, but it only increased my frustration and boredom. <br /> <br /> There was no food for thought, nothing that could arouse interest. Without real intrigue and cold, this film creaked so painfully that you didn't give a damn what happened to the end. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere of Wendigo reminds me of a boring film shown at the awards ceremony, the end of Mr. Bean's Holiday: an artistic and meaningless film, struggling to be deep and meaningful, but seemingly pretentious and boring. <br /> <br /> I would never want to watch it again. I only watched it to the end in the vain hope that something interesting might happen ... but this did not happen.
