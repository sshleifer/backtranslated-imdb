He pulled the guys from the inside! This is a lie! No one actually writes that it happens that improvisation is terribly wrong. I think that anyway. This film must be fake, because who would say that they wrote this script differently. Someone can imagine that the entire cast is sitting idle when the director and the screenwriters go over the storyboard. <br /> <br /> The director says: “Next, our inbreed villain uses his 24-inch machete to remove dust from our creepy neighbor. going to pull the guts out of their hole "<br /> <br />" Brilliant! "The whole cast announces. <br /> <br /> It can't be, no one writes it's stupid! Must be a cheat. <br /> <br /> I liked the part where the skinny introspective girl beats to death with a cast iron skillet she finds on the cave floor, I wasn't sure that outbred cannibal types are very worried about cooking. Perhaps this explains why the skillet lay on the floor at the dark time just at the right time. to kill the ugly carcass. It seems ridiculous that after to the prize guy is defeated by the martial arts expert porn queen and a pair of jocks of the door type he falls so easy to pan a skinny defenseless neighbor. <br /> <br /> What the hell is this guy Richard Greco doing in this? Did he fire his agent or something? <br /> <br /> Could someone explain to me the end, please, because I didn’t understand either? I can’t understand why the lovely girl hero wanted to kill the funny lady who was preparing her tea. It doesn't matter, I don't want to know.
