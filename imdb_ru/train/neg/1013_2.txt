If you watched this movie, you know why I said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus." Hehehe !!! Every time they said “Jesus, Jesus, Jesus” ... I laughed, thinking: “Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why did I make this film”? I can't believe how Oscar winners, such as Freeman and Spacey, appeared here in the background, while Timberlake and LL Cool J grabbed the screen. WTF is Timberlake? Awesome acting game! I think someone like Joshua Jackson could have done a lot better! This job was perfect for Joshua Jackson, and believe me, I don’t really like him ... but I really prefer the actor and not this android named Timberlake. And his girlfriend was petty, hollow and annoying to hell. I was happy when they both went outside. <br /> <br /> The story was fine, and I think Dylan Mac Dermott played his part of the bad guy very well. The film was interesting, but I think Timberlake messed up. Without him it would be very nice. <br /> <br /> By the way, everything was fine with the music, but suddenly, every time there was music, the film turned into an MTV video clip with flashes, low traffic and things like that. Something inappropriate for this movie about the cops, I thought. Maybe they wanted to make an MTV clip for Timberlake.
