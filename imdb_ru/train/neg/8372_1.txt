I can, strangely enough, unequivocally say that in all of my 51 years on this planet it was the worst (possibly a child) film I have ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> I took my three grandchildren to watch him, and even they struggled to bring a smile for all the painful 90 minutes. I'll leave the sexy Indians for another day, but they were as tasteless as the movie. They must pay you to see this, not you pay them. This is really terrible, there is no other way to describe it. The people who made this film should be held accountable for taking money under false pretenses. <br /> <br /> I apologize for my spelling errors, but I am so upset that it spoiled the time I spent with my grandchildren Best regards, Stephen
