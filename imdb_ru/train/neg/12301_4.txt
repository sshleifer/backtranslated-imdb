Oh, my ... bad clothes, worse synth music and worse: David Hasselhoff. The 80s returned with revenge in the American and Italian co-production Witchery, headed by the notorious Joe D'Amato from the director and the director with short shots (thank God for the little wonders) director Fabrizio Laurenti. Sold as a kind of sequel to Sam Raymi's The Evil Dead in Italy (nicknamed “La Casa” there), The Witchers offer modest products and a bad game. <br /> <br /> Combining a ghost story, Things and witchcraft, the film jumps ignorantly from scene to another, not allowing some seriously wooden actors and hilarious day and night confusions to slow its progress to an expected ending, culminating in a serious unexpected climax to the WTF . (I just like the expression on her face ...) It's amazing that Laurenti manages to gather some tension and malice in several - very few - scenes; Unfortunately for him, these few glimpses of light magic movies disappear quickly and effectively. <br /> <br /> Plus is felt when the blood hits the fan. This department is quite effective and fascinating in the classic style of the late-1980s Italian Italo-Gore paint, when everything was done 100% by hand and as shocking and bright as the modest budget allowed. I could only look with sadistic glee and a few ridiculous people in all the incredible ways in which the disgusting characters (and actors) were crippled and misused, one by one. I was only sorry for Linda Blair, who, it seems, was never allowed to try any other role other than this good old possessed girl / woman, ever in his career, or, it seems, while watching his filmography. <br /> <br Well, guys - not so much to tell, and even less to tell about yourself. Do not expect too much, spending a rainy day with it, and perhaps you will experience at least a little fun. It also helps if your rotten little heart is pounding in the rhythm of the horrors of the bloody euro of the 80s. And speaking of hearts, every film in which David Hasselhoff pierces a large metal object and bleeds heavily around the room and corridors MUST have it in the right place. <br /> <br /> This is my truth - what is yours?
