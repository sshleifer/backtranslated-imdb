This movie was the worst movie I've ever watched. I could not get through all this. I also think that the writer must have some kind of strange fetish for women writing with gagging ... I mean, what is it all about! I can't believe it was even done, and I hate that I paid a rent of 4 pounds. The picture and sound quality is terrible, the acting game ... well, it doesn't exist. It was a bad excuse for the film, and the scenes of piss, shit, and vomit resembled 2 girls for 1 cup. Uhh ....... AVOID ALL COST! The girls looked as if they were taken from the street, and they got only a part, because they would be ready to take off their top ... Although these girls have beautiful bodies, this, of course, did not compensate for the fact that their scream was terrible unconvincing and hurts my ears. <br /> <br /> It was (perhaps even worse) than setting up an amateur school without any right direction, and hey, thereâ€™s no need for a movie set, since everything revolves around the car ?! <br /> <br /> Definitely not one to buy people. Sorry if my first comment is horribly negative, but I can't find anything positive to say, and I would like to think that I can save someone else by spending their money, like mine.
