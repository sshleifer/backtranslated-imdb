I shot this movie from a blockbuster in one of those racks where you can buy as 5 films for 20 bucks. I have to say I got my money's worth on this. I was expecting a horrible dialogue, shit monsters and wobbly cameras. Well, as Meatloaf said, two out of three is not bad. <br /> <br /> The game is bad, though not as bad as in some films I've seen. Or maybe I recently watched so many low-budget films that I lost perspective. There are several episodes in which acting is terribly awful, but for the most part this is the level of play in high school. <br /> <br /> CG for Sasquatch in this film is probably the second worst part. The first thing I thought when I saw this (and noticed that another reviewer agreed with me) was that a man in a monkey costume would be better. Awkward stop motion animation would look better. <br /> <br /> So you can ask why I call computer graphics the second worst element. This is because the worst part of the movie is sound effects. They are loud, annoying and persistent. I was on a hike, I know how insects sound at night in the forest, and although they can be loud, they are not deafening, like the cacophony in this film. Usually, when the sounds of the “background” drown out the dialogue of the film, this is bad, but from what I understood from the dialogue of this film, I did not miss much. <br /> <br /> The action was infrequent and boring. There was no tension, like any feeling of sympathy for the characters. Speaking of characters, they were all cookies and lethargic. The only slightly attractive side effect was between ... in fact, I can't think of anything. There were one or two lines that made me smile, but that was about it. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was decent, a step or two higher than what you usually saw in such a film. However, he still had the quality of “home cinema” that you get with movies made for pocket changes and prayer. <br /> <br /> If you are like me and enjoy the meager genres of the budget genre and see this in the trash can, think about taking it. Otherwise, stay away at all costs.
