I'm a fan of Shakespeare, and I can appreciate what Ken Brana did to bring Shakespeare back to a new generation of viewers. However, this film does not convey the general intentions of the play with funny musical episodes. Add this to the fact that Alicia Silverstone stumbles about the dialogue (reminiscent of Keanu Reeves in "Much Ado About Nothing") and other poorly-played roles - all this is tantamount to a painful endurance viewing.
