"Stella", starring Bette Midler in the title role, is shameless. Located in upstate New York, Stella Claire works nights as a maid at the bar, pouring and dancing in the workerâ€™s lounge. One night, medical intern Steven Dallas comes in to look after Stella and permeate her. She rejects both his offers of marriage and abortion, sends him to a lucrative medical career, and herself raises her daughter almost in poverty. Fast forward to 16 years and the daughter grew up in a gorgeous, loving young lady. Dr. Dallas is not hidden from view, still maintains an unreliable but caring relationship with his daughter and ... I chat, and even worse, making the film somewhat interesting. The acting and writing is so excessive that you will moan in almost every scene. The main culprit is Bette Midler, but John Goodman is standing next to her as her alcoholic friend. Each scene seems more far-fetched than the previous one, right up to the finale, which is really a horn. Taken as a dramatic part, this film estimates no more than a D rating, but as a camp, it receives an unintended B +. <br /> <br />
