Now I got it. The name refers to the immediate reaction of each member of the audience after 68 minutes of psychological torture. Too hard an attempt to be terrifying, the lack of a good dialogue, even any fear about this really makes the “Screaming skull” look more like “snoring boring”. Although the mansion and the property, set in black and white, set a dark tone for the film, but that's all. The only thing that is scary about this flop is that people really made money on it! Remember the coffin guarantee at the beginning? This may be the funniest thing I've ever seen on the screen. The sad thing is that the audience probably hoped that director Alex Nicola was forcibly placed in a coffin, covered with nails and buried alive for his unfortunate effort. Jenny, who finds herself in this sad, terrifying situation, never arouses your sympathy for a woman whose anxiety is accused of a vessel being pursued. In addition, her husband John is taken off as an indulgent imitator, but this does not work, and he ends up by proving how strong he is by striking the helpless cripple around! Ah, Mickey, a few days before you could get a restraining order against property supervisors like him. This guy's approach is not very good or perhaps too much glue for the aircraft. Nevertheless, despite his strange personality, Mickey is probably the only good thing for this film, which provides a small sense of entertainment, and I can't get enough of a guy who says: “It was Mary!” And rummage through pots in the greenhouse.
