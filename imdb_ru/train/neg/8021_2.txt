Visually disconnected and self-contained, the director apparently decided to look for artificial depth in order to extend the 5-minute plot to the 81-minute snoring festival. <br /> <br /> The moments that work in this film are VERY limited, and the characters donâ€™t even feel real. How could you feel invested in a protagonist who became so surreal? <br /> <br /> Essentially And stylistically, it all looks like a bizarre sequence of dreams. Shaking irregular camera work, awkward silence and gaps in action, and what about the small image of a spider crawling on the screen? Whoever thinks of this, needs to go back to film school. It made no sense, only cheese, and not even stylistically worked with the rest of the film (assuming that the film even had a style that is a close challenge). What a flop.
