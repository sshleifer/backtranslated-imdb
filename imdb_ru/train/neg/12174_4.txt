This is a big step down after an amazingly pleasant original. This sequel is not as fun as the first part, and instead spends too much time developing the plot. Tim Tomerson is still the best in this series, but his ability to hold back in this record. The performances are all adequate, but this time the script brings us. The action is just a routine, and the plot is just a little interesting, so I need a lot of silly laughter to have fun during the movie "Trancers". Unfortunately, laughter is few and far between, and therefore this film can be watched at best.
