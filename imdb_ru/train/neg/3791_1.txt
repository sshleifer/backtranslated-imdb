I can not vote for it, because I will not look at the garbage from these people. They got my money in another movie (Mr. Jingles), and I swore it would never happen again. I consider it my civic duty to help people stay away from this garbage. Visit the forums on this film and read where the actors are trying to behave as if they were watching a movie for the first time. One guy even answers himself ... using the same name! There are scills on the forum that say itâ€™s as good as Shawshank Escape and Citizen Kane ... Even Close (by no means) If this is the company's second film, it should be better than the first one. This means that the third movie should be much better. Not so, I saw it. All I want to know is how you spread this garbage, using the same names all the time. Having fun with friends and making a movie on the weekend is good ... but don't try to sell this garbage!
