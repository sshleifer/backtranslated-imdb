This is another one of many B minus films labeled as film noir in the hope of generating some interest in something that is devoid of it. All aspects of the film - script, acting, directing - are mediocre. The action of the three leads wooden. I suppose that John Dall had to take up the film industry, but then someone realized that he had few talents, and therefore ultimately engaged in television. Lee J. Cobb, who is usually terrific, cannot rise above bad script and bad leadership. It is assumed that Jane Wyatt will be a femme fatale, but she will not be able to convince the audience. There are two odd-looking cars Iâ€™ve ever seen in the movie, the one in which John Dall is following in the wake of Lee J. Cobb, especially strange. DVD transfer is typical Alpha.
