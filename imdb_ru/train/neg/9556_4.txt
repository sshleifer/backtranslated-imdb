This film mainly pursues scenes and special effects. This is a very weak plot. Most of the computer conversations were just useless. I watched it because I was a big fan of the original war games movie, which was based mostly on computer facts and real computer terminology. In this film, none of this was not. Most of the computer scenes were not only impossible and extremely unrealistic for real computers and networks, but simply unconvincing. It looks like it was written by someone who does not understand real computers. <br /> <br /> The Ripley game was backward and in fact was just an arcade game. No real hacking, so what's the point? The film was boring. Lame sequel.
