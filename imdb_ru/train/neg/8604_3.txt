Mike Brady (Michael Garfield, who played a minor role in the classic "Warriors") - the first man in the community, who realized that in his small town there are killer slugs. Not just slugs, mind you, but a carnivorous killer is bigger than usual, mutated due to poisonous slugs (which still move as fast as regular slugs, which is not so bad, but I digress). At first no one will believe him, but they will believe. Oh yes, they will. <br /> <br /> Well, the killer slugs are right above psychotic sloths and right under Jonathon Winters, like Mork's baby in eeriness factor. So the absurdity of all this becomes apparent from the very beginning. The film is quite funny and has a kind of "so bad it is good." I appreciate that they explained that it was “Slugs”: a film, not “Slugs: a child’s game” or “Slugs: another white meat”. Probably not worth watching it several times and quickly forget, except to play in rather incomprehensible little things. Directed by Juan Picker Simon is more widely known for his previous films "People of henchmen" (which MST3K deservedly scoffed at) and "Peices" (which is perhaps the funniest bad movie ever made) Eye Candy : Kari Rose shows T & A <br /> <br /> My rating: D + <br /> <br /> More info on DVD: just a theatrical trailer for this film
