Awful Absolutely awful! No plot, no sense, no end. Looks like the director turned on the camera, and then the whole team went to lunch. Everyday. I'm trying to distribute this video, but no one will take it. I give him 2 instead of 1 because I like Benigni. Roger, I need to say thumbs about it. <br /> <br />
