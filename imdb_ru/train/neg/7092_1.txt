<br /> <br /> This film (and not the film clearly recorded on a cheap camcorder) may be one of the greatest cinema bombs in history. Caution: the packaging advertises the film as an erotic study of sexual addiction. The film is not a study of anything, and it is no more erotic than looking at your own warts. The script is senseless and tortuous, all the elements of the plot act as segues between the intended sex scenes. However, even sex scenes are lame, lame, lame. Except for the first, they are about three seconds long (then again, maybe my version was cut out) and comically overloaded. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a decent film, you do not want it. If you are looking for an exciting sex movie, you do not need it. Regardless of your life goals, desires or perspectives, you do not want to watch this movie. The way they made Roseanna Arquette, Natasha Kinsky and Ed Begley act in this smelly bomb is extremely surprising.
