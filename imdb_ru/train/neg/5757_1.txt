The film could be watched while Nicholson was on the screen. However, I had to struggle with a swoon from boredom, when the film depended on Meryl Streep to shoot scenes without Jack; she was as soft as she could. There was nothing special about the relationship between the characters; These characters were depicted earlier - and much better. It was like a scenario based on real life in the absolute worst sense: 90% of everyday life is boring and you shouldn’t write or look at them. Why did Efron feel that her life and relationship with Karl Bernstein was interesting enough to write about what eludes me. She may have written it as a therapy — for many writers the release of an episode from their life on paper is catharsis. Well: but why someone in Hollywood felt that this story should be removed, remains a mystery to me.
