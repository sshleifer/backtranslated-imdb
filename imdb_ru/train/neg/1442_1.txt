This is the worst shit imaginable. The novel by H. Ryder Haggard is very entertaining and dramatic. The creators of this useless film are not intently watching him. Well, old novels are not sacred, and creating their free versions is good for me if someone has their own ideas. If all you can do is change things and replace them with uninteresting and thin clich√©s, then you should stick to the original. If they had done this, this film would have been at least twice as good, even with the worst actors, and if it had been made in a studio with cardboard huts. But there is no imagination, only fatigue. Only collectors of Victorian novels turned into films should buy or watch it. <br /> <br /> I think this is just a hint, not a spoiler, so that those of you who read the novel understand what happened and what you can expect if you decide to watch it on TV or - don't let God is wasting money buying it. Gagul, the old wicked witch in the book, and some predecessor of Gollum turned into a beautiful girl!
