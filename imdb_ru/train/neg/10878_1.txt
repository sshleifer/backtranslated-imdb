This film is a big part of the robbery of the masterpieces of "demons", and this is the only thing that makes the film worth seeing. The acting is terrible, the scenes of action are speeded up, the scenario is almost painful and the budget does not exist. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is good, then you havenâ€™t seen a real horror movie yet, skip this and get a copy of the movie of demons.
