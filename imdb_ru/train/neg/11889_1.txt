It is very funny to watch “Beretta Island” as a kind of natural trash film. This is similar to the response to a movie like Jesse Franco in the style of b-movie. Bodybuilders strike back (! Face to face!) Jolts. Very, very, very stupid punch! : incredibly poorly directed shooting scenes look even better than hand-to-hand fighting. Chasing scenes is ridiculous. Saving scenes of beauty is incredibly stupid. Erotic scenes are very non-erotic. The main success of the film - beautiful landscapes and festival scenes. Do not miss: Arnold Schwarzenegger's joke at the beginning of the film and the list of relatives of Franco Columbus at the end. Special attraction: bare breasts. Almost forgot - Franco can sing!
