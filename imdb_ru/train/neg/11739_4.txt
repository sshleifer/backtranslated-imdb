Often reliable Leonard Maltin says that this is a “delightful novel” and that Sanders is “magnificent.” Maltin must have confused this film with something else. Sanders, as usual, is a fool and beautiful, you can imagine how he put a line concerning adultery: "Sometimes the chains of marriage are so heavy that they have to be carried on three," but the dull, wooden and dated describe this film more for sure. The plot itself, an autobiography with Saunders as the courteous jewel thief Francois Eugene Widocz, who becomes the police chief, but can hardly resist the lure of precious stones, is rather entertaining, but it has the same hollow historical Hollywood approach that overshadowed such periodic epics as “Marie Antoinette”, and, of course, the deplorable “Forever Amber” (which screams for a cool remake). Although, in his defense, Sanders struggles to add a bit of depth to his character, it's all to nothing. I am a shameless fan of Douglas Sirk, but this is 1946, and this is one of Sirk’s earliest American attempts, which lacks many of the characteristics that define his variegated, with chest turning boilers. Sirk had just wetted his feet and made some unforgettable films for the next ten years, until he hit gold with “Great Obsession”, and didn’t take his own step, bombarding us with such estrogenic festivals as “Everything the sky allows” * Written in the wind * and * imitation of life *. But "Scandal in Paris" - hardly his best work? relatively low budget with cheese sets and inefficient costs.
