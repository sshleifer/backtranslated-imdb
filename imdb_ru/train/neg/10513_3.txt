This film was a waste of an hour and a half of my time. I generally like cheap monster type horror films, but this film was a disappointment. The main disadvantage is the lack of explanation of the creatures. When they entered the house and found the person he could rent, they were told. In fact, he says nothing about them, except that they killed his parents, and if I did not miss something, I did not say how he managed to escape ... Not to mention that it does not give of the slightest concept or reason, only the survivor remains and essentially feeds the creatures after her own experience of death. It would seem that she would have the opportunity to leave after the "cross-incident."
