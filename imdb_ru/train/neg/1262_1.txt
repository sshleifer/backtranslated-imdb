This film has a weak plot, a weak characteristic and really weak special effects, and I wonder why I lost my valuable life by viewing it. There are random characters in it who add nothing to the story and seem to the director an excuse for inviting his girlfriend to the film. Robots are sad, and the main bot of the “hero” is turned on by a huge switch. If this film were not so bad, it would be funny, but there is nothing funny in it. The main antagonist is one of the only saving characters, and he is killed. It's sad when you support a bad guy, because he is the best to cheer on him. When all is said and done, it is better to leave this film on the floor of the cutting room or not to finance it at all.
