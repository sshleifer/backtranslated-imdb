Oh! With that it was a little painful to sit. It has a cute and funny premise, but it all goes to hell from there. Matthew Modin is almost always pedestrian and annoying, and he does not disappoint in this. Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville played surprisingly decent performances. Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly, by the way, tied. I know that this is how the parts were written, and it is difficult to blame the actors when the script and director force them to do such nonsense. If you have outrageous characters, that's fine, but you have to have good material for it to work. It is not here. Run away, shouting from this film, if at all possible.
