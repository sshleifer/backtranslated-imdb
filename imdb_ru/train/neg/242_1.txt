From a poorly thought-out storyline, which makes almost no sense, to a bad dialogue and scattered scenes, to the final dull, bad acting (even Peter Falk cannot find his way), “Finding John of Christmas” is better left unattended. The speech of Ms. Bertinelli without depth and emotion, like her colleagues in the film: William Russ as Brother Hank and David Qubitt in the love interests of Noah Jennifer Pizana as Socorco, daughter of the lonely father Noah, look almost unbearable, not to mention singing . But who can blame them with such material? The script of Michael J. Murray is a minor at best. <br /> <br /> Every year at this time I look for TV guides and I look forward to seeing truly classic Christmas and inspirational holiday movies on a small screen. Such films as “The Miracle on 34th Street”, the amazing “Shop around the corner” by Ernst Lyubich and, of course, the 1951 version of “Scrooge”. There is a classic Frank Capra "This is a wonderful life" and "Meet John Doe." Hey, forget the classics. What about "House Alone" or "House for the Holidays" with Holly Hunter and the excellent performance of Robert Downey Jr.? <br /> <br /> My gift to you as an advice. It would be better to spend your time searching for these films than searching for “Finding John of Christmas.” Merry Christmas!
