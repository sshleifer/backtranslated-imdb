This film is bad enough that can happen in real life. I really can not understand when we show this bad movie. I say it was bad, because there is some reason. 1. If Madonna was rich and can do whatever she wants, then why does she fall in love with this bad person. 2. How can a story script be so weak? She was so rich that she could do anything she wanted, but did not dare divorce her husband, which is very impossible. <br /> <br /> The words “I love you” mean nothing in this film.
