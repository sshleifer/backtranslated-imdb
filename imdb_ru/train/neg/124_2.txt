This film was probably inspired by Masculin Godard, Feminin, and I urge you to watch this film. <br /> <br /> There are two strong elements in the film: (1) realistic play (2) impressive undeservedly good photo. In addition, I am most struck by the endless stream of nonsense. Lena Nyman should be the most annoying actress in the world. She behaves so stupid and with all the nude in this film ... it's unattractive. Compared to Godardâ€™s film, intellectuality has been replaced by folly. Without going into this topic, I would say that this follows from the difference in ideals between French and Swedish society. <br /> <br /> The film of its time and place. 2/10.
