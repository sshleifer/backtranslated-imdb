I usually like Loretta Young's early films: her acting was then light and fresh, and she knew exactly how to wear clothes. But this one is just a loser from the very beginning, with the exception of the amusing move of supporting Glenda Farrell. Young is a hatch girl who persuades her husband-writer (Paul Lucas) to become a bridge player of the championship. This is not the most cinematic of the games, and the long, talkative middle part in which their marriage breaks up, almost kills the movie. <br /> <br /> Although there is one interesting point. While Lucas and Ferdinand Gottschalk begin their climax game, a series of quick snapshots show planes, trains, football games, even divers in the air, frozen in anticipation of the event. This is the earliest use of freeze-frame, which I saw in an American film. I wish the rest was so inventive and fun.
