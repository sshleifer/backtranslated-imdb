Good actors and good performances can not disguise a meaningless script, poor dialogue and patterns of behavior, turning into everything that you do not care. The most interesting character is David Berkowitz. Without character development - without growth, without interest, simply suffering without a specific reason, they do not teach us anything and do not even bother to entertain.
