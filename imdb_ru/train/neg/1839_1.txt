I couldn't wait to put this movie on my DVD player when I rented it. Then, after I started it, I could not wait to get it from my DVD player. Actually, I watched the whole movie. My wife and I continued to wait and wait for something funny, but nothing funny happens. The box was read as if it would be very funny. The premise of the film sounds good. Ben Stiller is funny. Jack Black is funny. How could this movie miss? Well .... this is not enough! This is the most unfunny "comedy" that I have ever seen. No one I spoke with thought that it was even a bit ridiculous. It's just a very flimsy film. Trust me. Avoid this .... AVOID IT !!
