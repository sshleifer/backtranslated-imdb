This film certainly has one of the strangest themes in history - right there, with Ed Wood's passionate protection in dressing up in the movie "Glen or Glenda?" <br /> <br /> Theme: Bridge game. Set Park Avenue plays it; Bohemians play it. Russians who speak Russian are very doubtful and have inconclusive accents when they speak English, they play in the restaurant where they work. <br /> <br /> If someone is not interested in the bridge, one - - even despite the great cast - is unlikely to be very interested in this strange film. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Paul Lucas are fine. (Well, Frank McHugh is an incredible ghost writer, as Lucas is an unlikely Russian.) But they are all sunk by the fetishistic script.
