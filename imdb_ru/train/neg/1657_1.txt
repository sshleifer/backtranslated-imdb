This film cost five hits on my "fan card". I saw it while in Virginia in the mid 70s. I saw it alone, so I was not distracted while watching. It sucks. It was the most ridiculous, complete waste of celluloid I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I know that others who watched this movie thought it was awesome. I offer you the following: if it was so cool, what was that ticket? End of discussion.
