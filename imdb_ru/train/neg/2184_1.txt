This film is a free collection of incomprehensible analogies and poorly thought out plot devices. <br /> <br /> History of the film: The director of this film was a pervert who traveled around the city in the filming of random women. When his wife discovered the film, he was forced to quickly make up a story. He claimed that he starred in the film “The Brain That Will Not Die”. In the end, his wife demanded that he show her his “so-called film”. That night, he quickly shot a few extra scenes with a friend, and was born The Brain That Will Not Die. <br /> <br /> I hate this movie! Summary of plot: the groom of the protagonist is killed in a terrible car accident (which he caused, ignoring the clearly posted road signs). He grabs her head from the wreckage and reanimates her. After reviving the head, he goes and raises a bunch of prostitutes. This is pretty much what happens to the rest of the film. In the end, he fights and is killed by a monster who lives in the closet. Monster appears almost without explanation. However, the monster saves a prostitute, and I guess they live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Notes to end: The final loan screen states that the film is called "The Head That Will Not Die." <Br /> <br /> I hate this movie!
