I was looking for a copy of “Forest” because I was watching a special edition of the VH1, I think, “Where are they now?”, And saw a video box flash on the screen during an episode with actor Corky Pigeon. He played a male ghost in this terrible horror, but I remember him from his character Freddie on the Silver Spoons television show. This click is a major disappointment. There's nothing here. In fact, it took me four months to watch it from beginning to end. I kept stopping it from boredom, putting it off and forgetting about it, then bumping into it and trying again to get through it. Obviously, the angle of this film, which was supposed to distinguish it from its analogs, was a supernatural element, visions. And obviously, it does not work here. I can not stand men leads. I kept expecting that they would look down at their palms during longer dialogue scenes to read the lines of deception. The situation at the beginning, when couples decide to go hiking separately, awkward and just stupid. I believe that the only thing that can be said about this positive is the scene when a guy falls and breaks his leg, you can see how the bone sticks out of his flesh. There's pretty good makeup. Dude, I really strive for positive. The only other off-budget horror film on a level as bad as this would be Home Sweet Home.
