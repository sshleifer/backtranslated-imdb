I was very unhappy with this step. Everything was terrible from the start. The comedy was unfunny, the action was replayed, the songs were not melodic. Even the storyline was weightless. From a writer who wrote successful scripts such as Guru and Dhum, I had high hopes. The actors worked too hard and did not help the film at all. Of course, Karina rocked the screen in a bikini, but for two seconds. I think Hindi directors should learn how action films are made. They are too exaggerating. In Chinese films, this style works because it is their signature sample. But the signature of the Hindi cinema is songs. A good action movie should last no more than two hours and cannot look unreal. But in the future I am sure that these militants will become much sharper. Also worth noting: comedies and action films do not mix, if not done correctly. Good luck next time.
