With a detachment of outstanding British actors and a pleasant photograph of Britain from the 1950s, I hoped and expected that this film would be more exciting. Unfortunately, I found myself stuck together for the wrong reasons - I could not believe how terrible it was. I must have watched thousands of old films and always ready to make allowances for them to be products of their time, but it was really hard. <br /> <br /> As others have noted, the main problem is that it seems he does not know who he wants to be: a tender romantic comedy, a comedy comedy or a musical. I was a little overwhelmed when Ginny Carson suddenly started singing a song in 15 minutes! At any level, this is implausible, neither the storyline itself, nor the fact that Daisy never had a single drop of threat in it. Other aspects that challenged plausibility included the role of the courteous Donald Sinden as songwriter (songwriter for God's sake!), The fact that he has Diane Dors for the bride and she seems to have no interest in her ( I mean Diana) Dors! Come on!) And a funny scene in the wording of the song. All this is stupid in the worst possible way. <br /> <br /> If I had to choose a favorite scene, it would be the scene that started at the very beginning with this wonderful actor Wilfred Lawson - after that everything went downhill in a big way.
