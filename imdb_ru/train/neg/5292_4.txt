I can not recommend this movie as a date. Gary Oldman’s semi-autobiographical account of life on an estate in southeast London is, frankly, Becketttian’s cruel story about one of the circles of Dante’s hell. At the center of this is Ray Winston, who has done similar characters before, but never so well. The film begins with the fact that he orders drinks in the pub-bar - and that's it - and you are already engulfed in a sense of frustration, self-loathing and barbarism, which he shows differently throughout the film. This is a master class in acting. <br /> <br /> Of course, stuck and destitute need a drama in a drama like this, and Katie Burke considers Winston his long-suffering wife, who absorbs and ultimately rejects his intolerable behavior. Charlie Creed-Miles makes a skillful turn, like a son-addict, setting fire to a fuse, Billy, although he must have been sometimes surprised that it was he who allowed himself. Gary Oldman directs the actors closely, maximizing the claustrophobia of their misery in the council. 4/10
