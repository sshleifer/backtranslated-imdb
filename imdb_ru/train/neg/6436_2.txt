I am a kind person, so I gave this film 2 instead of 1. It was, without a doubt, the worst film I have seen in a long time. There was very little plot, and the deeper areas of interest that were affected, that is, Jesus might have really wanted us to know, were embellished, and instead we were given heavy visual doses of sadistic punishment inflicted on our heroine (Arquette ). A full crucifix in the first 15 minutes would be more humane for both her character and the audience. The game was only there, and the manual was boring. And if I saw another drop of water or a pigeon flying towards the camera, I might have started shouting louder than Patricia.
