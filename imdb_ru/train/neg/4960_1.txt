I'm a big fan of Batman comics, and I was disappointed when I could no longer find “Batman: the animated series” on TV. I was excited to hear that there would be a new cartoon about Batman on TV. I watched the first episode on the day of its premiere, and I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> First, the animation is very bad. It looks like cheap, shitty Japanese anime. Again, almost every modern cartoon is like that. <br /> <br /> Character design is even worse. Batman is more like Birdman, Catwoman is more like Chihuahuawoman, Bane is more like red version of Hulk, Penguin is Kung Fu master, Mr. Freeze is some kind of undead with an iceberg on its head, and Riddler is gothic-like Marilyn Manson (which is funny, because I don’t expect people with riddles and puzzles to be Gothic). <br /> <br /> The worst character design is the Joker. They turned him into a monkey / crazy bob marley / kung fu fighter! It is assumed that the Joker is Batman's most deadly enemy, but in this show he is hardly a threat, because his crimes are so stupid and meaningless. In one episode, his plan was to put his joker poison in dog food! Oh, how evil! Batman is a fascinating and complex character because he is being pursued by the deaths of his parents, so he fights crime. This version of Batman, it seems, does not give rest to the death of his parents and is not at all interesting. He is also not a detective, but simply a fighter. If there is an enemy that he cannot defeat, he will not study the enemy to find out his weak points, like a detective, he will simply build a giant fighting robot to defeat them. Often this show doesn't even look like a Batman show, just another brainless anime that has nothing but meaningless battles. <br /> <br /> What I don’t like the most about this show is what they did to the villains. They took away everything that makes them pleasant and attractive, and turned them into stereotypical evil bad guys. Man-Bat is the biggest example. In the comics, he is a tragic scientist who studies bats to find a cure for his deafness. Experimenting over himself, he accidentally turns into a giant creature-bat. In this show, he is a mad scientist who wants to deliberately turn into a giant bat creature for no apparent reason. Almost all villains are like that; None of them, with the exception of one or two, has any real motive for their crimes. <br /> <br /> The worst feature is Mr. Freese. In the Freeze comics, he was just a mad scientist, until brilliant writer Paul Dini wrote the BTAS episode “Heart of Ice”, which gave Freeze a new origin, which made him a more tragic, three-dimensional and pleasant villain. The episode was so popular that fans perceived it as its actual origin, and it was even used in comics as its origin. Even that crappy movie “Batman and Robin” used it as its origin. In this show he is a thief of small jewels, before becoming Mr. Frieze. Becoming Mr. Freeze, guess what? He is still a petty thief! Great origin. No wonder they used it over the created Dini. <br /> <br /> As a Batman fan, I don’t like this show because it doesn’t look like comics, because I also like BTAS, the Batman cartoons that were followed by the films of Batman Tim Burton and obviously excellent movies by Christopher Nolan Batman. None of them were 100% loyal to the comics, but they were still very good. The problem with this show is not that it doesn’t quite look like comics or BTAS, but that it lacks any depth that makes other Batman’s media so popular. <br /> <br /> I gave this show so many chances, but the more I watch, the more I find it disappoints me. I miss the good old days when Batman’s cartoons were something everyone could enjoy.
