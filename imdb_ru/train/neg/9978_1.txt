Me and my girlfriend were stunned by how bad this film is. After 15 minutes, we would call it a termination, except that we were too curious to see if the film could redeem itself. This is not true. <br /> <br /> I cannot understand the praise given to this film. The letter was terribly awful and was written by some of the worst actors I have seen in a very long time. <br /> <br /> One thing that especially annoyed me in this film was that people often spoke there with each other. there was an unnatural pause between the lines. I understand the use of a pause to create a feeling of embarrassment (as in Happiness). It was not a pause - just bad direction. This film can actually be much better with subtitles, and maybe the best film for this film is the foreign market, because then meaningless dialogue and bad play are not so noticeable. <br /> <br /> I generally like these little fanciful films (“Real Blonde”, “Walk and Talk”, “Beautiful and Amazing”), but this film failed on many levels, and I consider it one of the most worst films i've seen in the last few years
