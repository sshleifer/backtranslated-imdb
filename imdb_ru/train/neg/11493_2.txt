“Störtebeker” is truly one of the worst television miniseries ever created on this planet. <br /> <br /> The acting is unbearable, and the historical background is basically meaningless: just two examples. Instead, it was a major city at this time, its best days have already passed. Secondly, Hamburg would never have been a city taking care of pirates in the Baltic Sea. Hamburg did not have access to the Baltic Sea, the main city at that time was Lübeck. <br /> <br /> But the worst of it all: the manual! How can you let an amateur, like this guy, make such a film? Impossible! There was not a single believable scene, the fights were ridiculous, and I could not help laughing at most of the harsh scenes. <br /> <br /> I cannot understand at all how a large television station can be so incompetent.
