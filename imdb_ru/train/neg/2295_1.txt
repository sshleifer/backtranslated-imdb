Senseless boring film with charismatic Mercurio completely disappears. Released on Thursday for a minute, maybe in one local cinema, and avoided by the entire population of Sydney, except for me and four others, BACK OF BEYOND is a project that would seem to be created by a producer who is looking for a fee. Local actors, such as John Paulson and Terri Serio, deserve better (well, that Paulson turned into the director of unsuccessful thrillers, such as SWIMFAN and HIDE AND SEEK), and Terry Serio, it seems, will never get Guernsey except the roles of bandits. But Paul Mercurio was to become one of Australiaâ€™s largest exporters on screen. Such roles are big disappointments, and films like this are just a waste of talent and time.
