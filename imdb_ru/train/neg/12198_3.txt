When I grew up with Beast Wars transformers, I wasn’t very familiar with the original Transformers, and now that I’ve watched a terrific movie, and now that I’ve seen the old cartoon on which it is based, I have to say that I like the original cartoon and live action more than Beast Wars. <br /> <br /> Not that I don’t like BW characters, I just think that characters like Optimus Prime are better than Optimus Primal. <br /> <I mean "CONVERT AND RULE TRUCKS!" sounds much better than "MAXIMALS MAXIMIZE!" The voice of the original Optimus Prime still makes me believe that he is a real commander, more so than Optimus Primal. <br /> <br /> In addition, Powermaster Optimus Prime is much more powerful than Optimal Optimus. Just look on the Internet! <br /> <br /> Megatron in the BW character was more like a humorous version of his more evil version in the original series. <br /> <br /> Besides being cooler, are robots turning into animals or are robots changing into vehicles and spaceships? Give me the original Transformers any day by Beast Wars!
