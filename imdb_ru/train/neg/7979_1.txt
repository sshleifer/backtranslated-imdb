This film was slow but tedious, and acting skills often went to the ham country. Redgrave's character was unattractive because the 60-year-old woman tried to compete with the 20-year-old Thurman because of the love of the hero Fox (why it's me). The title of the film was supposed to be "Little People on the Lake". The actors played like they were in rehearsal. Terrible predictable end of the download. I can't believe this on this site is like a comedy!
