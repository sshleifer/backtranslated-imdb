As an Altman fan, I have been searching for this film for years, thinking that with such a wonderful actor it should be at least a little brilliant. <br /> <br /> Big mistake. <br /> <br /> This is one of Altman's mixed confusions, randomly and improvisationally collected (or, as she feels), with the hope that all this will come together in the editing room. This is not true. <br /> <br /> As Maltin points out, this turkey is distinguished only by the debut of Alfre Woodard, who overshadows veterinarians around him. But besides that, avoid at all costs. (Which is fairly easy to do — it has never been videoed — as far as I know — and its cable appearances have the frequency of Halley's comet.)
