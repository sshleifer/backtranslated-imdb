I shouldn't have watched this movie. For some, the style of filming may seem skillful, but for me it causes a migraine. I think he might have had an interesting plot, but since I could not watch it for a long time, I missed a lot. Shimmering pictures and stopping filming branded my brain. I stopped looking halfway and wonâ€™t be back on the second try. I suppose that if I were at home alone in my own lighthouse on a dark and stormy evening, it could have been just a ticket ... PS my first review;)
