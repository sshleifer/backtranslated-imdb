Indeed, when it comes to this, this film is simply not funny. Josh Kornblut is the opposite of the funny, and yet he thinks he's funny. The plot to send 17 letters in the mail was good at first, until Josh's “look at me, I'm a fool” approach began to infect every scene. The Judas Priest joke may have been the least fun thing I've ever been involved in, and that says a lot, since she has a tough competition with all the other jokes in the film. As for the incredible abuse of the Pixies' Debaser, I can only say one thing: what did the Pixies ever do to deserve such a fate? What did anyone do with Josh Kornblut to write / shoot / produce / star in such a horrible movie?
