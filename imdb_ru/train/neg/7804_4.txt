THE TEMP (1993) did not engage in the theater business, but in any case it is a rip-off for a video that you did not want! Ellen Bradford (Mel Harris) is a new woman at Millennium Investments, a large brokerage firm that is starting to get useful advice from Secretary Deidreâ€™s wide-open view (Sheila Kelly). Deirdre turns out to be an ambitious father's girl who will stop at nothing to climb the corporate ladder, including cheating the main broker she cannot bear, and killing anyone who takes her side. She digs up skeletons in Ellen's closet, tries to cause problems with her husband (Barry Bostwick), kills, pretends to be responsible, kidnaps her daughter and tries to get her to take money from the company. <br /> Harris and Kelly demonstrate competent work, the cast is in order, and it is quite well composed, but this does not fully compensate for the script, which goes on a worn out way and presents few surprises.
