In a recent post written by a woman applying for military training, the comment “A woman’s life is no more valuable than a man’s life” was contained. <br /> <br /> This mantra of political correctness is incorrect, both the history and the biological show. Societies managed to recover from the heavy losses of their male population, sometimes at an astonishing rate. Germany was ready for a new war in 1939, despite the war of 1914-1918, in which more than two million of its people were killed. In the War of the Tripartite Alliance in South America (1865), Paraguay captured three neighboring countries until almost all of its male population was destroyed, but it fought in a dead end in the 1932 Chaco War against much larger Bolivia. <br /> <br /> However, no society could survive the loss of the female population. Only when the very life of the nation is at stake, women are sent to fight. Israel faced this situation in 1948, but since then it has never considered combat units for its defense forces, despite the popular image of the Israeli girl soldier. <br /> <br /> “G.I. Jane "- Hollywood fluff.
