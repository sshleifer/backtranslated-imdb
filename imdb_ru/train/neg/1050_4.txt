Nathan Detroit conducts illegal high roller dice games in New York, but the heat is on and he can't find a safe place. He relies on the chronic Sky Masterson player that Sky can't force a top-notch missionary Sarah Brown to go to dinner with him. Sky accepts the challenge, but both men have some surprises in the store ?? <br /> <br /> This is one of those expensive MGM musicals of the fifties in catchy color, with big sets, loud music, roles that transcend life and performances to match; Broadway is photographed on the big screen, if you like such things, but I do not. My main problem with such movies is just music. I love all kinds of music, from Albinoni to ZZ Top, but the Broadway melodies on the swing with the endless pah-pah-tah-dah blooms at the end of every fourth bar are not my cup of tea. It was written by the tag team of Frank Lessser, Mankiewicz, Joe Sverling, and Abe Burroughs (based on a couple of Damon Runyon's short stories), and although the plot is quite friendly, the songs are weak. For example, two Blaine numbers are identical, superfluous, do not advance the plot and do not cause ears (and are also blatant misogyny, if it bothers you). There are only two catchy tunes, Luck Be A Lady (performed by Brando, not Sinatra, as you might expect) and Sit Down, You're Rockin 'The Boat (nicely played by Kay), but you need to sit after two hours, to get them. The trump card of the film is the young Brando, who gives a thoughtful, relaxed presentation; he also sings quite well and even dances a little, and he is evenly combined with the always interesting Simmons. The sequence in which the two of them flee to Havana for the night is a long-awaited respite from all the noise, hustle and murder of vowels of Nou Yak. Fans of musicals can understand this, but in my opinion, a musical should do more than just shoot a stage show.
