I watched this movie about 30 minutes before I finally got tired of hitting my head with this movie. The soundtrack, the so-called "plot", and each actor. As if they all think that they are the main part of the film and shout "MEET ME!" again and again. The bad guy has his bad guy music and he says ominous things like a bad guy, in case you donâ€™t quite understand. A good guy does bold and noble things in case you didn't know that he was a good guy. And, god, the airplane scene. "MY HUSBAND WILL NOT MISS! Oh, my God! IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE WILL REACH THIS TO ALLOW THE LEGS OR GO TO THE TOILET OR ANYTHING, HE MUST BE TRANSFERRED!" (And yes, I know, his clothes were still there, but, to be honest, she woke up and started to panic, not even having time to look at the damn place he was sitting in.) <br /> <br /> Like a religious girl I want to apologize to the world for wasting the film on which it was printed. <br /> <br /> And I want to get my 30 minutes back.
