I have to say that although this film was formal with a plot stolen from films like Friday, the 13th / I Know What You Did Last Summer, this film was not that bad. In fact, it was not as bad as most of the horror films that Hollywood recently released. The killings, although sometimes too creative, were in most cases simply original. The cast was mediocre, as one would expect from low-budget features, but much better than what the much larger studio Artisan / Lions Gate offered. My only real complaint that was not related to the filmâ€™s budget, which must have been a small one, was the contrived ending of the "twist". Sorry, but this is what put this film in a bad category for me. The ending was just dumb and hooked. Before that I was a little bored, but in fact I liked it. 4/10
