This is one of the worst movies in history. Trite. Predictability. Apartment. <br /> <br /> The only thing that rated one point was a few good scenes that illuminated Barcelona. I believe they will use similar films in Guantanamo or in some other hidden CIA / NSA prison for torturing suspects. <br /> <br /> Often bad films have redemptive traits, there’s nothing in it. If I were in this or worked on it, I would change my name. Truly turd. It’s hard to write more than that, but I feel that world filmmakers need to be aware of this. On the other hand, it will be a great gift for people whom you can not tolerate. <br /> <br /> You can send it to politicians who you don’t like, according to the laws, ex-wives, teachers you hated, ex-employees, Dick. Cheney V. and many others.
