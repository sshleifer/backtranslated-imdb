In his first film after the death of longtime friend John Belushi, Aykroyd shows great fatigue, trying to make a character that would be easy for Belushi. <br /> <br /> Instead, “Dr. Detroit” gives us a book professor, Aykroyd, disguised as a strange, brutal pimp to ward off an opponent known only as a mother. This is bad enough, but it also has classes for teaching, a school dinner for the owner, four ladies for the evening to protect, and lunch for the pimps (or something like that) for a visit. It's no wonder Aykroyd seems dazed most of the time. Why should the viewer be alone? <br /> <br /> It was in this film that Aykroyd met his future wife, Donna Dickson. At least something good came out of this chaotic mess. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars. Want a good Aykroyd, see "Blues Brothers". Want to bad, see "Doctor Detroit."
