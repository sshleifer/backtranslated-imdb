Like last year, I did not manage to go through all this. So, Chris Rock as the presenter was a good choice, because he was vaguely attractive. Or rather, of all the boring nerves packed in a theater, he, at least, did not make it to the Top 10 most boring ones. On the other hand, many of the speakers were in this cherished Top 10. I did not know that all this was done using autocue (although I knew it was written from the script), but it was really awful to see these supposedly good actors, unable to put in an expression, turn away from the cue and stumble upon simple words if the director is not, she left). The night of fancy dresses and boring speeches was long and tiring, Beyonce Knowles recorded some good songs, and there were very few decent speeches and clips. Adam Sandler receives the "worst presenter" award. <br /> <br /> For the help in writing this review, I would like to thank mom, dad, lawyers and pedicure for believing in me, and I would like to note that I have a high metabolism and, of course, I did not starve for of the month. I'm not going to cry ... thanks.
