(Spoilers) <br /> <br /> I was very curious to see this movie when I heard that it is clever and witty. I had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom that I felt. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film would be acceptable: to show how relations between a man and a woman develop, through all the problems and difficulties. what two people living in a big city can experience. What made me dislike the whole movie was two things. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the film was so mundane that it looked like it described the problems that the couple had to solve in a day. Nowadays, all by itself has become boring. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the general negligence of production with hardly understandable dialogues. <br /> <br /> Too bad.
