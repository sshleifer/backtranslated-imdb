One can only assume that Robert Osborne is contractually obliged to express admiration for even the least attractive films in the TCM library, as this explains his praise of the “merits” of this “charming” film during his presentation when I saw it on cable television. Seeing that any old film on IMDb receives the status of “classic” from a number of amateur amateur reviewers, I thought that there was an urgent need for a more honest review of this film. <br /> <br /> This is not from your father's "Shop around the corner." Despite all my quibbles with “You Got Mail”, he still eclipses this as a remake in almost all possible options. For those who saw the original, the flaws will be even more obvious. <br /> <br /> From one of the loudest Meet Cute sequences that I can remember, I saw (a sad attempt at “humor”), this film goes on the wrong foot, and it never returns to the leg. This "musical" qualifies only as one in the rare sense of the word. There are many instantly forgotten musical numbers, and then Judy sings "I don't care", waving his arms as if in a fit. The Christmas song she sings in the store is probably one of her best songs here. Miss Garland has been remarkable in many musical films, but here she seems terribly erroneous. Initially, the role was to be played by June Allison, and Judy was definitely not able to fill the shoes of the old part of Margaret Sullavan. Van Johnson also turns into a rather soft performance as a second-rate Jimmy Stewart type. Leading never reach the chemistry of Stuart / Sullavan or even Hanks / Ryan. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that knows (some of) the notes, but not the music. It seems he does not understand why the original worked, and even feels the need to add another possible love interest to the Van Johnson character in order to make things too complicated. Replacing the remake for the plot of the infidelity of the original is a battered conspiracy device involving a priceless violin. It is almost embarrassing to watch this, and I feel as if it was shot from the episode of “Troika” by someone with Delorian and a capacitor. This is actually just an excuse for the carnivorous carrion. Even a scene with a large resolution between the romantic characters can not cope. After watching both films, you will understand why they called it “The Touch of Lubich”, and NOT “The Touch of Robert Z. Leonard.” <br /> <br /> Avoid this and review either the original film or the Judy Garland film. early films, unless you are an iconoclast who likes to see the once great star falling to the ground.
