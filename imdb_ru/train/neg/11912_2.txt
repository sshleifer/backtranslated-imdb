The story behind this film is very interesting, and in general the plot is not so bad ... but the details: writing, directing, continuity, pace, action sequences, tricks and the use of computer graphics all reduce the cost and spoil the film. br /> <br /> First, the sequence of actions. They are all rather uninteresting. Most of them consist of someone getting up and shot, not trying to escape, fight, dodge, or something else, even if they have all the time in the world. The strings seem just soft for something made in 2004. <br /> <br /> CG has very well-visualized and animated effects, but they look cheap because of how they are used. <br /> <br /> Pacing: everything happens too fast. For example, “El” learns to fight for a couple of hours, and from the very beginning can do back flips, etc. Why is she so acrobatic? None of this is explained in the film. Like Lilith, she wouldn’t need to do a back flip — perhaps she couldn’t, because she had wings. <br /> <br /> We have such episodes as a woman who is knocked down by a car and got up, and just went to a deserted room with a sink and a mirror, and then dug into the throat, and all this for no apparent reason, and none of the spectators didn’t care that the car hit her (and then he felt the side effects of another, exploding car) ... "Are you alright?" asks the driver: “Yes, I'm fine,” she says, bloodied and disheveled. <br /> <br /> I watched it all because the introduction promised me that it would be interesting ... but in the end a bad execution made me wish for something else: Blade, Vampire Hunter D, even that film with the vampires where Jackie Chan was a comic relief because they managed to stop my disbelief, but it only made me want to wake the director, and give the writer a good talk.
