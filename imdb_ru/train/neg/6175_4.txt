Was it a thriller, as I thought when I saw the cover in the video library? Was this food for thought, as the author might have tried to do this? Not really. So what was it? It was a very average film that had a lot of potential, and it was well directed, but disappointed with a confusing story without strengths, from the middle to the end, with poor acting performance from a serial killer, which, although it seemed too zealous in some points put better throw performance in general. It was a good cinematography, with nice colors, cool hi-tech things, beautiful scenes, but left you confused about where it goes and where it has just been. And with feeling, let's just quickly finish it at the end. Good to see if there's nothing else on TV.
