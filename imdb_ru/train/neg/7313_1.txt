I spent 5.75 to watch this shitty movie, so I just want to know a few things: <br /> <br /> What was the point of separating the dog in half at the beginning of the film, the disease had nothing to do with the division in half. <br /> <br /> What’s the point of getting Karen into the barn, she’s already completely infected her room, they could just lock her where it would be safer. <br /> <br /> Why does the Hermit run through the woods, asking strangers to help him, when he could just ask his relative, a pig, to take him to the hospital? <br /> <br /> Why not? Does any of the characters want to go to the city to get help when things start to get worse, are they all so lazy? <br /> <br /> Even if Paul is threatened by a guy with a gun because he is spying on him. Paul's wife could just send Jeff or Bert back to the house to ask for help. the girl he loves is getting worse. <br /> <br /> What was the point in the box? <br /> <br /> Why did Jeff go back to the cabin after he left, when everyone else got infected, if first, he was such an idiot to leave, wouldn't he have returned home? <br /> <br /> If the police did their best to gather the children and burn them on the fire of Yama, why they threw Paul halfway into the river, it wasn’t even necessary for the plot because the water was already polluted. <br /> <br /> Whoever makes lemonade from river water, this shit has dirty leaves and mistakes in it. Why two children couldn’t just use tap water, it was also polluted, so a silly ending would work anyway.
