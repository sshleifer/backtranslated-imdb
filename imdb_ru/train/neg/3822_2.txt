Being a fan of Buster Keaton means breaking your heart regularly. Most of us meet Keaton for the first time in one of the brilliant feature films of his great independent production period: “The General”, “Navigator”, “Sherlock Jr.”. We recognize him as the greatest person in the history of film comedy, and we want to see more of his films. Here the grief begins. After 'Steamboat Bill Jnr', Keaton's brother-in-law Joseph Schenk made him sign a contract that put Keaton under MGM control. Keaton became another self-employed actor performing other people's scenarios. Then his alcoholism increased. After Steamboat Bill Jnr, Keaton never again made a really first-class film. Several sources describe a potential masterpiece comedy that Keaton claimed he * almost * should do at MGM: a parody of the Grand Hotel. Biographer Tom Dardis provided compelling evidence that Keaton invented this story. <br /> <br /> The gap is widening because over the years of Keaton’s long decline, he has just come up with a good film from time to time ... such as his short comedy The Grand Slam Opera. I continue to look for the lost footage of Keaton’s dramatic scene with Spencer Tracy in “This is a crazy crazy world”: a sequence in which embittered police officer Tracy calls the old retired rogue (Keaton) and tries to recruit him to steal Smyler Grogan’s money. These shots are almost certainly gone forever, but I continue to watch. <br /> <br /> “Talk easy,” alas, this is one of Keaton’s films from the very beginning of his decline. MGM tried to create Jimmy Durante (who, by coincidence, played Smyler Grogan three decades later) as a new comedy star. Unfortunately, MGM tried to create Durante, combining it with Keaton, whose comedic style was simply incompatible with Durante. (I’m a fan of both.) Throughout his career, Durant was a merciless theft of scenes: commendably, he knew that he was built at the expense of Keaton, and Keaton was the only partner Durant had never tried to overshadow. . <br /> <br /> Keaton was often subjected to cruel frauds. In “Talk Easy”, he plays a didactic and without humor a college professor named Post (because he is as wooden as one), who receives a letter informing him that he inherited $ 750,000 and he should go to New York York to demand. Is he calling to check it? Does he even check the postmark? Not; he takes the savings of his life from the bank and rushes to New York. As soon as he left, Post's servant confesses that he wrote a (fake) letter to get Professor Post out of his rut! <br /> <br /> A post that thinks he is a 3/4 millionaire intersects with Jimmy Dodge (Durant), who is trying to create a musical revue, but he has no money. Characters whom these two brilliant comedians play on the screen simply cannot mix. Keaton plays one of those eggs (like Mister Logic in "Viz"), which intellectualizes everything. Durante plays one of those annoying hepatats who are unable to make any direct statement, because the script requires him to always speak slang. There is a horribly unfunny dialogue scene in which Durante is trying to talk to Keaton about money, but - instead of talking directly about it - Durante should use more and more contrived slang terms such as “cabbage”, “wheels” and so on. .. while Keaton, of course, has no idea what Durante is about. I pay tribute to Keaton: his own dry and dusty prairie voice, his smooth Kansas accent, is absolutely perfect for the character he plays here. <br /> <br /> Sydney Toler, who looks much slimmer and more beautiful here than he would have been just a year later, is impressive, like an excitable director of revue, controlled (checked) by Professor Post. Henry Armette, whom I have never found funny, is even less funny here than usual, offering a gag with dull recoil. Thelma Todd impressed me in a more atrocious version of the role she played in “Horse Feathers” (a much funnier film). Edward Brophy, one of my favorite character actors, wasted. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem with “Talk easy” is that the supporting characters behave completely inappropriate. Keaton's lawyer appears in the Durante Theater with an urgent message for Keaton ... but he is not there, so the lawyer proceeds to divulge Keaton's personal files to the first stranger he meets. (Dismiss this lawyer, Buster!) In another scene, Professor Post - the guy who is considered the bankroll of this musical - slips into the dressing room of the chorus girl, and all the chorus girls immediately squeal and hide behind. I know for sure that * modern * choir girls would never have reacted in this way, and I seriously doubt that choir girls in 1932 also behaved in this way ... of course, not in response to the “angel” controlling their wallets show. <Br /> <br /> SPOILERS COME. About half an hour after the unfunny “Talk Easy”, the great Jimmy Durante sits down at the piano, grins at the camera and makes this characteristic little sweep of his head when he starts to play a tune. This is the moment when I thought that finally this film would finally calm down, and its goal is to entertain us. Unfortunately no. Most annoying is the ending of this film, which uses the most beaten and implausible cliché in the whole comedy: the one in which the completely incompetent dumbass becomes a star comedian because of his incompetence. (Keaton would be forced to reproduce this cliché in the episode of the “Theater of Directors” in 1955; Chaplin already used it in the Circus.) <br /> <br /> I almost cried - in anger and sadness - for lost Opportunities in Talk Easy. Mainly out of respect for the work that Keaton, Durant, Toler, Brophy and Miss Todd have done in other places, I rate this film 2 points out of 10. <br /> <br />
