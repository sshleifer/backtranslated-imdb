Although the title of this film has Flying Guillotines, it has nothing to do with the original Flying Guillotine (1975) and its sequel Flying Guillotines II (1978). These two originals are masterpieces of kung fu cinema and still stand out as classics. This is a much lower copy of the original, and even as a regular Kung Fu movie, it is below average. <br /> <br /> Firstly, there is not much acting in this movie. This is one meaningless battle scene after another, and the flying guillotine does not even play a big role in them. The story of some of the Shaolin monks who track down some of the villains who left with the holy book, and the evil prince who owns this book, is part of the plot. The same evil prince has plans to lure the monks and use flying guillotines on them. <br /> <br /> In its title there are four films with “Flying Guillotine”. This is in my opinion the least quality. The design of the "flying guillotine" in this film is different from the other three, which indicates that this film was created by another character from the other three. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in the film, except unintentionally ridiculous due to poor production. <br /> <br /> It is better to skip this and see two originals.
