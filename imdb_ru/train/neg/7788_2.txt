I noticed that in all other reviews of this film, it is mentioned how “useful” and “interesting” it is. These people need to leave the house more often. I don't know why they want this empty, tasteless, brainless piece of fluff. Pat Boone has absolutely no acting talent, and his ineptitude has surpassed only the inability of his colleague in the film Pamela Austin, the former model (another reason to ban the insidious practice of imposing mediocre models on an unsuspecting mobile public, foul habit, which, unfortunately, persists and to this day). A good cast (Terry-Thomas, Edward Everett Hortion and others) is trying hard to figure it out, but to no avail. I noticed that the two directors divided the loan, although the word “credit” is not the word that I would use (as well as the “director”). As for the "useful entertainment", there are many types of films that do not torment your loved ones, forcing them to come to terms with it. Find one of these movies and skip this one.
