When discussing a movie called “Snakes on an airplane,” we must indicate in advance that snakes are damn important to the plot. <br /> <br /> We have very bad cgi snakes who don’t look and move. like real snakes. snakes are scary because they seem slimy, they crawl, slide. these snakes do nothing of the kind. they slide like a video game. they are cartoon snakes. I would go so far as to say that even someone who had a serious phobia against real snakes would not have found these terrible <br /> <br /> why would you want to include extreme close-ups of cgi failures ? why not rely on uncertainty .. all ethics "less means more." or, even better, why not just make them look good? and then perhaps still use them sparingly. <br /> <br /> One look at John the carpenter. here we have real mucus and bloody horrible proportions. It takes 20 years, and we get this smelly nonsense sfx "snakes on the plane." when are these people going to wake up and smell the coffee? special effects go backwards! <br /> <br /> Of course, you can say .. but the film is a joke, you know? Of course, I agree with this idea, but do it well! In addition to the above, there is a shitty dialogue in this movie. and the music and sound effects are not creepy or memorable in any way. <br /> <br /> I could cope with any other actor participating in this film, except Jackson. what was he doing there? the man who starred in the fiction 10 years ago. is it a career growth? Do you offer people value for money? not. I would like to know what Tarantino thought when he was halfway to this filthy movie. <br /> <br /> The current generation seems to have very low expectations. and Hollywood seems to offer them exactly what they want. Coming out of the cinema, I saw some advertisements about some really awful looking future releases, including ... DOA: dead or alive, (another) animal film cgi, called "washed out", and another comedy called "click ". In addition to this, I saw several terrible trailers, including one for (the other) crap British horror / comedy. I really have not seen the film industry in such a mess as it is now. <br /> <br /> I expect this film to go on sale in the 6-pound DVD section for 6 months. and if you expect to see a black comedy with tons of great looking snakes and some kind of bad ass, cool dialogue from Samuel Jackson. forget it.
