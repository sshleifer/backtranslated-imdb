I am always upset by films that are clearly written by the same sex. Especially when they obviously do not conduct enough research to find out when something not only does not sound believable, but it sounds clearly false. <br /> <br /> I remember the scene in the bathroom, where Jack tells his football teammates that he conceived of Diane. In no case, neither the form nor the form of the guy will not be able to cheer up the other guy, forcing the girl to become pregnant in high school. They can welcome a guy who has sex with a hot fan, but I can also guarantee that the first football team will not hear about it on the urinal. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that this film did not take yourself so seriously, and it was not terribly bad, but come on!
