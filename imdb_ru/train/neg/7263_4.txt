This star-studded British-Spanish co-production looks great that you can see from it. I have three versions, two VHS, one DVD, and they are all terribly cropped, so terrible that the buildings seem to be talking to each other. Few films suffer from panning and scanning as much as this one, since director Robert Parrish seems to have been so fascinated by the widescreen process that he tended to use both sides of the screen at the same time, ignoring the middle. Another user comments that we see all the inhabitants of the church killed in the beginning; none of the copies that I have. There are several sharp cuts of peasants shooting from rifles, one Mexican officer was shot, Shaw and Landau are celebrating, and that’s all. We will never know why Shaw became a priest (if he really is), we will never know what is happening with Don Carlos (Savalas), although I suspect that he was called home to play a star in Kogak, since his departure seems arbitrary . And there is a strange sequence of memories where Michael Craig (Mysterious Island) is dancing around in a bowler hat and a bad suit in the tradition of the great old English music hall to the 1960 BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS hit, not sung here by Johnny Horton, but with some lyrics, which I never heard before. On the other hand, the location is excellent: a huge old ruined fortress with a Escher-style staircase leading to nowhere, pleasant chewing of scenery by Robert Shaw and good performances of Stevens, Landau, Lettieri and Telli Savalas as Telly Savalas. I didn’t really like this movie, but I definitely didn’t see it. I will look for the widescreen version and then make a decision.
