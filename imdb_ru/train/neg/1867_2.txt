Unfortunately, the only spoiler in this review is that there is nothing to spoil in this film. Even if B. Mattey never made any masterpieces, he would use it with humor and madness, which made him a cheerful director of Eurotrash. But over the past 10 years, he seems to have lost him. This film is just empty, nothing will wake us from a deep sleep, in which you sink after the first 10 minutes. No sex, no blood (should it be snuff?), No actors, no dialogues, just as bad as in the 90s. TV movie. This is even worse than his last epic of cannibals and zombies. Gems like: Zombi 3, Robowar, Rats, l'altro inferno, Virus, Cruel jaws and some others. So if you don't want to see B Mattei, obsessed with the new film of the spirit of Jess Franco, pass this. But if you don’t Know this cute artisan’s career, look for his old films and have some fun.
