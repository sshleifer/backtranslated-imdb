Slow, boring, extremely repetitive. It is no wonder that Weinsteinâ€™s company did not buy it. This Spurlock should eat more McDonald's during filming and stop production. You can not watch it and enjoy. The preacher is a joke. The whole idea is not funny. You can make a 2-minute film with this idea, not a feature. I am very sorry that I made this film. I will never watch anything with the name Spurlock. It is completely rubbish. Such filmmakers should be on youtube and never get a distribution contract. The film says that American consumers and their customers are guilty of the current depression when they buy and buy products, so the movement of money in the system is the basis of a healthy economy.
