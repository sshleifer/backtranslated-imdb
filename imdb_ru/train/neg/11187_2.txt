The fatal flaw of the order - in addition to the aninine plot - is that the character simply does not react and does not even react. <br /> <br /> Two examples: a priest walking through the cemetery late at night is suddenly attacked by ghostly spirits. Having chased them away, he quietly resumes his walk when his friend appears. "Nothing bad?" His friend asks when he sees the attack. "Just a few demonic spirits - nothing that I could not cope with." No reaction, no surprise, as if he had replaced the tire. His friend is equally indifferent ... it must be the standard training of priests ... ["And then you put the waffle in their mouths. Any questions? Okay, go on, the Spirit of Demons attacks ..."] <br /> < br /> Example two: at some point the priests need to answer a question, and only a demon (or something whom they care about now) can provide it. How? Why, you must ask a dying person! So, in front of two priests, a random person is hanging around a demon so that they can ask their question to a beating, choking person. "Hey, don't kill him!" or maybe "This is not good!" would be more realistic than their answer. They never ask them to allow a person to leave or stop - in fact, the closest reaction they get is a slight annoyance. They ask their question and leave. <br /> <br /> At that moment I had to turn it off - my brain began to atrophy. <br /> <br /> Avoid <br /> <br /> * / **** (one star out of four) <br /> <br />
