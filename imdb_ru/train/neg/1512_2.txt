Poor robbery attempt on the “Seven”, complete with second-class acting work, terrible camera work, unfinished history and a strong aftertaste of weak propaganda. Yes, these "sex offenders", they live in the neighborhood, and you really raped. <br /> <br /> There is no surprise from the female Vice-Territory, she acts as always - as convincingly as a piece of wood. Richard Gere continues to slide lower and lower - and here is almost as low as the late Stephen Seagal. <br /> <br /> Singer with crazy eyes is the best when she is dead in bed; and even the wolf was secondary (although she was the best performer in the film) - maybe they fed her before the shots, or something like that. <br /> <br /> Unlike “Seven”, in which it was (this interesting story is made, which can be more or less relevant regardless of the country, it seems that this film is dedicated to the obsession of the USA. If someone is not very cares about "sex offenders" - and statistics show that lack of exercise and unhealthy diet cause more pain, suffering and death, - there is no particular reason to see it or be afraid. <Br /> <br /> There are some fetishes of body parts and snuff tobacco, but blood is less than mediocre, and fails as thin a natural reception (because it is meaningless), and blood, because it is not bloody enough. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time on it.
