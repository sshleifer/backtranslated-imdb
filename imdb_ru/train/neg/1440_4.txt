Swayze is not a very convincing Alan Quatermain. Compared with Stuart Granger; who grew up as my main character in films like Scaramouche 1952, Zend 1952 and King Solomon’s Mines 1950; Patrick Swayze fails. Even the image of senior Alan Quatermain Sean Connery in the “League of Distinguished Gentlemen” was very good at another big dip. In addition, Alison Dudi lacks the grace of Deborah Kerr as the leading lady, and, just as importantly, an impressive Ciriac as Umbopa makes it hard for anyone to fill him (shoes) !!! For someone who has been disappointed with the 1985 version of Richard Chamberlain, I highly recommend it if you can’t get the Granger version.
