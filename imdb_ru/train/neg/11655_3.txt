I was very disappointed with this movie. I thought that “Scary Movie,” although not a very good movie, was very good and funny. "Scary Movie 2", on the other hand, was boring, not funny, and sometimes just silly. <br /> <br /> Exorcist / Amityville Cheating was probably the best part of the film. James Woods was great. <br /> <br /> Now I admit that I am at a disadvantage because I have not seen several films that parody, unlike the first one, where I mostly saw them all. But a bad comedy is still a bad comedy. <br /> <br /> Something that really hurt this film was a time that ruined some of the possibly good jokes. Scenes and jokes are stretched on a long journey. <br /> <br /> In addition, the same jokes are repeated again and again. For example, a talking bird. Well, it was funny the first time and maybe even the second time. But it continued to repeat to the point of annoyance. The order between the guy on the wheelchair and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was fun at first, but it continued to repeat and ended in stupidity and even bad taste. <br /> <br /> Some jokes were even repeated from the first movie. For example, “cream”, I think you would call it Cindy (Anna Faris), were funny in the “Scary Movie” because Cindy held on so long to give her boyfriend sex that in fact he had blue balls from hell and it was funny when he “drained” her. But this time it was inappropriate and not funny. <br /> <br /> Bathroom and sexual humor in general was more fun and timely for the first time. Although humor from stingray was excessive and rather unnecessary in the second film. <br /> <br /> Tori Spelling was annoying, and there really wasn’t room for this film. <br /> <br /> But I really liked Shorty (Marlon Wayans), who, in my opinion, was the funniest character in the first movie. The scene with him and the potted plant was one of my favorites in the second film. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I love the Wayan family and their humor. That is why this film is so frustrating. .. they have much more comic abilities than endless jokes.
