I thought any horror movie with Orson Welles would be strange. Necromancy, of course, was, but it was too strange for her own good. The film does have an eerie feeling as it deals with a satanic / witch sabbath in a small town and the young woman’s attempt to escape from them. The director seems to be deliberately trying to confuse the audience, using memories and dream episodes. There are too many unanswered questions for the final. Worse, since the story is so confusing, it’s quite difficult to get the support of any character. It seems strange that Wells would agree to title this film, especially since he has nothing to do. Maybe someday they will release a cassette with lists and misses from this movie. Now it will be really fun!
