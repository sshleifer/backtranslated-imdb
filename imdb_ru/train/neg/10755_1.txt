I can’t think of any redeeming features of this completely bad rendering on Azimov, except for the artistic direction. Forget about the disasters associated with the placement of the product, the unconvincing work of Will Smith and the giant plot holes. It was not only funny, but also painful to watch. Even the action was boring. The mix of MTV inspired production values ​​and a completely bad dialogue, probably aimed at very young children. <br /> <br /> What a shame that science fiction is so bad can still be done after we had Bladerunner, a Minority Report or to a lesser extent Dark City (from the same director). This one really belongs on the top 100 list. Really terrible.
