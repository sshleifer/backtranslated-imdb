Someone told me that it was one of the best adult films to date. Since then, I have discredited everything that this person told me after watching this movie. That's just terrible. Without going into detailed descriptions of various scenes, take my word for it, sex scenes are uninteresting at best. Jenna in her usual street clothes was initially the highlight of the film (she really looks good), but from there everything goes down
