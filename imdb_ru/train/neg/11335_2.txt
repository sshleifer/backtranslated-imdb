I recently watched Belle Epoque, thinking that it could be wonderful, because he won an Oscar for the best film in foreign languages. I was a little overwhelmed by the predictability and simplicity of the film. Perhaps the conflict that I had was that from the moment when the film was shot to the present, the story of a man who falls in love with beautiful women and eventually falls in love with a good girl has been repeated many times. In addition to the predictability of the plot, some of the scenes in the film really seemed out of place with the plot (for example, a certain event at the wedding). At times, the film was a bit preached in its ideas and in connection with the Franco era, when the film and the church were shown. The only thing that was in the film was the pleasant moments, the scenery and the character of Violeta as a strong, independent woman at a time when women were not really associated with these characteristics.
