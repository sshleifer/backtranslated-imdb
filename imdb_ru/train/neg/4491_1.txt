1/10, and this is only because I do not fall below with my ratings. <br /> <br /> skip this “movie” and wait until the last movie of the “Trilogy”, do not buy or rent it. believe me you won't miss a thing. The architect does not carry any new information: _ (spoiler) _ before it was more than NEO, he is like 6 or so. You might have come up with something like this from the first movie: Agent Smith told us that the first Matrix created did not work because it was too perfect. The Trinity died, and "love" Neo brought her back, where have I seen this before? Oh, right in the first movie, the roles are reversed! just like in action movies, nothing new, only with a lot of opponents. action scene (more than 20 ships) in a BIG battle that we haven’t seen (maybe in Revolutions?), betrayed by someone (hmmm, maybe the guy holding the knife who wanted to strike Neo?!), who pushed the Button EGM to soon. <br /> <br /> In general, a shameless trick to make money (especially from the guys who visited him more than once), which obviously worked like a charm.
