I was one of those “few Americans” who grew up with all the wonderful creations of Jerry Andersen. “Thunderbirds” was a great series for that time, and it would make a great action / adventure film if only the writers could figure out what it was aimed at. <br /> <br /> I expected it to be a joke, but I did not expect it to be aimed at such a low age group. Like “Lost in Space,” it could be visually stunning and exciting. He had to focus on action and adventure, as well as on the goal of the original series ... to save people in distress. <br /> <br /> Instead, he focused on Alan saving the day instead of his brothers (who were also filmed young in any case against the original). The breakthrough was Lady Penelope and Parker. I was not very concerned about the characters in the original, but I was grateful for them in the film. They stole the show! <br /> <br /> I always liked the Thunderbirds more for high tech than for stories, and even that didn't give me enough time to screen, I was curious. I would love to see more cool gadgets. <br /> <br /> But then I’m just a big kid ...;)
