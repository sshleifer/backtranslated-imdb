What a powerful beginning of the film when the heroine Julia Roberts slapped her offensive and anal husband, played by Patrick Bergin, and I felt ready to experience a powerful film at the same level as Farrah Fawcett's Burning Bed. Well, as stated in the summary, I was wrong. This film did not look like the “Burning Bed” in which there was strength, and Farra played the role of the woman you really wanted, and felt her pain and the need to survive. Sleeping with the enemy after the first act turned into a thrill when Roberts pretends to die to escape from her husband and leaves to live in Iowa. At first, her husband believes that she is dead, but begins to suspect that she is still alive, and goes after her. The rest of the movie is basically a cat-and-mouse game with Julia, who builds a house in this small town in Iowa and changes her identity ... of course, it doesn't mention how she got paid for it, but at the moment in the film I had everything equally. She meets a guy (Mr. Nice, a weakling) and falls in love with him, and her husband finally catches up with her, but not before he rearranges her soup cans and straightens the kitchen. I assumed it would give a cheap thrill to the viewers. But I didn’t care if she was offended by the wife, because, as I said, the film deceived the audience. If this continued, I would feel her and her position. Of course, the husband is killed, and everything is good for little Miss Roberts. If only the real world was something close to it ... Look at the "Burning Bed" and you will understand what a movie about domestic violence should be.
