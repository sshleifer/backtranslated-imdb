I agree with most other guys. A waste of photons and precious time. <br /> <br /> Virtually no joke is worth what the article is written about. The only highlight in my film is Olli Dittrich in the role of Pinocchio. ("Egal, ich muss eh Waldsterben") This is reminiscent of old times with RTL Samstag Nacht. It is difficult to describe the performances of the actors, as most of them do not even seem to have a good time during the production and simply “do their job”. The camera is fine, the plot is ridiculous, I think you will be ashamed, even if you discuss it with a lot of beer. <br /> <br /> In addition, I kept yawning all the time, wondering how such a scenario could be considered for production and waited for the end. <br /> <br /> My 9-year-old son was pleased, but then he was so little at this age :-) <br /> <br /> In any case, 1 point is almost 1 point here ...
