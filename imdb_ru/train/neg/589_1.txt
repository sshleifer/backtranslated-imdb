Honestly, I went to see the movie, not because of the actors, not because of the plot, but since it was rated 17 here in Luxembourg and the film must be very cruel or pornographic to be put in this category. Believe me, being a movie fan, I have seen quite a few cruel films in my entire life (Iti the killer, the Irreversible, Risen of Hell), but this film was by far the most disturbing and cruel picture I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot is stupid, the direction is terrible, the acting was mediocre, even the music was a cheap copy of the so-called “Horrible Soundtracks”. There is not a single intellectual aspect in the whole film, and some scenes are really difficult to sustain. (especially the scene where you see embryos with glasses and hear the baby crying - terrible). I cannot understand why the film received 16 points in Germany, where the criteria are usually very tough (for example, a deadly score (cruel, but he ridiculed himself and had great hints of Asian cinema and besides great directing) even the film as a state of grace is rated 18) . No one can call it a horror movie, because in fact it was more about showing blood than scaring the public (showing “Disgusting” in the middle of the movie was a very bad decision); for me (sorry for the expression) this is just one crazy director, experiencing their disturbing fantasies. In some scenes you see violence that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot and does not explain anything. There are holes and flaws in the plot, the dialogue is boring, to be honest, I cannot mention a single positive aspect of the film, except for the British and Scottish accent. <br /> <br /> If I had something to say, I would Prohibit this film in cinemas, I fully understand why none of the major production companies have invested their money in this shit. <br /> <br /> I look forward to feedback on my topic and will be happy to discuss this or that topic. <br /> <br /> “Live the dream, live the dream” by David Ames
