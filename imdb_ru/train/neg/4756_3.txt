A remake of a magnificent 1972 film about a production in which Kane was in the role of an arch-hero from the first movie. But nothing more pleasant to do. <br /> <br /> Actor, Law and Kane, performed with an understated party, even more weakened by weak self-satisfaction. <br /> <br /> The heat setting in the original is reserved for an ultramodern homesetting. The subtle interaction between Oliver and Kane, which made the first film so watchable, is replaced by terrible, defiant arrogance, which immediately evokes contempt in the viewer. But this is not a clever, pleasant and enjoyable thing compared to another character, who was so well supported by the original, this is an obvious OTT-killing of both characters from the word "go." <br /> <br /> This version of Sutiut is really not worth watching, watching the original film and being overwhelmed by the introductory act.
