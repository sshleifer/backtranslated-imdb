Based on the personal experience of director John Singleton, being at the University of Southern California comes Higher Learning. The film is dedicated to the racial politics of the modern college. <br /> <br /> The film is based on three main characters: Malik Williams, a carefree, undersized athlete, an African. American man. Christine Conner, a sheltered soft white girl, and Remy, an innocent, unbound white man. All three are overcome by the sudden reality that college life is not as good as it is advertised, since all three are disappointed by being unprepared (Malik), naive (Christine) and undesirable (Remi). <Br /> <br /> One good thing about the film is that it really shows that modern American colleges are just big high schools. Colleges are not a place where you can develop character, develop potential or enhance personal growth, but they are educational institutions used to gather all sorts of students in a single atmosphere for all. This is an experience that is usually built to fail for most students. It would be nice if the film built his story about this parody, and not about racial politics. <br /> <br /> But this is not the case, and this is where films fall apart. Singleton seems to have had a rather bad experience in Southern California. Through this movie, he lets it all hang out. There is no need to fight around the bush. Singleton makes it easy to see the heroes and villains of this piece. <br /> <br /> Black film characters are largely seen as heroes, and all whites in the film are villains, except for Christine, who was raped by another white student. <br /> <br /> Who can understand the inconsistencies of this film? Black gang members who come to the aid of a white girl after she points to them, who allegedly raped her? The ease that black gang members have at university, while a group of skins meets in a dark little dorm, planning violence? <br /> <br /> The speeches of Omar Epps (Malik) and Kristy Swanson (Kristin) are disappointing. They do seem to be the third choice for the roles they played in this film (Tupac Shakur and Drew Barrymore were supposed to play Malik and Christine, but were unavailable). O'Shea Jackson, aka Ice Cube, Busta Rhymes and Regina King, were annoying in their roles. And Laurence Fishburn was very mistaken here as a professor of history. Only Michael Rappoport succeeded in this film, and he did it, given that his character, of the three main characters, has changed the most in the film. <br /> <br /> John Singleton wanted to address the issue of race and inequality in American student life with this film. And he did it very badly. It was like killing a fly with a shotgun. Life is much harder than it seems, and people are the same in everything, and he should know that. Higher education is proof that he did not understand this at all. Watching a movie then and now only confused, disappointed and angered the same audience with whom he would like to talk. Not to mention that it would not entertain them in the least.
