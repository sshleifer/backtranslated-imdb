I thought it would be at least aesthetically beautiful. It was slow, pretentious and boring. I almost fell asleep. There are some decent songs, but there is one song at the end, just some guy shouts out "Yaowwww!" while someone accidentally knocks on a wooden object. Nevertheless, there are some beautiful songs, but you should not watch the movie. Go to itunes (they have an album), review it and select good ones. <br /> <br /> Half of the film - some guy makes tea. Well, this is a slight exaggeration. But you will understand what I mean if you see. That being said: DO NOT SEE THIS!
