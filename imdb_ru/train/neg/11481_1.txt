If they could get Ed Asner, why didn't they get other actors instead of people who go to the same church as the producers? And why the main character threw the wise old wise character on the ground when he was never in danger. This made the old man disguise the injury because of pride, and so the young guy would feel guilty, leaving him with a disability for life. I think this is why the main character refuses money and why the old man works with him like a dog, even when he volunteers for extra work. If the D-Bag guy is a bad guy because he is a guy from a distance, then why is a soldier better? He has a good reason for jealousy, a good reason to lead her away from her hometown and because of her protective, controlling manipulation of her father. All the characters who are supposed to be cute are not, and everyone else is a “bad” guy. How did they meet, a wine broker and a sawmill worker?
