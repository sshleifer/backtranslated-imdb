Good, but does that make this movie good? Well, in fact, in my opinion, not so much to recommend it. I found it very slow, tedious, in fact. Itâ€™s also predictable to a large extent through the number one and two number one and two were somewhat predictable, but not so much. I also felt that this film was sometimes quite picky, that I do not think it fits into this series and character. he is a decent enough actor, but I felt that he was playing his character too much. I think it corresponded to the tone of the film, which would be great if I liked movie.plus, there were some pretty bad airliners. Arnold The character has not really evolved, as I had hoped. Oh well. This is just my opinion. In any case, for me, although this film is not terrible, it is pretty bad. my vote for Darkman III: 3.5 / 5
