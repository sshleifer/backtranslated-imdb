This is a bad season for Bollywood, when all the big releases are accompanied by a massive sensation, which was unsuccessful at the box office. London Dreams is no exception to this. Let's see ... It's all about the pursuit of your dreams and how far you will go to achieve this. Sounds impressive right? But, unfortunately, the film is not like that. <br /> <br /> Arjun (Ajay Devgan) is an aspiring musician who wants to succeed someday. His dream is to play at Wembley Stadium in front of 90,000 spectators who shout his name. He is joined by two brothers, Zoheb and Wasim (debutants Aditya Roy and Ranvijay) and the delightful Priya (Asin). Together they form "London Dreams", a group of their dreams. After being impressed by the head of the record company, they become overnight sensations. Arjun is secretly in love with Priya, whom he does not want to reveal until he reaches his goal. Then Arjun brings his childhood friend, Manjit Khoslu or Mann (Salman Khan), a carefree, flirtatious guy who has no ambitions in life, to join their group. Mannu is an experienced musician and a real talent, whom Arjun later became envied by the excellent skills of Mann and his romance with Priya. Arjun plans to destroy Manna with the help of Zoheb. What happens next forms the rest of the films. <br /> <br /> With regard to technical aspects, we feel only the shadow of Vipul Amritlal Sha, whom we admired in Namaste in London. It was felt that he simply visualized the script. In short, the famous operator. The script of Suresh Naira is boring, although it has its own moments. Defined in a predictable manner, the script tired you out. The filming was awesome in capturing the beauty of London. This is the only entertainment part while watching songs. <br /> <br /> Few songs are humble, while others are decently noisy fare. Ajay was the one who stole the show with its negative character. Salman is monotonous and annoys you. Asin can be forgotten, and I do not think that it will become popular in Bollywood. Aditya Roy is impressive, and Ranvijay is fine. Brinda as a bitch is what we saw in countless films. Ompuri continues the proceedings. I do not want to stop there, because it will be a difficult task. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, let me say that London Dreams is a soulless movie that you can watch on DVDs.
