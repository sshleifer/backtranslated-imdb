An underground comedy film is possibly the worst train wreck I've ever seen. Fortunately, I did not pay for this film, and my friend reluctantly agreed to watch it again, noting that it was so terrible, but he needed to prove to me how terrible it was. I love color comedy. I thought at least that would be the case, and I would have fun. No, instead the game was so terrible, the “jokes” were extremely stupid, and the plot was not where to find it. Maybe there shouldn't have been a conspiracy, so I can't relate to this film. It's pretty sad when the funniest thing in a comedy is an old woman whose bat hit her head ... Batman ... A man wearing a baseball uniform with a bat. Fun. Just a genius. I had a feeling when I watched this film that its creators made it and laughed hysterically at it. Perhaps it was full of internal jokes that we simply did not understand. Or maybe this is the worst piece of garbage that has ever been made, and it should be locked up in storage and thrown into the Arctic Ocean. <br /> <br /> P.S. Do not buy this movie!
