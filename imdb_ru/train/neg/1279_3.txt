This film tells three stories that seemed to be filmed without the knowledge that this is a combined vignette film. The creators link the three vignettes, connecting them all to reduce Martin Cova, although you will never see some of them with Cova. <br /> <br /> The first vignette is sexy Vivian Schilling, a woman who is afraid of everything under the sun (she makes Adrian Monk look brave), having paranoia alone in the evening at home alone. You will literally scream at Vivian for doing some funny things. She spends most of her time in a nightgown, which shows off her amazing features. But her film is the worst, if not the coolest. <br /> <br /> The second vignette belongs to Bill Paxton, who portrays a roommate from hell. His disgusting roommate allows him to take full advantage of him, and Bill does this whenever he can. <br /> <br /> The last vignette was funny, because the person is afraid that death will accept him at any moment, like his friend who suffocated from the olive tree. <br /> <br /> Not very interesting, because the film as a whole seems to be split with very little thought involved. A must for fans of Bill Paxton.
