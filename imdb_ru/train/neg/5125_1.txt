As a young pastor, I heard good news about this film. Then I looked it up. The game was not the best. This is forgivable. This is not the message: give your life to Jesus, and everything will change - you will cope better, you will get amazing catches, you will stop messing, you will start landing and even go to the playoffs. This is because Jesus magically transforms the terrible undersized wimps into American athletes. I laughed out loud when the coach recited a verse from the scriptures to explain to the kicker why he missed field targets. But wait, that's not all. You will receive a brand new truck, $ 6,000 earnings, and the fight against infertility in you and your wife will suddenly end with pregnancy â€” twice. Then you win the state championship because God helps the weak hit the triumphant ball 12 yards farther than he ever struck - and no less than to the wind - all because "God wanted him to do it." Then you win the state championship again next year. None of this good would have happened if the team had not decided to follow Jesus with all their hearts. <br /> <br /> This is what I took from the film: God can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants to do it - and it's all about making our lives better, easier and more enjoyable. He chooses his favorite team and helps them win the game. What Bible is this story based on? I bet that Stefan wanted to know the keys to such a safe life before he was stoned to death. Someone had to make this film before 10 of the 11 apostles were killed for following Jesus. It would save them from many troubles.
