Daraar started a pretty good start. The first scene really made me think about what will happen next. In addition, the first half of the film is GREAT. The entire first half of the film is about how Rishi Kapoor is deeply in love with Juhi Chawla. By the way, do not you think that he is a bit old for her? <br /> <br /> At last, everything starts to liven up by the middle of the film, when Juhi tells us about her previous husband; and wow how crazy he is! He was overprotected, ugly with a really HOT TEMPER! He used to beat poor Juhi without a good reason! One of the reasons I donâ€™t like this film is because I cannot see how Juhi (my favorite actress) is being subjected to such violence. This film generally has TOO a lot of abuse and bloodshed; I find it so disgusting !!! <br /> <br /> In any case, all I'm trying to say is that if you are thinking about renting a Daraar, you should put it back on the shelf where you found it, and choose something else!
