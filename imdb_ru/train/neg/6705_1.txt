This movie is just a shame. Orlando, Fla., Seems to be becoming a more recognized area of ​​filmmaking (such as the growth of Vancouver). The Brothers was filmed in Central Florida, and this short film was a kind of setback for the area (which made great strides with the indie film Walk in Africa and the great HBO mini-series, From Earth to the Moon). <br /> <br /> I will try to be as honest as possible. I think Orlando was the perfect place for filming The Brothers. It had the potential to give a new twist to the 'Band Band' craze. After all, both N'Sync and Backstreet Boys come from this area. But the Brothers are failing, probably due to a weak script. Both protagonists are flat and have almost no development (partly it may be amateur actors, but partly it is the way the script was written). <br /> <br /> Also the problem lies in the choice of jokes. Many jokes are too repeated (for the first time, they seem funny, but it gets a little boring). Some of the "concert" scenes are posed poorly (and many of these scenes also seem to not move the story). <br /> <br /> I had high hopes for this, but, alas, its disappointing effort. I also hope that the best for the future function based on this short film. But I think that for director John Figg it’s best to go into different genres (quickly). Comedy is not his strong suit. But, its undeniable, that he certainly is one of the most prominant cinematographers in Orlando (its just a shame that now he is sad, not famous). <br /> <br />
