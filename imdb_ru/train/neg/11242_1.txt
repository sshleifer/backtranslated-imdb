I saw this movie last month in a free preview and came out. It was pretty awful. In the process of too much effort, they replayed and shot a terrible film. I was disappointed because I felt that all the actors in the past made a respectable choice, so this one could not be so far from the goal - but I was wrong. I hoped that they would conduct a survey at the end of the film so that I could tell them not to release This movie. I was attracted by the free part of the preview, but it turned out to be a waste of my time - and, as a rule, it is very easy to cheer me. He tried to be innovative and creative with shots, ideas and shootings, but since they collected so many ideas at the same time, he failed. I’m usually not picky about movies and usually don’t feel the need to show my opinion about movies, but I had to warn everyone not to watch. I signed up for IMDb just to tell all of you guys
