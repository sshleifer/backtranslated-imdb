Another film about the tortured egocentric, arrogant, insensitive, hateful, self-destructive main character, which we should take care of. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I am very open to all kinds of Wall films, which have the character of self-destruction as the main character. What I object to is the fact that this guy has so little background. Why did this guy hate himself and the world? If the script dealt with this more, they could cause some sympathy for him. Since he was simply posing as an unpleasant hated character, not tragic, just hated. <br /> <br /> After making great efforts to make this guy as insane and antisocial as possible, and make his fate as dark, perhaps then the writer has the courage to make a happy ending ... . <br /> <br /> This is not the worst film I've ever seen, but it fights well there! The man! Do not waste your time.
