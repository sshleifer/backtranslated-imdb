I would like to give this film zero or even less, because, unfortunately, this is what it deserves. Honestly, I never leave the film, but this one was so terribly awful that I could not stand a single minute of that. Please, please for the sake of humanity, skip this movie. If you need a hot lesbian film that you can really understand, this is not true. <br /> <br /> He has unattractive, unattractive personnel, a changeable structure, an absurd dialogue, and he is absolutely unconvincing in every conceivable relationship. At an absolutely basic level, this does not entertain. Everything in Mango Kiss is so scenic that it is LESS than any student film I've seen. <br /> <br /> As if this were not enough, the entire film relies on a constant (and I mean CONSTANT) voice for the narration. The screenwriter may also have written the novel, because they insisted on TELLING everything, and not SHOW it. We just have to assume that Lou and Sassafras are best friends and have a special connection, although there is no character development to illustrate this. In addition, this film continues to introduce new characters after the first five minutes, and not in a natural way, but in a still image of characters with their name written on the screen. There is no introduction, no development of any characters. In fact, we are not familiar with any of them. <br /> <br /> This is the most amateur movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I’m a gay woman who watched this movie with my roommate (another cheerful woman) and we both found this movie a depressing representation of a strange movie. I'm starting to think that lesbian and funny movies are very similar to Christian rock - it doesn't matter how terrible it is, people will still strive for it and defend it, no matter how low the quality is. Please don't rent it! Instead, let's promote the production of QUALITATIVE gay and lesbian films by renting “But I'm a Fan,” or “Fire,” or “Heavenly Creatures,” instead of swallowing any meaningless joke aimed at the gay community (i.e. Queer as Folk),
