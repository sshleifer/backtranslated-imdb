On this board I read some good reviews on “Mr. Scarface ”, but for everyone who is not related to the genre of Italian gangster films like me, the picture will probably have little meaning. Indeed, after the initial staging involving fraud of ten million lire, the picture turned into a rather ordinary picture of revenge with a slight turn in the personality of Rick (Al Kliver). The whole story of the gang war fouled me up with the inclusion of Vincenzo Napoli (Vittorio Caprioli), but, as most other viewers commented, he is the only one who gave this picture any life with its often ineffective attempts at violence. It seemed to me somewhat incredible that the idiots of Manzari, who were chasing Tony through the streets, did not really break out before Tony even laid a hand on them. Despite the fact that Jack Palance was the main character in the film, he was rather unceremoniously wasted in the anti-climate final, with the result that the working title of the United States "Mr. Scarfeys" was rather controversial. I have seen enough Western spaghetti to know that they do not all work; I believe that in this case, my first look at the film about the spaghetti gangster also did not really help.
