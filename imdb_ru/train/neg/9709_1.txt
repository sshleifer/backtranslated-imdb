30 seconds after the opening credits, I had a feeling that it would be a bad movie, but I didnâ€™t know how bad it was. Then the actor playing the evil Nazi scientist opens his mouth, and my friend and I decided that in order to survive in this film, we would have to turn down the volume, create our own dialogue and double the speed on a DVD. But it did not help. About halfway we turned it off. I have already experienced some very bad films, both with Secret Scientific Theater 3000, and with Svenguli, and without it, but there are only some films that I doubt can even be saved by bots. The biggest part of the movie that bothered me the most was that people, hypnotized to believe that they were zombies, had rotting green skin. I guess they were all hypnotized to death, and then hypnotized to rotting. Stick to these iconic classic films such as Plan nine from space.
