I knew that I was going to watch a low-budget film, but I expected much more from Alex Cox's film. The actions of the two leading men were terrible, especially the white guy. The girl had to win an Oscar compared to these two. This film was filled, I think, with jokes for people in the film industry and several other jokes that I actually understood, and made me laugh out loud, which is rare. Without these ludicrous moments, I would give this film 2/10. What happened to Alex Cox, who created all the classic works of the 80s? <br /> <br /> SPOILER: <br /> <br /> I had a couple of questions after the film ended. Why did the mexican guy go to the other guy's house at the beginning? What did his daughter say that he fired 100 people from his last job? Why did she break her stuff when she was angry with him? I think I should have gone to Q & A after the movie, but I didnâ€™t want to get up at 10 in the morning.
