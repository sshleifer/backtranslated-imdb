I envy the stars of one of the best. Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler and the great Christopher Walken. With such a composition you can expect only the best. However, with Envy no one could save this catastrophe. <br /> <br /> Tim Dingman (Stiller) and Nick Vanderpark (Black) are the best friends and employees of the sandpaper factory. Both earn a good living, but since Tim works better at work, he can afford more than his buddy Nick. Nick is a dreamer who always comes up with new ideas for inventions. One day, Nick came up with the idea of ​​a spray can, from which dog food will disappear (yes, I seriously). Having fallen in love with this idea, Nick decides to truly invent this product. He invites Tim to invest in his idea and share the 50/50 profit. Tim refuses to think that the idea will never work. <br /> <br /> Nick's invention, entitled “va-poo-rize” (again, I'm serious), brings millions in the end. He loves to spend his money on things like a much bigger house, a horse, a personal trainer and fancy deserts. Tim begins to feel envy of Nick. Hence the name of the film. <br /> <br /> The idea is not bad, but it’s still terrible. This film contains some of the worst dialogues and very bad performances from all the actors. Again, as I mentioned earlier, none of them could save this mess. Even the great Christopher Walken, who plays a homeless character called "J-man", did not make this movie funny. The film is bad from the start and only continues to deteriorate. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie if: * you like shit (no pun intended) * you want to see Jack Black in a white tuxedo <br /> <br /> I say, avoid this movie at all costs, but avoid ESPECIALLY if: * you are offended by the humor in the bathroom * you love animals
