An interesting concept of vampirism, having something to do with the virus (but already done several times). In general, the film is too long and slowed down a bit. Editing could be tougher. I'm sorry to hear about the credit issue. Maybe the film was rushed to the market. The places were too dark. But the worst technical problem is audio. The level was good enough to hear the dialogues, but in many interiors there is an echo that is very distracting. Either they were not careful when recording, or the sound mixing might be better. Also passed too much background noise. It was necessary to get someone to make sound effects for martial arts scenes. The hard knock of swords hitting each other was not the sound of an epic battle. Especially in the battle scenes, editing should have been tougher. <br /> <br /> Also the action was a bit flat. Sorry, but when I see that the same person writes and acts in film, in my experience it is a red flag. <br /> <br /> But it was a good effort, so I gave him 4.
