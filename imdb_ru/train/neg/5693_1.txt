I can't believe the positive reviews about this film - I thought it was one of the worst, most badly played and badly played films I've ever seen. And the plot was completely ridiculous (sp?). She starts to caress him while he is tied to a chair? PUH-liz. The worst thing was that it was even not bad, ridiculous. Just awful - I couldn't understand why they even bothered to show it on HBO. I thought Belushi was ridiculously stupid — very incredible, like an “eccentric” killer. Idk, I could continue - again, I'm shocked by the positive feedback. The only thing that made me watch is that it’s interesting to see how a movie can go wrong and what makes it bad. And the final also did not disappoint in his stupidity! "Live by the sword, die by the sword ..." It's funny.
