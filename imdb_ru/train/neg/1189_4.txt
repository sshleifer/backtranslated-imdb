The repetitive “bubbling” sound effect of the show made me sleep. Very soothing show. I think I might have overslept the parts where there was danger or danger. I also heard that in Tarpon Springs, Fla., Some ready-made shots were taken for a show on spongy divers. I would suggest that Lloyd Bridges never dived in there. I remember the show only in restarting, and although it was never a thrilling adventure, we would have invented our own underwater episodes on the lake at my grandmother’s house ... imagining sounds echoing and flying about our adventures in our head, I thought that Flipper is better than underwater action. Of course, he had the advantage of being in his natural environment.
