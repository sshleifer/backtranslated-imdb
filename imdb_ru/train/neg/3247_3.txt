I was looking forward to seeing this film because it seemed really promising because of the upcoming sights: Jim Carrey with divine powers was an idea that most definitely worked for me. As a big fan, I was sure that he would be in his element with such a promising premise, and what could go wrong? Yesterday, my bubble burst, boys and girls, because I was watching a movie. <br /> <br /> The first act (where he is set up so that he hates his life, he is a disgruntled employee and mostly unhappy tourist with an ax to thresh against God) is useful, the second act (where he is called by God on the phone and receives the authority of the Almighty) - this is GREAT - Kerry enjoys his new "toys", and it's nice to watch, really funny. But the third act is just awful. <br /> <br /> The decay begins after dinner between Bruce and his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston, who plays very well in this film, given that her role is just a plot device; even her NAME smells invisible) - she He thinks he will ask a “question”, but instead he tells her (so far on his knees) that he finally got a job with a news anchor, and isn't that so exciting? <br /> <br /> She doesn't think so. She wants him to marry her, you see, so she throws him, you see, although she still loves him very much, you know, and the rest of the film is about hitting us on the head with one pathetic, super-heavy ... spiritually sounding cliche after the next, until by the end I, too, began to pray. , in order for this to be completed. <br /> <br /> I did not object to the lack of subtlety in the first two acts (one example is in the second act, after he got his strength, Bruce jumps into the room and sings "What if God were one of we are just sloppy, like one of us, “blah blah blah), and I was even ready to skip an amazing amount of contradictions that are being imposed on us (for newbies Morgan Freeman - God's son - tells Bruce that he may not violate either free will, but he does it a lot.) These choices were forgivable - this is Jim Carrey’s comedy, directed by Tom Shadyak, o not “Remnants of the Day". <br /> <br /> Or rather, it was an assumption that it was a comedy. When the scriptwriters lose sight of this (in the terrible act 3) and try to turn the hearing into some kind of (gagged) film “Message,” we get hell on earth instead. Bruce realizes the mistake of his selfish way, he realizes that GRACE is his salvation — I must say, grace, and that his life priorities have been greatly misunderstood. However, all this could be transferred much less rigidly. The film did not have to go to the dump truck to make these points. Unfortunately, the authors and Shadyak did not seem to know how to solve this story in any clever and easy way, so they took the “hit them on the head” road in the hope that we would not notice. In the end, they even took some unexpectedly unfunny exits, hoping that this would reduce the bad taste. That didn't work for me.
