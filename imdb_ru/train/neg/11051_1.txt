A terrible film that includes a lot of Canadian actors from the D-list, who seem so shy because they are filmed on camera that their performances are excessively melodramatic and quite easily forgotten. <br /> <br /> This film is poorly written, poorly edited, and poorly directed. It is incoherent, incomprehensible and strange - but not in a good way. McDowell does an excellent job with what is given to him, but he is the only one in this film - he has a really bad story and a script for work. This is not enough to be funny. <br /> <br /> I have yet to see how Van Pelleske behaves with dignity, and even minor characters like Eisen (with his nose, aching voice) confirm that we are in Toronto much, and not to the barge from Of Africa. <br /> <br /> Didn’t the director see that the “creature” looks like a jazz dancer in an alien costume? The battle between the blue flashes of lightning and the orange bunches of “magic” Pelleske (!?! Due to the lack of a better word) is obviously the result of bad actors without a choreographer, superimposed with completely special effects. Was there even a director on the set or on the set for this disaster film (not very good)? <br /> <br /> Learn from the mistakes of others ... do not even waste your time on it, you will regret it, like me. I have nothing more to say about this waste of celluloid.
