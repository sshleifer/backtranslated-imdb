I went to see it with my wife and 3-year-old son. It seems that he liked it much more than me and my wife. The letter is surprisingly bad for a Pixar / Disney guided tour. In fact, it was very difficult for me to pay attention at all. The film looks amazing, but the story gets so strange and wordy that I hoped that my son would fall asleep so that I could take it and leave. <br /> <br /> Not to say that the film is not "This is an interesting concept, it just says so strangely (bad script?), especially when we" first meet with the family. " I know that we should get the impression that the family is a stupid, but good sir, they could shorten this sequence by a good 15 minutes (it looks like I really didnâ€™t count the time). At this point, I scratched my head in search of a way out.
