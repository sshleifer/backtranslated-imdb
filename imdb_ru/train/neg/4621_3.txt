Searching this film high and low, I actually found it when I least expected it, playing on the Sundance Channel very early in the morning one fine day. Why I was endlessly looking for a small, conceited project that Chuck Barris, who was made during the last decaying years of a television show, I have no idea. The film is just awful. The script part that deals with the week. Of course, the highlight of the film is the real performers who were “too hot for television” or for some reason rejected. This part is still terrible, but poorly understood, which was pleasant in its own way. Now that I have seen what I have been searching for so long, will I watch it again in my lifetime? Loud NO !! Do yourself a favor and just look MUCH better than Confession of a Dangerous Mind or find old copies of the show itself. The acting girl, where they defiantly licked popsicles, was funny, but the need to endure the flash of Jay P. Morgon, which the public, in all likelihood, made me fruitless. Looking back, I am so happy that it was a massive failure, because if it was a massive hit, it could be a movie about a beauty show for $ 1.98, and the fact that my friends would surely bring on the Apocalypse. <Br /> <br /> My rating: D
