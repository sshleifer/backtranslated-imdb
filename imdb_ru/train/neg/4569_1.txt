I can not believe that the city of Mansi is so attentive that they would be embarrassed to let the show be there. This show is like a slap in the face of real hard-working law enforcement officers. I have never seen anything stupid in my life. If they declared it a comedy, it would be one thing, but to say that this is reality, this is nothing but a lie. I saw it only once and was shocked by what I saw. I wanted the little guy to chase with the bad guy. What a joke it would be. Nothing on the show was even close to the real world. The city of Mansi, the police chief and all the officers should be ashamed to hang their heads and should never admit that they came from this city. No wonder that is on TV
