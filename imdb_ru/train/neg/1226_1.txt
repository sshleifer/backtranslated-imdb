How mighty they fell. Kim Basinger is a great actress, but she definitely worked when she took on the role. This film is bad for one reason, in particular: an error in logic. It looks like one of those films that would be passable with all the holes in the plot if it were released in the 80s and 90s, but in 2008 it looks just silly. This is the worst thriller I've ever seen, and I've seen Bone Collector and Twisted. <br /> <br /> The story tells that Della (Kim Basinger) just bought gifts at a mall, and she is being pursued by a gang of thugs who end up killing a policeman who came to her rescue. Since then, these stupid fools have stalked her down an abandoned street, and she gets rid of them one by one with a toolbox full of tools. <br /> <br /> There is so much wrong in this movie. As I said, this film jumps over logic at every turn, and, with the exception of Kim Basinger, acting is bad for television. Hell, this pseudo-thriller is bad for television. The way she kills each of these politically correct thugs (1 Caucasian, 1 Latino, 1 Asian and 1 African American, all get together to pursue a Caucasian woman. Don't you just love America?), It's funny by mistake. The way she killed a Hispanic guy made me laugh hysterically. The sex scene with the main bully was in the left visual field so much that it made you ashamed to shake your head. I only recommend this to fans of bad movies and to no one else. Anyone else, especially fans of Kim Basinger, would be nice if not for this film. You do not want to see an actress you respect in the film that is so bad now? Of course not. You have been warned.
