To begin, I must point out the fact that you will feel completely lost for more than half an hour. Yes, some things happen, but you don’t know why or why. When you finally understand, you just understand that this is nothing more than a perverted opera opera dealing with mature prostitutes, dead mothers, illegitimate sons ... The characters are quite poor, and the actors (especially the young ones) do not help this much to make them look trustworthy. Only Marisa Paredes stands out, but she is an excellent actress, regardless of whether the film is nonsense. <br /> <br /> The only thing that can be said about "Frío Sol De Invierno" is that debutant Pablo Malo seems to have good intentions, and he took a couple of rather intense scenes ... Well, maybe next time ... <br /> <br /> * My rating: 4/10
