The message of this film is “personality is more important than beauty”. Janine Garofalo is considered an “ugly duckling,” but the funny thing is that she is not at all ugly (in fact, she is much more attractive than Uma Thurman, a friend who looks like a model). <br /> <br /> Now, would this film work if the Ugly Duckling were really unattractive? When will Hollywood stop its hypocrisy? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, despite the message that he wants to convey, this film is just ridiculous. <br /> <br />
