The Japanese have always had incredible ambitions in their science fiction films. They were always ready to destroy cities with huge plastic monsters coming out of space and from other places. The problem is that they never had the money to succeed in creating compelling special effects. This film, released in France under the title Les envahisseurs de l'espace, is no exception. His goal is to show three creatures from a giant octopus to a giant lobster trying to get the best of people. It is very embarrassing and ridiculous, but quite pleasant. In the end, we like these creatures and these films, right?
