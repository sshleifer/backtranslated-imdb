I tried to go through this film twice, having achieved success for the first time - and it was like pulling teeth - and failed the second time, despite the excellent DVD transfer. This problem? It's just too boring. <br /> <br /> If you get to the dramatic scene in the courtroom, which occupies most of the second half of the film, you shot it, but it's difficult to get to it. There are several interesting speeches by Abraham Lincoln (Henry Fonda) during the trial. End touching when Lincoln leaves, and they impose his memorial statue on the screen. <br /> <br /> This is a good story, well thought out and such .... but in the first half it lacks a spark, and this does not encourage the viewer to hang out there. I suspect that the real Abe Lincoln was much more interesting than this film.
