I don't think you can be much worse than that. Gather bad actors, fake limbs and three stupid stories, and what do you get? This is a meaningless excuse for the film. <br /> <br /> The first story immediately shows the poor quality of the video, and the acting is really very pitiful, especially when you portray a 25-year-old who pretends to be her grandmother with usually a grandmother bite a bun over her ears. Plus, with a man, everything is in order, and the woman is pretty ugly. "You look great!" NOT! A werewolf in this was the best of all three, I would say, but it is still not impressive, since it was a bad suit. Later, the woman’s face was decent enough for Halloween, but not for a werewolf movie. <br /> <br /> The more stories you go through, the worse it gets. In this next lesbian there are two lesbians who are completely stupid. The whole "I also want to be a werewolf" "How could you do this to me?!" It was stupid to talk. You asked for it now, overcome it! They don't even talk about a werewolf ... about his rat! <br /> <br /> The third one doesn’t make sense ... almost forty-five minutes of running and a boring narration make up this story and all this change. still didn't make it interesting. Boring <br /> <br /> Music, yes, bad ... who could not even hear some parts, it was stupid. The effects of the animals were either rat or pig-like, which was stupid. They could not use the sounds of a lion? I think no, good movies use it. Well, I enjoy B-bets, it's good for you. I received this film, as I am a fan of hardcore werewolves, and I will buy ANY film about werewolves and watch it more than once, but it's just me. If you prefer good, do not waste money. I asked you!
