"Arakhan" does not add anything positive to the kung fu genre. Comparing this intricate film with inspirational insanity and the quality of Stephen Chow films is a mistake. <br /> <br /> First, the fight scenes are not new. Everything that is represented here was done earlier and better than those of Yimou Zhang, Tony Jaa and Jackie Chan. Fighting in intelligent movies need logic. It seems that it does not make sense to beat strikes that do not have a destructive effect, as in the sequels of the "Matrix". <br /> <br /> Attractive female leader So-Yi Yun captivated the screen, but she never convincingly conquered the physical demands of Ziyi Zhang’s role so easily in the House of Flying Daggers. Having martial arts is well suited for kung fu movies. Using actors who are inexperienced in these skills is a serious mistake (see Ayia Ueto in “Asumi”), unless you are a very talented director who, as “Arakhan” proves, is not Son-Van Ryu.
