I am ashamed to write this review. I say this because those of you who read this will know that I’ve spent it all, and it’s embarrassing to admit even strangers. But I just had to warn those who read the audience’s comments on IMDb before watching a movie don't watch this one This is the least I can do. This is a bad movie! Trust me. The plot is stupid. Acting amateur. Direction, cinematography, scenery, costumes, etc., are all secondary. Let it go.
