After watching KHAKEE, I felt I could watch another good movie, but unfortunately the film is a joke, and in fact he is trying hard to introduce Aryeman Afterall, his father Keshu is the producer <br /> <br /> RKS praised the film so much during promotions, saying that there is meat in the film, unlike films made at that time, I’m wondering which films he was talking about <br /> <br /> In fact, this film is typical “Masala” film with a lot of comedy, romance, action films, in which everything is mixed <br /> <br /> The ease with which children kidnap a family - One of the funniest parts, imagine that children kidnap the Daoud family. <br /> <br /> The end is a complete messy mutter with a sudden change in characteristics. <br /> RKS gives its weakest film to date, with the exception of some scenes from Bachchan, a boring movie. <br /> <br /> Music is boring. <br /> <br /> Amitabh tries to play his role. In general, he performs his role well, although not in his power, although he distorts his face too much when he pulls the trigger and looks strange while smoking a cigar. H sometimes the duplication doesn’t fit properly <br /> <br /> Akshay is there for a few minutes and just repeats his act and ham <br /> <br /> Ahriman seems impassive, tries too hard, but some scenes <br /> overdo it <br /> Bhumika becomes the best of all <br /> <br /> everything else is fine
