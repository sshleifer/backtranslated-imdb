Bill (Buddy Rogers) goes to New York by his uncle (Richard Tucker) to experience life before he inherits $ 25 million. His uncle paid 3 women to Jacqui (Catherine Crawford), Maxine (Josephine Dunn) and Polina (Carol Lombard) to accompany him and prevent him from falling to the prospectors. One such lady Cleo (Geneva Mitchell) appears on the scene to disapprove of women. We follow this story because girls are offered more money to participate in the show instead of their accompaniment role, which they agreed to play for three months while Bill is in New York, while Bill meets Cleo and another woman. In the end, love for Bill and another one is in the air ............. <br /> <br /> In this film, the quality of the image and sound is poor. The story is interspersed with musical numbers, but the songs are bad, and Catherine Crawford has a terrible voice. Rogers is also not so good. It is pleasant enough, but really comes to life only when playing drums or trombone. There is a very annoying character who plays a taxi driver (Roscoe Karns), and the film is just boring.
