This is the typical low-budget mess of the 1970s. This is supposed to be documentation of a team that hunts a snowman through the Pacific Northwest. Each character is a stereotype, from Native American to cynical cowboy. Acting and narration is a complete joke. If you hope to see a lot of bigfoot videos, keep hoping. There won't be much there, and what could you do in the backyard with a cheap suit and a video camera; it would look better than this movie. <br /> <br /> Not that I didn’t like the 1970s budget rate; I do. This is what is such a mess of bad games, bad characters, a lousy story and no thrills that you just can't enjoy it. It does not fit into the “so bad, it's good” category, and you cannot laugh at how bad it is without the help of prohibited substances. These are mostly boring shots where people walk, hike, ride horses and watch wild life. There is a snowman attack that is completely stupid; presumably, our friend Sasquatch throws stones at the campers from above while they shoot him with rifles. At this point, you are very sick for Bigfoot, to drop stones on the director’s head and stop it all.
