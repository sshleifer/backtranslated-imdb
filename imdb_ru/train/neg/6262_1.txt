I agree with the reviews that I read here, and I have no words to define a turkey like this, but, despite everything, I can still find a reason for films like this. Do you remember those happy days when the video was a thriving business, and many films were filmed for the sole reason for filling video stores? this film came from that period, and I can imagine that it was the only reason that it was shot, and the same thing happened to many, many, many other stinkers. Do you remember the imitations of Rambo? and so many slashers of the z-class? I still feel nostalgia for this period. I can say that I didnâ€™t spend my time watching this movie, because I pressed the fast forward button after the first fifteen minutes, just to find a very funny scene in which the guy shoved his head with an ax, which exploded, because You perfectly noticed, they were made of plastic. And about the end, well, it was so badly filmed that I could not understand what had happened. The same thing, I did not follow the non-existent plot at all. But, man, Video Age was a great age, despite such films.
