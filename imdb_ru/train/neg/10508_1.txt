I thought the nadir of making a horror movie was reached by the Book of Shadows, I was wrong. This film makes it look like “Magnificant Ambersons” compared to this shameless, unrefined feces, who have the courage to call themselves films. I would write more, but I'm still angry that I was so idiot that I spent 3 pounds on renting it, reels. <br /> <br /> And were these people English? and where is the forest> I lived in the UK two thirds of my life, and, as far as I know, there are no dark, unexplored forests in the central regions. This whole thing looked like a plantation of coniferous plants of national trust. These angels looked like porn star anorexia (most of them turned out to have done their research). I, however, liked this moment when Judd tore to pieces. <br /> <br /> P.S. I love and admire Tom Savini, but HE CAN'T ACT
