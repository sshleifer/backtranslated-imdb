There are films that are terrible, and there are films that are so terrible that they are considered long-forgotten and invisible. In addition, a lot of mixing and bad things (not just cheese things; you understand what I mean) are also added to the mix. What is the result of bad movies with such dirty content? Why, "Final Justice", of course! <br /> <br /> Remember "Mitchell?" Joe Don Baker was the star of this film, and Joel and Botha shot it on Mystery Science Theater 3000. Now, this time, when Mike took Joel’s place on the Satellite of Love (but with the same bots), this trio made fun of the second MST3K movie “Joe Don Baker” “Final Justice”. Of course, much of what I mentioned was removed for the television release, but I still want to watch this episode (and “Mitchell”) because Joe Don “hates” the most? Why, none other than "Mystery Science Theater 3000!" <br /> <br /> P.S. If you have large lots nearby, check this store for uncut tape! LOL It happened to another user!
