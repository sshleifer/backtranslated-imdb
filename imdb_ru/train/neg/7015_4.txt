"54" is a film based on the infamous "Studio 54" of the 1970s - a haven for the social elite and club party people. In the film, Ryan Philip is the main character based on an actual studio employee from 1977 to 1982. <br /> <br /> The problem of the film is that it has all the brilliance and style, not the essence. He tries to be a really dirty and insightful satire like Boogie Nights, but ultimately looks like a lower imitator. Mike Myers is given an ungrateful task to play the club owner, who snorts on cocaine, Steve Rubella. This is just a small comedy role, and if these were Myers' best attempts to immerse themselves in drama, as Lemmon and other comedians did in their time, it was a complete failure. <br /> <br /> “54” might have been insightful and interesting, but instead it’s just another stupid teen movie that isn’t interesting or even attractive. View at your own risk.
