This is the official continuation of the sci-fi thriller '92. In the original, Van Damme was one of several dead Vietnam war veterans, revived to become the perfect soldiers (Unisols). In this, I think, about ten years have passed since Van Damme has a daughter of about the same age. He is currently working with the government on a secret installation for learning the newest Unisols - codenamed Unisol 2500, for some reason. As usual, something goes wrong: the on-site supercomputer (named Set is like a serpent in King Cobra of the same year) goes crazy, takes command of Unisols and even loads its computer brain into a new super-bodybuilder. (jai white) We are looking at the next step in evolution, guys! Most Van Damme fights take place with one particularly mean-spirited Unisol (about the wrestler Goldberg), who just keeps going: throwing him out of the building is no good; knock him off the truck - do not go! Shoot him, burn him - forget! Much of the humor stems from how Van Damme is now outdated and classified (it even turns gray at the edges). But, although he licks, he continues to kick! Most of the sequels of this kind are a rather weak imitation of the originals, and although this is certainly not a brilliant stroke, he manages to constantly have fun, especially if you are a fan of the struggle.
