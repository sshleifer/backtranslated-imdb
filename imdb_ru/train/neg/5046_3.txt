The lethargic direction destroys otherwise convincing history of the period in which the wonderful Zhang Ziyi plays the wonderful role of a woman who joined an extremist group in China in 1928, shortly before the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, and reunited with her former lover who now works for Japan. Each piece of drama and the movement of history is sucked dry directorial style director E. Lu. The characters still stare at each other for long minutes, without saying anything, the hand-held cameras always hold faces, showing endless reactions for much longer than necessary, the editing repeats the same reaction â€” triple redundancy. We know nothing about the heroes when the story begins, and we are given little new information as the plot develops, only silence and static shots of lovers who do not speak, who interact through silent dances, but do not share obvious emotional intimacy. A very sleep-inducing movie.
