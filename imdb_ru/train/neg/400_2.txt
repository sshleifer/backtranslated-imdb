I rarely make these comments, but I felt obliged to save others from the pain I had experienced while watching this film. It is so stupid and implausible, both in general history and in detail, that you simply cannot suspend disbelief. The problem starts early when you see a government researcher working in a new Porsche and having lunch with his team in a restaurant that looks like a castle, overlooking the Capitol building in Washington, DC. Such a life on state salary? Hah It only gets worse. By the end, when the bad guy starts killing the good guys, the last group is acting so stupid that you want them to die in order to clear the gene pool. The special effects are pretty good - you can buy it for the money of any producer - and the main actors were great in other films, but the script and direction are idiotic here. Many people wondered if there was any conscious intelligence behind the previous, facially stupid films of Paul Verhoeven (Showgirls, Starship Troopers), but this film should stop the surprise. He's just bad.
