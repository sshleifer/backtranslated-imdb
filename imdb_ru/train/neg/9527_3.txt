I tried to find this film, simply resorting to bad phrases about how “teenagers seduce and kill a man in his house” and the like. I think I first saw parts of this film when I was about 10 years old, when he was working on cable. This made a big impression! This is the film that the children know that they should not watch, and switch the channel when their parents arrive. When I saw who the cast was, I couldn't believe that some of these good actors were in such a terrible movie. Again, if you like to see men who cheat on their wives, kill, then this is an interesting movie. Also, if I remember, there are some pretty interesting pseudo-Lesbian moments. Perhaps the dumbest end of all time, but still ... memorable.
