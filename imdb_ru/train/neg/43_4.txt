This nasty video was originally banned in Britain and allowed last November without cuts. <br /> <br /> It features the Playboy Playmate of the Month, October 1979, by Ursula Buchfelner. The discovery cuts back and forth between Buchfelner and the hazy pictures of the jungle. I'm not sure what the purpose of this was. It would be much better to focus on the scene in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> Laura (Buchfelner) is abducted and kept in the jungle for ransom. Peter (Al Cliver - The Beyond, Zombie) goes in search of her and ransom. Of course, one of the kidnappers (Antonio de Cabo) manages to spend time productively, while the other (Werner Pochat) whines continually. <br /> <br /> The ransom exchange goes to hell, and Laura runs into the jungle. Will Peter save her before eating cannibals? Oh, yes, there are cannibals in this jungle. Why do you think this video was nasty! Peter and his partner (Antonio Mayans - Angel of Death) found Muriel Montosa on the kidnapper's boat. Montosa is very comfortable undressed. Peter leaves them and leaves alone to find Laura, who is already captured. They spend time having sex and see no danger approaching. Guts, anyone? The great battle between Peter and the naked devil (Burt Altman). <br /> <br /> Blood, decapitation, guts, a lot of frontal, some great writhing of the cannibal priestess (Alina Mess) and the lines: snatched her heart "that is fun if you see the movie.
