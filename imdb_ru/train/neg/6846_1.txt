I am a big fan of Karishma Kapoor and Govinda. I watched this movie after seeing Fizu, which was just great. <br /> <br /> There are bad films, and there are films that are very good. but this movie just takes a cookie. <br /> <br /> We were so annoyed that we were deceived by paying money in anticipation of a decent film. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs, do not even rent it. <br /> <br /> 1/10
