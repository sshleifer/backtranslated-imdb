I love bad shark movies. I really do that. I laugh at them hysterically. and the Scifi channel had a marathon of them, culminating in the premiere of their new original painting Hammerhead: Shark Madness. Judging from the previews, it seemed that it would be very funny. essentially a remake of the Benchley being, really. this was preceded by a shark attack show 3: megalodon, which is a shark movie game at its best. I was in the mood; I was ready to go. Bring it over, crazy man scientist! oh god this film was wrong. <br /> <br /> wrong, wrong, wrong. <br /> <br /> nauseous. twisted. MESSED UP. <br /> <br /> This is a theoretical reproduction in the worst case, my friends. when a girl with drugs is taken out of suspense and tied to a table screaming with her head, because the hybrid fruit of a human shark, an absolutely insane "scientist" deliberately implanted in her womb, wants OUTSIDE ... of Jesus monkeys. this is what i call disturbing. <br /> <br /> This is how the plot actually works: hmmm, the mad scientist thought. My son died of cancer, but I brought him back to life by combining his dna with a hammerhead shark, because sharks are not amenable to cancer and other hammerheads multiply through the placenta. oh look! beautiful amphibian creature! I created the next evolution of the human race! I KNOW! let's make him multiply! but damn it, if all these shark genes didn't make my son bloodthirsty; instead of raping hot babies, which I keep sending to his little jungle paradise, he continues to eat it. but check it out! among random people who, for some unimportant reason, ended up on my research island, there is a woman with whom my son was engaged to his death! I bet he will make her! All this leads to an extremely touching and hearty reunion: woman: are you going to soak me? Mad scientist: no. he. (points to a shark-beating man shaking) How cute. <br /> <br /> DO NOT LOOK IN THIS MOVIE. Ever
