The plot, character development and jokes in this film are extremely weak. It's a waste of time. It is assumed that the conclusion of "Saving Grace" makes you feel warm and indistinct, as if the characters survived their struggle. There was no such development to make such warm fuzzy feelings possible. Funny drugs are removed, and most of the film does not correspond to reality. The plot builds what should be energized, but the characters are not developed enough to take care. He then solves all the unresolved problems in about a minute of screen time, leaving the viewer feeling as if they have just lost their time.
