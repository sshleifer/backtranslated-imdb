This film made me very angry, because the main characters or all the characters have a southern accent. I have been living in Iowa for 29 years and I know that people here have no southern accent. This film is about a guy who makes meth, but I don’t know the real plot or what the film should be about. It has some pretty graphic drug use, and this is really offensive, so look at how people use meth as it is sugar. I lost my brother because of meta, and this film makes me nauseous because he charms with a drug. The film makes the drug look cool, but I was happy at the end when the guy almost crossed the state border. I also know that most women who are being traumaticly raped do not want to make love to their boyfriend or husband the next day. The film is simply wrong in all directions. I would suggest “The Basketball Diaries” if I was going to offer a film about drugs.
