Not a bad start for the program - but what a slap in the face of real law enforcement. The worst part of the series is that it is trying to declare itself a payment for reality - and this is not at all the case. Men and women who devote their lives to law enforcement deserve better than this. What's next, medical school in a minute? Charo performs lipo? Does Charles Grodin help with hip replacement? C'mon ... show a little respect. Even citizens of Muncie exhibit the program as staged. Police Academy = Gym? Poor editing (how many times can they use a Taco Bell shot out of the car in the background?), Mean siren effects (the same cycle added nausea to every “call”, whether it's a sliding code or not), and last but not least - more security issues officers than you could shake a stick. <br /> <br /> If I want to see factory police officers and wise fake police officers, I would look at RENO 911.
