This is pretty ridiculous, I hope that many people are confronted with Muslims who live throughout the United States, Britain and the whole world. Religion has over a billion followers. I myself was born and bread in America, and thanks to my religious studies and teachings, I was taught to take care of my country and work in order to contribute to the development of society. I am very devoted to the pursuit and teachings of my religion, which all my life have emphasized the need to train and prepare myself for success through education in order to contribute to the world. I know many Muslims from all over the world, and I visited countries like Pakistan. I have not yet managed to meet a person who believes that we should harm someone or not accept any other religion besides people from the media ... I wonder why ... It is also sad that these extremists use the media to represent the whole religion. This is a religion of one billion people, which is less than one percent. Iâ€™m sure that other people from other religions would not like to be represented by the KKK, the IRA and many others, who are just a small percentage of extremists who use outdated and not literal passages from respected books. to pursue their own revenge, personal or business matters through their so-called religion
