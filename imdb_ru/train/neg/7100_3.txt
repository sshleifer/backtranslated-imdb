This film gives a promising start, and then becomes very confusing and confusing. Kamal Hassan put a lot of effort into correcting the period, it is a pity that he did not spend more time on the plot. Most of the little characters in the film appear for no particular reason. <br /> <br /> Overall, very disappointing, I would recommend avoiding this movie.
