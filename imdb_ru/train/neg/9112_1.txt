Cruel Intentions 2 is essentially Cruel Intentions 1, again, just bad. The story is exactly the same as the first (even some lines), with only a few exceptions. The cast is more unknown and definitely less talented. Instead of being seductive and pulling me into watching this, I end up feeling dirty because it compares to watching soft-cored porn. I'm not sure if Iâ€™m gonna blame some stupid lines on actors or writers ... and I always feel bad saying that because I know how hard it is to do both ... but it was mostly an hour of waste of my life. It literally surprises me that some films have been shot, and this is no exception ... I cannot believe that they have shot the third one.
