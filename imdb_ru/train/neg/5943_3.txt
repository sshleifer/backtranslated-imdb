This film reminded me of a soprano, and not in a good way. <br /> <br /> David Chase's original mafia opera only put its foot on the wrong foot twice, the harshest and most inexplicable incident of this occurred in the fourth season, when Junior Soprano was put on trial for his life. Instead of pursuing this exciting (and key) storyline, the authors instead decided to completely ignore it, focusing instead on Bobby Bacalleri's constant whining over the frozen pasta dish of his recently deceased wife. <br /> <br /> When something really interesting happens in the “Notorious”, for example, that first, mysterious attempt to assassinate Tupac Shakur, which primarily inflamed all hostility on the East and West Coast and eventually led to death like Tupac and Christopher Wallace - the film views this as just another piece of the story that needs to be done. Why was it that Tupac was so sure that his own people sold him? Did he alone bring up his subsequent relationship with the Suge Knight? And is Lil Kim's transformation from a streetless drone into a sex-obsessed vampire diva really as trite as it looks here? <br /> <br /> None of these issues are even fleetingly considered by film writers who are much more interested in portraying Wallace’s tumultuous love life to zero. These episodes (including the extravagantly ordinary performance of female fans in a hotel room) are so toothless and mercilessly manipulated that the only real comparison that can be made is a film on network television. <br /> <br /> In both stories, the structure and content are simplistic and banal. But more fundamentally, like a biopic; as something intended to glorify your subject and teach the uninitiated in the subtleties of their life and work; the film is almost completely useless. Reliance on the plot of the meat and potato genre, combined with lifeless musical performances (an area in which a film like this should surely take off), leads to a film that seems to have been developed only to satisfy the whims and demands of those involved, leaving Wallace’s precarious status as a giant in his field as a nature reserve is easy to convince and previously transformed only. <br /> <br /> And the last twenty minutes, during which the post-mortem cultural identity of Wallace is widely portrayed as a resemblance to a Latter-day Saint, frankly made me feel vomiting. <br /> <br /> From this point of view, as with any other, Notorious is rude, prudent and compromised.
