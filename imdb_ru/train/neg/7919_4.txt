I was very passionate about this film, at least at the beginning, and any merit in this film is Lacy Schabert, it was fantastic !! But that's all. It seems I understand very well who the killer is, and I like when the film is able to completely confuse me, but I felt that I was deceiving, all the time they lead you in one direction, and then suddenly at the end decided to go in a completely different direction , they did nothing at all, it is not misleading that very bad writing and planning, someone did not think at all! <br /> <br /> I felt the film would be much better if they followed the plot that you are being led to, they also didn’t seem to have answered anything, so Jane (Maria) burned down the professor’s house. <br /> <br /> Too bad I felt it started as a relatively good movie.
