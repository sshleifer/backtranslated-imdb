Stray, shy, weird and opaque, if visually striking ... passionate erotic fantasy. Really boring, too much of a male naked body (including father-son incest) and just some kind of shameless meaninglessness. I admit, however, that some excerpts of the dialogue, taken on their own terms, really have a lulling quality.
