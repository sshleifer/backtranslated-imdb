From the comments, I notice that most of the people discussing this film base their remarks on the MST3K broadcast. This is fair enough (that is, in the end, as it has become the most widespread), but having the misfortune to see the “Final Justice” in its original form, I just wanted to share a few thoughts and comments about the uncut version. <br /> <br /> First of all, it should be recognized that the original version is a bit more consistent than the MST3K broadcast, mainly because of the storyline between Rossano Brazzi and Venantino Venantini (I CAN use the names of the characters). instead of actors, but I just love to type the words “Venantino Venantini”), explaining why the runaway character Venantini cannot just leave Malta. (This is not a very convincing plot point, but at least the directors tried to illuminate it.) Whether this scene was cut just for a while or because it did not give much riff food, I do not know. <br /> <br /> There is no other plot point in the story: Strider Venantino Venantini's betrayal to Jo Don Baker, who seems unmotivated in MST3K, is explained by an earlier, extremely unpleasant scene in which Venantini rapes her in the soul. Although this gives her a reason to turn against him, the whole script is just ... unsightly. (There is no other word for this.) <br /> <br /> Some of the MST-worthy moments (the constant truncated cries of "Son A" and "déjà vu" shooting at the sheriff) were purely the result of the edited television print they worked on and were absent in the original film. <br /> <br /> One scene I wanted to do was included in the MST3K version: before entering the bar to ask questions to some people, Joe Don asks the Maltese policeman accompanying him to stay outside, because "they see this uniform, they will not cooperate. " However, Joe Don himself wears his ridiculous outfit cowboy slash-sheriff complete with a brilliant badge! I can not imagine why they missed this excellent opportunity to ridicule him ... <br /> <br /> A final comment about the original, uncut version of Final Justice: Why, oh, why do you feel the need to put Venantino's naked ass Venantini on the screen?
