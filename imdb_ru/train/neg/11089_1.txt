Pretty good movie, but not true. <br /> <br /> Ruby "The Hurricane" Carter was a liar, a murderer, and never admitted to innocence. The state of New Jersey just did not go for it the third time, since 20 years have passed. Carter received an offer in 1976: "Take a test for a lie and go free." He did not take it. This film should never have been made, but the money says. Many people unfairly spend their lives in prison and, no doubt, more blacks than whites. Why choose a fake story? <br /> <br /> Jens
