In this film, there is no plot and no focus. Yes, it must be a stupid comedy, but the writers have no idea what the film is about. Even the name does not match the film. It was supposed to be called “Cool Ethan” or “Scammers Never Winning” or something like that. Characters are not developed and nobody cares what happens to them! The girl, the roommate (from the 70s show), was the only person worth seeing. She was fun and stole all the scenes in which she was. The rest need to make sure that their own college diplomas are in development, as they need a career different from acting.
