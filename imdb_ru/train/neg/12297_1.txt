Witchy Hildegard Knef catches a group of people in an isolated hotel and selects them one after another in perverse, disgusting ways. I thought I saw all this until one unfortunate man was crucified, and then his head was set on fire. Hildy is also a pretty prankster: she takes a nagging harpy and stitches her mouth ... then hangs her upside down in a chimney just in time for a roaring fire! "Witchcraft" made me sick. It made my eyes hurt. I was ready to write it off as the worst movie ever made by competent people ... before the final. I have to admit that I liked the final. He includes the boy and his toy tape recorder in the corner of Linda Blair, who looks fantastically obsessed. The scene lasts about a minute, and the film is over, but you know the old saying: “If you have a great ending, people will forgive you for anything!”
