If you have read the book - do not place great hopes, if not - go read and never watch a movie. It is strange to know that Toby Young actually participated in writing the script a lot (as he declares himself in the post-script of the book). Because the film is very different from the book. <br /> <br /> What the film seems to be looking for is a rather provocative and interesting piece combining philosophical ideas with simple funny sarcasm and simplifying it so that everyone can understand it - this is achieved with perfection. The film is full of bad and cheap jokes suitable for comedy series, and he lost all the meaningful messages he could have. <br /> <br /> You better not see him.
