I caught this movie on AZN by cable. It sounded like it would be a good film, the Japanese Green Card. I can't say that I never liked an Asian film, quite the opposite. Some of the most incredible horror films of all time are Japanese and Korean, and I am a HUGE fan of the Hong Kong films of John Woo. I am not against frivolous films like Tampopo or Chung King Express (two of my favorites), so I thought I would like it. Well, I'd rather cut my wrists and drink my own blood than watch this painstaking, poorly played movie ever again. <br /> <br /> I think that director Stephen Okazaki must have added Quaalude water, because nobody in this film had a personality. And when any of the characters REALLY tried to act rather than mumble one or two lines, their game seemed forced and incredibly fake. I honestly did not think that anyone had ever acted before ... The ONLY person who sounded sincere was Brenda Aoki ... I find it surprising that this is advertised as a comedy because I never laughed . Even more surprising is that the morning news of CBS called it "the refreshing breath of comedy." It was neither refreshing nor comic breathing. And the ending was very predictable, the previous reviewer must have been an idiot to think about such things. <br /> <br /> AVOID this movie unless you want to see a boring, predictable storyline and wooden game. Actually, I think Spike Bensonhurst is a better movie played than this one ... and I went through half of this movie!
