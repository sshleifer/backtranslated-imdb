As a person who read a novel and watched a film, I understand in a different way why the film was so disastrous. Firstly, any comparisons between the novel and the film are purely superficial. These are two different animals. <br /> <br /> The novel is probably conceived as a satire, but instead it is a cross between tragedy and controversy. Any comedic elements, such as those that later formed the stylistic basis of the film version, are just random for the authorâ€™s evenly cynical impulse. And so that the omnipresent white suit of the author does not make you think that this is another Mark Twain, think again. A more successful literary precedent would be the ghost of Ambrose Beers in a top hat and tails. Tom Wolfe is an equal clown and hacker, more famous than the author, always looking for a new seed for his mill. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising, therefore, that the excellent production skills and direction that were laid when creating the film were doomed from the very beginning. Unlike real satire, which translates very well into the cinema, the controversy is not based on publicly available observations of a particular form of human behavior, but on a targeted attack on specific people - whether real or fictional straw people - who have somehow earned anger the writer. Any attempt to create a successful filmed story or story from such a beginning must begin from scratch, without the influence or intervention of the author. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I also find a mistake in the casting. Not only are incompetent people, such as Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith, unable to match, but the fact is that real talents, such as Tom Hanks, F. Murray Abraham and Morgan Freeman, are either completely wasted, either got roles that are just caricatures. <br /> There is enough thematic material for a truly great satire of the film, but it is not even suitable.
