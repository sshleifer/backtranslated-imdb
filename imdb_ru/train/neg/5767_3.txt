As mentioned earlier, the visual effects are amazing. They are exciting. I personally use Blender, and such graphics are not at all easy. But this is all that is in this film. Not only is the plot confusing, but the general conflict is not clear. For example, in the first scene, Proog and Emo try to run away from who knows what. It seems that the conflict between man and nature is here. Later, when they enter the bottomless pit room, Proogh explains that "one step is out of place and (you're dead)." There is a more precise conflict between a careless person and nature. In the course of the film it becomes clear that there is a conflict between man and nature. But suddenly there is a conflict between man and man, when the Prolog from nowhere kills Emo. The prolog immediately turns from a caring guardian to caring for a lost child and becomes a â€œsick person." He betrays us. This is not only depressing, but it does not bother us, because the conflict between the thoughts and actions of the character is not developed. This is not a story about someone who becomes stronger through struggle. It is depressing and does not make sense, because there is no great truth about the human soul or about the world, revealed as a great drama. In my opinion, the film is very underdeveloped in all aspects. Still, the graphics are awesome, but the film is much more than just candy. There is no truth, no struggle, and a bad surprise ends. In conclusion, an undeveloped film without a point. ... but the graphics are good.
