As a Dane, I am proud of several good Danish films that have been produced in recent years. However, it is a terrible shame that this quality leap has led to the fact that most Danish film critics have lost their sense of criticism. In fact, it became so bad that I no longer trust any reviews of Danish films, and as a result I stopped watching them in cinemas. <br /> <br /> I know that it’s wrong to set this unfortunate event against any one film, so let me emphasize that Villa Paranoia will be a terrible film in any circumstances. The fact that he was criticized by critics only added fuel to my fire of disappointment in a Danish film. In addition, waiting until it was released on DVD helped very little against the unshakable sense of wasted time and money. <br /> <br /> Eric Clausen is a seasoned film director with a social realism ability in Copenhagen. I especially liked "De Frigjorte" (1993). As an actor, he is usually funny, although he usually plays the same role in all his films, namely, in the role of spittle, which is not lucky, partly because he is sloppy, but mainly because of society, and who redeems himself by doing something good for his community. <br /> <br /> This is problem number one in Villa Paranoia; Clausen exposes himself to the role of a chicken farm, which so violates the norm that he never succeeds in making it trustworthy. <br /> <br /> However, it’s much worse that the film has to make twists and turns and break all the rules of how to tell a story so that viewers can understand what is happening. For example, the film begins with a very sad attempt to visualize the main character’s near-death experience using low-budget effects and poor camera performance. After this, the character tells her best friend that she suddenly felt a desire to throw herself off the bridge. This is symptomatic for the entire film; Motivation for the actions of the characters is almost absent or absent, and Clausen resorts to the lowest form of the message about the motivation that exists: speak instead of showing. So at some point you have a character speaking aloud to the supposed catatonic person about how he feels, because the script will not allow him to play out his feelings; and later, a voice-over is suddenly introduced, quite possibly, as an afterthought to convey feelings that otherwise would have remained unknown to the audience due to the director's ineptitude. Fortunately, at this moment you are about an hour later taking care of any of the characters, not to mention the so-called story. <br /> <br /> An acting game that was often a problem in Clausen’s films can be summing up one sad statement: Soren Westerberg Bentsen, whose only other statement of fame as a member of Big Brother is no worse than a few actors in the cast. <br /> <br /> I give it a rating of 2 out of 10.
