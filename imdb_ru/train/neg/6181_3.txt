If you're a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3K, Giant Leech Attacks, or Pinata Island for survival, this movie may be for you. <br /> <br /> I live in Nashville and did not even know about the existence of this film until the day before its release, when the advertising company panicked and covered Music Row with dozens of leaflets and billboards. In any case, in cinemas it lasted almost two weeks. <br /> <br /> Bad play, poor writing and poor production are just beginning to describe this embarrassment of the film. To begin with, what are the names a little: Bo Price, Angel and Dixie? Eesh. <br /> <br /> The awkwardly slow delivery of Toby’s strings makes one wonder which of the producer’s assistants is stuck while removing the cards with the cues from the camera. The character of Angela quickly moves from her city streets to the shepherd boy, who slips into southern slang after two days at the ranch. Her wardrobe moves from the chic to the female version of Toby - in fact, in the final scene their outfits are identical, and the question arises whether the assistant of the wardrobe caused the patient. <br /> <br /> The sound is incompatible - Perhaps the most visible example is when Toby decides to go swimming, and his voice suddenly sounds like he is screaming in the gym. <br /> <br /> There is never enough explanation or character development enough to happen on the screen. Reappraisal, irritation, grimaces and moodiness best describe the interpretation of the actors and the direction of the horrible scenario. <br /> <br /> This movie is best enjoyed after drinking a couple of alcoholic drinks and in the company of your most witty friends. But this does not mean much.
