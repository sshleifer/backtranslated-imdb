I am a Christian ... and I feel that this film is terrible. <br /> <br /> Anyone other than angry Christians from the Bible belt will not like this film. The message is just too in your face. If you want to touch a wider audience, you need to be more subtle. You can't have dad swinging a bible and carry it with you in EVERY scene. FUNNY! <br /> <br /> Bad direction. Finding the missing was supposed to be terrifying, but it was funny. Do they leave their clothes on the ground? It reminded me of old Ed Wood films: “My God! There aren't enough people! ”This scene on the plane is just stupid. Think about it: if you had found the clothes of your relative next to you, you would simply not shout: “My God. They disappeared! They are gone! ”And start crying and screaming. At first you would deny ... you simply would not come to this conclusion. See Jodie Foster at FLIGHTPLAN. My favorite shot is a dog sitting on the lawn with a pile of clothes and boots sitting next to him. I fell off the couch, I was laughing so hard. <br /> <br /> The music was so bad and distracting. As if the composer was in his own world, making his own films. “Here is my chance to make a thriller”, “here is my chance to make an action!” Stop telling me how to feel James Cowell! A good score supports what is happening on the screen ... this film needed more AML points, but instead it was face to face with the message. <br /> <br /> The letter was soft. So was Captain Christian Kirk Cameron. Chelsea was worse: “you do not understand! There are not enough people! ” Brad Johnson was funny. Two outstanding speeches came from the Antichrist and the older guy (sorry, I can't remember their names), watching the “creation” (to answer my question “what did they think ???”), producers, directors and actors just cheat themselves, saying, "We will reach a wide audience," "Brad Johnson is awesome," and "it's like a Hollywood movie." I concluded that they simply did not know what the hell they were doing. <br /> <br /> I appreciate these efforts. Sending a message to a wide audience is a fantastic idea. The film is the best way to do it. Look at films such as Wide Awakening, Signs, Contact, Passion of the Christ, even O Brother, Where is art? The bottom line is that the film should have been made by people who have talent and vision. Unfortunately, this was not.
