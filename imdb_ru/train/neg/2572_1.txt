This movie delivers. Best of all, when an awkward teenage neighbor tries to ride a bike from a nanny, and in the background it seems that in his life he has never been near the bike, trying not to fall. <br /> <br /> but this film does not stop there, when in less than 5 minutes he put the stage out of nothing, except for a hand that reached over the fence and into the refrigerator, pulling out a beer. <br /> <br /> Stereotypical grill dads, a few plot lines that never go away, and the former seaQuest actress with a Bluetooth-enabled mobile phone â€” all this makes this Saturday a perfect evening at home.
