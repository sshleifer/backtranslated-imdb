How does this robbing "Being there" ever become so fond? People say that this is proof that a decent, honest person can succeed, despite the lack of intelligence. They are wrong. The film is proof that luck is all: I hope your friend will put all your money in Apple, not in Atari; I hope that your shrimp boat will be the only one in the sea when a storm breaks out; I hope that you will not die of shock when you manage to shoot at the buttocks, and not in the back; I hope you did not get AIDS from your wife. This film is also politically reactionary â€” everyone who rebels against a social agreement loses their legs, takes drugs, beats their girlfriends or dies young. In addition, product placement in this film (Nike and Dr. Pepper) is shameless. An emotionally manipulative film that is very, very empty.
