I suddenly woke up, realizing that I was drooling on the plastic cover of the sofa, and I realized that it was a warm Saturday afternoon. Why did I sleep? I banged my head? Or accidentally swallow all my grandmother's muscle relaxants? Can it be narcolepsy in adults? <br /> <br /> No, I briefly stopped at Cheap Seats while watching the channels, and the stunning lack of humor and talent drained my life force so fast that I lost consciousness. <br /> <br /> head banging, mouth agape, bad shrug. But I must pay tribute to these retarded and boring twins for selling this idea. They may have had the same effect on the ESPN program manager as they did on me, and when he / she woke up, several terrible episodes were already in the bank, and he / she hoped that, since all of the audience would sleep, no one would now how terrible it is, and he / she can save an annual salary of 425,000 dollars. <br /> <br /> You have been warned.
