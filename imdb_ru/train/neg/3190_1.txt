Jimmy Dean could not be more boorish or ridiculous boorish. Hysterical, if you look through the eyes of Mystery Science Theater 3000, which I rate as 10. I mean that the spectacle of this fat fed corn hog around Malta should be enough to send you to vomit, if you make it so far in film . This ugly, hysterical farce should be similar to “Booty Call”, “Pumpkinhead”, “Swarm” and “The Smurfs Go To Bangladesh”. A film like this one proves that sometimes actors, writers, producers, etc., lag behind in their mortgages or are stoned to madness. This begs the question "who was so stupid as to finance such a whale?" But then, if common sense triumphed, and “Final Justice” never existed, then we would not have a delightful parody voice-over in Mystery Science Theater 3000!
