I read Chris_m_grant's comment from the USA. <br /> <br /> He wrote: “A fantastic 1924 documentary. The geography of today's Iraq at the beginning of the 20th century was powerful. ” <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Chris and the people who are interested in the nomads of Bakhtiari of Iran, the Zagros mountains and landscapes and watch the film “Grass, the nation’s battle for life”. These traditions that you saw in the film have been maintained for centuries and will continue as long as life exists. I myself am from this region of Iran. I am Bakhtiari. <br /> <br /> Chris, I'm sorry to bother you, but the Bakhtiari district in Zardkuh is in Iran, not in Iraq, as you mentioned in your comment. Iran and Iraq are two different and different countries. To take an Iranian for an Iranian is the same as taking an American for a Mexican. Thank you, <br /> <br /> Ziba
