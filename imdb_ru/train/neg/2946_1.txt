I must say that as a child I am proud of many films that I shot. The exception is Theodore Rex. Talk about the movie of a crook of all time in the resume of any actor. Could you imagine that the dismissed agent Whoopi told her to subscribe to this piece of shit: “Hey, Woop, have you ever seen this show Dinosaurs, yes, well, they make a movie out of it, and you will see Germany! “After that, this agent must have often referred to Star Wars. <br /> <br /> This film was so bad that I thought that Whoopi bought every copy of this film and destroyed it. I just wanted to for her to do the same with my memory, because my sister still gives me shit to watch this film. I mean, let me even admit that I watched Mr. Nanny and Kazzam in cinemas (good reasons for which For some time I was disappointed in Hulk Hogan and Shake), but this film was remembered by me as the worst of my childhood, and the biggest regret about renting in my life, and that was 16 years ago. I’m 24 years old if you want to do math. <br /> <br /> Whenever I remember my list of the worst films of all time, I even I don’t mention this one because, as a raped adopted child, I try my best to put down what has ever happened. Hi to you, Whoopie, just rejoice that people recognize only the act of Eddie and sister 2 as your worst, lucky one.
