I have never seen a Tarzan movie before, so when I saw it on TV, I decided that I would do it. Unfortunately, I have to say that I was disappointed. Tarzan was over 40 years old and had extra weight. Not what I thought Tarzan would look like. And if I did not miss it, brewing a cup of tea for myself, Tarzan never issued his traditional cry. There was also a lack of Tarzan swinging among the trees - jumping from vine to vine. <br /> <br /> Well, so much for expectations. Anyway, there was Jane - there was a monkey Cheeta. There was some guy with a guitar. There were villains, good guys and romantics ... everything is very harmless and predictable. Nothing bad, you understand, but equally no good. <br /> <br /> Probably not the best movie to introduce Tarzana: 4/10
