Just do not worry. I thought I would see a movie with great duration and activity. <br /> <br /> But after an interesting start, it becomes boring and terribly predictable. In the middle of the film, you have a little social drama, and all the tension is lost because it slows down the speed. By the end it gets better, but not very cool. I think the director took this film too seriously. In such a film, even if you do not care about the plot, at least you need some pleasant action. I almost fell asleep in the middle / main part. Rating 3/10. <br /> <br /> derboiler.
