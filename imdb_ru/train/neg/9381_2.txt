Tramp Mona lives on the periphery of French society, in a life without meaning, purpose or direction. <br /> <br /> I watched it because of all the star reviews, but I'm afraid I missed something. Mona's character has almost no individuality as he drifts through life, being rude to people, rising and bringing nothing into life. It is not interesting or exciting. She's just useless. <br /> <br /> I saw and knew enough such people: there is no secret meaning in what they do. They are just lazy asses. I would not want Mona to be by my side, since she tends to steal everything that is not nailed down and leave her friends in distress. Of course, it is mysterious - because there is nothing in it. Many drug addicts, wine and asses, which I saw, are mysterious; I wouldn't want to watch a movie about them either. <br /> <br /> Perhaps there is something that I completely missed. Otherwise, I assume that all reviews belong to people who believe that everything that is done by a French director is a high art.
