My God, this was the most painful experience in my life. I could even finish this, what is happening with Nick. Their best thing on teen Nick is Drake and Josh, and is about to air. Children's songs are a bit annoying, just like kids. My younger sister wanted to see the show, because she likes everything that usually happens on Disney or Nick, but after watching this show, she said: "One of the worst shows I've ever seen so boring." My younger brother actually fell asleep, I envy him. In short, if you are 3 years without brain activity, you will like this show, otherwise change the channel now.
