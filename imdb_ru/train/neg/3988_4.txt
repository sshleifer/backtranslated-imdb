In short, <br /> <br /> Spike Lee clearly thinks a lot. He thinks about racism, about color, media and hegemony, about consumption and capitalism, religion, sexism, "heterosexuality", the policy of the war on drugs, etc. This level of consciousness. <br /> <br /> This level of consciousness Own is great. I think it is a blessing that more and more people choose to critically examine the fundamental aspects of our daily life; the silent and invisible forces that govern our societies. However, the fact that Lee makes controversial films does not make him a good director. <br /> <br /> What is found in the “Jungle Fever” is a superficial understanding of these socio-political forces. This is largely the result of two major failures: first, Lee just tries too hard. He seems to be desperate to adapt every political / social statement he can come up with in the 1990s. And as such, the end result seems confusing and indecisive, because it does not allow itself time to develop characters that can fully embody the ideas that he hopes to present. And so he exhausts the stereotypes, and we are left with rash testimonies and very loaded dialogues. The end result is very staged and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Secondly, trying to make statements about such a wide variety of social functions, he does not seem to have a specific or original interpretation of the social / political problems presented. What comes across is a pool of regurgitated meaninglessness. You feel that he bought a textbook on sociology for an entry level and threw all 500 pages. <br /> <br /> These are very problematic features, because the artistry of the film is sacrificed, and the work turns into a speaker for the voice of the director. He cannot distance himself from work and let her speak for himself. <br /> <br /> It is neither a work of art, nor a sound political argument. <br /> <br /> Although I am still grateful to Li for raising these important questions, I must say: <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down.
