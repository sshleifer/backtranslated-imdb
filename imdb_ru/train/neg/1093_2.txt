Kitten Natividad, known in the Russ Meyer film, plays Chastity Nott, a woman who has breast cancer, so she goes to South America to get some special fruit (Crockazilla?), Which should have healing properties. After dropping down on some of these fruits (which seem to be plastic bananas on stalks), Integrity is endowed with some mystical magical powers that make it a superhero, in particular, the Double Avenger. Note that she also wears a pair of panties as a mask. In writing, it sounds pretty good. In the performance, well, it leaves much to be desired. It seems that Chastity owns a pub, and the local striptease is upset because it takes their business, so some strippers (including Haji, also known from the Russ Meyer film) go after her to destroy her. Of course, Chastity resists in the guise of the Double Avenger. See how she does the “Wonder Woman” type of rotation to change into her outfit, and also lose balance due to excessive centrifugal force. Bad jokes and lame doubles fly, as if tomorrow was not. With a meaningless dark song playing over and over again, this sounds like a “live action” of a twenties 70s children's show with content for adults, although, although it is not classified, it may in the worst case come off PG-13. And it is probably a blessing that the faded stars are well covered. This makes Doris Wishman Honor Morgan films look good in comparison. The particular appearance of Forest J. Ackerman, but so what. Very stupid, and I never buy another movie with Joe Bob Briggs on the cover. 2 out of 10.
