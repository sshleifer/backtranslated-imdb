Just good, a movie about a woman who is a twin, with her sisterâ€™s disturbing vision of being in danger at home. She then returns home and discovers that things are not so good, and that she will have to find out what happened to her sister and why. <br /> <br /> This is something that almost works, but does not help. t pretty. I cannot understand why this did not work, but it was good enough, and I kind of wanted it to be better, or at least correctly understood such trifles as having girls who play twins in memories to be closer size. I think maybe there are a lot of little things in this that are simply wrong.
