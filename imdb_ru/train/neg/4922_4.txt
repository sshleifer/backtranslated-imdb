DRACULA 2000 is a horror film that was constantly shown in the British Sky Movies, and, given that it was shown three times a week for a whole year, I absolutely can’t imagine how I missed it until its first show on the web. tv tonight. In fact, seeing that I'm not a big fan of horror films, the reason was probably in my theory that this would be a hoax. My theory turned out to be correct for the most part. <br /> <br /> !!!!! MANY SPOILERS !!!!! <br /> <br /> What makes DRACULA 2000 such a bad movie is the number of stupid scenarios. For example, at the beginning of the movie the bad guys fly in the coffin of Dracula from London to America (in a twin-engine turboprop aircraft!), And one of the bad guys is left alone in the cargo hold where Dracula comes to life. A fight begins, a lot of noise, but the bad guys in the cabin do not hear the sound until the script requires it. Also at the climax of this segment appears that Dracula can control the weather, but this seems forgotten as the film progresses. Inaccurate scripting, and there also seems to be a problem with the structure in which the character’s numerous scenes are in New Orleans, and then the characters are in another place, such as the police station, in the next scene, after which they return to Mardi Gras This, which means that the lack of credibility in the plot is enhanced. <br /> <br /> There is something else that has torn out my chain - product placement. There are many scenes where the logo for a particular record company / retail network is in full view. I don’t dare to publicize the company's brand (except for the fact that they also run a railway company, which is a national joke in the UK), but I got the impression that this type of advertising was against the British broadcast guidelines, and I’m surprised that The BBC showed this film, if so. <br /> <br /> In DRACULA 2000 there are some advantages, for example, visual effects. In fact, this is a good looking film with a good looking cast, and the boy has been that hot vampire tiptoe, but this is to be expected from Hollywood over the past few years - A very good looking film that is very dumb
