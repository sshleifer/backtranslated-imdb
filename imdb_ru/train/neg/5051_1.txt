I am simultaneously surprised and disgusted with people who claim that this film is very accurate about Vietnam, and NEVER WAS. This film is about as true in the entire Vietnam War as the beating of Rodney King is true of ALL police officers. Yes, bad things happen (and happen), but in general, people there are just like you and me. They have a moral, they don't kill cars, they don't all use drugs. Atrocities in Vietnam were the exception, not the rule. They happened much less frequently than the “hype” would have made you believe. Oliver Stone is able to make films that show the Vietnam War as this brutal bloodshed, but are based on reality just like Star Wars. If you honestly believe the stereotypes of Vietnam, do yourself a favor and find out the truth. Fact: The Viet Cong and the NCA did much worse things with the South Vietnamese than ANY soldier in the US Armed Forces. Fact: Soldiers in World War II treated the enemy as a whole much worse than soldiers in Vietnam, and they were WELCOMED when they returned home. The wonderful Americans who served this country in Vietnam deserve our respect; although from a political point of view, the war was terrible, no one could ask our soldiers for more, and this is a great disservice - to assert that this kind of “mostly true” fiction is how it all was.
