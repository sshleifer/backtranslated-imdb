A prerequisite for creating such a film is a complete ignorance of the work and personality of Nietzsche, the psychoanalytic methods and the history of Vienna. Take a famous genius whom you have not read, describe him as a madman, turn on mad doctors to cure him, a couple of pretty pretty women, play the role of an actor with a huge mustache, let each character speak with the strongest accent, show ridiculous dreams, include another a prestigious figure who has nothing to do with the first (Freud), mention a few words used in the works of genius, overdo everything that you can, especially with music, and everything is ready. Audience, please stay away.
