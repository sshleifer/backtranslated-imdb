I expected to enjoy a romantic comedy featuring hip-hop, but was disappointed on many levels. Firstly, the story is so poorly processed that it makes it almost unbearable. Secondly, the setting, acting and history are not very reliable or believable. Third, many more good black actors to choose from than these standard choices. How about originality? Thirdly, there were very few hip-hop songs played in full - if any. Neither seemed really central. Overall, the film was a big disappointment, but the editing style was very interesting and almost made the film worthwhile.
