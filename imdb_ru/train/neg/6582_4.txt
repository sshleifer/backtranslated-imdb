God, another movie for life, but again, not the worst movie in the world, but far from the best. I think that the main problem is that it’s obvious who is responsible for what, and in general it’s pretty predictable. Worst of all, some of the memories ended in confusion, and the viewer is left wondering: “Okay, how much should I be worried?” the guys are good and the bad guys are bad, ”and sometimes this is evil against evil, and not good against evil. Hadley did not do what she did, from a sense of justice, she did it because she considered herself entitled to work as a family and exclude competition. For Alicia, it simply proves that sacrifice is not always a good person. Some of them really “expect it,” even if “it” was a painful, horrible death. The “burning bed” is an excellent example of this, but the difference is that the mean-spirited person in “The burning bed” got exactly what he deserved. But did Alicia have it? Some will say what she did, but others disagree, and the law, as a rule, also. <br /> <br /> As for acting, it's a mixed bag. Some do a good job like Mia, but others are just indifferent to their roles. They were mostly wooden or just not compelling. The music was pretty cool, and some of the scenes were nice and intense, especially if you like action. The film is not bad shot, but, given its obvious shortcomings, strengths, unfortunately, in the background. <br /> <br /> I heard rumors about a continuation, but, given the years, I doubt it will happen. But I would not be surprised if a continuation suddenly appears. If Alicia is just as EVIL, insidious and terrible as people say, then I don’t think she will think, “YES! I woke up from a coma! Oh, was Hadley in charge? ABOUT! It's good! and I want the charges to be dropped! In any case, Hadley will not be in prison for a long time, if she ever goes to prison, because the murder has not really happened. <br /> <br /> In any case, it is worth checking at least once!
