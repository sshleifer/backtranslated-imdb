When My Deja Vu, My Déjà Vu came out last season, I was pleased. I thought Scrubs was doing something clever and unique about the concept of a clip show. Instead of reproducing the footage, they reproduce the jokes self-consciously, and I really liked it. <br /> <br /> It seemed to me very regrettable that I was mistaken. One season later, they gave in to what almost all the comedy series, the clip, inevitably do ... and it seemed that it was collected by a child with experience. Dr. Cox's shaved head reveals how lazy the editors were, creating it together, since it does not reappear until My Long Farewell, about 4 episodes later. I cannot imagine that a wig is too much effort when it comes to maintaining the continuity of what was once a good sitcom. Who knows why he was there, just seemed lazy and inappropriate, reminding me of (mostly) the episodes that aired last year. <br /> <br /> The three seconds of the clip stuck with the background music is an Extra DVD for a (very) rainy day, not a prime time episode.
