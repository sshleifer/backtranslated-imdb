My friend lent me this video, and I was pretty excited to watch it, but after ten minutes of the slow vocal of James Hetfield and Lars knocking on his drum set in what seemed slow, I began to think: I am watching this? This question will pop up in your minds in 5 ?? 10 minutes after you clicked Play. I returned the tape that day, as you suspect, not worth buying or watching! <br /> <br /> Just my opinion! <br /> <br />
