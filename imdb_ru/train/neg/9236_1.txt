I am among the millions who consider themselves to be Cary Grant fans, but I can’t think of any reason to recommend this film. I don't understand the casting of Betsy Drake, and it seems no one did if we judge by the small number of films in which she played afterwards. <br /> <br /> Most fans would agree that Katherine Hepburn was excellent in pursuing and catching Cary Grant in “Raising a Child”. Here the director or the writers try to paraphrase the Idea, but fail miserably. I read the comments about how “creepy” Drake was, but I thought it was too soft a description. Franco Ton went through this as if he was a hangover. Casting disaster is one thing. This film is a complete disaster. <br /> <br /> This film doesn’t deserve 10 comment lines, and I don’t know why this requirement. It is unfortunate that this one was saved when so many decent films were rotting in the vaults. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to torment someone, give it a wide place.
