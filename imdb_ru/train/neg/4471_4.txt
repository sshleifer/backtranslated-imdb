The best I can say about this film is that it was sometimes a little funny, and that it was an adequate time killer. Unfortunately, this film is also so annoying that I wanted to hit these characters. This is such a sweet film that hurts your teeth. The intentions were good, I suppose, but things get terribly tedious when the dialogue is SO disgusting. When two leads are not together on the screen, itâ€™s not bad at all, but be afraid in those frequent moments when a loving couple starts talking to each other.
