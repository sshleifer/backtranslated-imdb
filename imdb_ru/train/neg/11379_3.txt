When I first saw a small scene from this in some ads, I thought it would be interesting to watch the show. The little robot guy looks pretty cute. The animation style looks familiar to some classic shows. Before the start of the show, I studied it through several sources. There I was a little worried. Three children (Tommy, Gus and Lola) are voiced accordingly, but Robotboy is an exception. It would be much nicer if he was portrayed by a young guy. One good example is Robot Jones, a robot character from the movie “What Happened to Robot Jones?” The show is really good. But the way Robotboy is portrayed improperly is my only criticism. So I do not look this much.
