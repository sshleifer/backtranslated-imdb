Over the years I have seen a bunch of these right on Segal video films, and each of them has the same amount of entertainment; Unfortunately, the level of entertainment is low. Of course, the sequence of actions was funny, but it was almost everything. Seagal was really in his prime when he was shooting a movie; Under Siege, Under Siege 2 and Executive Decision (at least in terms of action), but over the past ten years, films of this type in which Seagal was shot do not really meet his past requirements. <br /> <br /> incl. a more positive side, the film did use time, like some action sequences and the use of wit. Just at the time when the film seemed to be just dragging out, a rather steep action movie pulled it out of the gutter. I truly believe that more Segal films would have been better if he hadnâ€™t been the only one that fans would recognize in the film. Supporting actors and actresses is a very important thing, and if there are famous actors and actresses in his current films, perhaps the film will get more popular results.
