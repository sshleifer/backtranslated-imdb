Where to begin? <br /> <br /> # 1 Son Amitabha, played by Akshay Khanna, is 30 years old. <br /> <br /> Amitabh has been in prison for over 33 years ... he <br /> <br /> A) Telepathically transferred the sperm home? <br /> <br /> B) I asked a good Pakistani guard to send him by mail? <br /> <br /> C) They allow spousal visits to secret Pakistani prisons <br /> <br /> D) All of the above <br /> <br /> E) Producers had too much noise in <br / > <br /> time when they approved the script? <br /> # 2) Amrita Rao (Yummm!) wants Hannah - he is yum, yum, yummy ... and, obviously, he wants her - whoever would become, right ?! ... But when her dad was pissed off and then killed (I don't think this is a "spoiler", since you would have to be breathtaking and blind not to see this in the film), he is rather insensitive to this catastrophe and with the tip (figuratively) of his hat leaves her behind to save his father, not paying attention to her loss, and says (paraphrasing) "If God wants, we will meet again" ... Basically it means: "I am going get my father d My work is done, sorry for the loss - CYA! Buh, bye! "- Callus outside even modest Hollywood standards ... <br /> <br /> # 3) There are so many holes in this terrible waste of time called a film that you can drive all the jeeps, camels and any other things through it Come on - really, a complete and complete waste of time - Oh! There is an excellent dance sequence (yes, only one - as in a dance sequence - regardless of quality), great belly dancing - but you should NOT look only for this. <br /> < br /> Rent a Veer-Zaara or Lakshya (Hrithik Roshan will someday be ? Men acting classes) for best films of the Indo-Pak conflict ... In fact, Veer-Zaara damn good - 7.5 / 8 I say!
