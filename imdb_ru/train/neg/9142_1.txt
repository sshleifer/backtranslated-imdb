I just watched it after I heard about how it was all bad, and I wanted to make sure myself. Seriously, even if you read all the negative comments, you will not be able to understand anywhere how terrible this film is, although this must be one of the most fun things I've ever seen! Never bothered to leave a comment here before, but this piece of shit really deserves it. <br /> <br /> First, the whole plot is funny and meaningless. The brother of the protagonist (Ben or Arthur, I forgot that there is, and, frankly, it is never clear) wants to stop some same-sex marriage, killing everyone in sight - because homosexuality is disgusting for Christians, but obviously massive killing is not "t. Then there is some sort of nonsense in which one of the ex-wives of a gay couple has fallen who tried to force him to marry her at gunpoint. This does not lead to anything, but it gives us one of the most amusing lines of dialogue in the whole “film” - “I don’t make sense? You do not make sense! That's who makes sense! ” Brilliant. <br /> <br /> Then there is an action that is just awful. Must see to believe. My personal favorite is a female civil rights lawyer, who obviously reads something in her lines, but still managed to spoil them. Enough said. A gay couple cannot be less convincing. There is a vaguely attractive and completely ruthless guy and his boyfriend, similar to this little man from the advertising bisto. Only thicker and less talented. <br /> <br /> The “film” was also shot by someone who is not able to keep the camera even at a distance, and the number of errors is amazing. It all starts with a fat main guy in bed in boots. Yes. <br /> <br /> But in any case, we all know how terrible this thing is, so I would like to highlight some of the most priceless comedy moments that the “film” gives. <br /> <br /> - When a fat man sets fire to a church, and then jumps, like a six-year-old girl, through the parking lot to escape. Happy. <br /> <br /> Sweet! I have no idea what relation she has to the main characters - sometimes they know her, sometimes not, but nevertheless she pops up in several scenes. Happy. <br /> <br /> - Stone Lawyer. Already mentioned her, but she is so funny that it is worth another mention. <br /> <br /> - The terrible dinner of brothers with crackers, which he serves for his guests. <br /> <br /> - Evil Brother vs. Potion for Gays. <br /> <br /> - Cats of the evil brother. <br /> <br /> - An end that I will not give up because it MUST be seen to be believed. I warn you, though, make sure you do not eat at that time !!!! In the tub fat the main character / director / producer undresses. This is dirty. <br /> <br /> In essence, Ben and Arthur are indescribably bad, but inadvertently the funniest thing you'll see for a long time. In the literal sense, there is nothing wrong with this excuse for the film, and the director even manages to turn the opening credits into a joke, having written his name about 15 times.
