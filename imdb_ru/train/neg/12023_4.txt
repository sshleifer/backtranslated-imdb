Reed Diamond plays a man suffering from amnesia, who was in a psychiatric hospital for more than ten years after he was discovered on surprising country roads with blood on his hands. Doctors want to try out a new experimental drug that will bring back his lost memories if it works. But when the drugs make him demonic hallucinations, he prefers to escape. While outside he is friends with a little boy whose stepfather (Greg Grünberg) is mistreating his mother, does not let her near the dark room in his basement and behaves suspiciously at all. <br /> <br /> Although a common “secret” film is a way that is easy to determine until it was uncovered, I found that Mr. Diamond’s actions are so exciting that they do not distract attention from me. (In the interests of full disclosure, I was a big fan of him from the moment of the murder and his brief but extremely important role in the film “Shield through Journeyman & Dollhouse”). Not a very good movie, but not a good one, but good enough. Although I liked it more than in previous films that I saw with director / screenwriter Michael Hirst (room 6, Pumkinhead 4, Mansquito) <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: one passing pair of boobs in hallucination <br> <br /> My rating: C-
