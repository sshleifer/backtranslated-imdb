I received this film from a private collector, and I was very curious. He had 7.8 in IMDb (only 9 votes), and some external comments were pleasant. But I must say that this is a very plain and uninteresting text. Yes, great cinematography, the film is well shot, but he never worried me. It all starts well, but although it’s not boring to me at all, the story is so ordinary, and things are happening so normally that I didn’t like it very much. <br /> <br /> You can laugh a little, And you can see a few small boobs. But if you like those that I like (weird, surreal, senseless, bloody, atmospheric, brutal murders ...), you will not like this movie. <br /> <br /> I give him 4 good direction and editing, and the last turns that make the movie interesting. But it can be much better.
