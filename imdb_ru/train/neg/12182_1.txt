Well, where should I start? I think this is very insulting to the original Annie with Eileen Cymn. I like the movie Annie, and I expected it to be a brilliant movie, but I was so disappointed! The acting is terrible, the original Annie came out a few years before I was born, I am now 25, and Annie is still one of my favorite films, so I was very happy to see Annie 2. The acting was terrible Some of the characters were original ? very poorly written, directed and acted. This is not the film that I would like to see again, and I recommend any lover of Annie not to watch this movie, because it will only disappoint. Young girls sing well, but still do not match the original
