I always felt that a good movie should have a plot. There was no one in this particular film, and I feel that it would be more effective with the plot. It got worse because it went on forever; I really wanted it to finally end. However, I only noticed that it was only 123 minutes; it seemed like four o'clock. Not only was there no conspiracy, but the film also lacked a noticeable conflict. This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I said it was until I saw The Fast And The Furious. So do not think that my review is from someone who needs nothing but action. I really hate most action movies today; just this movie is on the other end of the spectrum. Little is happening in this movie. However, the scenery and costumes were good.
