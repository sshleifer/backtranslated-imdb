Thomas Clay mingled with the wrong types. This is a problem of young people who do not respect them. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this film should be avoided at all costs. The action in the main part of the film is slow and rather heavy and approaches the crazy ending of the drug, as if, like its director, he has nowhere to go. We get acquainted with the main title character, who is a little stranger, we see him at school and at home, which does not quite fit, feeling uncomfortable, as many teenagers do. Robert falls with the bad guys and starts skipping school and taking drugs, and before you know it, he is a psychopist. <br /> <br /> The film actually tells of Clay’s complete inability to understand the connection between images of violence and acts of violence. Clay seems to think that the generation of crazy young people is getting angry because of the war scenes on our televisions. nevertheless, he removed the most disgusting fragment of simulated violence. Is this guy really? <br /> <br /> If Clay didn’t see YouTube, maybe he’s naive and unaware of what will be done with the brutal climax of his movie? All that anyone wants to see is the most disgusting scene from the end of the film, and I am sure that this is what will remain in people. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is meaningless, because to commit such an act of violence in the film Clay not only curses young people who are actively involved in preventing war, but also curses himself as the originator of extreme tasteless violence for some better reason. than his personal celebrity status. <br /> <br /> Shame on all participants.
