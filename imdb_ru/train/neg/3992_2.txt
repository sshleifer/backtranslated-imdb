Director Spike Lee is famous for making films about racism. In many films, such as Do it Right, most white people are cruel racists. This film is about interracial marriage, and racism again becomes the main theme. <br /> <br /> However, Lee again demonstrates his fanaticism against Christianity. Surprisingly double standards that exist in the world of cinema. If Lee or anyone else had made such a bias against another group, would he be offended, but by Christians? Hello, for them it is an "open season". <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis, the reverend in this film, shoots his son and then puts the smoldering pistol on top of his Bible. They increase it for another close-up in case you missed it. Hey guys, here's another Bible reader and look what he is! Lee does these things in almost every movie he makes. <br /> <br /> He shows the same hatred when it comes to race relations. Who can argue with the image of racism as evil? However, Lee perpetuates this in this film, as in his other films. His obvious bitterness towards white people does not help the situation. It only adds fuel to the fire. <br /> <br /> Hey Spike: start “doing the right thing” and leave your prejudices in the closet. Better yet: "Overcome it." <br /> <br /> This is very bad, because the subject could have been made for a film that makes one wonder if it was made with objectivity and intelligence.
