This film has been a long time without a climax. People who ultimately consider the sword fight great must either be out of their mind or not have them. Too often, this film became soft. I'm not saying that soft films are bad. But no matter how much you like sugar, there should be no place on a bone steak. It was assumed that this film is about revenge for crimes committed against culture, but in the end it turned into a minor fight. And there was only one of them who really knew what a sword was; Tim Roth's character (and yes, he plays him well). Rob Roy was a weak “hero”, not knowing how to use a sword, and how he “defeated” was a shame. Like a drama, this film had its periods, but the best performance in it should go about the nature of Scotland. This one breath, which in my book is called "soap."
