It may or may not be the worst movie that Steve Martin has ever made, but he certainly was not the best. Obviously, he did this shit for paycheck. Dreck, as it certainly does not contribute to his reputation as a funny person. It seems he does not understand that when people go to watch a film about Steve Martin, they expect to be entertained, and not bored to tears. Sad that he dragged Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman with him. I don't understand why talented people can't understand that people don't want to see them in lousy movies. If you are going to call the movie a comedy, then it must be funny. This was not the Shame of the American military for allowing themselves to be connected with this trifle. Full Metal Jacket had more laughter than this pitiful excuse for “service comedy.” Of course, Phil Silvers rolls over in his grave.
