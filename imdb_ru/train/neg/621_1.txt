Holy @ #%, and this film was still warm and mellow from the pile with which it was made. I tried to look at this pile of festering waste, but it was easier for me to cut my wrists and beat off the arrow of Lysol floor cleaner than to take out more than half of the crap that was on my screen. I rate it a lot below everything I've ever watched on a movie or on TV, and that says something. Once I witnessed cow shit in the field. I watched a steaming pile for an hour and a half, who knows ... she could move or something like that. Well, it was a better time than watching this prank. Acting was not, the plot was not the same as in this film. I think I saw an early comment when the story was saved and he was driving in the background in the back of an old pickup truck heading for Portland hoping to become Stephen King's shi77er. Please tell me that the director gets the drugs he so desperately needs. It is clear that he needs heavy medication, and I would like to get the money necessary for his reversion of a lobotomy. Bach ... I can't give this review the full blow it needs, because nothing so painful can ever be done right in the printed words alone. Let me just say that if you are looking for a click to go for a while, and you see this Chilton on the rack, go to your car, start the engine, then put both fists right into the fan until you feel your bones vibrate more . Be sure to keep your wallet in your hands also because you are still going to spend money. You might also have the privilege to spend it yourself. <br /> <br /> By the way, I watched it after my “buddy” sent his girlfriend so that I could see it. HE has come, she has too. To make matters worse, she had to watch this $% & @ thing TWICE! I heard that they are married now, and he attends his balls once a month. I hope this is because of this movie.
