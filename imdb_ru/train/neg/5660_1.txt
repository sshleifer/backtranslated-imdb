I am glad to read so many negative comments about Tritter's plot. Everyone I talk to says the same thing. They like House’s rough nature and his mind, but they don’t really like the vindictiveness of this ongoing conspiracy. This cuts into the real nature of the hospital's history and makes everyone angry at the police authorities. He should be more caring, not vindictive for everyone in the hospital. In addition, it seems there are many questionable legal aspects of what Tritter actually does. He alone can not freeze accounts and has the right not to let doctors write prescriptions for patients. The many vindictions he demonstrates also hurt very sick patients in the hospital, and this is not a good storyline for the image. I voted for this episode terribly not because of the story itself, but when you insert the play “Trittor”, it turns me off, and the rest of the plot suffers from it. People say they no longer want to see storylines. Please change this. Take out Tritter.
