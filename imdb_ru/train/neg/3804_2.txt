This is a bad movie by any measure. The story at Match Point had a certain intrigue, direction and spelling of a certain charm (Woody Allen mixed his own culture with classic English murder and studied what can be done about it). <br /> <br /> Scoop, however has none of this. It is poorly written, the two leads are hopelessly wooden, and the story itself has no interest whatsoever. The genre that he forges requires at least some plot with witty explanations and connections (why are tarot cards and keys kept under French horns in locked rooms?). <br /> <br /> Delightful and witty versions of Allen Various Hollywood genres (The Curse of Jade Scorpion / Violet Rose of Cairo, etc.) have given us so much pleasure over the years. Even the Hollywood finale had a great idea. Unfortunately, his inspiration left him this time.
