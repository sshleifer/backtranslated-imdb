FOREIGN LOVE (as this film is known in Britain) is a very strange film. I don't mean that this is an esoteric art house film in the style of Peter Greenaway or Derek Jarman, I mean, this is a TVM with a curse, sex, really good T & A, a bad script and a very retro feel. You can just imagine someone like John Hughes, who led these ten years earlier, although, of course, he would cut T & A. <br /> <br /> Returning to a bad scenario, one of the problems is that few of the characters have any type of motivation, especially Amanda. Why does she pick up connie at the bar? Just so she could meet the alien? Do you understand what I mean by retro? ET, SHORT CIRCUIT and a number of other films from the mid-1980s had this type of plot, and most of them were clearer and more convincing than those shown here. The storyline continues to follow a poorly defined, unconvincing and illogical path. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I discovered that FOREIGN LOVE is watchable, and not just before the demonstration. As a science fiction sex comedy, it is much better than FLESH GORDON and EARTH GIRLS EASY
