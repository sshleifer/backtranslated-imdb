Hearing such praise for this play, I decided to watch it when I stumbled upon it by cable. I do not see how this “facilitates” women and their “struggle” by focusing on the topic at hand. I suppose if you have an interest in the stories about women's personal things and how they affect their lives, then this is for you. Otherwise, it is rather dull and boring. In any case, it seemed to me a bit humiliating. <br /> <br /> I asked a friend who was watching this too, and she thought it was terrible too. So, this is not just a guy "not understanding this."
