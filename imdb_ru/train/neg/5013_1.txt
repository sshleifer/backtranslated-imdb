I will not argue with anyone who pronounces this film as doable, like, for example, John Jones, but please check it out, if you haven’t already, in the AMC series Mad Men, which will start later on month like the whole cast. I, to put it mildly, suppose that she took on the role of "Taboo" strictly for money, and, realizing what a rotten mess it would be, turned into minimal acting work in order to avoid starvation. I know if this is so, but I (now) know for sure that she can act. <br /> <br /> At first, looking at Taboo, I was convinced that her renting an apartment was a tricky choice that would later give rise to some significant revelation about her character or plot. Bad luck. It is hard to believe that the director did not offer her at least once, that a constant expression for 17 consecutive scenes could cause a jaw. <br /> <br /> Ironically, her victorious performance in “Mad People” appears as a character who, at least in her early appearances, is very depressed, restrained, unsure of herself, and rather colorless, little more than different from its role as "Taboo." But as the series progressed, it began to flourish due to the fact that it questioned her traditional role as a mother in the early 60s. Can't wait to see where they take her character in season 2. <br /> <br /> To summarize, avoid Taboo as leprosy, but be sure to watch Mad Men.
