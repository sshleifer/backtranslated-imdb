I see the guys preparing the budget for this film. “Well, let's see now, we are spending 50% on getting Dirk Benidikt, because Battle Star Galactic and A-Team were cool. We spend 40% on creating the demon costume, not to mention the fact that the demon is considered ethereal in the script. ” And we spend our holidays making a movie. ” It was very bad and VERY cliche .... There is a loved one who looks (or brings a good book)
