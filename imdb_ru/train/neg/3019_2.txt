How can you take her hardworking, glamorous, cruel bounty hunter story with this accent? This is absurd. In addition, the directorâ€™s visual style is nauseous and useless, the plot is shallow, boring, tangled paraphrasing of the gangster movie, and the action is unconvincing. The film introduces new characters throughout the film and tells fragmented memories - mostly not in order - apparently, just so you are cute and confused. The film ever shows you THINGS THAT DID NOT REALLY HAPPEN, and then says: "This really did not happen, it did" - look at the (obvious) murder of (fake) "first ladies." What did we see at the beginning the wrong sequence of events at that time? <br /> <br /> A terrible choice of actors, an intricate, dirty plot and a directorial style that causes headaches. 1/5
