As a veteran of the army, I was deeply offended by this film. In my opinion, this is a shame for those who fought in the Vietnam War. To say that the real SF soldiers I knew were offended by this nonsense is an understatement. If the film were presented in the form of satire or even in the form of a cartoon (it was), it would be better perceived. But this was taken seriously by my many people, especially abroad. No matter how silly this may sound, wherever I went to Europe in the late 80s, people seem to have judged me and the Americans in general from this film. Unreal? Hmm, we'll see. A monosyllabic muscular nerd is being removed from a prison gang to go on a secret mission to Southeast Asia to release some American prisoners of war. In battle, he kills about 500 enemy soldiers from an M-60 machine gun, which never runs out of ammunition and it never overheats. And he never misses, running with a 32-pound rifle raised with one hand. I could go on, but I have a headache. I gave it 2/10 just because it's a little better than Rambo III.
