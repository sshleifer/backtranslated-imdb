The first ten minutes of Just Looking really determine the direction in which most of this film moves. Lenny (Ryan Merriman) is a 14-year-old boy living in New York in the 50s. He has a strong desire to see two people having sex. Who are the best people he means? Well, my mom and stepfather, of course! How pleasant unfortunately for Lenny, he was caught before he saw something, and was sent for the summer to stay with his uncle and uncle's wife. <br /> <br /> Lenny’s next plan is to see his uncle and his wife having sex. However, the wife is pretty pregnant, and now they are not sleeping together. Then Lenny gets a new friend. He and his buddy spend most of their free time hanging out with a couple of girls. They have a small club where they just sit and talk about sex. The problem is that ... it is not done in an innocent, charming way of the 1950s. I am not a hypocrite by ANY means, but I was rather anxious to listen to how these children talk about masturbation, blowjob and anal sex. Such rawness may work in a film similar to Children (1995), but in this film it just seems perverted. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol is completely wasted here, like Hedy, a former bra model that becomes the object of Lenny's carnal desires. Jason Alexander needs to stay as far away from the director's chair as possible. “Better or worse” (1996) was terrible and like that. What a waste. 1/10
