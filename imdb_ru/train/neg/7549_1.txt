If Edward Woodward was the film that watched this film, then this is what he would scream in horror. <br /> <br /> Sorry, guys, but that's enough. We had “Get Carter”, “The Italian Job”, “Alfie” and now this. What is the similarity? No, it is not a coincidence that the three original stars of Maurice Micklewhite and other stars are another great British actor. The main common ingredient in these originals is British film. They were not created to impress Hollywood. These were fancy English films with a unique charm / atmosphere that are simply impossible to reproduce in the USA. The word CULT and the best way to destroy a cult film than to kill it with a remake or even a sequel. <br /> <br /> Wicker 06 had a difficult task even before it hit the road. Wicker 73 is even more mysterious than the other cult films mentioned; he challenges the genre, the intellectual scenarios, the actors of the class, the musical score, the scenery that defies description, and all the stories surrounding the film. <br /> <br /> So, here's a remake. Do not worry When creating this remake the originals were not damaged. Some modern aspects of history had to be reworked for the modern United States - communications, paganism, virgins. But this is about the whole premise. Thus, we give the police a Nam-style injury, complete with memories of shock music for cheap fears. Then there was no mobile phone mast on the island to break the connection, but in the real world this would not have happened. Cops just do not disappear. Give him a blood connection for motivation, not collision of beliefs, and you have a remake. The waffle is thin, isn't it, is it? <br /> <br /> Just everything was smeared with a spatula. The name changes were just Hammi, almost “go on”, there was no sense in community on the island, there was no center of the city where you could navigate, just a few houses scattered in the forest, and that’s all. Willow just annoyed without giving out any information, and Cage was useless to let her get away with it. When he entered the well, you just knew that he had locked it. The script was marked to the very end - and you just wanted him to hurry and end. The epilogue was completely cheerful and did not know when to stop. <br /> <br /> This ending is probably the best way to summarize the difference between them. Each one ends with the most beautiful sunset after the most terrible day. The other ends with a post-production conclusion of the “explain everything to the crowd” type. <br /> <br /> I liked the original, but I went to the cinema with an open heart and was thrilled to see the film, I left thankful, knowing that this film is likely to be under the highway somewhere only this time, fortunately forever forgotten.
