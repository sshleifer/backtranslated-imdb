I watched it with my girlfriend after stumbled upon her while watching channels. <br /> <br /> I think we both hoped for some happy, family-friendly, pretty Christmas movie, but were extremely disappointed. <br /> <br /> the actor playing the soldier seems to have no emotions, his face looks the same, regardless of whether he cuts down the Christmas tree, sees the girl who likes to kiss her boyfriend, or when he is happily surprised the girl he loves, he is a terrible actor, and by no means have any of us done anything but laugh at him. <br /> <br /> Then there is a sweet blond girl, endowed with the ability to count points and deceive her boyfriend, what a trick! and her life ambitions are to live with her parents and count more points. <br /> <br /> This is a story about a guy without any emotions or feelings who falls in love with a guy who counts points and cheats on his boyfriend. , it’s as predictable as it turns out, and really a waste of time, you’ll get nothing watching it, except for strange laughter, because everything is so banal. <br /> <br /> I like when her father says that he eats only french fries, not French wine, and they all laugh, so what’s the attitude to this film is brave, moreover, if my girlfriends, Dad, looked after me, like, I would tell him something or not, but not our army is a veteran, no, sir, he allows everyone to look after him. <br /> <br /> The film is what First Blood would be if John Rambo was set on fire as the biggest weakling in the world.
