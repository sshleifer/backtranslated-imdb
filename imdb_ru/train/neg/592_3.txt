All the logic goes straight from the train window in this British horror film, filmed in the London Underground and in which usually plays a reliable Frank Potente (Run Lola Run). Franca plays Kate, a business woman, going from a corporate party to meet with friends who fall asleep at the subway station, only to wake up and find that she is locked up and finds herself being pursued by “someone” or “something "with the intentions of the killer. <br /> <br /> Holes in conspiracies and improbability are common and there are very few moments that are actually nervous / frightening, but many that are just plain boring. <br /> <br /> In general, an unpleasant film that must remain locked up forever and provide us all with a service. <br /> <br /> The only advantage here is the inclusion of the popular veteran actor Ken Campbell in the cast, who has achieved greater success than this ?? it even including the "Erasmus Mikroman"!.
