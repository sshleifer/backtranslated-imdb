What a disappointment! I hated mom, but this one was even worse! It was very tiring and incredible, and at some point I kept sighing and yawning. I can't believe that people really liked this movie. The role of Nicolas Cage was not very convincing. The whole movie was like a grand tour of Americaâ€™s most wanted buildings. The continuous flow of hints and combinations was not very convincing either. I stopped paying attention about 30 minutes. What should have been a happy night was a complete disappointment. What a burden ... I think I just watched too many films to enjoy National Treasure.
