I'm a big fan of Steven Seagal. Hell, I probably weighed as much as he did, although I have no authority on the street to wear curly tails. Having declared my prejudice and attachment to the beloved obese American hero of the scene and screen, I must announce with a heavy heart that this is his worst film ever. I'm not sure that he could have made the film any worse than that. <br /> <br /> In his defense, the main problems with this film seem to arise in post-production. It is terribly obvious that this film should have had a different storyline. This leads to woeful voiceover, in which the voice of Steve almost does not coincide with the voice of the duplicated voice. Editing is useless, and in general it all starts badly, it gets worse, and by the end you will want to review the Da Vinci code. Yes, this is so bad. <br /> <br /> After that, I donâ€™t know what to expect from Steve. My friends still laugh at me for listening to his CDs. Is it time to start checking out some Van Damme recordings right on the DVD? If you feel like watching this movie, tear out your eyeballs and flush them down the toilet. A life of darkness is better than 89 minutes of it.
