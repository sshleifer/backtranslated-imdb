What was Stephen Sigal thinking? I mean, first, I love Seagal. I love all his films until the mid-2000s. His early work - one of the best in the genre. This, however, does not correspond to its excellent name. It is expected that the Attack Force (with the main character Marshall Lawson {Seagal}) will be a meaningless fighter with Seagal in the typical form of a blow to the ass. Nevertheless, we get a riddle of crime, bordering on a political thriller with almost no action. Seagal is always in the shadow because of its weight. I could not follow this story. There are people who turn into supermen when they take drugs. What happened in this movie. Seagal duplication is a shame, a ruin and a shame. Why duplicate a man? The story is terrible. It got 2/10 from me because of the scene where Seagal is asking for reinforcements, despite the fact that he is in the army, and the funny battle scene, where Seagal is waving his arms like a girl standing in front of the camera! “Revenge is a two-way street,” says Seagal in this film ... well, forget the revenge, Stephen, you need redemption!
