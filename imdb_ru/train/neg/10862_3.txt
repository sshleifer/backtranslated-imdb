I watched 8 or 9 films of the Duke, and none of them had any influence on me. <br /> <br /> I watched a few documentaries about him. He is obviously an intelligent man, with great knowledge of films and a passion for making them, but does that make him a good director. Definitely not! Full anti-talent. He can make a good documentary because of the previously mentioned traits, but a movie with actors ?? never! <br /> <br /> He can neither write nor write. His scripts are full of poorly thought out situations, and many situations / dialogues in his films are made so childishly and ill that they cannot be hidden in any sense by the word “art”. Never. Not to mention the inept direction, so amateur. To say that he wants to direct and write nonsense is a lie. <br /> <br /> Like the script when Sheic is arrested and Hornie is hiding in the back of the store. WHO IS HE CHILDREN? <br /> <br /> He is a deceiver; he knows what fake intellectuals and critics want. He knows what elements he needs to insert into the script to get your attention and praise. Never mind the rest of the script and the casual direction. <br /> <br /> Just look at Julio Medem. If Herzog can shoot a film like Medem, then I could double-check his old films and try to find talent in them.
