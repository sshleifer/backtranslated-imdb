I liked the previous Ittenbach film, which I saw, "The Burning Moon". But although this film was rather gloomy and unpleasant, Premutos seems to be mostly playing it for a laugh. Although it’s amazing how Ittenbach made this film without money in his spare time (and the DVD documentary is worth looking at), I constantly fought not to go to the next scene. Of course, there is blood, and if this is all you want, go ahead and enjoy. But be careful: there are too many lame comedies and tedious stories. Many people compare it with the films of Peter Jackson, especially “Brandid”. But, looking at what Jackson did with a similar budget in “Bad Taste,” it became clear that Ittenbach lacked one thing that Jackson has - talent. 3/10 (for pretty good and abundant effects of blood, and in order to get the most out of limited resources - but not worth the money I paid for it)
