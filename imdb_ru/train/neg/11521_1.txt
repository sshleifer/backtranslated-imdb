This film is truly one of the worst pieces of garbage in history. It's amazing that you can do something so terrible. But, if you can withstand a stunning plot, character development and direction, you can enjoy the soundtrack, which is so terrible that it is ridiculous. The film begins terribly and quickly becomes imperceptible. Someone should give anyone associated with this film a kind of consolation, because his career was probably ruined by participation in this film. If you end up watching this movie or have already seen it (I feel your pain), then these words came too late. For everyone else, stay away at all costs or realize that the film is so bad that it will waste 2 hours of your life. Then at least you can clear or something while browsing.
