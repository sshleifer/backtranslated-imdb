My comment relates to the Russian version of the Space Race called “The Battle for Space” (“The Battle for Space”), shown on Russia's First Channel on April 10-13, 2006. A bad translation could spoil some of the details, but I doubt it is. The number of factual errors is such that it is impossible to list them, especially in the first episode (the development of the first rockets). Even half of the film in the United States contains many errors and omissions. Audiences do not report any V-2 / A-4 launches from the United States. Three different Jupiter C rockets are launched with the same UE serial number on board. Apollo 1 should be launched to the moon, etc. In the Russian half, everyone is ridiculous. Korolev is afraid of the NKVD, Glushko is a saboteur and a traitor, Mishin is an alcoholic, and so on. Men as functions; no motivation, no life at all. Uniforms and decorations are terrible. Gagarin sings a frivolous song awaiting launch (I think it was added specifically for the Russian version).
