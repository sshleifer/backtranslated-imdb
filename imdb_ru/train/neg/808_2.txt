Extremely disappointing film based on the novel by James Michener. <br /> <br /> Even worse was the performance of Marlon Brando. His southern attraction was ridiculous. I found myself laughing when he spoke, as if he sounded like an elderly southern lady returning home for an overnight stay. Brando, so gorgeous in previous films, has become a mockery here. Tyrone Power in the film “Witness to the Prosecution” was to be nominated as the best actor, not Brando. <br /> <br /> The film on racism talks about the US government’s attempt to avoid marriages between US soldiers. and Japanese women. <br /> <br /> Brando had stone faces throughout the film. His transition from anti-pro to this relationship happens when he finds love with an Asian woman. His emotions and conversations prevented him from understanding how he could support such new views. <br /> <br /> Only the Lord knows why the Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki received support from the Oscars for their performances. Nothing in both speeches was so impressive. The appearance of the Umeks on the screen was short and almost nothing was shown on her part. The best performance in this film was made by Miiko Taka, who showed love to Brando well. She showed great emotions as an anti-American who found love with the character of Brando. Her face was sealed by the misfortune she felt because she lost her father and brother in the 11th World War. She realized that her dance was not her way out of this existence in which she lived. <br /> <br /> Martha Scott left at first the Jewish mother Yohobel in the Ten Commandments of the fanatical mother of love Brando. Her performance along with Ricardo Montalban's performance was wasted. Patricia Owens, as Brando's first love, showed depth and conviction in her work.
