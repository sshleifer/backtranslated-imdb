I think I’ve seen all of Grisham’s films now, and in general they are all very bad, with the exception of Rainmaker, but this one is so bad that it’s unbelievable <br /> <br /> WARNING SPOYLER <br /> <br /> This one of those films where the character does stupid irrational things that no one would ever do. For God's sake, he is a lawyer. Why, when his children go missing, he doesn't call the police. Oh, yes, this is because all the policemen hate lawyers, so they simply ignore him and allow him to be attacked. <br /> <br /> When he is arrested for murder, he is simply released, he is locked up in a cell. pending a bail hearing. <br /> <br /> Why should you drag your children halfway across the country when you can easily protect them at home. <br /> <br /> Police are not trying to find an escaped mental patient; they don’t bother to interview his daughter. <br /> <br /> As for the ridiculous ending ??. <br /> <br /> In general, it is stupid, very unreal and a waste of time. <br /> <br /> 0/10 ?? One of the worst movies ever made.
