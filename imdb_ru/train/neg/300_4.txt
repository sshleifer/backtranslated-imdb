Robert Taylor definitely showed himself to be an excellent dramatic actor in his role as a buffalo hunter in this western region of 1956. It was one of the few times when Taylor played a heavy role in the film. However, this picture was far from what was soon after that Taylor escaped to television with the successful TV series "Detectives". <br /> <br /> Stuart Granger hid his British accent and turned into a formidable performance as Taylorâ€™s partner. <br /> <br /> Taylor is a fan here, and his hatred for the Indians really manifests. <br /> <br /> Another very good performance was at the age of an old actor Lloyd Nolan, an old-time drinker who also participated in the hunt for bison. In his early scenes, Nolan really shot Walter Houston as an Oscar in The Treasure of Sierre Madre in 1948. Pay attention to the appearance in the film Russ Tamblin. Next year, Tamblyn and Nolan will join the phenomenal Peyton Place. <br /> <br /> The scene in the film is tough at best. By the end of the film, these were elements of nature in which Taylor participated. How about the spelling elements here?
