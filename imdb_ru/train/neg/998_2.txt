This is pretty bad when the general synopsis of a movie has more information than the movie itself. In the "paragraph paragraph" length in paragraph, written on the page of the film, there are details that I could not find when watching the movie itself. I found myself constantly supporting it to see what details I just missed, what can tell me what was going on (beep). Alas, to no avail - in this film, monstrous pieces of history are missed, if you could call it a story. As if they were trying to deceive us, thinking that there was some kind of film here that was shooting enough to make it resemble history and leave the rest to our imagination. Newsflash for creators: I paid to see how you make a movie. I can stay at home and imagine plots and storylines for free. And Rosario Dawson? This is the one to whom I have never paid enough attention to be able to put a name on my face, and I understand why. She had one of the most artificial performances that I had ever seen for the main character in any film, A or B. Was in? Wrong. She was listed as one of the manufacturers. The next time you do something, do not call yourself a leader if you cannot act. If you really can, then create a worthy character you will become. In addition, someone here mentioned the problem of white / Hispanic - yes, I hate to say it, but this film does occur as an act of revenge against white college-age men who wear baseball hats. This is what happens when there is nothing in the film that could attract the viewer to Latin American characters. Adrian's character seems like a defiant jerk who is no better than the antagonist of history. As for the nature of the Maya, she did not seem to be a real person. In any case, I am ashamed of Hollywood that this film was even made.
