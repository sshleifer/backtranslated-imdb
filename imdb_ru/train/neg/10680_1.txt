SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst films ever. In this film there is no redemptive quality. The first 10 minutes are pretty tricky - they actually lead you to the idea that this film will be shocking and make you stand on the edge of your place. Instead, you will spend 83 minutes hitting yourself with your fist, watching the stolen and poorly made scenes pass without any organization. The lake was ridiculous, looked like an aquarium, and there was one and the same plant in different parts of the bottom of the lake. The characters show their advanced teleportation abilities, such as Alex Thomas, who falls into the lake (drunk) and then finds himself in his boat in an impossible position. Angie Harmon delivered the pitiful role of Kate, exacerbated by a dialogue about the rupture of the space-time continuum, which seems to have been written at the last minute by a fifth-grader. An example of this might be when she said: "Flashlight!" in such a stupid way that it shows the threshold of how much a human body can squeeze before it breaks in half. Finally, the editing of this film was the strangest and most terrible that I have ever seen. As if the operators were a bunch of chimps, which scientists gave video cameras. An example of this would be the case when we unexpectedly get a close-up of the headlights in Alex’s car. I bet there was not enough time to edit this movie. The ending was absolutely pitiful. The authors obviously tried to create some kind of mysterious storyline that made the viewer say, “Oh yes!” Instead, we just had to look at some dull picture of a spider that somehow fits into the storyline. Unfortunately, there is not a single prospect among millions that could save this film from an ugly piece of shit. <br /> <br /> I give it .5 out of 10, that is, .5 from the fact that this film was taped instead of becoming a picture book.
