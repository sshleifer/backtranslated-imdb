The film "Gung Ho!": "The story of raiders on the island of Makin-Karlson" was filmed in 1943 with the aim of raising the morality of the American people during the Second World War. Best of all, this shows that cinema can be the basis of propaganda. The value of this film is only a collection, not an art one. In a propaganda film, itâ€™s useless to judge a director and actors. Watch this movie if you are interested in finding out how propaganda works in the films, or if you really like Robert Mitchum, who plays a small role in the film. If you want to watch a film about the Second World War, they are much better and more objective. I rated it 4/10.
