This film makes Canadians and Britons stupid idiots. Men become drunk / drunk, and then scream / beat each other in almost every scene. Women are unnecessary this story ?? I do not understand why they are there ?? they lead each scene, causing noise or, even worse, wallowing around like hypnotized cattle. Apparently, Canadian women are either hostile vulgar vagrants or hulking hippie chicks. This is a standard exhausted girl, her loser and his wicked mother, which we have seen in countless films before. <br /> <br /> Each character here is an insidious, infantile stereotype. Not to mention the fact that they all looked as if they needed a shower! And the idea of ​​any scene implying sex with George Wendt ?? shudder ?? enough for someone to gag! I watched the movie because samuel west was in it ?? but I can't understand why he would accept such a role. Maybe he needs money. Ian Tracy - a great actor, the only one who has a vague moment of salvation, but his talent is lost here. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the plot ?? three assholes trying to get their dope back ??? yawn - or Carl ?? who is dead, but who is actually a character, very much alive in the minds of those left behind (almost like Rebecca in Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece ??, although I am ashamed to even think to compare these two films), why bother? Karl is so annoyed that you find the circumstances of his death pleasant. <br /> <br /> By the end of this pitiful film, I thought that it would be better for all of them to go down with him on this boat!
