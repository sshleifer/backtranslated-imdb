At first glance, it seems that it will be a ridiculous click, and there are moments in it when it turns in that direction. Nevertheless, the main idea of ​​the plot is much stronger than one might expect, and represents a respectable effort to portray racial problems in the army of the Second World War era. Recognizable cast - hit and miss, with Glynn Thurman, Richard Pryor and underused Billy Dee Williams, showing the best results. Stephen Boyd, however, stops almost twisting his thick mustache in the star's excessively hot-tempered turn. <br /> <br /> Obviously, a low budget leads to inconsistency in production figures. Places are excellent, effects and actions are weak. Imagine if Salvation of Private Ryan consisted of killing half of a platoon just like Kaparzo Vin Diesel did (except for the fact that we see a shot because its effects do not work), then Hanks, Damon and Burns drove around in a jeep and shot five Germans for the climax. However, the denouement when heroic soldiers do not gain respect for their achievements, because they are black, and the racist captain Boyd, caused by this, is irresistible, as well as the sequence of the recording of Thurman’s character in the journal of his imaginary feats, to dig restrooms. <br /> <br /> In short, Carter’s Black Brigade / Army did not quite succeed. But this is a respectable failure, not a bad joke. It can be redone as a very good film, and, as it is, this is an interesting job.
