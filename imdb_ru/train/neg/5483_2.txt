I just blew up four dollars, making this movie! Why the Atlantis Alliance will offer such a bad excuse for the film is not clear to me. But even more surprising was the fact that several good reviews by Canadian newspaper critics gave this film. I'm tired of the fact that our media justifies the film simply because it is Canadian and low-budget. It’s as if they expect Canadian films to be lousy, so they give a good overview no matter. <br /> <br /> Now about the movie: the acting was below average (except for the main character, which was actually quite good). The quality of the film was poor, which, I think, could be expected because of the extremely low budget. The script was absolutely terrible. An example is the story of one of the main characters, a drug dealer, who flirts with one of her clients so that she can hire him to repair and steal bicycles for her gang, whose sole purpose is the accidental destruction of an SUV. Supposedly, many of the bikes of her gang members are being destroyed as a result of these actions (I don’t know how she can’t afford to just buy new ones, since she has to be this big link with drug dealers from Vancouver to Toronto). /> <br /> In any case, the meaning of this story (which is not revealed until the middle of the film) is that the drug dealer plans to bomb buildings in the Toronto area to try to make houses more accessible - because there isn’t. someone wants to live in the area. <br /> <br /> - Do I need to say more? <br /> <br /> Shame at the Toronto Film Festival for accepting such a film, a television movie for its support, and Globe and Mail and Georgia Direct newspapers for such biased reviews. <br /> <br /> The film should not be paid special attention just because it is Canadian !!!!
