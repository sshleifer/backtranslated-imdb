I have not seen anything so bad since twenty years ago I came out of the James Bond movie "Moonraker". I managed to come to terms with all this only thanks to Tilde Swinton, but she could not do anything to save this beast. <br /> <br /> Like a cross between Pi, Orlando and Tron, this film failed miserably in all aspects of filmmaking. The characters were cardboard and could not cause sympathy. The plot was absolutely incredible. The game was With the exception of Swinton, an amateur. Computer graphics were worse than at Throne. Timothy Leary was extremely annoying. I could go on, but what is the point. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can do To say about this film, this is what Tilda Swinton was in. I have no idea why the actress of her caliber agreed to sing wriggling in such nonsense, but she most likely regrets it now. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money or your time on this bitch. There is nothing worthwhile here.
