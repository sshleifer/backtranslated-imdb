My nose is slightly bent when I write this. A few weeks ago, I posted a previous commentary on this film, which has not yet appeared, so I assume that it was rejected, although I followed all the usual rules. <br /> <br /> I found this film interesting for the first thirty minutes, especially the performance of Jordy Moll, a veteran actor who appeared in such major productions as The Beat and Alamo. Leonor Watling is also nice. Unfortunately, everything ultimately sinks under the weight of a truly terrible melodramatic script. There is also a lot of unnecessary nudity, which does nothing to promote the narration or even impart an impressionistic nuance to what is otherwise a beautifully made work of art. <br /> <br /> A real day trip to the beach in Valencia will be much less difficult than to face these fictional characters again anywhere and anytime.
