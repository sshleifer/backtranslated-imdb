This film was physically painful to watch, perhaps because (like many people of my age and younger) I grew up with Dr. Seuss and loved his books - funny, smart, capricious and disruptive at the same time. "The Cat in the Hat" sucks all interest and ignites the story, and the performance of Mike Mayer, because the Cat is mostly confusing. Why the accent of the “Borsch Belt”, unfamiliar patter, inappropriate jokes, flawless costume? I had to go back and re-read the books to see the real problem: the books are SIMPLE. This film is "Supernatural" and too long. <br /> <br /> You do not expect that there will be Toy Story or Iron Giant in every children's film, but this film has set a new minimum. How could Mike Myers need money?
