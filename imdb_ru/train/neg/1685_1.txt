All children between the ages of 14 and 16 want to watch this movie (although you are only allowed at 18). They heard that this is a very scary movie and they feel so great when they watch it. I am very sad that children do not see what a good movie is and what a bad movie is. It was one of the worst films I've seen in a few months. Each scene that you see in this movie is a copy of another movie. And the end? This is the open end ... why? Because it is impossible to come up with a decent en for such a stupid story. This film was created to scare you, and if you are a little smart and a little knowledgeable about music, you know exactly when you will be scared. <br /> <br /> When the movie was finished, I turned to my friend and told him (a little loud) that it was a waste of money, some stupid guy looked at me strangely. These days, I could have done an Oscar with my golden fish home video if I used the right marketing.
