Maybe something poeticly correct is that dentists suffer. They will suffer in this dark, really terrible film, but they make the audience feel pain from non-dental diversity. If you ever wanted to see a film full of screaming children, disgruntled children, sick children, many long, meaningful looks, an imperturbable wife and a worried husband - all this is for you. Boring, too long, it stands out as one of those examples that scream: why? Is there a saving grace? Yes there is. There is a short scene from Nabucco, with pretty good singing. Save your money, or, if it's on TV or cable, save your time. You can always read a book or make an omelet.
