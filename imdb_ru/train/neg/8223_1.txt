Definitely, definitely the worst movie I've ever seen, no questions asked! Opponents of this opinion may argue that this title should not be judged by the same criteria as the others, since this is an independent, low-budget film, but let's go already ?? amateur skill and meager innovation are terrifying. <br /> <br /> Agree with everything that was said about this film, for example, with a mind of overwhelmingly weak acting skills (when itâ€™s so bad, you start shooting the scene, damn it), which annoyed me the most, total lack of common sense in the script, assuming that such a thing existed during production. There was an obvious lack of dialogue with respect to the audience, the girls changed personality several times, and they seemed to be completely singing about any rationality or even brains - five relatively suitable girls against one small female psychopath ?? damn it, why not? <br /> <br /> The only thing that can be regarded as winning this title is that the camera does not leave the van at any time, and the viewer sees everything from inside, that, like the rest of the film, is a good idea, performed exponentially terrible. <br /> <br /> ?? oh, by the way, is this movie NOTHING similar to The Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield or any other name taken from a handheld camera ?? it is an effect, not a damn thing! With skillful use, it can be breathtaking, but in this case it is an excuse for inadequate cinematography.
