In my humble opinion, in this version of the great musical BDWY there are only two things - the Secret Daily and the fact that now there is a shot version with the original script. (Well, Vanessa Williams is a pleasure to watch.) But for me, that's all there is. Most of the actors seem to be on the show - Chinna Phillips has no idea who Kim is, and itâ€™s not surprising that people are watching Harry McAfee when George Wendt plays him, who seems to prefer to return to the bar stool in Boston. , Jason Alexander is tolerable, but this wig has to go, and I saw how best to dance in Bugsy Malone. As I already mentioned, it's good to have a version of the stage scenario, but I hope that young people who have never seen the musical do NOT judge them all for that.
