I can not believe that those who praise this film do not think about any other film. I was ready for the fact that it would be terrible, but the script (or lack thereof) makes the film useless. On the other hand, the general level of skill on the part of actors and technicians is competent enough, but when you have a pig's ear, you cannot make a silk handbag. Fans of Ben G should stick to almost every other movie he was in. Dorothy S fans should stick with Galaxina. Peter B. fans must stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughter at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to the amazingly terrible book of Peter B. â€œThe Killing of the Unicorn.
