I can not believe that I spend my time watching this garbage! I did this because Leonard Maltin assigned him an AA rating, and for television films, this is usually a reliable indicator of some kind of quality entertainment. <br /> <br /> Acting skills were fine, but those who wrote it should be permanently denied access to any communication medium. The plot is ridiculous, the motives of the "bad guys" are completely absent, and various family interactions are stupid and superficial. For example, dad preaches that a violent reaction to aggression is BAD, but he turns out to be a “wonderful” person, NOT because of his philosophy of “ignoring idiots”, but because he is pretty good with his fists ... <br /> < br /> The ONLY message I was able to extract from this material was that the nuclear family is good and the alternative living conditions are bad. Oh, and bad people happen to good people.
