{pompous start} At first I didn’t want to believe them, but I think that’s what people are talking about when they say that South Korean cinema has reached its peak and may even come down. After a surprisingly funny and touching monster movie “Gwoemul” (aka “The Host”) of 2006, which really managed to make a sharp satire from the B-movie genre, successive Korean blockbusters became more and more common, even though their budgets (mostly spent on special effects) are becoming more and more fantastic. Do South Korean cinematographers really want to squander the entire audience and the goodwill of investors that their industry created after the release of the Shiri / Svir film in 1999, creating a whole series of high-budget mediocre films, as did mainland China? {rant end} <br /> <br /> The only “reason” I can understand for creating this film is to fool investors into financing the most detailed and smooth digital dragon animation in Korean / East Asian style, which I ever seen. today, for the final scenes. Now, if they presented this dragon at the beginning and gave him more individuality and purpose, as in the 1996 Dragon Heart, the film could have some more redeeming qualities than many digital animation dragons. Remember "Dungeons and Dragons" in 2000? Did not anyone know that the trick is not how many special effects you use, but how GOOD you use them? I hope there are more (and better) Korean legends that they can use because they just killed a lot of international interest in Korean dragon legends by how they shot it. <br /> <br /> In short, I agree with all the negative reviews that have gone before, and you wonder how Koreans felt that their national hymn “Arirang” sounded at the very end. As a feature of the creature, I would give it at least 5 stars out of 10 if the special effects or action sequences were worth it, but I saw a lot of video games with better camera work and scenarios (just fewer dragons).
