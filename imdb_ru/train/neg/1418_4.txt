I do not know why this behavior was tolerable in the movie business! This movie is (short) rough (at least)! This is a group of children 5-7 years old who wear diapers with large hairpins, acting as adults (and even too much!). However, this is interesting because it is a good example of how the “good old days” might not have been so good after all! (Thank God, we now have laws against this kind of material!) <br /> <br /> {This is a short excerpt from the "Shirley Festival in the Temple"}
