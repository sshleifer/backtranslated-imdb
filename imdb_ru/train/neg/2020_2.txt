It looks like two films: one dull, pretentious long saga about an actor who is busy with the roles he plays; another brilliant social comment about the middle-aged divorce, which is chosen by the waitress. Shelly Winters is wonderful as a waitress with another business on the side. She hints at heavy allusions to the need for communication, a certificate for a massage, and a desire to get into a simulation game. I really like her dark apartment with a kitchenette behind the curtain and her awful seductive belly button outfit with downy sleeves. <br /> <br /> Actors get an Oscar for Shakespeare? We know that they were Oscars for posing as disabled, wearing many artificial limbs or pretending to be crazy. Shakespearean scenes (which are included and included) are embarrassing and outdated. Just like in the "crazy" scenes where Tony looks distracted while listening to his voice-over. <br /> <br /> By the way, Anthony John is not aristocratic. On the early stage, he makes it clear that he used to be a chorus boy. When he quotes his father's advice, he slides off with a cockney accent.
