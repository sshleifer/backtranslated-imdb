Well, I admit that I watched this film on Mystery Science Theater 3000 (I'm a big fan of it), but I'm not one of those people who automatically assign a 1/10 rating to MST3K. Although I hate many of the films that they play, and some of them are some of the worst films I've ever seen, I actually was able to enjoy some of the MST3K movies. At the same time, this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. (Not surprisingly, the MST3K writers themselves actually noted that this film was one of the worst. Don't believe me? Check out their website.) <br /> <br /> For me, this film is a good example of what NOT to do in film production. The dialogue is very bad, the acting is worse, the cinematography is pathetic, the direction (although perhaps the best thing in this film) is bad. <br /> <br /> The pace in this film is the worst part. Several times in this film, the viewer had to wait literally minutes for something to happen. Although the minutes may not sound very long, it may be in the movies, especially in this. I am sure that this was supposed to create a mood, but I was very bored. It was really ten minutes. <br /> <br /> If “suspension of disbelief” means “almost fall asleep during the film,” then that is enough. But “Screaming Skull” is just awful, I would never be interested in what is actually happening in the film, and therefore “the suspension of disbelief” really did not exist. <br /> <br /> One of the worst and possibly the most boring movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 1/10
