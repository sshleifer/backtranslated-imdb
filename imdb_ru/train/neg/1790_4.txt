At first it was a “cute” film, then it turned out too juicy and contained mediocre songs, at best. <br /> <br /> Too many conversations with King James, who speak English, are not only annoying in the modern world, but also not always easy to interpret. Can you imagine that modern young people are trying to listen to this movie? Forget about it. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby has a few nice lines, and he is cute as “Hank Martin” Rhonda Fleming (“Alisande La Carteloise”) was also in addition to her beautiful appearance and beautiful long red hair. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie with a pleasant ending, and I can't knock it out. Maybe it's worth renting for the sake of the story, or if you're a big Crosby fan, but overall, it's not that much.
