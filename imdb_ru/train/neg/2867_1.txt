I was lying on my bed with a very bad cold, flu, or something else. I suppose maybe I would kill some time watching the horror movies my mother bought for me some time ago. I would never choose this movie! After I looked at it, I felt even more sick, and I wanted to vomit. Afterword (when I felt better, of course), I did some research on Dennis L. Raider and noticed that Dennis in the film was not like the real one. I hope that no one ever watches this film, but if they donâ€™t eat at all, or you feel the same as when I first watched it. I think you'd better see Santa Claus 3. At least this film had the best reviews on this site.
