Like Freddie's Revenge, this sequel takes a rather strange idea and does not go all out to squeeze the story out of her. In fact, Alice from 4 is pregnant, and Freddie is stalking her child, which gives him the opportunity to stalk her friends. It has the least number of deaths from the entire series, and the wise cracks are rather poor, so neither horror fans, nor comedy fans are happy. <br /> <br /> I can not say this. It is rather interesting to watch the characters of Alice and Dan return from four, but you should not watch the movie again. Boring and unpleasant, perhaps, only a competitive direction saves him from the worst in the series.
