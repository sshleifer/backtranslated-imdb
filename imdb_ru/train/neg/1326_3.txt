Senseless chatter about the second coming of Christ in the form of hippies and albinos, looking like Sandra Locke. You have no idea what is happening on the screen when the annoying song “Suzanne” sounds again and again throughout the film, until “The Second Coming of Suzanne” ends, you already know this with difficulty, no matter how hard you try to forget everything. this. <br /> <br /> This creator of the original rebar movie Logan, Jared Martin, shoots the film of the century, but is so rude and disgusting that no one in the banking world wants to finance his project. Planning to go to your own Logan, then notices this couple in a seaside cafe and is fascinated by Suzanna's young woman, Sandra Locke, who reminds him of someone he knew in another life: Jesus Christ. <br /> <br /> With Logan's assistant and all around Gopher Clavius, Richard Dreyfuss, somehow receiving a loan of $ 740,000 from the bank to finance Logan's masterpiece, he begins working on Suzanne, flattering her about her talent as an actress, to interest her in his movie. This leads to the fact that Suzanne not only leaves her fellow artist Simon Paul Sand, but later Simon, being so depressed and feeling lonely, takes the gun in his mouth and knocks him out of his brain. <br /> <br /> The film also has two somewhat unconnected subplots in this one that relate to young autistic girl Dorothy, Kari Avalos, who recovered from her autism Suzanne after all the others, in a psychiatric hospital, she was dedicated, failed. In fact, it is not known what exactly Susanna did in the hospital, but she seemed there to be some orderly or volunteer; should this have shown to the audience that, like Jesus, she could miraculously heal the sick? <br /> <br /> There is also a newspaper columnist and big business tycoon Jackson Sinclair, Gene Barry, who also seems to be experiencing a very difficult mid-life crisis or saw a biblical vision that has forever changed his life. Sinclair was searching for the meaning of life, and also that it’s all about the film, and he wanted to know why there was so much suffering in the world, like this film in which he was shooting, and it looks like he found the answer when he first laid his eyes on Suzanne. It also occurred to Sinclair when his personal chauffeur, David Mark Rasmusser, who was bored with his strange and insane hallucinations, almost knocked him off a cliff, like a kamikaze, on the way along the Pacific Coast. <br /> The film “The Second Coming of Suzanne” continues with a series of unrelated episodes, which may be completed or supplemented by its director and editor, and then proceed to the final scene in a crucifix similar to Christ. the hill when Logan has all the cameras rolling. It turns out that crazy Logan was so carried away with his masterpiece that he tried to repeat the actual crucifixion of Jesus Christ about helpless and connected Susanna about 2000 years ago on helpless and connected. <br /> <br /> It’s hard to sit and it’s almost impossible to trace “The Second Coming of Suzanne” exposes you to the same kind of torture that Suzanne puts to Logan and the filmmakers. The film tries to be tricky, but this is just an excuse to hide its brainless and non-existent storyline and, even worse, the terrible and amateur game of everyone in it.
