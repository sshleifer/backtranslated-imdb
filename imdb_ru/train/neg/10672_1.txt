It contained all the clich√©s of films of this type and no content. The plot did not lead to anything, and at the end of the film I felt lame for watching it. The production was good; however, the script and acting skills were B-movie qualities. The casting was bad because there were good actors mixed with clumsy actors. Good actors could not stand and did not raise others. <br /> <br /> This film does not deserve more words, but I will say more to fulfill the minimum requirement of ten lines. James Wood and Cuba Gooding Jr. play caricatures of themselves in other films. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for meaningless entertainment, I still do not recommend this movie.
