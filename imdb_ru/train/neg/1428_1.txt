Although this film was shot before Dogme became the dominant method of filmmaking, but before the digital triumph won, it hit him. You get the point. This 1991 masterpiece clearly anticipated these events. Korin Nemec is simply outstanding, as not a successful author and storyteller. The pace is slow, but elegant, because the cinematography is so beautiful. Record it the next time it comes out on T.V. because I guarantee you will never see the best nostalgia film made for T.V. Live video has never been so good!
