There are some bad movies there. Most of them are pretty funny. "Crime Mad 1" was one of those films. So bad that it was nice and it mattered to review it. “Criminal Madness 2” should be one of the worst films I've ever made. This says a lot, because I'm not one of those people who can say that something is worse. But believe me, it was just awful, and the show only lasts 1 hour - it's 1 hour more. <br /> <br /> The film has a rather inconsistent plot, but who cares about the story, when all you want to see is a big fat woman running around, killing people because she’s not fed. Well, you do not see this in this film, except for all the episodes of memories that are taken from the first. The new storyline could have been very funny when Ethel was sent to the house halfway and killed everyone there, but nothing happens until the last 20 minutes of the movie, and at that moment you are falling asleep. <br /> <br /> The camera work in this film is just brutal. It literally reminds me of something that I shot with my friends when I was 15 years old. Sound quality is different because you cannot understand the words that most characters utter. To give an example of how bad it is, go to the subway in New York and try to understand what is being said through the loudspeakers, this is how the movie sounds. Not that what they say matters anyway, because the actors are as dry as a dead piece of wood. <br /> <br /> Now I know what to say, which is the worst movie, pretty harshly, but the words can not describe how bad this film is. If you don't believe me, see for yourself. 1/10
