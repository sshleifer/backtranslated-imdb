I thought it was one of the most depressing holiday films I've ever seen - the others were “The Wife of Christmas” and “Jack Frost.” All three movies about death. If you like to be completely depressed, be sure to watch this movie or any other. In this film, acting is good, and some of the scenery (except when people die) is beautiful. But I’m worried that a person with clinical depression may accidentally watch a movie and play itself in it! Despite the fact that "happily and happily" ends, most of this film is one terrible catastrophe, following another. And, for some crazy reason, I DON'T WANT TO HOLD when watching a Christmas movie (I know it sounds crazy, guys - after all, I don’t despair and don't feel miserable because of the holidays)?). <br /> <br /> For a more impressive viewing experience try the forgotten HOUSE WITHOUT the Christmas TREE, instead George W. Scott's Christmas Carol or Christmas HISTORY - if, of course, you don’t like being unhappy.
