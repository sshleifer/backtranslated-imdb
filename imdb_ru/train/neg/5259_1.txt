After I watched this movie, I was so upset that I wasted 2 hours of my life. These are 2 hours which I will never return. Ugh. When you start it, you might think, “Wow, this is really good!” But be sure that first impressions mean nothing. I was so excited about this movie to the dumbest end I've ever seen. This movie is just pathetic. The acting game is soft, the storyline is not at all original, and there is nothing particularly unique about this, except that it is the LARGEST FILM !!! DO NOT LOOK THIS MOVIE !!! A WARNING!! LARGE CINEMA, EVER YOU WILL BE EXTRACTED IF YOU WASTE 2 HOURS OF YOUR LIFE !!! 1/10
