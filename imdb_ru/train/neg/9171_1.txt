What can I say? I ignored reviews and went to see it myself. Hell, the reviews were so correct. What a waste of money, given her budget. <br /> <br /> OK, after that I went to see Kill Bill. <br /> <br /> To see a really scary movie, it would be “Crossroads”! <br /> The result - I like "Girl in Gold Boots" more than this crap.
