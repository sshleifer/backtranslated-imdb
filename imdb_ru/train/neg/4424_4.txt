Oh! Another fun movie. This time it shows the black side. Put your last dollar, he will have an unfortunate end! But why? With the exception of less than half a dozen, ALL hilarious movies should end with death or the addio finale. This is similar to all European films Noir released in the 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s. The presenter ... a man or woman must die or go alone to oblivion. Why, in the name of God, should screenwriters, directors and producers leave the audience depressed? In the end, he must be gay ... not gloomy. Maybe the category should be changed to a dark movie. A large percentage of gay relationships REALLY lasts, and couples REMOVE together at sunset! No matter who writes or writes, he only shows the other side of the gay life and gives the wrong idea of ​​the gay lifestyle. This film only confirms my point of view. If you rent a DVD, take an anti-depressant, because here's another “funny” movie! This is not true!
