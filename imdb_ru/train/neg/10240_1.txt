I love all types of movies, especially horror movies. At the same time, Survival does not correspond to ANY hype surrounding it. <br /> <br /> I can not give him any points for originality. There is nothing wrong with exploring the same topics or redoing what others have done. It only became a cop for indie films to take us on a terrible journey through the woods, a crazy killer, and lately throw in some crazy family. In this regard, I have to compare it with such as a Texas chainsaw, Wrong turn (although the turn in this is obvious) and others. Survival falls short of comparable films. The plot was simply not original anyway. Some films can do with a weak (and overly overestimated) plot with an excellent acting, special effect, or many other factors. Survivial has nothing to count on. If you want, pay attention to the following: the action in the film was never filmed. I do not knock and blame neither the actors nor the director. The dialogue was mediocre at best, and the actors involved in it never showed (let alone did not HAVE) a talent for coping with it. I mention 2 outstanding. The main character in this film certainly looks like this, but I seriously think that he needs to think about training before he is ready to tear down the film. The actor who portrayed Greg also had potential, but we never saw any of this (watch the film to see why you wonâ€™t believe ...). <br /> <br /> Granular film view. Oh yes, this little piece of movie making magic, designed to take us to the glorious days of the "Grindhouse" films. In today's filmmaking, this has become a ploy. This is either working or not. In this case, it just does not work. There are too many other flaws, so it distracts from the film, and does not add to it. At the same time, I think they did a good job on adding this grain. This is a good, high-quality grain. I think with a different scenario, a better direction, and perhaps actors, they should try another Grindhouse attempt. Most likely, they will cope. <br /> <br /> As far as technical aspects are concerned, in my opinion, they have never changed for me. It would be better to take care of the sound (it sounds as if it is fed directly to the camera, but there is nothing wrong with that), and for shooting on DV it was too soft for my taste. <br /> <br /> This is all I have to say about this .....
