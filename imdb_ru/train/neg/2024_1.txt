Attempting to cash in on the success of “Deal or Not Deal” and “1 vs 100” is a weak excuse for entertainment — Show Me The Money, in which 12 sexy “dancers” break down in brilliant red prostitute clothes. The participant is given the beginning of a phrase, such as "Which team lost ..." with three choices, A, B or C, each of which completes the phrase. A participant has three chances to give an answer to one of these three options. The host, William Shatner, at his most disgusting most intelligent one, asks the participant if he wants to “fix the answer”, and when the participant says “yes”, he chooses a “dancer” to whom he shouts “Show me the money!” She opens the scroll, in which there is a sum, and if his answer was correct, he adds this sum to his winnings; if he is wrong, the amount is deducted. (Thus, theoretically, it is possible that the participant of this boring defeat actually turns out to be Shatner's money.) There is also a Killer Card, and if the participant chooses a girl who has this nasty scroll, but he answered correctly, Nothing happened . If he answers incorrectly, the game goes into “Sudden Death” and must answer another question. If he makes a mistake, he leaves with nothing. <br /> <br /> Before you go on advertising, Shatner shouts: “Let's dance”, and Shatner, the participant and 12 dancers, shakes the booty. At the end of the show, Shatner asks the women for the “last dance,” and they still shake him a little. <br /> <br /> I give no more than 6 episodes in this series, and at this moment, I hope it is a pity. Sorry for the game, they will show the door. (It could be worse - they could somehow bribe Cuba Gooding Junior to be the master, although, I bet, he is a better dancer than “Shat”, as he is called now.) <br /> <br / > 7/08: Guess what - I was wrong! This lasted only 5 episodes. There is hope for the world.
