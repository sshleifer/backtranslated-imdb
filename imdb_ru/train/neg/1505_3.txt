A completely ordinary trashy Italian-Western, stupid storyline, full of cliches and lack of logic, some mediocre actors, dirty tune-ups, a lot of perforated fights and mass killings of people. <br /> <br /> This is nothing to do with Django. “At least in my German translation version, this German DVD release is called“ Adios Companeros ”and in it Macho Callaghan fights against Butch Cassidy and Ironhead because their gang killed him (he is the only survivor). Then you have Butch Cassidy and Ironhead fighting each other because they quarreled, and the gang split. And you have Ironhead fighting against everyone, because he is only the biggest and most greedy asshole anyway. Yes, that's all, enough ingenuity in the storyline, hehe. <br /> <br /> The small role of Klaus Kinsky in the role of Rev. Cotton is wonderful (that's why I bought this DVD). In one scene, he tries to separate two men fighting, striking them and shouting: “I said love!” And in the other scene he wins the horseshoes throwing competition and goes crazy for a second - FANTASTICFANTASTICFANTASTIC !!! <br /> <br /> It is also noteworthy that JOE d'AMATO aka Aristide Massaccesi starred in cinematography - I love this master incompetent exploitation - thrash, so this was “ahhh” for me.
