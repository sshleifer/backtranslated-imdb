I saw this movie with some Indian friends for Christmas. A brief review of this movie is a MUST BE AVOIDED. JP Datta wrote, directed, produced and edited this film and did none of these jobs, well. <br /> <br /> The film describes Pakistan’s attempt in 1999 to capture part of the disputed Kashmir region from India. Presumably, based on the facts, you will get a hint from this film about the difficulties that the Indian army was trying to recapture from the Pakistani troops who occupied the hill. But instead of talking about what should have been a convincing and heroic story, all that makes this film makes the Indian military look ridiculous and silly, which I know is not true. <br /> <br /> I watched this film from an almost Absolutely Indian audience, which was very patriotic and clearly wanted to like this film, but at the same time was laughing at scenes that were not supposed to be funny. <br /> <br /> The script was absolutely terrible. This created the impression that Mr. Datta did not know anything about how the army was operating, and used for reference bad war films. The result is a script that is brainless and repetitive. <br /> <br /> The actions of most of the leaders were not stellar, but given the scenario they were given, I find it difficult to criticize them too much. As for the support staff, all I can say is that I hope they were lovers. <br /> <br /> Editing was also pretty bad. It was quite difficult to keep track of what happened during most of the time, and the music suddenly ended when the scene changed. <br /> <br /> Good stuff: the cinematography was pretty good, although it was slightly affected by the fact that the film was not adjusted in color (the color balance often varied greatly in scenes). In addition, some of the songs that were in the film were quite enjoyable — at least for the first half a dozen or so verses. Unfortunately, they lasted much longer than they should have. <br /> <br /> And the worst crime of all? This mess lasts four hours. Here it is enough that a good editor could almost squeeze a good 1.5 - 2-hour film from what was shot. Unfortunately, a good editor did not work on this film.
