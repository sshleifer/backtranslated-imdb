The producers made a big mistake by playing the main role of Mark Lester, who could neither play nor sing. Besides his very bad "game", all Lester's singing had to be duplicated by a girl. I donâ€™t know why he was abandoned, because there would be so many guys who could play this role infinitely better, and also sing themselves. Shani Wallis was too old to play Nancy, who was supposed to be only 16 years old. The current version of the West End is in all respects much better than the film. Ross McCormack is the best sly catcher of all time, and he certainly looks a lot better than Jack Wilde ever was. It was clear that it was politically rewarding this old-fashioned musical with so many Oscars after the tumultuous events of 1968.
