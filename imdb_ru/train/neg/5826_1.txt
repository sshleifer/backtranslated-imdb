Slow and nice pictures followed each other, sometimes annoying music (you know, Björk) sounded in the background for the first 75% of the film. If you do not get enough sleep, this is a good time. <br /> <br /> But in the last 20% of the time, the director decides to bring the idea of ​​rebirth, reincarnation or something else, using S & M images: “spiritual lovers” cut each other's bodies with knives. For me, it was very disturbing and actually changed the overall impression of the combination of abstract art and images of modern Japanese secrets. <br /> <br /> The cameraman and director are wonderful but weird. <br /> <br /> I didn’t like it at all.
