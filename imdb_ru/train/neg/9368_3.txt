Oh, once a vaguely famous actress in a film where she plays a mother with a child. He is shown on BBC 1 in the second half of the night, I wonder if ... yes, this is TVM <br /> <br /> You should transfer it to TVM producers, and not be content to shoot one mediocre film, they usually give us two mediocre films where the two themes are mixed together and NOTHING to hide anything. The first theme is a woman in danger, cross-pollinated by a woman suffering the pain of a divorce theme, which means that we have a scene of a heroine who survived a murder attempt, followed by a scene in which her son Sam asks why she divorced? And, being TVM, she replies that the reason is that “people change” and does not say something like “I'm a right minx” or “Your dad travels through men's public toilets for sex,” as happens in real cases divorce. I feel sorry for Sam, not only his parents divorced, but he is as thick as two short boards. In fact, since he is so stupid, he does not deserve sympathy, because he does not suspect that a man throws things. The toilet is a drug dealer, he does not know that you can die if someone shoots you, and does not know that I LOVE LUCY - it's terribly unfunny. If only our own childhoods were so innocent, well, Orwell said: "Ignorance is power." Sam suddenly became an expert in marine life! Is this character development or a bad script? I know what I have money for. And it is strange that Sam, boy, boy, did not notice that if the story unfolds in 1994, then why do people often wear clothes, drive cars and ride the trains of the 1950s? But as it turns out, during the plot, the mother is a fool. Then there is the final plot twist that made me feel like an idiot to watch it.
