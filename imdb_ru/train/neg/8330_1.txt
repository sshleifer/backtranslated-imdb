I saw "Shiner" on DVD. While I was looking at it, I thought: "This is a very bad porn movie without porn." I also thought: "Whoever writes this, he has real problems." Then I saw the director / screenwriter Carlson explain his process as a special function. Yes, it was really special. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on two unsuccessful alcoholics who beat each other in order to escape. They are marginally attractive. There is front and full nudity. These factors probably explain what the film was generally seen. <br /> <br /> The most grievous element of the film is the beating of gays and the subsequent beating of gays with the same victim, who ineptly tries to revenge his attackers. Two drunken losers. From a technical point of view, not only is it ridiculous and mistreated with the subject, but with a terribly bad acting game. <br /> <br /> Then there is the topic of the boxer stalker. This is really insane, not just absurd. This cowardly boxer is somehow traumatized by the constant attention of a boy with a fleshy mom who works in the parking lot of his gym. Notice, this is in LA. The boxer is so traumatized that he appears in the stalker's house, undresses in front of him and is inspired by this process. <br /> <br /> Well, all I can say is why is a boxer who is in the shower an exhibitionist so traumatized by the attention of a stalker? It just does not make sense. And, I'm afraid, some psychodynamics really make sense if you take the time to read about them. However, bad scripts rarely make sense at all. <br /> <br /> The director / screenwriter seems to have thought that this film represents a significant minority in the gay community. Well, he may be right, I suppose. We may never know, as this minority would be so dysfunctional that it is unlikely they will be able to get together enough to ever go to an obscure gay film festival or DVD store, the only two places where they could find this turkey. Thank God for that.
