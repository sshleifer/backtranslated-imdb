First of all, I would like to note that, although I am not an expert, the way the process is conducted will offend your intellect. Firstly, the prosecution never proved that “lite training” really works. Irresponsible both for the prosecution (because they can get an appeal) and for the defense for not acting on this issue. As another commentator said, the lightened training turned out to be false. Secondly, they used Terry as a translator who has a personal interest and will even testify in a process that is simply stupid. If the court allowed him to testify in this way, they would bring someone neutral, otherwise they would simply ask for an appeal. Thirdly, this child was never asked specific questions about the defendant on the part of the prosecution (birthmarks, details of the event, etc.), and even when he was asked specific protection questions, for example, when he started, he could not answer. If this is not a reasonable doubt, I do not know what it is, and a competent lawyer would get an acquittal. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that it starts well with the pressure of the parent of the child with autism, but the trial makes this film completely incredible.
