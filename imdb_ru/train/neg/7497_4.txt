After watching the trailer for this film and discovering Spike Lee, I was glad to hear about this event. I was not alive at the time, I did not live in New York, so I expected more lessons from history than anything else. What I got was a bit of interesting acting, a lot of sex and about 30 minutes of the film, which actually had something to do with Son Sam. I guess the film is not about Son Sam, but it was a look in the summer of '77. Call me disappointed. <br /> <br />
