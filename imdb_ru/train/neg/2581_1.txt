First of all, to get rid of my personal feelings, let me start by saying that I hate the so-called comedies, in which every single character is written and played as so stupid that you are amazed if they are all the result of inbreeding. <Br /> <br /> Now I’ll say this, I saw the first three American films about cakes, and although they weren’t the most amazing films I’ve ever seen, they were fine (and outright masterpieces compared to three "American"). “Pie Presents” films), I still feel compelled to ask, what the hell did they think when they made this film? <br /> <br /> I also have a few more questions. <br /> <br /> Who thought this was an acceptable use of studio tools and production resources? <br /> <br /> Who approved the final script (and that this person smoked when they approved him)? <br /> <br /> And finally, why did someone think that he deserves to be released to cinemas, where the average cost of admission is from 10 to 15 dollars, depending on where you live, when was he supposed to go straight to the discount basket at Blockbuster or Wal Mart? <br /> <br /> There are so many wrong things in this movie that I can't write a really detailed review, because it will exceed the maximum number of words on this forum, so I’ll just touch on the biggest things that he is not fine. <br /> <br /> The plot is stupid and stupid, and the characters are as interesting as watching the paint dry for eighty minutes, but the most important thing that I can see wrong in this film is acting. <br /> <br /> Although most of the actors and actors do not have talents and do not have names that are likely to be forgotten in a few years, <br /> <br /> the only known name in this film is Eugene Levy who spends almost all the time while he is on the screen, with that clever smirk on his face that tells the viewer: “I know that this is not true. it's funny and I waste my talents, but hey, I get paid for it, so who cares, "he doesn't even try to make any of his jokes funny (he really deserves better than this garbage). <br /> < br /> As I mentioned above, most of the other actors are terrible, although some of them were on some really great TV shows, Tyrone Savage (from the classic Canadian TV series Wind At My Back) plays a character that is so unbearable, incredible and irritable ( there are things he could teach tropical skins illnesses) that you almost want him to die a slow and painful death on the screen, Christopher MacDonald (NCIS, Law & Order) just hangs on the screen and the waste that he has talent while in this film. <br / > <br /> maybe the next movie in this series will be just a soft core of porn with a storyline so that they can get around MPAA and get the R rating of this movie is completely completed with meaningless nudity, vulgarity and senselessly offensive sexual content that he should was to receive a rating of X (rating board, should be drunk or addicted when they watched this movie for its rating). <br /> <br /> Interestingly, twenty-five years ago, when Wes Craven presented MPAA “A Nightmare on Elm Street” to review the rating, they forced him to cut off twenty-five seconds of footage (I believe that was part of the death scene in which there was a silicone casting of the breast) to avoid getting the X rating, and he had no choice but to do it, otherwise the film would not be released, <br /> <br /> but this kind of overly offensive garbage may get an R rating today, because it's all done in the name of comedy, if this the film was a dramatic or horrible film with this type of content, there would be a huge smell over the content, and it would have created a terrible X rating. <br /> <br /> The last thing that really annoys me is the script. This film is written to play it like a dream of a twelve-year-old child with an extremely hyperactive sexual imagination, quite young and unusually almost every exposing situation that should move the body in this film so wired that any intelligent viewer can see how he goes a mile away, and so-called characters are just stereotypes of stereotypes of stereotypes, not to mention often repulsive sexual references and constant unnecessary scenes of deviant sex ceiling elements of behavior gives the impression that this film was written by some incompetent freshman in a class on writing scripts for film school with low rents. <br /> <br /> It's about time to kill this show before it gets even dumber. rude and insulting, this pie is filled with apples of the road.
