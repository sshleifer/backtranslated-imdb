Carrie Fisher has repeatedly stated that she starred in this film during the period of her life, when she had a severe cocaine problem, and she doesn’t remember much about it. This would explain why she made this film, but it does not explain why someone else in the cast or film crew made it; I can't believe that ALL had a problem with coke. It has to be one of the worst films ever made, and it says something. The blame cannot be put on the feet of “director” Tim Kinkade or “writer” Buddy Giovinazzo, since it is obvious that this picture was not written or directed by anyone. Obviously, this simply spontaneously came together, since there is little evidence of coherence, consistency, design, plot, meaning, intelligence, or anything else. What is truly amazing is that some professionals were involved in this game. Film colleague Robert Joy did a good job in other films, and composer Jimmy Haskell and cinematographer Arthur Marks are both veterans of the industry, Marx was also a director, and a good one. Why they got into this steaming pile of by-products is unclear. Tim Kincaid, the alleged “director,” has shot quite a few low-profile science fiction films and horror films, and after reviewing most of them, I can say that none of them is good enough. This, however, is by far the worst thing he has ever done, and this is a great achievement on his part. Everything, absolutely EVERYTHING, about this 12th-level film - at best. Cinematography is terrible, the game is ridiculous, “special effects” make “Plan 9 from space” look like “Spider-Man”, the story is banal, derivative and stupid. Do not waste your time, even looking at the cover of the video box, not to mention the rental. Full, full, annoying, full loser.
