First of all, I would like to tell you that I love comics, anime, animation, and the like. It's true that everyone has their own preferences, but you can trust me in this film. I will be objective. Let's start with the story - everything is fine. Follow the storyline of the comic, as far as I know them. But the animation ... Well, it's not really terrible, but definitely cheap and mediocre. It would be much better if they did not try to imitate the style of anime and adhered to the original drawings in the style of comics. If we pretend that we don’t see rare inaccurate effects such as fire and lightning, you can say that the film was made about 10 years ago and even more. It looks a bit like the original 1985 Vampire Hunter D. Take a look, for example, at Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 - 4 years ago they shot a film that looks much better! In addition, the voice talents do nothing remarkable, the music is nothing special. So in general - it lacks the atmosphere. I watched it, but I can not say that I really liked it. It just does not capture you. There is a lot of blood and violence, but this does not impress me at all. Maybe it will be shocking for someone who has never watched more mature oriented animations and sees lively blood for the first time (is there anyone around?), But I don’t think this is the audience of this film. So they could add a little nudity and spice to this. The chicks around Lucifer were pretty tasty, and damn it, we have Lady Death herself! There are several sexual views, but this is not enough. I think that instead of Bill Brown's music, it will look better on the hard rock / heavy metal soundtrack. In general, the film is not so bad, but if you want something better, take the original Heavy Metal, Heavy Metal FAKK 2000, Ralph Bakshi's Fire and Ice or Wizards, maybe. And of course - Vampire Hunter D: bloodlust
