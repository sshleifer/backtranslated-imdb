I am surprised that anyone involved in the production of this series truly recognizes responsibility. The script is so unfunny that it must have been written by someone who did not pass the entrance exam for the Canadian Comedy Writers' Union (and that says something!). If you want, get your binoculars, but in sight there is nothing like a joke. Ronnie Corbett must have been completely devastated to humiliate himself with this garbage. The rest of the actors are so lacking in acting or comedic abilities that I am amazed that it lasted after the first episode - a correction, after auditions. All I can say to those who surprise them is that they are very easy to entertain. And it is obvious that the production costs should have been only 100 per episode. And just in case, if someone thinks that I am commenting as a foreigner, unfamiliar with English humor, I must add that I am really English.
