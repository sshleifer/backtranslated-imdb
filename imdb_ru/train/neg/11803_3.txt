When someone reworks a classic film, rework is always disadvantageous compared to the original. In addition, there is a possibility that the remake is so radically different that it is just too unfamiliar to the audience. <br /> <br /> The 1973 TV version of “Double Refund” has almost identical scenes and dialogues as the 1944 original. The main difference is that the remake simply has no energy. Fred McMurray was great as the lecherous, wicked insurance agent Walter Neff in the original; Richard Krenna seems tired from fatigue. Edward J. Robinson brought enormous manic energy to the role of boss MacMurray Burton Keys; Lee J. Cobb, a wonderful actor, seems almost bored in the process. Samantha Eggar is not right, as insidious, beating in the back Phyllis Dietrichson; While Barbara Stanwyk was simply superb in this evil role, Eggar is overly polite and brought up and seems simply out of place. <br /> <br /> Robert Webber, as old Richard Gaines as the boss of Robinson Norton, and John Fidler. Having taken on the role of Porter Hall as the crucial witness, bring a little bit of life into the film. In particular, Webber well recreates the role of Norton in the context of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> However, after the film began, it all just lay there, without any life or electricity. This is one movie that never needed to be redone.
