This film was bad beyond belief. I saw this at the 2004 San Francisco Film Festival. Before it began, the owner of the theater got up and told us how half of the spectators left the theater last night, what became his “world premiere”. I don't think anyone in the theater understood how bad the film would be at that time. We all understood the end. <br /> <br /> This is not a documentary, although it was sold as one. The Dark Angel was a bad biography and improper reverence for Betty Page, in which half of the film is actually just a remake of Betty Page's old films. The film lasts only 90 minutes, and the content of the 90 minutes is at least below the average. The scene began, and someone said: "Wow, Betty, you're so cool, why don't we make another film." this would be followed by a 5-minute remake of Betty Page, which was almost as ridiculous as (and even more boring) than the usual part of the film. at the end of the film, people laughed every time a new remake of the movie Betty Page appeared. it was so funny. I heard a lot of laughter in this theater, but people did not laugh at the creator of the film, they laughed at the film, its poor content and structure. This was easy to say, because the parts that caused the most laughter were the ones that were supposed to be serious or exposing. <br /> <br /> I know that films are expensive. I have seen a lot of cheap independent films, but somehow the cinematography and the quality of this film set it apart from everything I've ever seen. It looks like a movie made for 12 dollars. Cuts, grit and lack of sensual plot made it unforgettable. This film makes "Dude, where is my car?" similar to citizen kane. <br /> <br /> My friends and I left the theater, feeling that we had just paid $ 8 for torture. The only redemptive part of this experience was that we laughed at the fact that someone actually made this film and thought it was good. Apparently, last night, the night of the “world premiere,” the director / writer / producer was in the audience and witnessed how people laugh and leave his film. Betty Page films were destroyed. They, too, must destroy this film.
