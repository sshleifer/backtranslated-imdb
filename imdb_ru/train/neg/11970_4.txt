... for the lieutenant to choose this one. First, the film was not terrible, it was just Hollywood. In the worst case, I need a script “it will happen or we don’t have a movie”: if Willis’s mission was to save the doctor, but she was adamant that her “people” would get out of the missionary, would put her on this first helicopter and would send those refugees to the border without her. He would not compromise his refugee package. This is not how it works. But, as I said, this is Hollywood, we have to have drama. That's why we make films, because the reality is not so complicated. However, I thought that Willis and a good doctor had workable chemistry. However, the film also has several well-made battle scenes. It's not a waste of time, "Tears of the Sun" is worth the rental DVD. Check it out on a rainy day and you will be satisfied.
