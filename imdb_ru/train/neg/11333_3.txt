This movie is just crap. Although directors claim to be part of this culture, this is still a very, very bad directorial debut. The topic itself is very interesting, and I accept a bad game because they are all lovers and have never played before, but the worst thing about this film is the dialogues and very inexperienced and naive direction. There is absolutely no time in this film. I felt that the directors were so excited to make this film (this is their first feature) that they never really asked themselves what story they wanted to tell. I met with Ben (one of the directors) several times, and he is a good and thoughtful guy, but that does not make him a director. I think that American History X is full of clichés, but somehow I manage to convey the story. "Oh! Warning ”is full of clichés, nothing new or provocative says, and (which is sad in this film), it is far from any Oi! -Reality. <br /> <br /> If you want to see strange but wonderful German films, watch the films of Michael Haneke, Christoph Schlingensif, Oscar Relar, Hans Weingartner or Oliver Hirschbiegel Mein Letzter Movie Das Experiment Das Weisse Rauschen Muxmäuschenstill. <br /> <br /> *** out of ten, because of the topic and photos
