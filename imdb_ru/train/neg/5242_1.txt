Well, I hated, flew, I despised a 40-year-old virgin, and this little gem is a useless piece of trash movie. do yourself a favor and skip it. I admit, I don’t like the actors in this film, and after my 18-year-old son showed me the cover of the DVD, I said: “I don’t like this film,” but at his insistence, I decided to try, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> About two minutes after the start of the movie, I turned it off, I was so offended. it's just disgusting any decent person will be offended by the dirt in this film. call me old-fashioned, but stick your juice-covered hand in your pussy, in your friend's face, so that he knows that you "got a little", in my opinion, beyond the bounds of decency. Yes, this is how this putrid little film begins, and I can only imagine that this is getting much worse. another real winner for Mr Rudd. I bet he's proud as a blow. Imagine if you could only get useless roles, like him, would you stay in a movie? despite the payment, I would not. <br /> <br /> I should have known better; next time i will.
