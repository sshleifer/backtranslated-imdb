Revenge of the Sith begins with a long sequence of actions that is impressive, but does not cause terrible unrest, and then becomes really boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes, with the same terrible dialogues and boring machinations that haunt the rest of the series of prequels. The only thing that improves hearing is the slow — and I mean the slow — build-up of what we know will be the birth of Darth Vader. And when it finally comes, everything will be fine. Not good. Not even good. But pretty good. This film is greatly praised because it does not suck into heaven, as in previous sequels. Instead, it’s just sluggish, boring and routine. But you have to say, wow, these CGI environments are really impressive from time to time. Bu bright fights? They are all a vague mess. I think the dark side captured Lucas when he started these prequels, and no one noticed. It will bring a lot of money, but, thank God, it's over, this once revered franchise has been defeated. I saw the show at 12:01, and after that I heard a group of very young children say, “Wow, that was awesome! But everyone over eight years old grumbled the same thing: I fell asleep in the middle. It was pretty boring. I just thought it would be better to see the birth of Darth Vader. So we all said.
