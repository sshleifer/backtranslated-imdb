This film was made by a group of white guys who went to school together. Well, there’s nothing wrong with that, except that it looks like it was done by a group of white guys who went to school together. 90 percent of the composition - white men of about the same age. It's almost like watching the guys at the boys camp who turned on the camera themselves. There is no plot in the film. It simply repeats the same effect of the bloody bath after the bloody bath. There are several funny scenes and comedic episodes. But they do not redeem flat monotony. <br /> <br /> Graphic animated scenes are used to illuminate what was clearly beyond their budget or resources, and not very well. Everything that can’t be done with white guys running along the blood-drenched beach is done with cheap animation. <br /> <br /> I went to see this movie after watching a trailer that makes it look like Tarrentino. a piece. Well, the trailer scenes are as good as they ever get. Everything else just repeats the worldly, senseless comedy. It works from time to time, but it gets boring after the same things come to you again and again. It’s more like a series of Satuday Night Live scenes than a movie. This is a comedy like “you hit on the head”. I see where the plot idea intrigues. But in this film, post-apocalyptic America is very similar to Medevil of England. Whitleree actually says that the ideas of history came from that era. He plans to do part 2. I think he thinks he is Tarrentino or, perhaps, does a parody. <br /> <br /> At the opening in Los Angeles, Wheatley mentioned that he would return almost the same composition in the second part. He was asked if he could consider a more diverse cast in the following, to which he replied, yes, of course.
