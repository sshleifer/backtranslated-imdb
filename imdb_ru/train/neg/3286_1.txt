I do not understand why the creation of remakes has become a trend. Every remake I've ever seen is terrible, and this is no exception. If any of you have seen Ben Jones quote that this is a “dirty” piece of garbage, he is absolutely right. Why they took a great TV show that I loved, never missed an episode, and had their own seasons 1-4 on a DVD, and ruined it, I will never know. The television show was a family show, and, although Daisy has a body, it did show off or even be seen on the show, with the exception of outfits. The family show was turned into a dirty piece of garbage, and I would not recommend it to anyone to go see it. I also didn’t like that John Schneider and Tom Vopat were great actors (along with the rest of the original line-up), and they are also very cute. New Bo and Luke are not even so cute. It was one of the boxes for the show. Casting is terrible. They could at least get a brunette for Daisy. I do not think that Burt Reynolds is also a qualified boss, Hogg. Any other role he has ever played is completely opposite to that role. The only role they played halfway is Willy Nelson as Uncle Jessie, but it’s still incomparable. Denver Pyle is an actor in and of itself, and this made him ideal for this role. I think that the casting is terrible, the story is terrible, and in general has spoiled a wonderful show and turned it into a dirty, terrible film. I would not recommend anyone to go see. I just saw it out of curiosity, plus there was a free ticket in season 4 of the DVD. I would never pay to watch this movie, but it was free. Do not pay to see this movie.
