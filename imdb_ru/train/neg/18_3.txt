This is a feature film that was shot in 1969 or 1972 (the National Fund for the Preservation of Films says that 1969, and IMDb in 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the film is definitely very indicative of this general period of time - with some camera and pop art stylisations that relate only to the late 60s - early 70s. <br /> <br /> The film consists of three simple images that are distorted with the help of various strange camera tricks. These distorted images are accompanied by music, and there is absolutely no dialogue or plot. Obviously, it was conceived almost as a form of performance, and, like most performances, at first it is interesting, but quickly becomes tedious. The film, to speak even more frankly, is a boring exercise and will not please anyone except, perhaps, those who made the film, his family and friends, and perhaps a few people who are too smart and “with him” so that we can understand. mortals.
