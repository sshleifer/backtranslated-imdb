This film seems so empty. In each scene of the film, the maximum number of actors on the screen is about 10. Since everything was filmed in front of the blue screen, in fact there are no additions, and the film is just strange. <br /> <br /> ACTION was HORRIBLE! It is so obvious that it was in front of the blue screen, because all the action films you see show that the actor / actress is perplexed when he runs halfway, when they need to run after their lives. /> <br /> Spoilers: In addition, you will find yourself knocking your head while watching a movie. At some point, the Sky Captainâ€™s home base has 100 planes sitting on the runway. They warn in advance that an attack is coming ... So what are they doing? nothing. All airplanes are blown up, and again the ONLY man fighting in response is the Sky Captain ... <br /> <br /> The whole world is under attack, and he is the ONLY man ever resisting. At the very end of the film, you see hundreds of plains taking off ... but what do they do? Nothing ... the movie is over ...
