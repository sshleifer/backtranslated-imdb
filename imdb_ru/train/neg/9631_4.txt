The film attracts the public thanks to Ben Stiller's charisma and the notoriety of J. Aniston. It looks like we have a recipe for a successful title, but thereâ€™s nothing good about this movie. <br /> <br /> Polly plays very well Aniston, without a doubt. Such a character fits her perfectly. <br /> <br /> Bem Stiller is the same unpleasant guy as in the movie Meet the Parents, but in this movie there are few comic scenes compared to the title mentioned above. <br /> <br /> The script is very poor, nothing special. With these two well-paid actors, things can get much better, but what can they do when there is such a bad story and scenario. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
