Well, "Jesus from Montreal" is essentially a smart movie. The actors are really good, and the technical side of the film is fine. But, although I was very interested in this topic and loved to think and discuss religion (I am an atheist), it was difficult for me to make myself watch the movie before the bitter and in my opinion somehow unconsciously funny end. Why is this movie incredibly boring? I dont know. This is just the case and therefore not recommended.
