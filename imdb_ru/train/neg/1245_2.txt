Absolutely the worst movie of Burton, which seems to be getting worse with every movie he makes. The unhappy script, loaded with stamps, is only the first of many undesirable aspects of this film. This is a film in which every time something happens, you will surely hear someone shouting: “He lost the gun!” Or whatever it is for everyone to know. Carter is really terrible, as is Wahlberg, who cannot play straight and be persuasive. Very good effects and photography, but bad music in the image of John Williams from boyfriend Burton Elfman. Heston appears in a meaningless scene to express his most famous flashy phrases from the first film. Very bad results. <br /> <br /> If anyone else saw “Sleepy Hollow” there, they probably noticed, like me, the decline in the quality of Burton films. I heard that this particular project was produced by others, and that Burton was invited as a director, in which case his opinion should be questioned. But I think he missed any possible vision he could have at the beginning of his career; evidence is in the movies. In Sleepy Hollow, he could not decide which film he was shooting: a comedic or a real horror film, and the population of British characters (Chris Lee, etc.) made you also think that it was a film. the kind of movie about monster rally (as scary as ever, as horror fans know). The film can not be successful either in a horror film or in a comedy, because it was so schizophrenic, and not a single style was developed that would smooth them together. Planet of the Apes is very similar, and the result is more like Total Recall or Tango and Cash than fiction. He also fell into the rut of many other "big" directors trying to satisfy all possible audiences. Talk to Burton, if you are there - choose something and do it directly, or use some style to put everything together (as in Mars Attacks or Beetlejuice), or you can also resign because that people like me, who are fans of your films, will stop going.
