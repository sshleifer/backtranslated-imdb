If you go to see this film, you will be vindictive against the cinema, the director, the producer, the actors and the man who told you to go watch it! Shame on you, Sarah Michelle Geller, for pointing out your name and face in this bad excuse of the film. Perhaps it would be worse if the Japanese actors simply spoke Japanese, and did not try to “act” in English. I wanted to brag when the film ended ... a real disappointment after all the hype on TV and in movie trailers promoting this loser. Sarah Michelle really didn’t have to act at all to make this film ... she just practiced her frowning skills. Do not waste your time or money on this film.
