I had no real expectations from this film, and I am pleased. Even if I expected it to be bad, I would be disappointed. <br /> <br /> How to start? First, I think that 15% of the film consisted of videos of stationary stuffed animals in the dark jungle. I understood there stuffed. I think the name "Scarecrow" was enough. <br /> <br /> Secondly, not a single trait is explained in relation to stuffed animals and paranormal phenomena. Too many times I left WTF? <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the film takes itself seriously. I am all for the B-movie with buckets of blood, screaming women and senseless violence, which is the result of a simple psychopath or an ancient curse. But these films often know that they are B-films, and even flaunt them, for example, Dead Snow (funny scandanavian film about zombies) or Evil Dead 2. But this film does not seem to notice its stupidity. <br /> <br /> Finally, there should have been more blood and / or nudity. Yes, I said that. If you're going to make a horror movie, do it with murder. And if you have one hot and one half hot girl, one of them should at least show some side breast. <br /> <br /> So, as stated in the summary, skip the “Scarecrow” and just stick yourself in the eye. You will thank me.
