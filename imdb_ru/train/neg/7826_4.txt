Special effects? Good. <br /> <br /> Script? Terrible. No plot. No depth. It makes no sense. This film introduced Superman as a meaningless hero, a hero without archetypes. In the original film, he represented America in the Cold War. Here he represented only the Hulk. <br /> <br /> Of course the actors were fine. Kevin Spacey was a good choice, among others. <br /> <br /> This still does not solve the problem that there is no depth in this film. I can not understand how someone can extract something significant from this film, when Superman was created every day so that he was a significant hero not only in comics, but also in people's minds. It was a real waste of money, considering how many tracks this film could go. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples: Lex Luthor could have been the villain of global corporatism, political domination, totalitarianism, and so on and so forth. He was just another incarnation of stupid Hackman. <br /> <br /> And Superman? What was he standing for in this movie? Nothing but the next hacking of the “savior” of the figure. <br /> <br /> Wait until it reaches the dollar theater, if you see it at all.
