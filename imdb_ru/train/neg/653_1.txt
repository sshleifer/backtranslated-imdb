If I could give this film a real rating, it probably would have been in the red. Although I respect the fact that someone must continue to make these horrible horror films, seriously, people buying a ticket for this film are a waste of money that you could spend on something much more worthwhile. <br /> Despite the fact that this is a horror movie, there is nothing to worry about if you are not afraid of the idea of ​​seeing how many horror cliches you can put in one movie. If the rating were higher, it would probably be the best film in the long run. <br /> <br /> Whoever made this version of the "Prom", you screwed up. Actors could probably do a decent job if not for dubious scenarios. It was a terrible waste of going to the movies. I’ll rather go and see “One Missed Call” again, at least there was some plot.
