Maybe I'm not the one who watches this movie, because after 45 minutes of pure boredom and stupidity, I switched the channel. The original series lasted only 2 years, what can be said about the career of Adam West and Bert Ward. Put these two "actors" in a silly movie, and the result is two times worse.
