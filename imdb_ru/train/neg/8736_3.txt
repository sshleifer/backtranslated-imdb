The film had a good concept, but the performance just didn't fit that. <br /> <br /> What is this concept? Well, in the story, this “Dirty Harry” meets “M”. The murderer child began to terrorize the city. Leading detectives (Dennis Hopper and Frederick Forest) have never before encountered a serial killer. The mayor and the police chief, in despair, secretly hire the local mafia to speed up the process ... walk around and do what the police cannot do to end this mess as soon as possible. . <br /> <br /> To be honest, this film really does have something good. <br /> <br /> In addition to the concept, I liked the kind of shelter of the killer. Norman Bates has a basement. This guy has a terrible sewer. In some photographs, the light reflects from the water and creates ripples on the walls; often giving these scenes an eerie, fabulous quality. <br /> <br /> The game was good too. Dennis Hopper is one of those actors that gets better with age. <br /> <br /> However, as soon as you overcome this, he will more or less evade. <br /> <br /> The film is going too fast The actual investigation process from both teams feels very hasty as opposed to feeling confused and exciting. This could be corrected in two ways: either make the film longer, or cut out some of the many auxiliary subjects. Any of them would allow the team to devote more time to actual secrecy. <br /> <br /> For example, how bad it is, one of the key moments that helps them focus only on the right suspect is: at some point in his life, the suspect went to the pet store ... That's right ... I am here quite seriously. As if they had moved from point A (first hint) to point Z (suspect) and missed all intermediate steps. <br /> <br /> Then there are symbols. The only ones I really liked were the two pockets you meet about halfway through the movie. Given that they are minor characters, I would call it a bad sign. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is the angle of the crowd. This is what attracts me the most, because that's why I coughed up $ 3 to buy a DVD. I mean, what a hook! Over the past 10-15 years, there has been an absolute excess of serial killers. The crowd angle was a ploy that CAN help her rise above the rest ... but this is not true. <br /> <br /> I thought that the methods of the gangsters would be cruel, but at the same time fun and exciting; something like a movie about a vigil or something like that ... maybe they would even add some elements of a movie about robberies. In the end, we are talking about criminals. Instead, we are given some of the most disgusting protagonists of celluloid lovers. Detectives interrogate witnesses. What does the crowd do? They interrogate and kill them. It does not even look like these witnesses are really even such bad ones. In fact, I found criminals less attractive than the killer they hunt. <br /> <br /> If only the good moments that I mentioned are not enough to interest you, I would say you would miss it. Maybe someday they will use the same idea of ​​the story and do it right. I hope so. I hate to see how such a good concept gets lost.
