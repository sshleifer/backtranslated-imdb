I saw this film at his film festival in New York, and I must say that I found it a complete and terrible bore. Although in some places it was funny, the only real laughter was that there seemed to be a real plot to talk about, and the acting in some places was awful and wooden, especially “The Fair Lady” and the voice of the narrator (who I never heard) there was a lot of things to wish for. I felt that JK Mac was an expiatory feature of this film, a true action and a grain of sand and (outside the cast) the only real acting game. I’m sure that with a different cast and a tougher directing direction, it could be a half decent movie. Let's just hope that it will not be distributed in the general release, or if you really want to get a copy of it, look in the Lidl shopping basket.
