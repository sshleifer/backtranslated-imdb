Not that I was really surprised .... films have never been as good as the books from which they came. I was looking forward to seeing this movie, because this is one of my favorite books, although I knew that it probably sucked. I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised. However, they deviated too much from the plot of the book, and the film’s version did not show how terrible this house was. The ending was also different. Lara Flynn Boyle looked terrible because of very bad cosmetic surgery. The game was unremarkable at best. Perhaps, if the theatrical version were made in such a way that they would not have to remain so much in the box “Created for a TV movie”, this would be the best movie. If you have seen this film, I highly recommend that you find a book and read it. I doubt that you will be disappointed and hope that you will enjoy it as much as I do every time I read it.
