I was always interested in something about a snowman, so when I was looking for a movie at the box office, this film caught my eye. It was the worst $ 4.50 I've ever spent, and I want my money back! Please do not spend your money on it !! It was one of the cheapest films I've ever seen. The whole film was incredibly boring, and I often rolled my eyes and did not even watch it to the end. I'm just fed up with it. The action was terrible, the consequences were terrible, everything was just awful and tasteless. All this eventually became a very bad, boring film and a complete waste of time and money. I hope that one day they will make a good film about Sasquatch, but until then I have to sit through countless cheap things like this to find a real masterpiece.
