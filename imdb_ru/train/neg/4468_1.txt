Well, simple and straightforward, if you're a fan of other Tomb Raider games (yes, even AOD), STAY FROM LEGEND. <br /> <br /> This is without a doubt the most disappointing TR game. It looks very good, it sounds very good, but it is absolutely unplayable, and I gave up. I feel that I was robbed by Eidos. <br /> <br /> Everything is very simple. TR was a PC game before anything else. You control Lara with the keyboard. In 6 Tomb Raider games, control was standard. In AOD, they were "sticky", but the same general control sequences. In The Legend, they completely changed her methods of movement and control, and she is completely out of control. <br /> <br /> In other places I have seen comments from people who say "Use the mouse." No, why should I? Others say: "Use the gamepad." No, why should I? Others say: "But it has been the standard for third-party control for many years." Well, I don't care, this is not the standard for any other TR game, so why mess with it. Oh, I know, because they don’t care about their original, dedicated fan base, they want to make money on new children who haven’t even heard about the series until the films are released and make a lot more money. Sorry. <br /> <br /> My advice to any serious TR fan: stay away from this game, and if you still buy it, complain to Eidos. I have seen many other posts, mostly on the Eidos forums, from people telling them how much trash they are, maybe they will listen.
