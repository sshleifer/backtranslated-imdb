People at Disney have a lot to explain. Firstly, why did someone think that this material from the comedy series would ever make even a semi-decent film. In the strange TV show of the 60s, the unique idea of ​​the Martians among us has not yet received sophisticated handling of the X-Files. Fancy visions of little green men have long since dispelled such as ET, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS and ALIENS 1-3. <br /> <br /> Any charm the property had was mainly due to the tender relationship created between the late Bill Bixby as Tim and Ray Walston as the otherworldly guest. The vanity that the Martians have an antenna seemed besotted then. Now it looks positively idiotic. However, Uncle Martin Christopher Lloyd has metal appendages. At an early stage, an antenna on a signboard for a television station where Tim is working should make us think "Martian"! When was the last time you saw rabbit ears television, huh? <br /> <br /> Disney doesn’t trust strange things or relationships and captures this film with special effects that young people like, including a spacesuit named Zoot! Yes, you read that right — Uncle Martin's silver spacesuit says. It is assumed that he is a real fun cut! Drawing again. I have elastic socks that are funnier than Zoot. Whenever an action lags behind (and it lags behind constantly), computer graphics are used to animate. Tim is played here by the friendly Jeff Daniels, who cannot (or does not want to) do anything to save this mess. Lustful Christina Ebersola brings comic zeal to the role of a neighbor. Even Ray Walston himself is painfully drawn into the cause - all to no avail. This alien visitor is dead on arrival. <br /> <br /> Constant talk about sitcoms turning to the screen gives me hope that in the movie “I Dream of Ginny” there will be no harem talking suit. I pray that Samantha's cat in the movie QUANTITY does not have lines. I live in fear that I LOVE LUCY - CG Conga Drum by the name of Bongo will play proudly in the film. <br /> <br /> Paging by Michael Eisner! Mickey Mouse - take me to your leader.
