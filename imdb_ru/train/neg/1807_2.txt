I admit that, reaching the age of majority in the hippie era, I really love such films. I can enjoy some of the hippie genres much more than most "normal" people. However, this film is just terrible in every conceivable relationship. <br /> <br /> Every banal perception of hippie stupidity seems like a gospel, the police kill young long hair when he peacefully lands on the plane. This film is so terrible that it’s not even funny to look like stupidity on the excesses of a hippie drone. It looks like the left version of Dragnet, only without professional actors. The only reason I gave him two stars was because there are some ambiguities of interest on the soundtrack, and besides, I could not find a selection of negative stars. <br /> <br /> No actors, almost no plot, sheeze, barely even a script ... you got it, a "feature" film .... All this is done at a slow speed of drilling root canals, pulling out every meaningless scene in order to fill the time. <br /> <br /> In a bizarre turn of life, imitating art, the film’s “nonactor” star joined the commune in real life and robbed a bank in Boston, one of his associates was killed, and he was sent to prison where he was killed in a suspicious weightlifting "accident" ..... and just think, he should leave it as a legacy .... Oy vey.
