There are beautiful landscape shots. Writers put banal mouths in the mouths of actors. With smaller actors this show would be stupid. "Art must exalt humanity, or it is BS." This is not so, because the art of all these people should also excite humanity and express the dark side. The main character even says that those who do not drink hide a shadow. Wrong, he lived in darkness and suppressed his dark side, drinking and being one-dimensional, without expanding his horizons with anything but landscapes. In his work there was neither the respiratory organism, nor the expression of his pain. All that the artist did was limit himself to ten landscapes. Discussions between the heroes took place in elementary school, trivial things always gave one hero the advantage that the writer wanted. I tried to like after reading all the first wow comments here. I had to dig deep to see those with whom I agreed. I think the wonderful comments were from those associated with the film. I was moved only once to the end. The child was too passive. The scenery was nice and the music was funny. Just my opinion, but nowhere to show for me.
