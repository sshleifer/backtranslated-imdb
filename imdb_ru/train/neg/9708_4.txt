When theater workers find an old movie clip, they decide to show it at midnight on the Night of the Living Dead, suggesting that it is an old preview clip. Unfortunately, this is actually an old Nazi mind control experiment that turns an audience into a crowd of senseless shuffling zombies. <br /> <br /> I can't understand the hate for this film. This is a low-budget, independent production with a lot of camp, but it does not deserve "1.1" here on IMDb. It's so fun. Obviously, filmmakers have sufficient knowledge and love for old horror films, and they have created an exciting tribute for them, studded with links and reverence for various of them. It feels things like The Night of the Living Dead (very similar in many respects), Evil Dead 2 and The Army of Darkness and others. <br /> <br /> I liked the explanation of how a zombie. Although in reality he is simply hypnotized, thinking that they are zombies, in fact he has the physical qualities of the living dead, perhaps incredible, but I appreciate the authors' efforts to explain . The effects of blood were decent for the budget, everything was fine with the game, and the story was interesting. <br /> <br /> I liked it.
