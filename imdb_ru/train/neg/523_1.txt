It is amazing for me that today passes for entertainment. maybe I'm a dinosaur of the fifties, and I am not aware of today's generation of films, and obviously this is the case with this film, since so many people loved it. I found it dirty and vulgar. I did not say this about many films in my life, but this one meets all the requirements. Humor sofomorny and rough. I am not a politically correct person, and even I found funny jokes, not only not funny, but also offensive (I'm not gay). The main character in the film is not even a pretty person, just pathetic. When the movie finally ended, I heard many people commenting on how disappointed they are that they just get good money to watch.
