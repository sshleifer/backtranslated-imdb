Presumably, based on the life of Domino Harvey, the model turned into a headhunter. I would say that 95% is fabricated. I always have an open mind about films, however, this film has lost its chances when it became obvious that there is a story in it, something I cannot bear, and, to top it all, the heroine of the story is so hated and depicted as arrogant ! h, I just wanted it to end up being shot in the head. this is too incoherent, too luxurious and too boring, it is he who gives some kind of crap story, and I really think that big-time directors have to make films based on their own imagination or on the writer's own imagination, and not some ignorant life scum. ,
