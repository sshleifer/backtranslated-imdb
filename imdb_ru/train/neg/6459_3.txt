Such great actors, such a disappointment. Marlon Brando plays a horrible character, the film is not funny at all, you can see the subliminal message “It's a hell of a flake !!!”, “It's terribly bad!”, “Throw your window through the window”, and soon. This is simply disgusting and tiring. In addition to the silly plot, a sense of humor, there is something else. The way the rooms are decorated, the colors. I'm sick, everything is so colorful that it can cause epilepsy. Usually I don’t care about the scenery in the film, but that from “Free Money” pissed me off. Avoid at all costs! “Free Money” is probably for Charlie Sheen, Sutherland and Brando, but the viewer gets nothing! One watches it at the cost of sanity.
