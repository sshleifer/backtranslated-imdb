Somehow, a woman who works with a scientist puts round metal balls in people's mouths, which supposedly changes their personality, but in reality turns them into insane killers, like zombies. Experimenting Guinea Pigs - poorly dressed young women who are in desperate need of acting lessons. This film is terrible, terrible and terribly bad. There is almost no logic in the script. It will really be difficult for you to keep track of what is happening. He has no special effects. The computer screen, which supposedly represents a great scientific progress, looks like nothing more than an old Atari screen. And what's worse, there is also a puppet with strands of felt hair (it looks like a lonely child in a summer camp did it) named George, who looks like a personal servant / confidant of Jessica (the leading “actress”). Throughout the film, you will be subject to idiotic, secondary sayings of this puppet. But wait ... you also get a lot of erotic, non-erotic, barely nude scenes with girls and guys from the bar. All this time in the background sounds the most annoying soundtrack, as if there is some kind of spiritual discovery. None of the actors are good. There are only different degrees of bad. Mountains and horrors especially clumsily removed. The film really looks like a teenager. It is no accident that Henry Sala, the director by name, but not by profession, did not make another film. I was bored almost to a coma when I looked at this stupid, stupid, dumbass. What about the final? What happened? If you know, let me reveal the secret, because I can not understand his life. All I know is that I lost the time I spent watching this garbage, which made the beginning of my weekend a real nightmare!
