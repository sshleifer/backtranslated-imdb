Behind the thick green glitter of computer graphics, Ichikawa Somegoro’s amazing art and craftsmanship shone. Alas: all is lost. The scenes of Old Edo — with the courtesan drifting on Sumid, rehearsing and playing at Nakamura-dza — were exciting and captivating, bringing you back to an interesting and rich era. The action on the Kabuki stage, in which Somegoro stands out and worried, was more enriching than any of the subsequent absurd jokes. The craftsmanship, the energy of the audience, the colors of the stage decorations were much more satisfactory than all the nonsense that took on the plot and performance. What a missed opportunity! One of the best actors of the kabuki is alive, and he got lost in the wood.
