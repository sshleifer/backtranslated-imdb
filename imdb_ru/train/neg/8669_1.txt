First of all, I liked Ray Bradbury's novel. This is the horror that penetrates your skin and sticks to you later. It was one of his best books with Fahrenheit 451 and Dandelion. I just hope that this movie will be all right. He had many chances with a magnificent cast of actors such as Jason Robards and Jonath Price. And Bradbury even wrote the script himself. And to top it all, it has PAM GRIER! <br /> <br /> How could this happen? <br /> <br /> Spoilers can be inside. <br /> <br /> First of all fooling down. Much of the horror from the book was lost, as Bradbury must have been forced to reduce violence to a minimum. All the visual effects from the book ... disappeared. Everything that made you squirm ... gone. <br /> <br /> And then the game. Like many movies that Disney released in the 80s, children in this film can not play. And it worried me a lot, none of them looked 13, but 9 or 10. Their strong friendship was not resolved. It was more like they were familiar. <br /> <br /> You might think that Jason Robards and Jonathan Price could handle this in their roles as Mr. Halloway and Mr. Dark. But here it’s just that they don’t care. All they want to do, anyway, is to pay some mortgage or something. This is not one of their best performances. <br /> <br /> Pam Greer was fine, like a witch, but the character of Dusty Witch herself did not cope with this task. She is much less evil and has no such presence as in the book. <br /> <br /> And all that remains of the book. The night pursuit of the balloon, the layout of Jim's house, the real death of Mr. Dark, what happened to Mr. Coogan on the carousel, the destiny of the lighting rod merchant, the real death of the witch, and much more ... <br /> <br /> And the special effects were bad even for the 80s. The carousel of death on one side with the horses laid on it was not really creepy, and that strange green mist that really had nothing to do with anything. <br /> <br /> I could continue to talk about how this film tore apart the original novel, but the blood boiled. Do not watch this movie, but read the book. This is the classic Bradbury.
