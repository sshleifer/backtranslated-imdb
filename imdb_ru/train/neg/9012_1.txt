I saw the movie “Flyboys” yesterday, and my friend told me that this is the worst movie she has ever seen ... Since I thought it was pretty awful, it made me think which movie was the worst, which I've ever seen, and it was the only film that came to my mind. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, several years have passed since I saw him, but I remember the terribly erroneous Dean Kane as a daring military man (the cute Cain boy is not very bold) Well). A strange deal with a CGI helicopter when it would probably be cheaper to rent a helicopter than to hire some CGI guys to do it, but I guess they found the helicopter as a free sample for some CGI program or the son of a producer. He loved to play with his new computer. And what did it look like ?? Awful. And when the dragon attacks through the corridors of the complex, it repeats the same shots over and over again - it looks VERY cheap. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie - it's really terrible ...
