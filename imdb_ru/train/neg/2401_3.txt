At one time I saw the best films about werewolves for teenagers, but this one shoots a cake. More comedy than horror, "Full Moon High" puts "c" on the cheese festival. The star quality in this film is not bad. The way it was done just rolls down the hill. Adam Arkin plays Tony, an all-American football player from the 50s who ultimately does not get old because of the werewolf bite in Transylvania. The most annoying part of the film is the violinist. He drove all his hands! Ed McMahon plays his ultra-conservative father, who met his end of his own bullet. Adam's father, Alan, plays a psychotherapist who does not seem to be the pinnacle of his game. After all these years, Tony seems very inappropriate because of the attack, and then he will get a chance to catch in his condition. More laughter than bloodshed, this film is only the beginning of the 80s, Teenage Wolf was an improvement on that! 1 out of 5 stars.
