This is not the worst movie I've ever seen about Peter Greenaway, but he is close. This disgrace goes to the even worse Book of Pillows. The films of this director from three films that I have seen seem unhappy to me. Like Cook ... no matter what positive cinematographic manifestations he demonstrates, they are not completely bought out by his disgusting material and general presentation.
