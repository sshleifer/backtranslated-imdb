If Alien, Jurassic Park and countless other sci-fi horror films - your cup of tea, add a lot of sugar, and you get this drink. The film begins in gay old England around 1100, and then goes on to modern California. Our hero Carver (Dean Kane) is a new security chief and military advisor to a science lab 400 feet below ground. He arrives (Carver is also a helicopter pilot) with a lead scientist, and we will soon find out that this is a cloning laboratory, and they have something that was found for cloning. Is it a dinosaur or what? As in the aforementioned films, all hell broke loose, and our characters began to break away. Monster's special effects are pretty good for the movie “right on the video,” and Dean Kane does what he gets paid for. But forget about the rest of the group, as we will find out why we have never seen them before. Again, do not come in with high expectations, and you will be fine.
