It was so stupid that I turned off the DVD ... maybe halfway through. He was so weak that I could not even give enough attention to tell you how far I had come. Although I really wanted to believe that the image of young Carlito would be somewhat different, I just could not buy it. I don't really blame the actors, because I think it was a script that could have failed. I really laughed a few times, but I don't think these lines should have been funny. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves me is that I bought it in a set with two DVDs and paid the price I made for the original alone. This is one of those times when they should have left the classics alone.
