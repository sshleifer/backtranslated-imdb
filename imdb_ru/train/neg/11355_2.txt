Nat (voiced by Trevor Gagnon) along with his mental friend IQ (voiced by Philip Bolden) and the always hungry Scooter (David Gore) are children with big dreams. They want to be the first flies in space. And what inspires their dreams is the first spacecraft to land on the moon, the Apollo 11, which is waiting for its historic flight to the launch site near the place where they are located. movie animation I found it done very well done. The scenery had depth, because things from a distance actually looked like they were in the focus of scenes. I have not seen the movie in 3D since it was broadcast on HBO. However, I could see that in fact there were no scenes that would take advantage of the three-dimensional effects, except for the fight between the characters closer to the end. I was also not impressed with the character design. For me, they were not like something like a fly, especially in color. The flies were an unusual blue-gray color, which distracted me a little. <br /> <br /> The performances of the actors were not bad, but not very good either. Many times I focused more on my computer than on history. The letter was written for younger audiences, with comedic moments that will make young children laugh. I didnâ€™t see anything for adults, like jokes about how they would get a highlight, so that adults would understand the meaning. <br /> <br /> In this film, the story is not traced. In fact, I think it was completely ignored, since the focus was on flies. I also hated when a famous cosmonaut appeared on the screen and explained that the stories about flies in the film were fiction, and there were no flies on Apollo 11. although their life is for space exploration. <br /> <br /> If you are an adult, this is not for you. It was not made for the whole family. This is of course only for children. But keep it for a rainy day.
