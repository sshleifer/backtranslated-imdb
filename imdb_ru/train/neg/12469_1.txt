Rarely do I refuse a movie without seeing the whole show. This is especially true when I rented it on DVD. Siriana was the one in which I gave up. Halfway I turned it off with a bored disgust. <br /> <br /> This film is rambling, boring, tangled and dim. The action was dry and without credible images. The overall plot was good, but it developed so tasteless and boring that it could not capture my attention or interest. Numerous sub-subjects often could not connect with each other and seemed like random stories rather than a real plot. It is a pity that such a serious subject and such great actors can create such a failure. I can not imagine that this film received any nomination, much less an award.
