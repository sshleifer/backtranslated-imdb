This film is about Tirannus, the gladiator who is returned from the dead to summon Tyrann, the gladiator who needs to be returned from the dead. Tyrann, as we learn in about an hour, is also called Demonic. This adds much-needed depth to the script and questions our assumptions about identity, psychology, and ourselves. <br /> <br /> The Spirit of Tirana completes his little to-do list (kills some people and utters repeated phrases in Latin), possessing the body of a college student. To do this, he uses a magic helmet for mind control, which the boy-student readily puts on his head, and then in several places of the film he takes off and puts it back on. <br /> <br /> Maria performs oral sex on poor Sean Willian Scott, and Tyrannus wears a Rollerball glove. Tyrann has its own green backlighting for no reason, and has obviously been sitting next to CG fire in an ancient concrete tunnel for centuries like this. Extreme misfortune. <br /> <br /> This movie is empty and hurt you. See it.
