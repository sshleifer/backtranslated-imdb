This film was not just bad - it was terrible. After I watched it, I really felt the need to take a SHOWER in order to remove the dirt from me. There runs a "gag" with an elderly couple, it's not funny, but disgusting. Monster makeup was great, but that's about it. Succession errors alone will make you angry - at least I was. Editing is very bad. <br /> <br /> Almost everything you could do would be better than wasting time watching this movie. Even if your group of friends is interested in “bad movies”, this film is exceptional due to its inability, I could not even bring myself to laugh at it. You have been warned.
