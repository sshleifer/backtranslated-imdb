First, before reading further, you must understand that I am not a neo-Nazi, I just try to understand Hitler correctly, to be sure that no one, like him, will take power again. <br /> <br /> I saw this Serial and found it awful. I mean, well, it's fun to watch, but is it real? I searched for answers and found one: absolutely not. First, Hitler was not angry all his life, the series shows an evil Hitler, even when he was a child. Secondly, Hitler never wanted to insult his daughter, in fact, it is very likely that Hitler was in fact gay and struggled all his life to strangle this secret. Third, people will hate me, but this is true: Hitler was charming. How do you think he managed to come to power if he was so hateful and ugly? Because he was charming. This is a common point of view, which I found in interviews with people who live near or far from him (of course, not Jews). <br /> <br /> This series was terrible, because if you think that Hitler was just an evil bastard, ugly, and, of course, not at all charming, you are wrong. If you think so, you will allow people like him to seize power in countries, but you do not want it. If you really understand how Hitler managed to come to power, and stopped thinking that he was simply terrible, you can find such dangerous politicians as he (of course, remember that he was elected), and stop the topic before it was too late . /> <br /> Life is important for protection, this series is just awful to show us the truth, if we continue to see Hitler like this, the other will happen just like the first one.
