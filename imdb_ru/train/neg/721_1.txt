This film has several key flaws. The first and most significant of which is the apparent lack of a good plot! This, unfortunately, makes the film not only difficult to watch, but also evokes a sense of hopelessness in the viewer, as if he or she spends the precious time of his short life. This means that the film cannot charm its audience; instead, it encourages viewers to show contempt for the film and everything connected with it! In short, it is really very, very, very, very, very, very, very bad! Do yourself a favor and chew on large rubber shoes, you will find it much more interesting and more pleasant than watching Terminator Woman.
