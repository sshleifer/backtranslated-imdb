The incoherent confusion with the terrifyingly deafening soundtrack, “Soul Survivors,” is the latest horror movie recording of “who is dead and who is alive”. Two couples of teenagers, Sean and Cassie, Matt and Annabel, are preparing to go to different colleges, but before parting before the break on Thanksgiving, they attend the last flirting at a rave-type party in some burnt church at the suggestion of a juicy depraved Annabel ( Eliza darling, she's a fait, another vampire killer). Creepy guys who have no movements, start to pay too much attention to Cassie (generic Melissa Sagemiller) for reasons that are never explained, and soon the quartet leaves the party. Driving off on their SUV, they are pursued and then overtaken by aimless creepy guys who quickly and inexplicably make an intentional 180 in the middle of the highway, causing an unpleasant and fatal accident when the SUV turns the embankment and crashes into the river. Sean is killed (or is he?), And Cassie spends the rest of the film, coping with loneliness and guilt (she rode) when she is not pursued by the ghost of Sean and is not pursued by these gratuitous creepy guys. Many inexplicable inconsistencies follow, as Cassie’s mental state deteriorates further until we reach a predictable conclusion. So who is dead and who is alive? After ninety minutes of this purgatory, who cares?
