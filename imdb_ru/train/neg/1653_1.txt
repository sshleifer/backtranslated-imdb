It just seems strange that someone read this script and thought: “This is ridiculous! I mean, it's so much fun that you just have to make it! ”Who was this man? Is he or she the person really responsible for this? Is it those who owe me in my time more than the director / writer? <br /> <br /> This movie stinks in almost all possible ways. There is not a single shred of good dialogue and there is not a single pleasant character. And the story ... <br /> <br /> I prefer the second worst film ever, Hulk Hogan’s "No Hold's Barred". Compared to him, he looks almost like Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The final ends with a few minutes of out, and it is still less than 80 minutes. Among them are actors laughing at the “ridiculous” mistakes they made and the things that went wrong on the set of this “comedy”. Glad someone laughs at this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is not funny. Nothing. It just goes on and on. It really is so lame. I love movies that are so bad that they are good. This is so bad, this is ... something, but I don’t know what, and hopefully, I will never know. <br /> <br /> Amanda Pete doesn't suck right, and in fact it's only half good about this imitation film. But it really means little. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
