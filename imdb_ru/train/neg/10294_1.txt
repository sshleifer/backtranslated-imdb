Nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Then characters without personality do not develop. <br /> <br /> Then the end never comes, because there is no beginning and there is no middle. <br /> <br /> There are beautiful shots that are not made beautiful, because they are not even allowed to be, because this film is not even there. In this film there is no “is”, because there is no plot, characters, themes, ideas, symbols, discussion, dialogue or point. There's nothing! <br /> <br /> There is a good point: he has a good soundtrack. But sound editing is such, and the film itself is such that watching it is not even worth your time, so if you are really interested, I would suggest that you go and buy a soundtrack or something like that. From this film you will get everything you can, without fatigue, headaches and impatience. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
