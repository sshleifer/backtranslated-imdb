When you look back at another bad sequel of Nightmare, such as Freddie's Revenge, you should at least give him credit for trying something new. And although The Dream Child is more enjoyable, it offers absolutely nothing new for the series. Yes, creative deaths, as usual, happen when a child becomes part of a comic book and faces “Super Freddy”, but even such scenes are not fully used, and the roles without Freddie are just boring. <br /> <br /> This marked the official death of the series. Freddie, it seems, now brings a comedic relief ... but why? <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10
