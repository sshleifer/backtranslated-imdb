Ugh! Where to start ... first, Campbell Scott’s non-stop anxiety after a while (a very short time) becomes a real disconnect when he absorbs his growing pain, curiosity and anger. Only we do not care! These characters, represented by the writer and director, are completely unattractive, and this is the key. They gave us nothing to make us care about whether they are adulterers and whether they are in love with each other or not. When Scott quietly says to his wife, “I could kill you,” before their three daughters at the dinner table, after the shock of his selfishly unsuccessful timing had passed, I almost wanted him to do it - and then did the same with the smug witty appearance of Denis Leary before he was dragged out of the bin. This is a waste of time and, perhaps, only resources.
