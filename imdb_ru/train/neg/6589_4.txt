I'm afraid I didn't really like this movie. Apart from a few saving graces, there is nothing special here. <br /> <br /> J-Horror flourished over the past five to six years, but the films themselves on more than one account were repetitive and exact copies of previous success. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> In essence, this is a supernatural film. The beginning is promising from the chilling scenes in the morgue, where the dead girl stitches the eyes graphically, but soon opens them. However, after that, it quickly descends. <br /> <br /> To be kind, I will start with things that I like in Gavi. On the positive side, the visual effects are tasteless, and the film looks great for its type. For those who love their horror movies, there are several well-executed (without pun intended) murder scenes. We also have some good wait / set episodes. <br /> <br /> However, there are a few flaws ... <br /> <br /> First of all, and my main complaint about the plot in this movie is skipping and jumping back and forth in time with frightening intensity. This is usually not a problem for me, but here, where students look exactly the same, no matter what age they are, I was confused more than once. <br /> <br /> Submissions are fine, I think (a little hard to say when you donâ€™t know the language), but it seems a little tough. And for a horror movie, I don't think it was scary enough. For a while I was pretty bored. <br /> <br /> As a fan of hyallo films, I expected a lot from Nightmare, but unfortunately I was pretty disappointed.
