"Boom" got a reputation for itself. With heavyweights like Taylor, Burton, Noel Coward, Tennessee Williams and Joseph Losey, would you think how bad this could be? Well, this is much worse than you can imagine. <br /> <br /> The sad and disturbing fact of the “boom” is that it seems to signal the fall and fall of the above-mentioned heavyweights. Only director Joseph Losey, plunging into the depths with Modesty Modesty and Boom (some may wish to add The Secret Ceremony), managed to recuperate and create his best work in 1970 — the wonderful Go-Between <br /> <br /> The saddest thing is the work of Tennessee Williams. From the mid-forties to the early sixties, Williams wrote many plays that acquired classical status while remaining in the repertoire of theater throughout the world, many of which have become highly regarded films. When William’s muse left him, probably because of his notorious substance abuse, he left him forever. Williams at his best - an actor's dream, providing many unforgettable performances. (Was Ava Gardner or Deborah Kerr ever better than in Iguana Nights?) In particular, Taylor shone both in Cat on the Hot Tin Roof and in Suddenly Last Summer. There is a joke in which allegedly Taylor asks John Gilgud if he would teach her to play Shakespeare, to which he replied: "If you teach me to play Tennessee Williams." If Gilgud had seen Boom, he would have kept his mouth shut. Taylor just never got worse, turning into an awkward, challenging performance. Despite the fact that her face is well photographed, it is strongly fried. In addition to physical decline, from now on she would have largely lost credibility as a serious actress with a series of completely forgotten (and worse) roles in her favor. <br /> <br /> Much can be said about Burton. After his short theatrical fame, he won fame and fortune in Hollywood. But the bulk of his work from this point on (1968) would have been, at least, unremarkable. <br /> <br /> Noel Trus has long ceased to be a force in the theater, where his comedies in the living room were replaced by the likes of Williams and the British "evil young people." It seems that he enjoys putting him on a hike, but it hardly surprises this person who claimed such talent. <br /> <br /> The only cast that supports her dignity is young Joanna Shimkus, who in a few years a promising career on the screen will become Mrs. Sidney Poitier. <br /> <br /> “Boom” smells like self-indulgence; it's just out of control. A rather sad pointer to an unsuccessful career, and not to a cheerful camp holiday, as some believe.
