Well! What can I say? First, this adaptation is too long at 4 o'clock for the complexity (or lack thereof) of the plot. The actors do their best to make something from this film, but this time there is too little content. Swayze is NOT really a Quatermain character at all. Seeing the interpretation of the great man by Sean Connery in the “League of Distinguished Gentlemen,” Swayze really didn’t get a rating. This guy with Winchester's recurring rifle has neither strength, nor height, nor subtlety, nor humor necessary for the role, and he is extolled by everyone, including the healer, who, in my opinion, as an actor looks more convincing than an actor the rest of the cast. Some perspectives are pleasant, but there are stupid mistakes in cinema. For example. When a happy team arrives at a watering place in the middle of the desert, their footprints are visible to the oasis, just waiting for them to enter them. The exit from the mine leads to the exit (in the next photo), which resembles the exit from the passage through which they passed, and so on. I waited for Doug McClure to appear at any moment. In a sense, I wish he had. <br /> <br /> The leader of the Russians who are pursuing Quotermain is a poorly created stereotypical character who just shoots everything. <br /> <br /> Swayze copes well with the work of the sad father who returned to London, who cannot get custody of his son. Swayze should stick with this sort of thing. He is not able to fulfill the role of a courageous gentleman with a strong heart, life experience and a sense of fair play. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10. Hardly
