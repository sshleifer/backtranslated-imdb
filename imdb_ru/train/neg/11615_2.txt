Although I was not a fan of Sam Rockwell, I was surprised when I saw his name in the credits at the opening of Joshua. Hell, I didn't even know that he was in Joshua until I started the movie. So it goes without saying that I watched a movie based on a movie, and did not lead. It was announced that it was “Rosemary's Baby”, “Omen” or any other demonic children's film “Joshua”. Unfortunately it did not work. Slowly, incredibly slowly and evenly. Nevertheless, I continued to watch how all this would be resolved, hoping that before the faith, the final climax would shed some light on this topic. Well, I admit that it was (a little), but what a stale closure. And what a movie with a low budget, or at least so they created it. Man falls ?? you do not see a drop, you see someone lying in the blood. Does a person get hit by a taxi? You do not see this, you see that someone is complaining while holding the bike. I'm not sure if this is called “style” or laziness or just the lack of funds for special effects. We have a "rich" family with a crazy mom, father of a workaholic, trying to balance everything, child ?? Joshua, who can / cannot be the antichrist and a newborn girl who cries a lot. She cries as much as we see how many days she lives ?? And what was that? Are there rats or joshua? Is his mother crazy? Is Joshua crazy? Is he just jealous of a newbie in the family? Is he going to grow up to be Michael Myers? Or does he bring the family to the edge? I do not think so. Before that, they were crazy, and no "so-called" game could make me believe the opposite. Unfortunately, almost no questions were answered, all open doors were barely closed. I'm sure it could have been an idea, but for Pete, give me something. Anything. There are many best movies for kids. Joshua looks more like the antichrist mini-me.
