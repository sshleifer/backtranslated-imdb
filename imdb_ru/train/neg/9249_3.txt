When I watch a movie, I'm not sure what was the direction. There is a reason why a writer does not have to direct his work or even act in it, you cannot do all this. I felt that the story really suffered in this film because of the director wearing so many hats. Miss McTeere is a movie. To add to her amazing talents, her image of this woman was why I was engaged. Here is a British actress who can do anything. In my opinion, conflict is what makes a drama and a great story. I felt that this movie did not have it. Everything was somewhat easy for the characters, there were no real obstacles preventing the characters from getting what they wanted. Watch the movie for sweetness, but most of all for the brilliant performance of Ms. Maktir.
