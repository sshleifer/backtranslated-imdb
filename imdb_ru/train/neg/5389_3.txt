If you've seen other similar films, they are probably better. Omega man comes to mind. To the credit of the studio, they avoided the sprawling, unnecessary, large budget technofest that typifies films of this kind. In addition, the situation and the prerequisites were excellent: four people, whose past has practically no relation to us, are trying to escape from an incurable infectious deadly disease. What is bad is EVERYTHING! I'm tired of the infinitely stupid, careless, stupid, ineffective, arrogant characters in the film. It pretty much describes everyone in the film at some point. I rented it and found myself constantly shouting on TV: “No, don't do it!”, “Why are you so stupid”, “Watch out!” And so on. Halfway there is an obvious lack of character development. The film MUST give you a strong personal connection, at least with some of the characters, so you really care what happens to them. This one does not. In addition, there should have been a longer, more exciting end of the film.
