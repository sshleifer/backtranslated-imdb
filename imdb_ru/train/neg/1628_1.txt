Without a doubt, one of the most embarrassing works of the 1970s, GAOTS, it seems, really, really wants to be something important. The tragic truth is that at every level it is so useless that it is impossible not to laugh. Reaching in the despair of the earthly elements of Ingmar Bergman’s films, he follows the day of a married couple in the desert ... they walk along a shady path, meanwhile pontifying like the USA. Berkeley coffee clutch. Almost every line of the tarradiddle dialogue presented here is terribly bad (“I feel that life itself consists of so many tiny compartments like this grenade ... but is it so beautiful?”) After what seems like an eternity, absolutely nothing happens (ok. .. ok ... some nude and cool sex hugging us) with an acoustic guitar. <br /> <br /> IN THIS FILM, nothing interesting or interesting happens. I thought that Larry Buchanan's Strawberries in Need of Rain was a weak example of Bergman’s respect. “Golden apples” are no worse, but the endless random verbiage they represent makes it unforgettable and terrible. 1/10
