"Magnolia" - an absurd, amazing acting showcase, which is composed very little. Like the Eyes Wide Shut, Magnolia is a pointless series of episodes that does not care about consistency. The camera scans the corridors and corridors, catching a glimpse of sad characters. Where is the reason to care for these people? A common theme seems to be people who scream a lot, who do not care about others (with the exception of the characters John S. Reilly and Philip Seymour Hoffman) and are self-destructive assholes who either fall to pieces or die. I was reminded of how much I disliked the “Splendor” because of the inapplicable monster of the father played by Armin Muller-Stahl. There are so many unattractive, unappealing characters, why should we spend time with them? <br /> <br /> Having said this, nothing is hidden in Magnolia. Paul Thomas Anderson's ideas are abandoned on his canvas. There are two ideas, in particular, this bomb. Both occur at the last hour of this 188-minute film. One has a camera that switches from one character to another, while each sings one of the folk songs of the Aimee Mann coffee shop. Sweet, but to no avail, since we do not see what binds them all together. Another idea to which I refer cannot be revealed except to say that it is completely unexpected and completely absurd. <br /> <br /> Magnolia has a great acting game. Especially Tom Cruise, who launches a show that I didn’t know he was in. And John S. Reilly has been playing the most decent and really good cop lately. But it all adds up to nothing. When a secret unexpected event occurred, the girl behind me in the theater could no longer restrain him and said: “This is stupid!” It seems to me that most movie fans will agree.
