Margret Lawrence probably did not intend to take any of her novels for the film, let alone Stone Angel. Hagar, as a character, was the one who constantly challenged the social norm (Geinsey, who dared, anyone?), And ended up nearly sacrificing his humanity in this process. The characters in the book (Stone Angel, Silver Thread, etc., etc.) are constant reminders of this struggle between the old and the new, as well as the slaughter (so to speak) along the way. <br /> <br /> Although the film is fairly faithful to the plot of the book (but in reality this is not a plot narrative, is it?), I think he missed the moment to convey the spirit of the film. Hagar’s disobedience (for the sake of disobedience) was not there. Bram could have been much more rude than he was portrayed, and Hagar’s father could be called more “traditional,” so to speak. If the filmmaker insisted on a stronger image, the film would revive him. <br /> <br /> In the same vein, why should we see mobile phones, organic products and other upgrades? Are we trying to make any comments in order to make any comments (for example, a Muslim girl and the indigenous people). Hagar and Co. are all but politically correct in the book, so why should we see this in the film version. Modernization may be an excuse for a low-budget operation, but using this as a pretext for sending subconsciously politically correct messages that are completely irrelevant to the novel (and the film) seems like striking below intelligence. <br /> There is also an audience. It seems we were forced to see the bitter old men nice and sweet. Why should he laugh every time Hagar is in her tantrums? I doubt that Magarita Lawrence wanted her readers to laugh at Agara or her. These people are frustrated and filled with fear, and all we do is laugh at them. I don't think it helped Hagar and other people in her situation.
