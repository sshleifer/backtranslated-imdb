After watching the first 20 minutes of Blanche (sorry, I could not take more), I confirmed that she does not. <br /> <br /> In essence, this “film” is an insult to the real French actors involved in this farcical piece of garbage. It begins with a concept successfully used in French comedies (“Deux heures moins le quart avant Jesus Christ”, “La Folie des Grandeurs”, ...): a historical film with an anachronistic tone / dialogue. This can give brilliant results if supported by brilliant actors and the “sophistication” of direction that avoids the terrible stigma of “heavy comedy.” <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the horse-faced Lou Doillon destroys everything, and Blanche instead of a comedy, just turns into a horror movie. Horror for moviegoers who want to be perplexed and shocked, watching how great actors, such as Decaux, Zem or Rochefort, fight in the middle of this tasteless parody lousy farce.
