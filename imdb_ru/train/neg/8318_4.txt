I have already seen fantastic stories, but the prerequisites of this are so incredible that it is very close to ridiculous. A rich and young guy undergoes a heart transplant the day after the wedding, and in some way he becomes a witness to his own operation and the plot of his surgeons to kill him. Even if this phenomenon has a medical explanation, what will happen next, is it a mixture of dialogue between ... say ... souls? ... maybe in real life, where a dedicated mother will do everything to save the life of her son. There is no shadow of anticipation or thrill, just a combination of a bad and simplistic plot with a series of coincidences that can never happen in life. <br /> <br /> Can't say that the film lacks quality - for the first time, director Jobi Harold does a good job of managing a good team of actors, including Hayden Christensen in his first leading role after he shot Anakin Skywalker's costume, terrific Jessica Alba and the super-talented Lena Olin. Everyone would deserve a better story.
