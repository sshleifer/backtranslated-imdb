I had to watch this movie because the plot was so outrageous and the film met the expectations. In fact, this sometimes makes viewing rather uncomfortable. Unlike other Meyer films, sexual antics are minimized. Some scenes of violence are unnecessarily unfounded and offensive. The plot is chaotic, and some actions and lines are terrible. <br /> <br /> The film is a strange combination of sadomasochistic fantasies combined with a window of cruelty and immorality of slavery and fails on all counts. As if Meyer was trying to catch up on sex / black booty, having a higher moral meaning. Meyer knows that we feel a little guilty about being annoyed by the dominant connotation of the early scene, showing that Lady Susan is holding the whip in provocative outfit. Then he tries to return to the righteous path, turning it into a film about the victory of good over evil. However, since they mutually compensate each other, you will not get anything. <br /> <br /> Because in so many ways it's so bad, it's really worth seeing if you appreciate the art of making a terrible movie at worst. Possible taste. Perhaps because this is so bad, we almost let Meyer get away with the unacceptable.
