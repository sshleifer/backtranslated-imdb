This film is an attempt to present Jared Diamond's Theory of Weapons, Microbes and Steel, explaining how Europeans dominated most of the globe. <br /> <br /> A version of this documentary that I saw was presented on 2 discs covering 3 hours. I think that the information could be presented in 20 minutes. There are absolutely useless scenes: Professor Jared Diamond, birdwatching through binoculars, Professor Jared Diamond, who does not know how to properly use a bow and arrow, Professor Jared Diamond, shooting a muzzle loader. Was this documentary supposed to be the hero of “Professor Jared Diamond”? This part of the documentary was so bad that it could be a fake. Worst of all was when Diamond was broken and cried when he traveled around the ward of malaria in an African hospital. None of this helps me understand his theory of "Weapons, Microbes and Steel." By the way, "Weapons, microbes and steel" said about 100 times. “Can European guns, microbes and steel bring them out of this terrible situation?” Stay with us and find out! ”When he finally gets down to business, his theory is equally interesting and extremely boring. Europeans conquered the Aboriginal peoples of other countries because they had guns and beautiful blades against stone and wooden weapons. Do I really need a professor to convince me of this? Those parts of his theory that explain how the Europeans came to the advantages that allow conquest are interesting, but the coverage is very scarce. <br /> <br /> In the end, I think the documentary was only trying to convince me that non-Europeans are as capable as the Europeans. If I'm not a racist, I already know that. If I'm a racist, Jared Diamond is not going to convince me with his clumsy use of native tools. <br /> <br /> I don’t think that adults are the target audience for this documentary. Kids can enjoy it more than me. I read that the book from which this documentary is much better than a documentary.
