This is one of those topics that I can touch on a bit more than most people, because I hate noise and don’t know how it happens in big cities in New York, especially about how people sleep at all! It amazes me that people can endure all the noise there these days. The main plot of the film is an interesting topic. It's too bad, that's all. Tim Robbins is decent, although with the exception of a few scenes (especially with an absolute supermodel looking like Margarita Leyev), he doesn't seem to have been there at all. My biggest hope for this film is that the actors will see an absolutely amazing and talented actress, Margarita Levieva. She has nothing to do, but she is a beautiful supermodel. Even when they try to make her look at another girl next door. I am sad that there may be people in the world like Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian who have no abilities or talents that can be traded to have more fame and success than this talented beauty. I didn't care for most of this movie, because the script is not very good, but I'm glad I saw the new talent. I hope that producers and directors think of Margarita when they need a new beautiful actress to star in a big budget film. If they can make Megan Fox a star (oh well, she’s not so hot, and her acting talent is worse than for television shows on Disney channel) from one movie, for her it should happen easily, as she’s gorgeous and talented! I would advise her to change her last name so that we can pronounce it and make it more salable. We hope that this will make her career, and, if there is any justice at all, she may appear in one or two big summer films in the next couple of years.
