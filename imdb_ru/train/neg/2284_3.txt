Now I will not deny that when I bought it on eBay, I had high expectations. It was an incredible job of a print-free comedy master that I like so much. However, I was soon disappointed. I apologize to those who liked it, but I just discovered that Compleat Al is very difficult to watch. I got a few smiles, of course, but most of the funny ones came from music videos (which I have on the DVD), and the rest were mostly fillers. You could say that this was not Al's greatest video achievement (this honor goes to the UHF). Honestly, I doubt that it will ever lead to the transfer to DVD, so if you are a super-tight Al fan and just MUST own everything, buy a tape on eBay. Just don't pay too much for it.
