The film version of Sandra Bernhard's show with one woman off Broadway is choking. Sandra is deceiving the lounge of actors and superstars, but her sense of irony is only surprisingly interesting and surprisingly funny. Her fans will say that she is incredibly honest, and this may be true. But it is also piercing, with irreconcilable bravado in the face, which is not very suitable for a film in this genre. She does not want to put up - and she certainly does not want to make friends - and it is always going to rub many people wrong. But even if you meet her halfway, her material is seriously lacking here. Director Nicolas Roeg served as an executive producer, and, despite the fact that the film was not directed by him, the film has its own cool, distinctive signature style in all this. Bernhard co-wrote the show with director John Boscovich; their strangest touch was to make Sandra’s entire internal audience look boring — a feeling that most of the current audience would most likely share. * 1/2 of ****
