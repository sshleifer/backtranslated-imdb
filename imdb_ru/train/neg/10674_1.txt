This is considered one of the worst films I have seen in recent years. Apart from Cuba and Angie, acting is really confusing. Wasn't Archer a decent actress? What happened to her? The action is decent, but completely implausible. Makeup is so bad it is worth mentioning. I mean, who ever thought about makeup in a modern feature film. Someone should tell the makeup artist and DOP that you should not see him. The ending is a huge disappointment - according to the principle “and then they understood that this is all a dream” <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time and money. You better just look into space for 2 hours.
