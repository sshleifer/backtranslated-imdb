Good Land follows the life of a slave and poor farmer in China. The film is based on the novel Pearl S. Buck. The story is wonderful, but I hated the fact that they decided to play Anglo in the lead roles. Walter Connolly is ridiculous as the father of a farmer. He has such a strong American accent, like most of the leading actors, that I could not listen to his speeches. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Hollywood could not overcome his racist beliefs to cast Asians in the lead roles. Take Anglo and make it look as if the Chinese are like Anglo, who has a shoe polish on his face to play African Americans.
