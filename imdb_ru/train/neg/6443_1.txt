I was one of the few non-liberals who came to see Steve's video. It was a great experience ... in propaganda filmmaking and boredom. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that this film would be a documentary about Michael Mooreâ€™s visit to my local UVSC school, but it turned out to be another liberal attempt to destroy the conservatives and the local religious community. For the director, it seems self-serving to make a documentary that reflects his preconceived opinions about the problems. <br /> <br /> It is even more surprising to see all 10 votes that his household members have posted here. Did they even see the video? God, Batman, this must be in the rank of all the people of the president! Their ratings are as obvious as the bias in this film. <br /> <br /> Yes, for example, the distribution of votes in IMDb will help an unsuccessful film. Maybe my voice will help balance this out.
