Snow White, which just came out in Locarno, where I happened to see her, of course, belongs to the world-famous fairy tale. And this also applies to cola. In the end, the real snow of the Swiss Alps also plays a role. <br /> <br /> Thus, all three aspects of the title are covered in this film. There is a lot of drug addiction on stage, as well as a pale, dark-haired girl - with a prince who has to overcome all difficulties in order to come to her aid. <br /> <br /> But: it is not. fairy tale. It is assumed that this is a realistic drama, located in Zurich, Switzerland (according to the slogan). <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is close to perfect. Unfortunately, a weak plot, predictable dialogues, mostly unrealistic scenery and a mixed game do not add up to create authenticity. Thus, as a spectator, I remained untouched. <br /> <br /> And then there were cliches that drove me crazy one by one: Snow White is a rich and spoiled daughter from the upper class - of course, her parents divorced, and she never received enough love from them because they were so busy all the time. On the other hand, her best friend has loving and caring parents. They (the steelmaker and the housewife) live in a tiny apartment, poor and happy - and unaware of the stalemate in which their daughter is. The good guy (= prince) is a musician (!) From the French-speaking part of Switzerland (which is considered to be less economically successful, but emotionally more healthy part of the country). He has problems with his parents. These are migrants from Spain who do not seem to accept his wild lifestyle - until the father becomes seriously ill and does not admit his immense admiration to his son from the hospital bed. <br /> <br /> And so on to: Naturally, the drug dealer is cruel, heartless bankers, the club owner is a playboy and photographer, although the woman only has her career as she shows Snow White in the fancy pornographic photos in the exhibition (! ). <br /> <br /> This review does not need a spoiler to allow you to add these pieces to an obvious plot. Like other films Samira, for example. "Forget Baghdad", I was very disappointed. Let's hope for the next one.
