At least 10 years will be interesting. Eleanor (Gina Davis) and Fred (Hugh Laurie) Little, a lovely wealthy couple, were going to bring a new younger brother from the orphanage for their son George (Jonathan Lipnitski). They come home with a completely strange new brother ... a pointedly dressed little mouse named Stewart (voiced by Michael J. Fox). Yes, the mouse. Stewart is happy to have found a sense of belonging, even if he is in a huge world, in which there is the domestic cat of his new family, Snowbell (voiced by Nathan Lane). Stewart takes on the experience of family loyalty and mutual friendship. George will finally take on his tiny new brother when Stuart, dressed in panache, gets rid of embarrassment in a race on a model boat. <br /> <br /> Starring: Julia Sweeney, Harold Gould, Estelle Getty and Jeffrey Jones. And voices: Chaz Palminteri, Bruno Kirby and Jennifer Tilly.
