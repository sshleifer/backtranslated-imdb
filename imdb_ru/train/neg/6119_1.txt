A muscular man in the jungles of Africa is being hunted by an opportunistic expedition; the cute daughter of the team leader finds him first. The fairytale version of Tarzana, which is often deceived, is well thought out, but is trimmed with the only worst direction I've ever seen in a movie. John Derek is devoid of inspiration, except for delicate delayed shots and glimpses of Bo Derek's female body; Behind the scenes, he has as much talent as Ed Wood has. Striving for mocking sexuality, Dereks lack grace, instant timing and taste. They have a sense of self-parity and abandonment of bravura (they really throw caution to the winds), but after a promising discovery, it all goes to hell. Miles O'Keefe (who may have had marble in his mouth all the time) plays a major role, but plays the third violin with John Derek's ego and Bo Derek's self-worth * from ****
