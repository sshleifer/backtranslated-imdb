Dick Foran and Peggy Moran, who were so good together in the "MALE HAND", return for this very insignificant universal horror. But this time, instead of Wallace Ford as the comedy buddy "Baby," we get the Fuzzy Knight instead of the stupid buddy named Stuff. But the results are not so good, and the level of intimidation is almost zero. <br /> <br /> Dick is a businessman who came up with the idea to start a treasure hunt on a remote island in an old creepy castle. Peggy - one of those who comes for a walk. But in a black cloak and a big hat, known as the "Ghost", there is a tall and thin John Carradine, who himself holds a party in pursuit of a buried state. <br /> <br /> This “ghost” is not very mysterious, and no effort is made to even try to keep the pretty average guy’s face in the shadows to create some kind of tension or eeriness. It's always nice to see the cheerful Moran, but otherwise you can consider it one of the instantly forgotten misfires of Universal.
