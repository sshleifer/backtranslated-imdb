The views of the Earth that this film claims were rigged by NASA were recently compared with historical weather data at the time of Apollo 11, and show a good fit between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records. on this day. <br /> <br /> This may undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the "whole Earth" picture is in fact a small part of the planet, framed by the window of a spacecraft. <br /> <br /> I’m expecting Bart Sibrel to now say that NASA has forged historical weather data, although this would undoubtedly require that they also replace each archived copy of the newspaper with a weather map, and those that were private hands will still be a problem. <br /> <br /> Ah, the answer is: “Attempting to discredit this film, referring to NASA weather data, I would say this is a charming, but weak and credulous argument. How about the rest of the footage and evidence in the film? A wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels. Do you feel that this may refer to what you are trying to do here? :-) This film is simply full of irrefutable evidence against the statement that was once made by the US government that the moon missions were successful and that people are now the true masters of the universe. Things are almost never as they seem. Just watch the movie, and I, dear, say that you will see things a little different than before. <br /> <br /> First, weather data does not come from NASA. This happens in major agencies around the world. Secondly, weather data undermines the main claim in the film. Thirdly, remaining in the "irrefutable evidence", the rest of the claims in the film were completely refuted. a previously secret piece of the film, so he edited it and added his own interpretation. Unfortunately for him, his original film is in the public domain, and the edited fragments of Sibrel contradict his statements.
