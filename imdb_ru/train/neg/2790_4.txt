Julia (Christina Copeland) travels with her husband Stephen Harris (Stephen Man) and their young son Alex to spend a couple of days with her family on Savage Island, her own island. The couple expects to solve their problems on the weekend on a remote island. While waiting for the boat, Julia and Steven meet two strange people in the harbor, and when her brother Peter (Brendan Beizer) arrives, he explains that the squatter family lives on the island. Reckless Peter smokes weed when riding a truck at night and turns off the headlamp to show off; however, he accidentally bumps into Savage's little son, but in the dark he thinks he hit an animal. Later, the Savages family claims Alex as compensation for his lost son. The Young family does not agree to this deal, and they start a deadly war between the families. <br /> <br /> “Island of savages” is a very low-budget film, with a silly script, amateur cinematography, but surprisingly good play. The imperfect story is absolutely absurd, and there are many unbelievable situations. For example, how could two men leave at night two women with a child on the road alone, under the threat of a crazy family? The logical procedure would be the immediate movement to the continent and the involvement of the police to save Peter. Then the young family disappears; Julia and Stephen leave their car on the continent, in their home and friends, and no one is chasing them? Peter calls his sister Julia Alexei when he arrives with the boat at the beginning. There are so many flaws in this film that I could spend a lot of lines on this topic. I believe that this film was filmed on a home video camera, that's why terrible pictures. A good cast deserves the best material to work with. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Ilha de Sangu” (“Blood Island”)
