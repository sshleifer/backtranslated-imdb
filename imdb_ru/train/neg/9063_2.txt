The fact that most of the budget for this was apparently included in the list of super-powerful actors should not matter if it was delivered with talent, imagination and some sympathy for the satirical intent of the original. Instead, we get incredibly bad sequences of songs and dances with the participation of the picturesque beggars and whores, and the final alienation is achieved by rolling back to show that the action took place on the music hall stage, which is enough for a play that looks more like Lionel 'Oliver' Blair than Brecht. The acting talent is shamefully abused: Migenes and Walters are good, but they shouldnâ€™t try their best: Migenes at least has an excellent voice and some feel the material. Julia looks perfect like Mack, but struggles with a submissive character with a fake accent. Harris's Peachum is embarrassedly raised, and Polly is brutal. The adaptations of the lyrics, the script and the music are often awkward: it was a bad move to base the film on the tainted Broadway version of Mark Blitzstein, but at least his words were understandable, unlike most of what was interpolated in gestures of loyalty. And an attempt to overcome a small budget by filming under claustrophobic angles on the fog-wrapped film sets filled with bright blue and orange, as if Vittorio Storaro completely failed the basement of the deal - the film just looks cheap, crappy and thoughtless. Ugliness.
