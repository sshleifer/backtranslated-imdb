From this line begins one stupid, boring British sci-fi film. The great Vorelli from the movie “Devil's Doll” builds a teleportation machine only to cut off his financing by Blanchard, a bearded man who loves bow ties and men with big eyebrows. When his experiment fails, the good doctor finds out that Lembach, the man who controls all the grants in the world, will remain in London for a few days. He is trying to project himself into the Blanchard house with the help of his pleasant laboratory assistant Sheila. Needless to say, something goes wrong and it turns out to be like a rat. The rest of the film is about a good orange-haired doctor walking around London, shocking people with his mutated hand and putting a diaper on his face. There are a few more murders, humble paperwork, and finally, the doctor disappears where doctors have ever met with rats. Fortunately, no one decided to make a sequel.
