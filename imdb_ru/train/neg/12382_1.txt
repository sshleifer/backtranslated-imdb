Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn would have flipped over in their graves if they knew that this book “Guess Who Will Come to Dinner” was in cinemas. Together with Sydney Poitier and Catherine Houghton, these four brilliant actors made a great cultural contribution to the 1967 masterpiece of director Stanley Kramer. This present day is a joke. Thus, a white guy from an overly stereotypical Italian family in Rhode Island brings his African American girlfriend home (insert GASP here) at his grandfather's funeral. The reaction of his family members was, of course ... predictable. This film was so painfully telegraphed from start to finish that my girlfriend actually started a fake snore to give me a signal that she wanted to leave. Do yourself a favor and rent the original. Make a Wake badge.
