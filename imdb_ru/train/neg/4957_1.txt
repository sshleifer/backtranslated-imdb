I can't believe that some people really like it. Still, they still call themselves Batman fans. Even going so far as to say that this is better than BTAS. It is not so. For them, it must be plagiarized to use the name of Batman for this piece of shit. This is not Batman. <br /> <br /> The whole premise of the show: “If you can't beat someone, get more weapons to help you.” He uses his battery and capture hook and Batmobile, that's all. He does not invent any new ingenious technology every time when he cannot win someone. I don't know where the hell they got the idea for batbot. or whatever. They destroyed all the villains. Mr. Freese has turned from a sympathetic scientist into a petty criminal who has fallen into some kind of crying frosting. Catwoman is currently a 40 or 50 year old woman with a dumb suit. The penguin is now a ninja with a 50 foot cylinder. Ventriloquist is now called Scarface, which makes Dummy the central element of the character. They even had a stupid idea to make him a giant! WTF? and the two worst character changes are Joker and Riddler. they turned Riddler into a gothic / retro-ugly teenager. and the Joker to the acrobat with fears. He looks like a bob marley, wannabe. they completely and completely destroyed Batman even more than B & R! I would like to meet the creators and / or authors and animators of this show so that I can hit them on the head with a metal baseball bat.
