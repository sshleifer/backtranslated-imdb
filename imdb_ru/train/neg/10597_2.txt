This film was absolutely terrible. I can't think of one thing well about it. The openings of the plot were so large that it was possible to pass through the Hummer through them. The acting was so terrible that even Jean Claude should be ashamed, and that says a lot !!! And dialogue, what dialogue ??? To think that I was a fan of the first (I use this comment loosely, it’s more like feeling guilty than anything else). In this film was Goldberg because of a loud scream !!!! Nothing good comes out of this movie. What makes this movie worse is that it’s so bad that you can't even watch it with a bunch of friends to make fun of !!! That should be in my top five worst films of all time. 2/10, because it's so hard for me to give 1.
