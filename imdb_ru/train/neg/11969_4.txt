If you like to have fun, do not go watch this movie. If you like to watch the war heroes, do not go watch this movie. If you like to see a good game and a great script, do not watch this movie. If you like typical Hollywood war films that end just in time to call on the public to make a political call for greatness and glory for war, GO TO SEE THIS FILM I am always interested in war films, because I think that if they are made well, they can teach us something about the paradoxical and useless qualities of war. This film shows a group of guys running around the countryside, making terrible cliches, doing the most predictable things and protecting the oppressed with the same force and cruelty as the oppressed. This film is a shame for the film industry and for the United States of America! Can you imagine yourself as a person from Europe, Africa or any other country who watches this when he is told that Americans really are? No wonder everyone hates us! Please, please, please, don't waste your time on this piece of garbage; if necessary, wait and rent. 4/10
