I saw the film only recently, although it appeared in 2001. I was hoping to see an entertaining film, but let me tell you, Princess Blade is nothing compared to Azumi. The "princess" is not very talkative, as you probably noticed ... She reminded me of Jean-Claude Van Damme, who only looked to express her point of view, and then knocked the shit out of her opponents. Throughout the film, I waited at least for the recognition that she liked, why she fought, whom she loved and trusted. I waited in vain. Shoddy movie. Cheesy dialogue. Do not watch it if you do not want to be bored in your mind! It is so bad that in the end I wondered how I managed not to scream from frustration for an hour and a half. About. I give 4/10.
