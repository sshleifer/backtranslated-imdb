A three-part horror film with some guy in a boarded-up house who begs the viewer not to go "there" and (unfortunately) gives us three stories to prove the reason. <br /> <br /> The first story tells of a young couple in a car accident who meet with two psychos. This leads to two completely predictable turns. However, it is fast (about 15 minutes), cruel, well acted and well done. Predictable, but enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The second is a man on the run after stealing a lot of money. His car broke down, a dog attacked him and fell into the nearest clinic. VERY obvious, poorly done and very slow. Even 30 minutes is too long. Good game though. <br /> <br /> The third is just a horrible story. A beautiful, single woman who is looking for Mr. Wright is participating in it. He has beautiful scenery, nice erotica and nice sex scene. But (again) predictable and not even scary. <br /> <br /> It all ends very stupid. <br /> <br /> In general, the first is worth a look, but that's all. Tune in to it, then turn it off.
