Since I loved the original “Caligula” even with all its flaws, I have to say that this trailer remake was terrible. <br /> <br /> Listening to how Jovovich speaks with such a lazy American accent, “Mmm, cuhligyooluh ...” makes me ill. The plot is not at all like a Roman ... it looks like the backyard of a Hollywood mansion of a rich actor, and the Roman ones Costumes look like cheap crap that you buy in a commuter costume store. <br /> <br /> This “charming” Adriana Asti looks like a fifty-year-old Latin American woman, completely frightened to the core, as if not knowing that this is a movie trailer. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst thing I've ever seen, with most of the lines, I hear random actors shout "CALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!" as loud and annoyingly annoying as they can be. <br /> <br /> Random sex scenes also filled a good 40 or 50% of the trailer, and scenes with famous actors / actresses such as Gerard Butler (who adorns the screen in the shade for all three and a half seconds) without doing anything but it looks uncomfortable or struggling with minimal lines, just dragging them with the absurdity of their delivery. <br /> <br /> Courtney Love's part is that she looks like her usual dirty whore, leaning against a door, mumbling about the moon or something like that. You can't say, because she's either drunk, or tall, or just mumbles idly. <br /> <br /> Karen Black is just annoying ... he laughs randomly and screams in a way that annoys you. <br /> Helen Mirren ... she was original, and her return to Caligula consists of ... "CHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" I especially "love" (and by love I mean hate) the line of Ennia: "Kaligola ... j00 no maki me * something inconsistent * .... * something that sounds like j00nalo *" This is also insanely arrogant to say four Caligula. The year of government was more than the birth and death of Jesus. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this is the worst, most exploited, self-confident arrogant piece of shit, labeled as “art”, which I have ever seen. Even if Gore Vidal hated the original Caligula, he should not have appeared or given his name for this pile of shit, no matter how much he was paid (if it was not a billion trillion yen). The worst trailer ever.
