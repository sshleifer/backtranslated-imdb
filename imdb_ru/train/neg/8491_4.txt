Despite some sometimes original touches, such as “virtual scenery” that provide the backdrop for Victorian interiors featuring Ada Lovelace and her entourage, this film fails and ultimately disappoints. Newcomer Francesca Faridani seems talented, but she was wasted on Emmy, a character who by the middle of the film is reduced to just looking at the monitor, watching Lady Ada tell her autobiography. The Conception of Ada soars briefly when the Lady of Hell appears (Tilda Swinton); the camera delays the expression of her face, her manner, even making her appear translucent or momentarily invisible, adding scenes to the drama of the “virtual” presentation of her Emmy. <br /> <br /> Ada Lovelace’s direct biography was worth it, but unfortunately this film tells both about the life of Lady Ada and the life of a modern computer scientist (and her widely painted, abnormal guy).
