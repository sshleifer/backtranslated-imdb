I will keep it short; Thanks to Greg for helping me express it briefly: “Captive” is a guy who drinks a girl, drinks, puts in prison and tortures her, and then pretends to be a prisoner to have sex with her. This is the only twist of the film. This is torture, like rape in slow motion. And this is not even a good movie. This is not so bad, this is good; it's just bad. <br /> <br /> It should also be mentioned that among the critics there is a “spoiler code”, which they dare not crack, even if some were tempted by it, because it is so mean. Why NO ONE could come up with the koyons to say: “This is rubbish, and here is why” - behind me. <br /> <br /> Don't give money to these merchants.
