This is the third parody of scary movies and hopefully the last one. This time, the fake is mostly on the Ring, Signs and 8 miles for some strange reason. In my opinion, this film was very meaningless, unnecessary and not even funny. I laughed, maybe three times, and that's not enough for a comedy. I really enjoyed the first two, but this one was just dumb. If your jokes consist of beating up corpses and people who are constantly being thrown at each other, then this film is for you. In my opinion, if you are smart enough, stay at home and save your money and please stop making such films, they will only get worse.
