This is one of the few episodes (if not the only one) with an undeniable error in its storytelling. Handling the situation with Ralfi, Christopher states that he heard about Pie-O-My's death during a fire. This is an important detail, because in this context it is completely obvious that Christopher knows from the very beginning that it was Tony who had to kill Ralfi. However, Chris could not hear about the accident. Who should have told him and when? By the time he was torn out of his delirium by a call from Tony, no one else was informed. Tony knows this - which makes him worse! Therefore, Christopher's rumor about the death of Pie-O-My can lead Tony to the conclusion that Chris himself set fire to the fire. Given the impressively complex writing process, as the authors themselves said on the DVD, I am really surprised that none of them realized the problem there. The story just does not work. There is no need to add that I am a big fan of soprano. Otherwise, I really would not care.
