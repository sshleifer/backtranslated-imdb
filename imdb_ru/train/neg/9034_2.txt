The story is a bit slow and a bit silly. Greta Garbo doesn’t look very good, and I couldn’t understand half of what she said because of her accent, which was exaggerated for this role. Meanwhile, Melvin Douglas plays his usual unlikely role, and Constance Bennett is just like that, with the exception of a few of her screams, which were funny. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Roland Young played a better role in the film. I wish he had more lines, since he disappeared in the second half of the story. It was also interesting to see how Ruth Gordon looks so young. I only saw her in those crazy roles that she played from the late 60s to the 80s, and in a frantic old woman. In the story, the best part could have been in the last few minutes, when we see a trick doing amazing things on skis, pretending to be Douglas falling from the slopes. These were amazing and humorous shots. <br /> <br /> In general, I see where this film - the last Garbo - was not a box office success. It just pulls too much, continuing and continuing to deceive. This is an annoying story. Garbo also knew this and said he was leaving.
