What is it? It is a mixture of bizarre repetitive motifs (among other things, snails, Shirley Temple, swastikas and obviously racist music) that are not related to any narrative, plot or development of character. unusual casting decisions. It looks like a bad acid trip, far beyond any level of drug use that can be attributed to Hunter S. Thompson or William S. Burroughs. The only film with which I can compare is Eraserhead (my second most popular film of all time), which was intentionally much more depressing, but I still found “What is this?” A complete waste of my time. It's one thing to look at the inner workings of someone else's mind — even at someone’s chemically altered consciousness — but quite another — just throwing strange visual effects at me just for the sake of strangeness.
