This film is a complete dog. I tensed, trying to find something to laugh at, just to not feel that I wasted my money and my time. The recording in this film is absolutely terrible. It is a pity that this does not meet the standards of other films of Hale Storm. <br /> <br /> They had to save money on attracting actors from the D-list, such as Fred Willard and Gary Coleman, and spend money to work on the script as long as he was right. Even Gary Coleman was not properly used for his role. <br /> <br /> This film makes you wonder what is the point of most of the plots, including the plots. After watching this film, I got the impression that the producers were hoping to capture some Napoleonic dynamite-like humor, where not so much the plot as the character and delivery. Unfortunately, this film is not able to convey strings, characters, delivery or humor. I should have gone to the dentist instead!
