The film, so unsafe, the creators may have hoped to milk the original title of the film “noir classic”, “Goodbye, my beauty”, thinking that the gullible would accept it as a remake. Characters are so disgusting and unattractive that they deserve their cold reception when they are first released. Time only adds to its absurdity. Having no cunning, no cinematography, no despair, no despair of classical noir, instead, he relied on an intricate and meaningless criminal conspiracy, which could easily lead to several arrests in a few hours. As if this was not enough, it led to a completely sexless erotic attempt, in which at least one of the participants did not bother to bathe for several days. It only made this mess even more painful to observe. Find a good classic film of the forties or fifties noir instead of spending two hours on this setback.
