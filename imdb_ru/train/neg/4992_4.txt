This film is just another medium action movie, but it could have been much better. When the weapon came out, they really needed help in choreography. Someone, for example, Andy McNabb, who committed this brilliant sequence of actions in The Heat, when they were walking up the street from a robbery, would turn the boring sequences of actions into something special. Because the rest of the movie was fine - predictable, but watchable - better than you expect from this type of movie. Then came the final scene, the show, what we were waiting for, but it was like watching something from the A-Team in the 80s. They shoot wildly, do not hit anything, and run around the house, trying to kill each other - the same old, same old.
