Of the ten actors who portrayed Philo Vance in the series, Edmund Lowe seemed the most representative, but in this scenario, the audience is far ahead of the famous detective story. In the end, when jockey Douglas Walton is staring blankly into space, obviously hypnotized, and says something like: “I have to go and be killed,” I felt it was stupid that no one picked him up after he was killed . Police thought it was suicide because he said he would do it! After the hated horse owner Gene Lockhart was shot, Frida Inescourt does the same thing, saying that she is being killed and then lethally jumps off the bus. I laughed when Lowe finally shouted "I understood," as if it was a revelation. The guilty side, however, was cleverly hidden, and considerable uncertainty arose when this party began to hypnotize Low to make him jump off the roof.
