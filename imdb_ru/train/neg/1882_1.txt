What a terrible piece of trash !!! Who are all these people who shout about how good it is? Yes, this is "art"; and yes, it is a "stranger", but .... this is not enough. The plot is boring and scattered, similar to a reality show, but not so cunning. <br /> <br /> People are essentially not interested; but as characters they do not have enough depth to feel sympathy for them. If they are based on real people, then I am very, very sorry for them. <br /> <br /> Violence (and sometimes very cruel) seems rather ostentatious and unfounded. As if the producer had a vision of Quenton Tarantino. Not that I thought very much about him either. <br /> <br /> And yes, if I had such neighbors, I would move!
