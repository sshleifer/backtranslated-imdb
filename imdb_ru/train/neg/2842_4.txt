I am delighted! Wow, get ready to be hit by supernatural ninja paths. Watch them pounce, crawl on the ground (on the back or stomach), like a caterpillar, fly across the sky, climb buildings, hide and jump from trees, throw ninja stars, play blue cheering mats, disappear into smoke bombs, make loud noises with your blades and sneak on your toes What a view! In fact, I could talk about many traditional events, but I will be here all day. Oh, do not forget that we even jump out of the legendary Chuck Connors from time to time and watch how he easily sends a few ninjas with his shotgun. Which class! What the hell! In any case, the ultra-cheap “Sakura Killers” is a stupid, but stupid, fascinating ninja exercise in which only fanatics of this genre can learn something from this dark fiasco of class “b”. <br /> <br /> The Genetic Laboratory in America is a very important video stolen by a pair of ninjas. Two Americans sent to Japan by Colonel (Chuck Connors) to receive him. <br /> <br /> Opening the function perfectly adjusts it. Get ready for a laugh! After that, he slows down, but soon after the two main characters learn about the ninja and are trained, he gains momentum when they break down in costumes and run after a stolen beta tape, which contains a very important formula. This is when really fast action and aerobic martial arts really come into play. This is not too cheesy, (like an idiotic script and stupid ideas). The final climatic clash is very well done. <br /> <br /> In slower periods, two Americans (Mike Kelly and George Nicholas) deal with the case, exchange brainless conversations and face some minor problems. What made me laugh was how the ninjas were pushed aside by how brave and intelligent these two were. Should these be professional killers? Directed by Dusty Nelson (“Effects (1989)”) works seriously with what he has and plays for what he has. He focuses on screen activities around striking Taiwanese locations. The score is an elegant arrangement.
