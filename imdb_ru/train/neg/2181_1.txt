I saw this movie, thinking it would be one of those old B films that are fun to watch. I was so wrong! This film was boring and clearly designed for men who love to look at obese women. The story was so ridiculous and implausible that it completely lost my interest. It seemed that he was in the same genre as the Ed Wood films - the bottom of the barrel.
