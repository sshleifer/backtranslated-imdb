Well, the film is good, but I give it one, because the idea of ​​turning a computer virus into an organic virus is a pure fairy tale. Such nonsense simply adds to the paranoid delusions of an inexperienced idiotic jerk that a computer virus is exactly like an organic virus. First of all, lines of code and dozens of ones and zeros add up to a computer virus. The organic virus is much more complicated, although it is cooler. Although it is considered one of the simplest forms in the universe, organic virus attaches to your cells and attaches to RNA, and then changes its own RNA code. Explain to me how something like this can be processed from the monitor? Maybe radiation affects the user's cornea, which turns your eyeballs into these viruses? I could see it, but obviously the writer did not think about it.
