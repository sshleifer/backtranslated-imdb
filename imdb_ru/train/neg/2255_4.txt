Was this movie stupid? Yeah. Does this movie have a depth? Nope Character development? Nope Is the plot spinning? Nope It was just a movie about the fantastic show Springer. It shows the lengths that some people will go to get their mugs on TV. Molly Hagan did a great job with Jaime Pressly's mom. Jaime is ... well ... Great! This film was not created to become a “breakthrough” film, rather, it was intended to live in a trailer park (I live in a trailer park, and ours does not look like the one in this film), where everyone sleeps with everyone else, all the girls get pregnant from different guys, and all the guys drive the rusty Ford pickups of 66th year (of course, exaggeration, but this is a picture that everyone sees when you mention "trailer park"). Some people overestimate movies (example: Star Trek freaks). I watch movies exclusively for fun; not to mention the fact that the girl is wearing a different shirt in a different scene (read a little “stupidity” about Connie’s shirt. Could it have been better? Of course. But it was damn ridiculous.
