This may sound crazy even for people who remember this show ... But I remembered it as a live action. I don't think I've ever seen a cartoon. but the movie? may be. I remember it very clearly. The guy was in a building like an exhibition hall. He even had a red jacket. It was dark and he turned into a red car, and on the second level was a guy who looked down on him. The car / guy turned around and crashed into a large window like an exhibition hall and went outside. And then he continued to drive away. That is all I remember. I really hope someone else remembers this too. If not, maybe I'm still crazy. But I hope not.
