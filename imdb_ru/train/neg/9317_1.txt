I bought it from Blockbuster for 99p. The guy at the counter said it was so cheap because the disc was scratched, but did not mention that the reason was that it was so cheap because the film was a bad effort that sucked harder than Paris Hilton in the hotel room home video . Speaking of home videos, since when it was a fair game to release them in the form of films - I mean, films were used to attract actors, technicians, screenwriters, etc. - no more than that - just collect your friends and crazy ideas together for the weekend, waste production with a budget of 8.00 pounds and ask someone to fall from the stairs with the Casio keyboard (soundtrack), and then slap it on the shelves so that some poor person (I) can go home alone despair . But the crucial point - I quickly went through most of this and threw it in one direction, ready for the hammers ... until the next night, watching the horror of Darna Day "Hell Rock" (1.99 pounds to take home and keep from another blockbuster). Now this movie made 'Grim Weekend' look like The Exorcist, so I turned on Grim Weekend again to deal with some of the points listed on the wonderful IMDb boards that the audience claimed were fun. Of course, as soon as I managed to endure the suffering, pain, and horror from the realization that Grim Weekend was a toast, I could enjoy, enjoy, and start doing funny things. And this is a lot. Check the boards. Then check click. Hell, it might even be worth it. AWWWWW CRAP!
