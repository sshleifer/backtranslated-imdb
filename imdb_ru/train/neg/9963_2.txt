I love Alec Guinness. And it says a lot after this movie. In fact, he is not bad at this. It seems that he just stands aside, be polite and familiar to yourself, but invest nada. It is obvious that the girl with whom he combines is a featherweight, even an inexperienced young French girl. Sir Alec would not have chosen her when he was young, and obviously now is not too happy about it. <br /> <br /> An interesting character is the brooding brother of the strange "Suzanne", another idiot. "Donald" seeks to become a French Heathcliff, and I waited in vain for the source of his secret. What deep dark secret did he hide behind this forehead? Was he in love with his mistress? Why did he pull Suzanne by the hair when she planned to collect the scattered parts of this turkey in the estate? Or perhaps he was just tired of her disgusting action. <br /> <br /> The film would be charming if Guinness and the “elderly woman” remembered and saw Paris together. That would be a great story! Two beautiful experienced people in a beautiful city after the destruction of World War II. Why no one came up with this? I propose to watch Alec Guinness in "Map", a little-known, but worthy film.
