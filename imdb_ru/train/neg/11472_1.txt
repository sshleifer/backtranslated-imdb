Everything about this movie was terrible. For starters, this film had a pretty good cast, and I find it impossible to make such a great cast as the biggest disaster for the gangster movie genre. The sound track was like one of a very bad slap comedy. He had this music throughout the entire movie, and he began to get pretty annoying. <br /> <br /> PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT AFFECT YOURSELF WITH THIS POVERTY, YOU WILL ONLY BE PAINFUL
