I did not expect much from this film, but boy, I did not expect the film to be so bad. Chris Rock doesn't show a good act here, you can't feel that his character is real, I think the film would be a little better if drama or romantic scenes were a smaller part of the film and more / better humor was involved. The film is similar to how the filmmakers had a bad hangover. When "creating" they do not show a single smile. This is a very bad movie! I gave it three out of ten because of the few smiles it gave me, but I never laughed!
