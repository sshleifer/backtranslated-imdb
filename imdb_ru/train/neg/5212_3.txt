I unknowingly kept this film on my shelf in the Mill Creek collection for some time, and one evening I just decided to watch it; although not expecting much. When the credits begin, I am surprised to discover that this film was filmed at Filmirage. Filmirage brought such amazing abominations to the world as Troll 2, Ator Invincible, and Quest for the Mighty Sword, so I had to look. <br /> <br /> When the film began, he had the potential to be quite decent, although it was not original. The bloody scenes could be improved if they were expanded and more frequent. But after a while in the film, the pace began to slow down, and I thought: “Okay, better kill someone sooner” or “Someone mutates better”. At the beginning of this inhibition, when I had these thoughts, although someone might have been killed or mutated, however, as noted, the blood and effects were not very good. Worst of all, the transitions between scenes were confusing; example: first Dr. Houseman was at the zoo, then he remembered that he could kill someone, and finally woke up in a cold sweat in bed, forcing the audience to ask: "He dreamed that he was in the zoo?". Like in the movies, these the scene transitions got worse and worse. <br /> <br /> I can say that Dr. Hausman’s character development was pretty good, but near the end of the film, that is, after we saw what the Doctor turned into, I hope you will laugh - what really is the only reason why this film at least one h; this film inadvertently sounds like a wordy joke. <br /> <br /> The costume of Mr. Dr. Houseman can also be seen in The Search for the Mighty Sword by Joe D'Amato, which was made the same year. You have to love Filmirage movies, they always use the same things!
