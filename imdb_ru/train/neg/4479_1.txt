I'll be honest, this is one of the worst movies ever. If not, it is VERY close. Ever seen a bad teen soap opera. Well, it's like one of those. Except the worst. For example: (SPOILER IS POSSIBLE) girl: I want to go somewhere else. <br /> <br /> guy: all we need is here. <br /> <br /> girl: but I want to take myself to another place. <br /> Boyfriend: I will take you to another place. <br /> <br /> ... After going through this line, they have sex. Music is bad pop music and bad punk rock. If you've ever read a book, avoid this movie like the plague. They completely change the personality of the characters and events. In addition, they just get rid of things. In addition, the film ends approximately before the book ends. This is a terrible movie. So, if you have not read the book, do not look at it. If you READ a book, burn it (film). If you like silly teenage soap operas that are of lower quality than the usual low-quality soap opera, do it. Again, is it worth waiting for something different from MTV?
