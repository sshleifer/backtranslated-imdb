This film has little to recommend, although due to the breathtaking scenery, cinematography and wildlife, it is difficult to pinpoint our weaknesses in the company of such enthusiastic reviews. However, it is these things that make the lack of a satisfactory plot and its execution so disappointing. <br /> <br /> I looked at this with my children, and none of us was too impressed with the end. Yes, the pictures were magnificent, the wide landscapes through the forest and the mountains were magnificent, but what was happening in the foreground? A rather boring story about the stupidity of a tasteless girl who too slowly learns a very simple lesson about how to make friends with wildlife - and easily copes with this story. This, of course, is not a new story, in fact there is nothing remotely new in the way it is told, and we all saw it before, and, indeed, much more eloquently than Antoine de Saint-Exupery. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really needs to be learned from this film is the feeling of how to work with these wonderful lenses and forest lighting; the rest is a waste of time.
