The directorial version I saw was very long for this type of film. Almost two hours is too long. If you have a choice, definitely choose directors who are not directors. <br /> <br /> The main plot is practically not involved, the film consists of the main part of several murder scenes, which are connected, but the Feeling that they are shown only in order to fill the film with brutal violence. The connection is not revealed until the last part and the lack of context have bored me long before my appearance. <br /> <br /> Like a horror movie, it doesn't work. You will never get the desired feeling for the characters because of mediocre play and general location (character is represented, after 15 minutes the character is dead). This picture forte lies in the spray.
