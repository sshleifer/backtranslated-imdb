In many films that I have seen of Warren Oates, I came to a definite conclusion, here’s one talented person. I first saw Mr. Oates on a 1960s television series called Stony Burke. Since then, I have closely followed his career and felt that excellent roles await him. This happened in 1974, when Sam Peckinpah gave him the highest rating in a film titled “Bring me Alfredo Garcia’s Head”. Of course, his biggest claim to fame was his magnificent role in The Wild Bunch. I always thought that he was quite capable of bringing any character to any character, until I saw him on this flop. The film is called "Chandler", a tribute to the detectives of the 1950s, created by Raymond Chandler. Because in the synopsis it is said that it is a private nose, Private Eye, I immediately became interested. However, I patiently sat through the entire film and found it to be a boring, uninteresting, slow, intricate, intricate saga, which, if it had a theme or plot, was to remain in some dark back room. Combined, and with some of the best Hollywood stars such as Alex Dreyer, Mitch Ryan, Gordon Pinsent, Charles McGraw, Richard Lou and Scatman Crothers, this film had enough strength to reach Mach five, however, it crashed on the launch panel and did not where. As a result, one of my favorite actors was stuck in a poorly made vehicle that never got off the ground. **
