This film has such an inexorable cheapness in class B that it makes you think that they spent 80% of their budget on Connery. This is like watching some of the Wing Commander material after Star Wars (completely separate from the content). <br /> <br /> History can be described in one word: FLAT. And, my God, I can not remember such an uninteresting villain for a long time. We are not informed of the reason for which he is so angry (a congenital defect that we tend to think :), or of true conviction or inclination towards his evil. <br /> <br /> If you are traveling to Connery, better go rent a Hunting Forrester.
