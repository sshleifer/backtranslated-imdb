This intentional strange adaptation of the Borges story is typical of Cox. Its strong visual meaning, as usual, is negated by the terrifying half-baked play of most actors. The film is definitely in the surrealistic tradition of the Bunuel Mexican period, and from time to time it looks like the poor man’s view on the Elements of Crime by Lars von Trier. Cox’s obvious preference for single takes, jumps and surround sound recordings all work against the effectiveness of the film. Worth seeing, but ultimately disappointing.
