I'm a big fan of movies. I like movies of all types. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I realized that he was closely following the book, which raises the question that not everything should be turned into a film. Especially since the authenticity of the experiences in the book has been repeatedly questioned. <br /> <br /> These characters are not strange, but mentally ill. The things that are happening are not funny, they bother; especially given that they must be true. <br /> <br /> This film resembled “Royal Tenenbaums”, another film that I hated, only “Running with Scissors” was even more ineffective and less funny. <br /> /> I will never return this watch. I wanted to wash my face after watching.
