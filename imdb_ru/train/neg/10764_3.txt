I pay tribute to writer / director William Govu for finding someone to finance this ill-conceived thriller. A good argument for not spending money on an HBO subscription, not to mention buying DVDs based on covers and promotional materials. Pedestrian Dennis Hopper and Richard Greco's game do not add anything significant to their resume, although the artistic direction is not half bad. The dialogue will leave you grimacing in surprise at his vanity; this is storytelling at worst. There is no tension, no expectation, no fear, no fear, no sympathy, no catharsis, nothing. A few attractive and often naked women liven up the boredom, but this film is definitely best seen as a trailer. I'm sorry for the guy who set this thing on fire. Suitable for late night viewing. You have been warned.
