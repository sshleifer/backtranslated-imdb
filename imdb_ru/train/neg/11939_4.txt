Let me tell you something about this movie. I saw it twice. The first time I was a kid, and the film was quite interesting for me. I really liked it. I thought it was fun and interesting, and the main character was pretty cool. <br /> <br /> I saw it again a few days ago. It was terrible. Indeed. I don’t know why I thought it was funny before, but now ... I didn’t laugh at all. There was nothing even a little interesting. It was just stupid. The story was weak. The game was nothing special. There are great actors in this movie, but, nevertheless, acting is mediocre at best. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, this film is racist. Indeed. Don't get me wrong, I usually don't complain about racism in the movies. However, I saw people complaining about the absence of blacks in films such as Shaolin Temple, or the fact that the only black man in The Street Fighter is one of the bad guys or ... Whatever, you get the point. People see racism everywhere. I wonder how they would react to a film like "Meteor Man"? What for? I'll tell you why. There are no Asians in this movie. There are no white people among the good guys. In fact, there is only one white guy in the whole film, and he is the leader of the bad guys. All the good guys are African Americans. Don't get me wrong, I don't care if the good guy is black, white, yellow, pink or green ... I’m worried about the fact that we can barely see a white man in this film. This is the only film I've ever seen. This is just unreal. If there is only one black person in a Japanese film, as in the case of Street Fighter, then there are no problems — in Japan, most people are Asians. But if there is only one white person in an American film, then a problem arises - in the USA most people are white. It's like shooting a Japanese film with all-white actors and one Asian as the bad guy. Just not real. <br /> <br /> That's it. I give the film 4/10. It would be 1/10 if I had not had fun with him in childhood.
