Firstly, there is something good about this film, but all these are minor features in conjunction with a teen movie. In the commercials of this film, which I saw, a lot of attention was paid to the fact that Denise Richards is in it, but she is a bad actress and not as good as people trying to see it has anything to do with the film). And what does she give to everyone with this look? Perhaps this is part of the character, but, as I said, the acting ... However, the script is fine. You know who it is throughout the entire film, and you can almost predict what is going to happen, but not in an annoying way. I think that the book on which it is based is probably good, judging by the storyline, but the next time I read the book to find out, and not watch it.
