Pay attention to all the mad scientists everywhere: if you are going to turn your son into a genetically mutated monster, you need to give him a more terrible name than “Sex”. I don't care if he is a scary hammerhead shark with a sip of sharp daggers and the ability to ambush people both in water and on land. Give your child a better name, such as Thor, Rock, or Tiburon. Because even if he eats me, I’ll probably just sit there and laugh: “Ha! Get a load of it! Paul Monster ripped me to shreds !!!!! ”This is the worst part of this film, this shark is called“ Paul ”throughout the film. It does what could be a decent, scary horror movie, it just seems silly. Not that there were no other fanciful and contrived parts of the “Hammerhead”. Scientists spend the whole movie wandering around this island, and suddenly one of the girls begins to itch madly while walking through a dense forest, and just MUST water her legs with water to survive the itch, which of course allows “Paul” to get out of the water and kill her The only thing that the SciFI Channel did correctly in this film is to let the beauty live, but this is a small silver lining in a disappointing movie.
