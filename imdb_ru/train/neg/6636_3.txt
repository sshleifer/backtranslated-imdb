Some of the worst, least natural acting performances I've ever seen. This is perhaps not surprising, given the awkward, awkward dialogue given to characters from one note. Add to this the cheap production cost, and you have a film that doesn't even seem to belong to television. No one expects much from the movie "Lifetime", especially so old, but this is almost imperceptibly bad. <br /> <br /> In the story, this is a terrible, clich√©d romance, which even the Harlequin could see under them. Surprise, the only female character who receives any trick and a mysterious stranger ends up falling in love.
