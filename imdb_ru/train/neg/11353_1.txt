Today I visited the Athenean cinema with two children (6 and 8 years old), paid 3 x 12 euros (about $ 45), not to mention gas, popcorn and soda, I was asked to return my 3d special glasses after leaving the theater and was "Forced" to see what could be an excellent masterpiece in a 3D film, but it turned out that it was just a sick propaganda film, similar to the Cold War, which I had not seen in the last 20 years ... BE A FILM FOR CHILDREN .. NAME OF HEAVEN! <br /> <br /> PS 1: the average working Greek earns no more than 850 euros per month (approximately $ 1050) <br /> <br /> PS 2 My children liked it ... but again, they are no more than babies> in Greek: mora, assholes> as the one who wrote the script, and others who did this "3d shame". <br /> <br /> PS 3 3D animation is fantastic, but that gives ....!
