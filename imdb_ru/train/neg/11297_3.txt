Jenny Neumann (from the film “MISTRESS OF THE APES”, American slasher HELL NIGHT, etc.) - American actress Helen Selleck, who won the main role in the Australian stage performance. She is a virgin because, being a little girl, she saw her mother having sex and then accidentally caused a car accident that killed her. Meanwhile, the killer in black gloves is wandering around the theater, beating people with shards of glass. <br /> <br /> *** THE BASIC SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> The killer is obviously Helen (she speaks with the voice of her dead mother, after the murder she washes away the blood from her hands and, like a little girl, kills seducer child with a broken bottle!), but this is a gratuitous heavy camera for POV and hides the identity of the killer to the very end, as if it should be some big surprise. <br /> <br /> The whole cast seems to be obsessed with talking about sex, or trying to have sex, and, in one case, even blackmailing them to get laid. There are quite a lot of nude nature and blood, but there is no point in continuity, the photo is muddy and editing (Colin Egglston, who also wrote the script and produced) is terrible. A theatrical production for a slasher film precedes Soavi's film with the same name and OPERA Argento (both of which are better than this one) by five years, and Neumann is quite hot.
