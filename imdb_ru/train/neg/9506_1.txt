Oh yeah, VS series, MVC2 - top. As already mentioned, this is what you get when half the team fell asleep at work, unfortunately, half of the gameplay did it. Don't get me wrong, it's fun, but you're tired of mashed potatoes. As for the plot summary, AHAHAHAHAHAAAAA ... There is no plot. Beat this guy at the end and win! Yes, who plays it on their own?
