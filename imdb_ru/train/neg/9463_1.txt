Vile, humiliating and directly humiliating adaptation to the classic children's fairy tale is not only devoid of the charm of its forefather, but also devoid of any talent. Mike Myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his terrible performance, which is a clear undermining of what Jim Carrey did, but he must refuse to play together. He is so annoying that you want to beat the crap out of him if you can jump right in the movie. The sets are ugly and the cinema is very bad. I have seen a lot of bad movies this year, but this is not only exciting, but also undoubtedly the worst movie ever made.
