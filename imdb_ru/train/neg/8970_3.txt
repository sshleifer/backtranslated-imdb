The first Cube film was a feature film. This created a world in which all the major archetypes of humanity were represented, and showed how they struggled to understand a hostile world that they could not understand. It was, on a non-literal level, the conspiracy “man against a cruel nature”, in which an individual, who represented innocence and kindness, eventually won to appear before a new, indefinable world beyond the limits of petty quarrels; a world in which there was no more struggle but peace. I rated Cube as 10 out of 10, and this is a film that should never have been continued. <br /> <br /> The second film, "Hypercube", caused great disappointment. Some of the ideas were pretty cool, but in the context of the original film, both the plot and the situation did not make sense and did not make sense. Nevertheless, because I was quite interesting, I rated it as 5 out of 10. <br /> <br /> The third film, “Cubic Zero”, ignoring the second one, plays as strongly inferior to the B-film commercial first film, without symbolism. There is no “tribute” or “tribute” here; there is only a rip off. The same type of plot, with some elements, is idiotically modified (for example, the presence of letters instead of prime numbers between cubes - an idea that is more clear than anything else shows that it is plagiarism without any originality and nothing to say). br /> <br /> The fact that we see something “from behind the scenes” does not mean anything, because observers are only part of a big bad experiment, about the architects of which we hear nothing. And in this film, those who get to the exit (as Kazan did at the end of the first film) are simply killed - where is the point in this? This is just stupid. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​and acting in Cube Zero are not so bad, but the story and ideas are so completely devoid of inspiration that this film can only get a rating of 3 out of 10 from me.
