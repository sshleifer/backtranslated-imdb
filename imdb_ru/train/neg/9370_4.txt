Although this is not a “great movie,” it has something compelling and memorable. Like another movie commentator, I saw it in childhood. Thirty-three years have passed since 1952, but I have never forgotten a story or its ridiculously bulky name. See if you have the opportunity. You will feel like a voyeur of the life of a small city, as it has evolved over the decades. This film, more than any other film, brings a human face into the historical drama of the beginning of the 20th century, Progress. It is attractive for a young viewer and memorable enough for an older one. In addition, characters can easily be liked and watched as they pass through time.
