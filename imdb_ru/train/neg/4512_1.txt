Having lived in Japan for several years, this film does not reflect Japanese culture and does not even closely explain what a geisha is. Unfortunately, a great opportunity has been missed to bring Japanese culture closer to a wide western audience and help demystify the country from which Zen, the samurai, and the world of Kyoto geishas originate. Some of the hottest moments of the film are when Americans are shown in a Japanese setting. Geisha dances were not authentic. There was too much use of Chinese music. A small but important detail: the proper use of incense sticks was nowhere to be seen. Sakura's scenes were almost obscene! Interestingly, some of the Chinese actors were quite convincing as the Japanese.
