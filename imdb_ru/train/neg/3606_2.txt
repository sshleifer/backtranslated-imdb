This film is the worst film, but for me it is very high. This is what a slasher movie should be. It happens at a university, in which, it seems, only a handful of students. Teacher dumber bag with hammers. He is filled with a kindly Catholic priest, sexually suppressed with humor. Bad hair, bad clothes. The dialogue is so confusing that it is hard to believe that I could predict strings in quotes. The cuts have some creativity and seem to revolve around piercing people in the genitals. The lack of continuity in the soundtrack and characters that deserve death because they are so bad, I recommend this film for a fun time. Take a box with cheap beer and friends, look and laugh.
