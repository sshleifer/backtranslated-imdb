I really hoped that it would be a fun show, given all the hype and ingenious preview clips. And speaking of hype, I even heard an interview with the creator of the show on BBC World Today - a show that is broadcast all over the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this show doesn’t even come close to the show, All jokes are obvious - those that sound quite funny when you first hear them, but after that they seem sloppy - and they are not given any new treatment or perversion. All characters are one-dimensional. Acting is good - mediocre (I feel good). This is a classic CBC recipe - one that always fails. <br /> <br /> If you’re a Muslim, I think you’ll have to be stupid to believe any of the white characters, and if you’re white, you’ll probably be offended by the fact that almost all white characters are fanatical , ignorant, or both. Not to make fun of white people is a problem - most of the best comedies are rooted in this. This is a problem only when it is not funny - as in this show. <br /> <br /> Canada is full of funny people - so many that we regularly export them to Hollywood. So how could the producers of this show not find one?
