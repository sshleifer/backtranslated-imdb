Imagine it, say, 12-1 in the morning - you are at home, bored, not tired. This scenario happened, say, about 4 years ago. I turned on the TV, switched several channels and found that this movie was on. Oh, MY WORD, this is the worst movie I've ever seen! A runaway car that cannot be stopped (because the brakes were off or something like that), driving along the freeway - what will happen ?! This film was so bad that in fact it is funny - I think that the tricks cost about 2 dollars, there was one case when a child / young child was kicked out of the car by helicopter - in an attempt to excite the viewer - a conveniently located bridge approaches forward .. THIS IS THE BEST BAD PUPPET OF A FILM - it shows that the child almost missed the bridge, but it looks so bad - you can almost see the brand of dummy they used - an absolute budget classic! I can not remember the end of the film, although I bet it was a BIG <br /> <br /> I doubt that they will ever show this film again, so I am glad that I was able to see this piece of garbage!
