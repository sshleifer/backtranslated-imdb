WWF Survivor Series 2001 <br /> <br /> This was one of the worst events of 2001. Perhaps his biggest flaw was that he did not follow the lead of most of the previous Survivor series. ” There was only one match of the surviving series. And this match of the Survivor series lasted 45 minutes. Moreover, anyone who has a working brain knows that it will end up being “Rock vs. Austin” and “Rock” will win his team. And do not get me to preview before the event. Whoever won, it was obvious that no one would die. There was no need for all this meaningless deception. Whatever the storyline, it was just a wrestling competition. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the matches: the first match was Christian, who defended his European title against Al Snow. It was a good speed match, and it's nice to see how the heel honestly wins the match. William Regal vs. Tajiri was boring and we saw it 2 or 3 times before. The edge against Testa was good, but nothing good. The label of the names of steel matches in the cage was the best match of the evening. The royal battle lasted 10 minutes, and no one cared who would win in the first place. Women's title match was not great. No, not in the least. The main event was to be the most hypocritical coincidence in history. The Alliance lost, but guess that in 5 months each Superstar of the Alliance returned. The match itself was bad. The stone destroyed 3 of them, and Jericho destroyed 2. The stone was too busy with its actions to be there when the invasion began. Jericho was the one who jeopardized the whole match. If I wanted any 2 to be eliminated at an early stage, it would be them. Everyone knew that Kane, Big Show and The Undertaker were just boys. 7 series is not enough for the Survivor series. If the Survivor series ever comes out again, it's just as bad as me.
