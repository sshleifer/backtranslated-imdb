I always thought that Cinderella II was the worst movie I've ever seen (it was followed by Peter Pan 2 and some other sequels, such as The Lion King 2 and Notre Dame The Hunchback 2). All these films are made with the same idea; because the film has no plot, they are trying to make up for it, filling it with jokes. I'm not saying that the jokes are bad, but they make up most of the movie. When I first saw the movie, I would give it 1/10. But now I think about it, most children do not care about how good the original film was, they just care about making the film interesting. I still think that the film was a bad continuation, but that does not mean that it is terrible. Now I think it deserves 3/10.
