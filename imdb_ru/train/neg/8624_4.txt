The game was not great, the story was full of simplified turns and transparent characters. We are talking about the consequences of the struggle between the voters of the right-wing Flemish bloc, on the one hand, and the inhabitants of Morocco, who live in the Belgian city of Antwerp, on the other. Is this a political analysis? Is this some kind of Belgian West Side Story or modern Romeo and Juliet? The film is simply not strong enough to answer both questions (suppose it was also the director's questions). However, some scenes might work as a kind of Ken Loach film, shot in Antwerp. After all, this city was the starting point of the extremist party of the right-wing Flemish bloc and struggles with many problems and tensions between different groups of people and cultures. Making a film about this situation is very difficult, and, unfortunately, this film was not successful. However, he tells the story of a very real and difficult situation in modern Belgium. The few foreign viewers who watch the film should try it and realize that itâ€™s not the film itself that is important, but the social barriers that haunt Belgium, a country with a population of 10 million, in the 2000s <br /> <br /> Dries Van Dongen
