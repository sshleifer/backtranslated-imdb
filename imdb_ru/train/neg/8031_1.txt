The American Humane Association, which is the source of the familiar disclaimer "No animal was hurt ..." (registered AHA trademark), began tracking the use of animals in filmmaking more than 60 years ago, blindfolded. The horse was forced to jump to his death from the top of a cliff to shoot in the movie Jesse James (1939). Needless to say, the brutal act kills for me the whole entertainment aspect of this film. I suppose it can be said that, at least, the horse did not die in vain, as this was the beginning of a public awakening to the soulless and terrible pain caused by animals for the glory of making a film, but I can't help but feel that if a poor animal had choice, he certainly would not have been the way he would have gone!
