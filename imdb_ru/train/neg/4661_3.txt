In this film, there are Richard Pryor, Rosie Greer and others. This is a curious film of the Second World War, which serves as a statement about racism. It is worth looking to understand the fact that films reflect what we think about problems when they are produced, and not about the time they depict. This means that this is a 70s movie, not a 40s movie (WW2). However, there are a few good militants of 7 seven blacks led by a white captain trying to seize the dam. The story tells the captain that these people are soldiers, and not just a service company. There is a scene that may be from a film about the civil war, and not from a film about the Second World War, which reflects the essence of the film. The black lieutenant innocently smacks a German woman on the cheek, and the white captain gets upset. I liked the movie in terms of curiosity, as the stars and the genre were interesting to me.
