Bad plot, bad dialogue, bad game, idiotic direction, annoying porn grooves soundtrack, which ran constantly over the replayed script and crappy copy of VHS can not be redeemed by consuming alcohol. Believe me, because I stuck this turkey to the end. It was all so terribly bad that I thought it was the fourth parody of Spring Time for Hitler. <br /> <br /> The girl who played Janis Joplin was the only weak spark of interest, and that was only because she could sing better than the original. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something similar, but a thousand times better, see “Outside the Valley of the Dolls”.
