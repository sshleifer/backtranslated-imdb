Well, I saw a lot of films about witches and the occult, but this one was just weird. This film starts with the fact that this cult of witches, led by the really bad Orson Wells, playing the main role (they could not get someone who would look and act more like a satanist), he simply did not participate in this film at all. But, in any case, the coven takes a new member and strikes at the doll, which looks like someone and makes her miscarriage. The lady who had a miscarriage and her husband go to a place called Lilith on the bus, and in the meantime the lady sees an image of her sister or the one who calls her and warns her to stay away from her and never use her powers. there or she will die. The couple, after settling in a strange city, discover that all residents are witches, and she becomes curious and fears all her neighbors and friends. Then strange things start to happen when the lady discovers a funeral happening on a hill that suddenly disappears (it was creepy) and also sees a little boy belonging to Orson Welles on the playground, which he later asks the lady to help him bring back to life . Soon the lady tries to escape from the city, but discovers that her inhabitants and forces have caught her, and she ignores everything the spirit is trying to warn her about. There is nothing wrong with this film, it has moments of waiting, but it really could be much better than Orsonâ€™s presence.
