Well, I'm shocked, the film by Woody Allen, from which I came out in half an hour (I know about the moral fragility of commenting on the film, which I saw less than half, but I hope that you will understand why). In fact, it became very early that we were going to patronize from the screen: a scenario that sets out his vanity, as if with bullets; actors who all tried to be characters of Hannah and her sisters (with the exception of Chloe Sevigny) and were brutally directed towards this; and the camera, which sat deliberately, just so that there was nothing to shoot, except for the chat and the actor delivering it. Drama? No one; it is partially tentatively narrated, but action does nothing to develop a dramatic situation. <br /> <br /> Maybe I really left too early in this case, but by that time I decided against another one and a half hours, liner-allen clones. Does the script have funny moments ?? I almost completely stopped Will Ferrellâ€™s excerpts in the trailer (hooked the trailer again, dox!) ?? but there is a small pace to allow them to carelessly fly as the best. Worse, there is no fluidity. To say that this film is wooden, makes the forest look like jelly: an open discussion related to a cafe is the most blatant example. The only thing that needs to be done by numbers is browsing in a pot ?? 2/10.
