: Spoilers: <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed in the constant joy of love. I waited a long time to see him, and finally, I had a chance when he was shown on Thursday night in Hallmark. I like the first three films, Love, but this one was not at all what I thought. The whole film was sad and depressing, there was a lot of nonsense, and the editing was very bad - for many scenes out of context. I also think that the death of Katie’s baby happened very soon, and Clarks’s appearance in the film just didn’t fit. It seemed that none of the actors really wanted to be there - they all lacked emotion. It seemed that there was no interaction between Missy and Willy. <br /> <br /> I think the screenwriters should follow the book more. It seems that every film that has been made so far just goes farther and farther away from the works of Janette Oka. I mean, in the movie they never mentioned a mine and two boys or Clark because of that. And I think that Missy and Willis’s reactions to Katie’s death could be shown and heard, and not just heard. <br /> <br /> Of the four films that have been made so far, I would say that Love is my least favorite eternal joy. I hope more books will follow in the next four films, and if the character Clarks is I hope that he will play a big role, and I hope that his role is not so modest. I also hope that there is more Scotty and Cookies, and perhaps even Marty, but who knows what the script writers will have in the future.
