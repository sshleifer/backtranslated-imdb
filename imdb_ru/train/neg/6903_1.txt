Probably the worst movie in New Zealand ever made <br /> <br /> Jokes They are not funny. Used from other films and just corny. The game is bad, although there is an excellent cast. <br /> <br /> The story is uninteresting and boring. More cheese than pizza huts. 1000 times before <br /> <br /> I watched it on TV, but it was so boring that I could only endure 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie sucks, <br /> <br /> Do not watch it, <br /> <br /> Instead, watch how the paint dries.
