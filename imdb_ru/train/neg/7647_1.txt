Madison County Bridges is the best version of this story. I felt that the end of this film was not perceived sensitively, as in the original English film. This film is very Indian, if you are a very sensitive person who cries in the film, when the hero eventually dies, you will like this movie. On the other hand, if you are a fighter in life and you think you are crying for wimps, you may not like the final. But overall, this is a pretty good subject that fits well with Indian conditions. Taboo was good as a caring wife and mother. All acted well.
