A young boy gets a lot of money and quickly starts earning it. Unfortunately, the person whose money is actually worth is very bad. He wants to return his prey. When he finds out who has money, he starts trying to get it back. This little child, who was just lucky to keep from falling into the hands of an evil person, continues to tear him down. Sounds familiar, I bet. Very predictable, not at all interesting. Come up with something a little different, ok guys?
