When I was filming Unheded, I was expecting a horrible movie. The box even claimed that there were extreme scenes of violence in the film, cut from theatrical release (I now have serious doubts about this exit in the cinema). After the end of the film, I thought about how to get a video release. <br /> <br /> The plot is this: a group of three young women on a car trip crashed into a tree. These women somehow manage to get into the mansion in which an extremely sexist woman lives. In addition, the film consists mainly of useless scenes intended to make the film long enough for its release. <br /> <br /> One of the things that makes this movie awful is action. Lisa Munson, who plays the main character, looks like she reads her lines from cue-cards. Others play badly, but not as badly as hers. Another thing that makes this movie bad is the camera technique. Many pictures were taken by cameras attached to the ceiling. It gets very annoying as the movie progresses. On top of that, there is very little blood there, which makes the box very misleading. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on this. My rating: 1 out of 10
