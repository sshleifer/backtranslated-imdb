I so wanted to believe in this film after the only form of comedy that this country recognizes is farce and stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Of course, everything went completely different - let's be cool and sharp - and the other side came out with a little to show it. I bet that one little seed went crazy about it. I know what SL did. <br /> <br /> None of the main characters have comedic roles. Even Danny K had a better time. I'm really serious. Every time they introduced a bit of character, I kept thinking: “Damn, this person had to be the lead!”. <br /> <br /> Independence does not mean that working with the camera should be terrible. Black and white have done nothing for this film - in fact, with such a flat dialogue, it is even more insulting, bringing boredom into dramatic relief. Black and white, too, was not clear. The composition was terrible. The use of music was terrible. Oddly enough, I watched Little Miss Sunshine after this film, and its composition was excellent - perhaps that is why I remember the flaws in this film. <br /> <br /> I think that Korn (who was funnier than the main characters), even before he said something, spoke to this film, and not to David - look and you will understand. I bet the guys who organize Oppicoppi were alarmed. It would seem that nothing happens there at all. I had a feeling that this could be removed in someone's garden. I know ordinary guys who have much funnier, coarser and more witty conversations than any of these "comics." The dude they tied to the end was fine. <br /> <br /> I think comedy S.A. will remain in the stone age a little longer. Good job guys.
