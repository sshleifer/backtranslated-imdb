I just watched this movie 15 minutes ago and still have no idea what I just watched. Basically, I think this is a movie about Internet S & M “star” CD Roms, which is about as realistic as online flash cartoons. She was killed by someone, causing her sister and a group of 2 FBI agents to investigate her death. The local homicide investigation unit in Big City, USA, is also investigating, although most of his work is to capture CDs that he says are as realistic as they are real. I know. Wow. <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen is the only one in the film who has any credits. He is in the film for about 15 minutes, and half of this is that he fucks the main girl, apparently for no apparent reason. I will not even explain the end, because, frankly, I can not make out myself. But before the final scene, we consider 3 or 4 minutes of editing the entire film. Honestly, they could have started this final scene, and that would be the same effect with a cross-eyed direction and everything. <br /> <br /> In general, stay away from this movie. I got it because I love bad movies and I love Michael Madsen. I really could have used these 80 minutes for something else and would have been more pleased. Like, play this game with a knife, where you poke in your hand several times. That for 80 minutes would be much more interesting.
