** HERE WILL BE SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Recall: Mia (Helin) returns from the capital of Stockholm to rural Rettvik to celebrate his father's 70th birthday. She is certainly the youngest child, and she has two sisters Eyvor (Ernst) and Gunilla (Petren). Eyvor has a family and still lives in Rettvik, and Gunilla divorced and moved to another city. Mia is still single and focused on her career. There is a lot of jealousy and almost hostility between the sisters, and conflicts arise everywhere when they run into each other, and each has personal problems that they find it difficult to cope with. As the party continues (and alcohol is consumed), more and more secrets are revealed and more and more conflicts arise ... <br /> <br /> Comments: The work of the new writer / director disappointed See this movie to follow the same tracks as the old Swedish comedies / dramas in which they have been playing for years. There are really no new elements or ideas. This film is based on three main aspects. 1) Embarrassing humor only on the basis of characters posing as fools. 2) Sadness and 3) Anxiety. This move focuses on the latter, almost forgetting the first point while the movie is going. Without a loss, since the humor that is there is not funny. I suppose the performances are performed well, although behind all this suffering they are lost and soon forgotten. I hoped that there would be new ideas and influences, but they were not. In conclusion, there are better ways to spend time than watch this. <br /> <br /> 3/10
