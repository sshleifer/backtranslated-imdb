My friend and I shot this movie for $ 2.50. And we both agree on one thing: <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie ever made! <br /> <br /> In addition, my friend and I counted 475 face shots. (This is 95% of the film). <br /> <br /> In other words: SEE IN THIS MOVIE IF YOU DON'T LIKE LOSING MONEY AND I DO IT! <br /> <br />
