This production has absolutely no storyline. The game is confusing. Sophie Hilbrand, a promising Dutch television star, should not add this film to her resume. Her game is far from flawless, and I personally think that she crossed the border of professional decency; Regarding how she exposes herself in this film. This film contains too much unnecessary nudity, vulgar sex scenes, and coarse language. It also shows the wrong image of the Netherlands (like most movies). Don't worry about watching this movie: a waste of time, a waste of money and an awkward recording for Hilbrand, which showed itself better when it is close on the screen.
