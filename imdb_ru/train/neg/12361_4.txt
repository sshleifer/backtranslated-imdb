I saw this recent Woody Allen film because I'm a fan of his work and try to see everything he does, although reviews of this film made me expect disappointing efforts. They were right. This is a tangled film that cannot decide whether it wants to be a comedy, a romantic fantasy or a drama about a female midlife crisis. This does not happen in all three. <br /> <br /> Alisa (Mia Farrow) is a restless middle-aged woman who married great wealth and leads the aimless luxury of living with her rather dull husband and two young children. This rather mundane concept of the plot is animated by such incredible things as the old Chinese traditional healer, who makes her invisible with some magical herbs, and the ghost of a former lover (with whom she flies over Manhattan). If these additions sound too fantastic for you, how about something more prosaic, like a saxophonist? <br /> <br /> I was never completely sure that I was trying to say this confused mess. There are only a few really funny moments in the film, and the ending is Pollyanna’s really ridiculous touch. <br /> <br /> Instead, shoot “Crimes and Misconduct”, a superbly made film that successfully combines a comedy with a serious consideration of ethics and morals. Or return to Annie Hall or Manhattan.
