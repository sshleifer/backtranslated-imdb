If you have ever wanted to watch a movie that emphasizes style, not content, this is for you. For me, Son de Mar is beautiful to SEE, but there is some precious substance, if only they do not excite disgusting, melodramatic, manipulative threads of love. This may be one of those famous “chicks” that you have heard so much about. <br /> <br /> We are halfway to this film before something really happens: Ulises (Jordi Molla) goes to sea in search of tuna and does not return, leaving his wife Martin (Leonor Watling)) and son to stand up for myself. Then, in a furious six minutes of screen time, they bury Ulises, Martina gets married again, and her son grows up in the middle of his childhood. This quick change sounds at least very casually: after 40 minutes more or less inaction, we suddenly fall into a full-blown melodrama, and all this in six minutes. I think this is called the capricious course of the narrative. <br /> <br /> Five years later, Ulis (as in the wandering superheroes Ulysses, understand?) Returns to her Penelope (Watling), only to find that she is married to Sierra (Eduard Fernandez), an inexplicably rich guy ( what does he do to earn all this dough?), who inexplicably keeps crocodiles as pets. When Martina, in a strong anger, asks Ulisa about his absence, he tells her that one day she will take her to the island of Sumatra, and she will understand EVERYTHING. <br /> <br /> And the thing is: he DOES Take her to the island of Sumatra. The link just dies somewhere in the script. He really does not explain where he was and why he ignored his wife and child for five years. He does not justify himself as an honest guy, and the film DOES NOT fill the holes in the plot that look at us at least half the film. I can only assume that director Bigas Luna wants us to fill storylines with mystical clues (fish, reptiles, the sea), which he offers through exciting cinematography and evasive dialogue. It just does not work. The narrative "arc" in this film ultimately looks more like a wobbly clothesline. <br /> <br /> I am sure that Jordi Molla is a good actor, but I just could not buy him to Ulisses like any other hero. (this is how the original Ulysses should have been). With wet sensuality, he spews a short stanza of identical poetry from Virgil about 2000 times, and every time she excites Martin to an explosive orgasm. This guy must be rented to liven up stale marriages. I'm sure Virgil will be impressed. As I understand it, it is not so often laid out. <br /> <br /> This poetic “device” is prominently featured in the film, and I had no choice but to assume that it was the sexual twist of Ulysses’s famous “siren song” (that is, beautiful maidens are seductively singing distant sailors who were doomed if they answered, well, well, call the siren). If this is what Bigas Luna is doing, you can see the problem - he offers an elaborate symbolism in an attempt to catch and grab High Art. Once again, this just does not work, at least in my eyes. <br /> <br /> Watling is a beautiful and charming young actor, but she gives us a character that doesn't seem to have great intellectual or even romantic depth. It's beyond me how she could desperately fall in love with a guy who wears a rolled sign (like free), oily hair in 1960s style that looks more like seaweed, and one of these trendy beards of the 21st century. (You know, four-day growth, no more, no less). It is assumed that he is a dreamy guy (I think), but his gaze suggests that he may suffer more from an overexposure of the ridiculous scenario. <br /> <br /> But, do not despair, it's a pleasure to watch this movie. Just do not try to connect the dots in the red herring or think too much about what you hear on the path of dialogue. You can lose rewind this movie (especially in the first 40 minutes), and you really do not miss much.
