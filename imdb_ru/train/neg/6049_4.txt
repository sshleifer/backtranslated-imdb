First, anyone who thinks that this is a sequel to the film “William Friedkin's French Connection” is superior, quite definitely completely insane, a moron, or both. The problem with reviewing this film is that: a) this is a continuation of a brilliant film that always makes it difficult to observe it objectively, and b) its director John Frankenhimer, one of the best American directors in history, so I wanted to like it. William Frendkin was the perfect person to make a film about drug trafficking in collapsing New York. Due to his documentary approach to action and history, Frankenhimer, on the other hand, is one of the most stylish directors, that is, Manchu. The candidate "and" Seconds ", and with his French Connection 2, it seems that someone is trying to be tough and does not have a true understanding to cope with it. The fact that Frankenhimer was chosen to lead the sequel to Gene Hackman himself In fact, he says a lot about Hackman’s understanding of the original film. It’s well known that Hackman hated Friedkin on the set and vowed never to work with him again. character This shows that Hackman, despite the fact that he was a great actor, had no idea who would make the film and the story great. The point of the story that Doyle is a drug addict is interesting, but gives no reason for the rest of the film. Unfortunately, low point in Frankenhimera filmography.
