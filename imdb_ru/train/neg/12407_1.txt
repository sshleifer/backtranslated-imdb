Alicanna (Laurel Barnett) becomes a nanny for young Rosalie Nordon (Rosalione Cole), who recently lost her mother. But Rosalie misses her dead mother very much and constantly visits her grave (conveniently located in the cemetery right behind the house) late at night ... where she also meets her "friends" ... <br /> <br /> It starts well with a really creepy sequence in the graveyard ... then falls apart. The story is thin, and there are tons of stuffing to make the film 85 minutes long. The game is terrible in all directions (Cole is easy to be the worst). Poorly directed with some of the worst editing I've ever seen in a movie. Scenes (and sound) are simply cut off without rhyme and reason. The film also has a terrible (and obvious) post-production sound. <br /> <br /> Regarding blood and violence - forget it! There is very little and what is there, looks incredibly false. I have NEVER seen such false blood - it looks like ketchup! Boring, pointless - by right a forgotten driving film. You can skip this.
