Despite the fact that there are more than 180 films to choose from, this “Succubus” is often called the best film by Jess Franco. Hell, even the legendary director Fritz Lang considers Succubus to be one of his favorites. So maybe it's me, but I thought it was a terribly boring and too confusing movie. The discovery is great, though, and shows that Janine Raynaud performs the act of SM on stage. Hence, unfortunately, everything is downhill. Raynaud's character is a maniac who ultimately kills his lovers in some kind of trance. Franco had a decent budget for work, and he spends it well on beautiful places, beautiful photos and fascinating musical accompaniment. It CAN be his best film if not for the lame and uninteresting story. It should be psychedelic, but I would say sofoforka is the best term to describe what is shown here. In half the time you have no clue what is happening or what exactly is said, so even a short time of 80 minutes seems to last forever. In my opinion, this is not the best movie of Franco. I would not even recommend it to fans of tough exploitation. If you're looking for a better-quality film about Jess Franco, try purchasing Las Vampires, Dreadful Dr. Orloff or Female Vampire.
