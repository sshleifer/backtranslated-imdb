This film has its negative comments, and I have to agree with those who consider it one of the worst films ever made. True, most films based on King’s works are rather bad, but this one goes beyond the bad in a terrible realm. There is not a single terrible moment in this if you do not consider nonsense as terrible. This is the typical king of garbage — myths twisted around that made no sense in the first place, mixed with obvious and exhausted so-called “scares” that are about as shocking as Playe PeeWee (which is interesting, at least). He is full of ridiculous moments, not least the character of Alice Krieg. When she gets furious and starts to make noise like a villain in the old Batman TV show, it's so absurd that it's disgusting. All the people who had cameos in it (including John Landis) are lucky that they still have a career. But the most absurd part should be cat suits at the end, which look like cheap rubber clothes that someone bought at K-mart. The best part of the film is the appearance of real cats that actually beat the people in the film.
