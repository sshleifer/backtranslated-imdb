I have nothing against religious films. I think religious people need to look at something on Saturday night. But what really annoys me is that the recording on the DVD box does not indicate this fact to the potential viewer. It’s NOT cool to give out religious propaganda for fun, bro. <br /> <br /> And even if I were a religious person, I would have to agree with most other posters, this film was erratic. Poorly directed, badly acting, poorly edited, and the soundtrack attempt was fun. The fake accents were terrible, the characters were mostly stereotypes, and the continuity was outside the window. The only reason we put up with this waste of time was that it was already too late to watch another movie. Must have just gone to bed. <br /> <br /> Absolutely no redemptive qualities to this film, unless you are a religious type who immediately supports everything that your beliefs preach to non-believers, even if it’s a bunch of rubbish, If not, avoid it at all costs. Do not be fooled by the writing of the box.
