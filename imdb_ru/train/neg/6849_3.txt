This quasi-horror film followed a young woman when she returned to her children's village on the island of Shikoku to sell the family house and meet old friends. She finds that one, the daughter of a village priestess, had drowned several years earlier. Then she and Fumiko (another childhood friend) find out that mother Sayori is trying to bring her back to life with the help of black magic. The bonds between the dead and the living are already weakening, and friends and villagers see ghosts. Nothing was exceptional or even very good in this film. Unlike star horror films J, the wait does not really create, the result does not seem overly threatening, and the final boundaries are absurd. <br /> <br /> This film is like plain white rice cooked a little too long, so it borders on soft. Sometimes you get it in poor Asian restaurants or cook your own white rice for too long. You end up eating it because you need it with food, because it is Chinese or Japanese food without rice, but it almost destroys the food because of the sticky, sticky tastelessness of it all. 3/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
