If someone doesn't enlighten me, I really have no idea what this film is about. It looks like a picture with a message, but it’s far from it. This film tells the senseless story of a New York press agent and his problems. And that's basically all. When this agent plays Pacino, you need to think that it must be something important. But you do not need to think much to understand how senseless and boring this film is. For one of the best actors in the world, Al Pacino, this is the second film of the year (the other is “Simon”), which deserves the title of “The Most Boring and Most Pointless Film of the Year”. So what happens, al?
