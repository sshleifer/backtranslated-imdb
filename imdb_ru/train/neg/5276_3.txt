No, this is not a fairy tale with a pumpkin carriage, a fairy godmother and glass slippers, but if I had to clarify, I would have to spoil it for you, which I will not. But do not let curiosity overpower you, as this film is not fantastic. This is one of those films that start promisingly, before betraying its audience with cheap scare tactics and an inconsistent storyline. And this is a real horror. <br /> <br /> Yun-hee (To Ji-Won) and Hyun-soo (Shin Se Kyung) are your ideal mother and daughter. One is a successful plastic surgeon, and the other is your obedient and beautiful teenage daughter. Their relationship is hand in hand, so close that you will think of them more as siblings, not as parents. But things start to go wrong (not always) when Hyung-soo's friends, with whom Yun Hee operated on, start going crazy. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this warning is for viewers, and for those who are Korean Ladies who do not beat their eyelids when they go under the knife, according to news reports. The only truly scary moments are the scenes in plastic surgery, although, anyway, I thought that “Kim Ki-Duk's Time” was actually more bloody when he told and described what happens during the operation itself. . <br /> <br /> This is a story about two halves, the first of which is an attempt to shock the audience with standard scare tactics, which, I admit, have come to me from time to time. However, the second half degenerated the film into a senseless melodramatic mumbo-jumbo, and he was quite resourceful to make him think. Some things start to make no sense, and although there are always attempts to explain, you probably don’t buy it, not that horror movies are logical to begin with. <br /> <br /> All references are excellent, and there is a clear lack of male presence, except for the minor role of the policeman. But hey, I'm not complaining, although the storyline could be greatly improved. I would recommend that you watch this only if you are a fan of mediocre Korean horror on VCD. Beware of these unexpected moments!
