Probably the worst movie about Delphi. There is nothing here that you would like or expect. Do not waste your time. Dolph plays an unhappy cop who is not interested in life. His brother is killed, and Dolph is trying to figure it out. The character is just stupid and stumbles aimlessly. It makes no sense.
