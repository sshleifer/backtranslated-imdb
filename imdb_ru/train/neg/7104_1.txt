The producers of this film offer to pay the funeral expenses to everyone who dies of fright while watching this movie. They had to offer intensive psychotherapy for those who really enjoyed this abomination. A young couple moves into a house where a woman resembling a woman from a couple lived. Extremely boring and very predictable. In the end, in the end, I didnâ€™t care about anyone in this film. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs.
