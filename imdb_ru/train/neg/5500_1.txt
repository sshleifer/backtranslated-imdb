This film is trying hard, but it lacks the fun from the 1960s television series, which I am sure people remember with love. Although I am 17 years old, I watched some TV shows on YouTube for a long time, and it was fun and fun. Unfortunately, this film does not quite justify the series. <br /> <br /> The special effects are rather poor-quality, and this did not help the flat camera work. The script was also boring and lacked a sense of wonder and humor. Other films with a non-standard scenario: "Home Alone 4", "The Cat in the Hat", "Thomas and the Magic Railway" and "Addams Family Reunion". <br /> <br /> Now I will say that I liked the idea of ​​this story, but, unfortunately, she was terribly executed and exhausted too early, and I, frankly, am not sure for this reason that this is something for family to enjoy. And I was annoyed by the talking suit, despite Wayne Knight’s energetic voice. <br /> <br /> But what made me most angry about this movie was that he squandered the talents of Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels and Daryl Hannah. All of them are very talented actors. Jeff Daniels had achieved good results before, but he seemed to have no idea what he had to do, and the character Elizabeth Hurley, unfortunately, seemed useless. Daryl Hannah is a wonderful actress, and she is generally ignored, and I liked the idea that she is a love interest, but, unfortunately, you see her very little (not to mention that attacking monsters will rather scare children than enthrall them), as well as Wallace Sean as a kind of government operative. Christopher Lloyd is getting better, and as an actor I really like Lloyd (he was in two of my favorite films “Hint” and “Who Framed Roger Rabbit” and I like “Back to the Future”), but he had little to work with and The tendency to replay is pretty wild. <br /> <br /> In general, no matter how much I like this film, I was not impressed. Instead of being funny, it seemed pointless, and it's a shame, because it had a lot of potential, with some talented actors and a good idea, but wasted with a bad performance. 1/10 Bethany Cox
