"Well, Chuck Jones is dead, he lets his characters get dirty by adding cheap explosions, an American style of drawing anime and giving them super powers." "but, sir? are we not ready to have several shows in works that already look like this? especially not giving up all our dreams of the original creators." "Yes! And these shows bring us a lot of money, but we need more! ”. "But will not all men, women and children who grew up with fewer characters get annoyed?" “Listen, you're right! set it in the future, make them the descendants of the original characters, and change all the names a bit ... but not too much, although we still need to be able to milk the success of the classics. "<br /> <br /> Well, this is the only reason I can think of why it exists at all. If you look past the terrible desecration of our favorite Looney Toons, it looks like a normal show. But then there is a teenage titan, and this is also the most bloody. All the characters are dressed like Batman, they drive around on some ship, fighting with supervillains, they have soup abilities, the only difference is that they speak like Looney's melodies and have similar names and character traits. <br /> <br /> Such things fall into the category “it's so funny, it's good.” Remember the film about Super Mario's brother, Batman and Robin. If you want to laugh for all the wrong reasons, check it out. If you are from the younger generation (what this thing is really intended for) and can look like shameless greedy leaders, then run with it and enjoy. <br /> <br /> If you like this cartoon, I don’t like my problem with you, these are people who figured out this thing together that I’m angry with. You know, as they say, piracy is like car theft; this show is like a grave robbery. With the same success, they could dig out all the people involved in the creation of the original cartoon, put them on display, dress up in pirate costumes and take money. If this show had not used characters (which in any case were not similar to Toon Looney), which had already made the studios millions, it would be good. But no! To shame, brothers Warner, to shame. <br /> <br /> If I saw this thing as a 30-second gag in the episode of “Simpson” or “Family Guy”, I would have liked that. I just can not believe that this has ever been done. I would argue that 80% of the people who work on this show hate it. But whatever it is, in 10 years this show will be forgotten, and the originals will live forever, or at least until the end of the world. <br /> <br /> “Soon 2008, Snoopy and the gangs of peanuts are back, and now they have lasers, and they can become invisible! Can Charlie Brown defeat the evil alien commander Zapara? Tune in and see. ”
