Oh my gosh ... I thought the CBS Primetime television shows were the worst things Gerald MacRoney had appeared in. <br /> <br /> Four people experiment with insane mind control. <br /> <br /> computer. That's all, do not hand over. <br /> <br /> I saw it under one of his many titles - “The Gray Question”, and this is perhaps one of the worst films of recent memory. The rest of the <br /> <br /> reviews are correct, this is terrible. NEVER have so many impressive <br /> <br /> shots ever appeared on the screen. The cast of actors is terrible, the direction <br /> <br /> is terrible, the script is terrible. I can not stress how terrible it is. <br /> <br /> Avoid this like smallpox. <br /> <br /> This is a rating (PG) for physical abuse, gun abuse, easy bloodshed, profanity and some adult situations
