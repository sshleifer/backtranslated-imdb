The fact that Hopkins really succeeds with this effort as a writer and director gives us the feeling that we know absolutely no one in the film. However, perhaps this is the problem. There are many ambitions in his film, and his intentions were obviously complex and drawn from the depths of the soul, but this is so impersonal. There are no characters. We never know who it is, so there is no investment on our part. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the screenwriter is mixed with his own characters. It? May be. I do not mean that Slipstream is ambiguous; I mean, that says nothing. The Hopkins film is an experiment. At first glance, it can be argued that we are talking about a potential screenwriter who, at the very moment of his meeting with fate, realizes that life has hit and gone, and / or success is a blind accident, since it is thrown into the “flow” of collisions between times , dreams, thoughts and reality. Nevertheless, he is so adamantly cerebral that he leaves no room for any hints of emotion, even to a tiny, rather rudimentary degree, allowing us to establish a connection with his characters. <br /> <br /> I did not think that this nimble and bright school of shaky, camera work and editing at the speed of a machine gun upset me, but, reflecting on the film, I begin to realize that it is largely connected with it. Over the past decade, there have been so many films in which cuts or camera movement have sound effects, as well as other atmospheric technical things. I believe that in this case it was justified by the fact that his goal was to create the impressionistic susceptibility of dreams. However, I knew almost nothing about Slipstream when I watched it, and I came out the same way. And I just don’t care, because Hopkins made no effort to make us care. There are interactive films, and there are films that sit in a rocking chair and are connected, unaware of your presence. Slipstream is the latest.
