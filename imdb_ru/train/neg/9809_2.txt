Some wonder why there were no more Mrs. Murphy films after that. Will it be because this film completely blew snot. Disney was not the right studio to launch this movie. CAN BE Touchstone (well, they belong to Disney, but that would be more adult). The film is too kids, like a series of books. Casting is not suitable for characters. Characters do not even behave as in books. And why did Tucker turn into a guy? He's a girl in the damn books! Was this done to make the film attractive to boys? Sheesh. And where was Pewter, the gray cat? One of the funniest characters from the book is missing in this dirt. Rita Mae Brown is a good writer, but letting Disney explode her work was wrong. An animated feature film, perhaps in the works of Don Bluth, is suitable for the best Mrs. Murphy film. Overall, I give it 2, because at least Disney made the film from an underrated series of books. But I would like them to do better. In any case, I still have my books to entertain me.
