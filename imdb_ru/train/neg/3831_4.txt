I am going to disagree with the previous comment and join Maltin in this regard. This is a secondary, overly vicious western that squeaks and groans, trying to convey its central theme that the Wild West has tamed and thrown aside the steady course of time. I would like to be in the tradition of “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” but he lacks the sharpness and charm of this film. Andrew McLaglean's direction is weak, and the last 30 minutes or so is a real failure, with some incomprehensible strategy on the part of the heroes of Charlton Heston and Chris Mitchum. (Someone might flinch if you can explain to me why they set fire to this side of the hill.) There was something callous in the whole treatment of the rape scene, and subsequently the woman’s reaction, of course, did not sound believable. Coburn is rather unpleasant, since the half-breed has escaped from the convict for revenge, but all his shoots are underdeveloped (they look like bowling pins that need to be shot down one by one when the story moves forward). Michael Parks gives one of his usually running, sluggish, murmuring speeches, but in this case it was appropriate, since his sheriff in a modern style symbolizes complacency, which can provide technical progress.
