I must immediately admit that I have never been a fan of Rodney Dangerfield. Indeed, he does not receive "no respect" from me. I only watched it because my wife wanted to see it, and found exactly what I expected: a stupid story without any real humor. It is full of silly, rude jokes and a completely ridiculous story, revolving around the plans of the developer (Dangerfield) to build a ski resort in Utah, which simply did not attract my attention. <br /> <br /> In addition to Dangerfield, the film starred weak actors, including such as Andrew Dice Clay and John Beiner (he was over the hill) (I didn't even know that he was still there until saw his name in the credits). br /> This is really a disaster in Dangerfield. <br /> <br /> 2/10
