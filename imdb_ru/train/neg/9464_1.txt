Well, the previews looked ridiculous, and I usually do not go to the cinema for the premiere, especially with my children, because ... well, you never know. This is a film that neither the children nor the adults like, because the jokes are too perverted for children and are completely unsuitable for entertainment purposes for adults. In fact, I was ashamed that I was 9 and 6 years old, and I have to explain to my 6-year-old, which means S H * T. In essence, what happens here is a complete distortion of Dr. Suze’s classics. This adds an angry and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the mother of the children for her money. If it was a plot, then perhaps it would be good, but ultimately it became the main plot of the entire film, and the “cat” plays a more important role in the plot, exposing the neighbor to the mother as it really is. Take my advice and read the book and pass the film.
