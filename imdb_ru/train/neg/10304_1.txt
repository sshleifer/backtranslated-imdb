here, let me wave my hands over the keyboard, I will tell you which salad she is going to order. time and again, works like a charm: he is such a genius, oh my god, how does he do it? my trash detector is going crazy, even if I miss this show, when I scan channels, I have to be very careful (these days it’s useful too often, so I don’t need it to break from idiotic crap like this ... be careful with this remote!). should it be some kind of fascist propaganda to make people believe in the invisible sphere of Uberman control and skill? or what? why does it exist? <br /> <br /> This is the most senseless show, absolutely incredible and contrived, and I can not understand why it is still on the air. so geeks can give SO much better shows at such a difficult time (The Sarah Connor Chronicles, True Blood), but they will give this meaningless move. shows like Firefly (if any) disappear after the season, but such nonsensical things that have no logical sense just keep going. yeccch.
