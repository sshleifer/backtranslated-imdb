I have to admit that when I went to see this film, I didn’t have high expectations. But even with my low expectations, I was completely and completely disappointed ... <br /> <br /> In fact, Luke Wilson is a tough guy, prone to go out with slightly crazy friends. There is a slight mention of a girl stalking him, but this is pretty much the case for this character. Which I do not quite mind, because it will probably be as underdeveloped as the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Being in the subway, Rein Wilson (who I really liked before this movie) convinces him to say to the “hot” girl, Ume Thurman. This, to put it mildly, is strange, since everyone clearly sees that Uma Thurman does not belong to the category of “hot”. <br /> <br /> Raine Wilson’s work is also far from hot. Usually I am all for his acting, but even he could not save this film. His character was nervous, unreal and rather annoying. You could never tell if the screenwriters tried to make him a comic gay guy or just despaired. It was almost painful. <br /> <br /> But in any case, someone steals her purse when she leaves the subway, and Luke Wilson is a charming savior, he runs after the robber. Now we all know that Uma Thurman is a superhero, or “G-Girl”, as they like to call her in the film. It still confuses me as to what G means, but we'll leave it for the bulletin boards to discuss. <br /> <br /> Sex scenes, which I suppose should be funny, but I find myself asking, who has such sex? They almost throw the bed over the wall because of the “passion” of Uma Thurman, let's say. It makes my head hurt, but not like this: “I think about it very seriously.” <br /> <br /> When Uma insults Anna Faris, calling her a “whore”, I did not argue with that. Besides the fact that she cannot choose films properly, she cannot act and relies on the fact that she is blond and typical. <br /> <br /> In general, I would have left the theater if I had not paid $ 8.75 to see it. Characters are typical and have absolutely no chemistry, especially Uma Thurman. Someone should let her know that if you move your head a lot, it does not mean that you are playing. <br /> <br /> In addition, the script and the storyline could use either a lot of work or a match, and some lighter fluid. In fact, I began to feel embarrassed about the actors and their dying careers. In general, if you value your money and respect yourself, DO NOT waste your time on this pitiful attempt at a movie.
