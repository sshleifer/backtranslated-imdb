Let's see ... I'm trying to find something positive in everything, so what can I say about Pallbearer? <br /> <br /> I know! The performances were - no, it wouldn't work, as they managed to deplete the whole personality of Gwyneth Paltrow, usually so bright, and in the end they created caricatures from Carol Caine and Barbara Hershey ... <br /> <br /> Oh, how about stories - no It also does not fly, as it gave impetus. What was the genre? It was not funny, it excludes comedy. It was not interesting enough to be dramatic. Was it a romance between Schwimmer and Paltrow? I have to ask, because I can't be sure - let's just call it "losers in the likeness." I am sure that those who were behind this film started with a vision, I mean, they must have had one to transfer it to studio costumes, but I need help to find it. <br /> <br /> Even if I were a patient man who could forgive all the nonsense of this story, I could not with a clear conscience recommend a film that would allow a guy to undergo a professional interview in a windbreaker and dirty, fluffy, silly hair. Speaking of hair - should we be surprised by the deliberate black roots and platinum strands that Hershey wore? <br /> <br /> What am I doing? I have already lost 97 irretrievable minutes in the actual viewing of the film - I can no longer devote more time to this loser.
