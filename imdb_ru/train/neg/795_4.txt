When you see Boris Karloff and Belo Lugosi in the role of colleagues, you expect to find a well-made horror film, but in reality everything was different, presenting what I described as early efforts in science fiction. Karloff and Lugosi both play scientists (Ruch and Benet respectively) are competitors to some extent, until Ruch defeats Benet with a demonstration that confirms his great theory. Science was here - to put it mildly, a bit rough around the edges (thus, science fiction, with an emphasis on fiction), but Ruch somehow uses some kind of ray from Andromeda, which allows him to look at Earth "several thousand millions years ago." At that prehistoric time, a huge meteorite crashed into Africa, leaving deposits of matter that scientists call "Radium X", which can heal and destroy. Most of the film was made in Africa rather tedious, in search of deposits of meteorites, which Ruh eventually finds and uses to create magnificent weapons, unfortunately, infecting themselves with some kind of disease that makes it also an excellent weapon. <br /> <br /> Karloff and Lugosi were pretty good here. Lugosi copes with the role in which he is a good guy, although, to be honest, I found him a little unconvincing, especially during filming in Africa. The story also stretched a bit, and although it caught my attention, it did not fascinate me. Given that this is really a science fiction film, not a horror film, and that the science fiction film was at a very early stage, I believe that the film should be a little weakened. Everything was in order - no more than that, but no less. 4/10
