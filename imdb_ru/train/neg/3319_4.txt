I was surprised when I saw this movie. I heard that it was the best novel ever shot. How disappointed I was. <br /> <br /> How a true fan of Jane Austen can appreciate this adaptation is a mystery to me. The writers decided to add pieces of ridiculous humor that confuse during the best of times, but also destroy the feeling of the period. As for the cast: Gwyneth Paltrow makes a rather superficial heroine (but then any “hot” American star will be questionable in this role), Tony Collett will be wrong, and poor Juan MacGregor is made to look ridiculous! <br /> <br /> I really couldn't say anything good about this movie. It seems that I am one of the few who do not appreciate it, but if you want to get my advice, watch the TV show with Kate Beckinsale instead of starring - believe me, this is much preferable to this surface garbage.
