DEAD HUSBANDS is a somewhat silly comedy about a bunch of wives intending to fight each other's husbands. This is by no means embarrassingly bad, like some comedies I can mention, but it never reveals its potential. Imagine how good this could be if the Farrelli brothers were leading Ben Stiller in the role of Carter Elson. <br /> <br /> Oh, is Carter based on Jerry Springer? Just curious, because the key phrase on Dr. Elson's show is “take care of each other and keep talking”
