The name should have been "Walker". It was just him. <br /> <br /> There was nothing good about the movie. The description of the film does not really fit the plot. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can get from the film is that he was a good son, but a terrible man with a low standard of living. <Br /> <br /> I'm sorry that I spend my money and time on this film. I saw people leaving the theater in the middle of a movie. I was left to hope that it would be better .... what a mistake. I got worse. <br /> <br /> If there is a proposal that I can make to the producer, this will redirect his life to another area, because making films is definitely not his cup of tea.
