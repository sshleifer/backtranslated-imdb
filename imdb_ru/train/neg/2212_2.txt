This low-cost horror storyline “B” includes all the comforts - a mad scientist with an assistant, the evil corporate greed of the pharmaceutical industry, eccentric and extreme genetic engineering and information technology ... I can't forget about it. <br /> Start with a strange sequence of hot-looking unnamed boatmen who foolishly decide to swim in the waters near an uncharted island and end up talking to swarming hammerheads ..... <br /> <br /> Reduce to weak The prehistory, which implies a reduction in stocks of a generic pharmaceutical corporation that motivates its evil Shakespeare quoting the CEO, to accept an unsolicited proposal made by a former employee / scientist who was fired from his job as a research manager. REPRESENTATIONS, and which was also crazy ... of course (of Herbert West mimics). He offers a new stem cell technology that can earn tons of cash ... or it seems so ... It attracts several employees to his island of Moreau (it must have been a rather impressive way out of the company when he was released so that he allowed himself an island) to confirm his scientific findings, including the CEO and, by the way, the former fiancé of the son of a mad scientist who has now been turned into a sharkuman (as convenient) .... <br /> <In some ways, the plan is to revive lost love between b spouses, as well as revenge on former colleagues for his dismissal. (Shiz, how can this guy be bitter? He has his own islet ...). <br /> <br /> Soon everyone is on the run (from endless supplies of guards to heavy weapons, from mutant plants - can there be an uncharted island without cannibal plants? from the appetite of a shark son to a slaughterhouse; from plans for breeding dad-charlatan and from the lack of a cell phone signal) ... and they all have to learn how to work together to leave the island alive! <br /> <br /> Will anyone run away? Will new species be created? Watch it and find out. <br /> <br /> There is some entertainment value in this movie, but don’t expect much ... for a real fan of Combs, it’s not to be missed. <br /> <br /> Do not say that I did not warn you.
