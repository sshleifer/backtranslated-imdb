Watching this movie is like having a meringue banquet. Initially, it looks great, but in the end it does NOT deliver ANYTHING - not one. <br /> <br /> The plot is a mess around the toy factory and the forces of evil. So how is it possible that with this main plot And by Robin Williams, that the film still turns out so badly ?! This is because the picture is completely external, without any being - very much like the horrible picture of Popey, which Williams made at the beginning of his film career. The film must have cost a fortune, but it may not have been enough money to hire authors who graduated from elementary school. <br /> <br /> A film is one unfunny joke that goes on and on and on and on and on. I'm really not sure why this was done in the first place â€” it was certainly not done to provide any entertainment.
