I'm a big fan of war movies, and as a Vietnam vet I have some experience with technical details. I worked with the bomber guys more than once, and I have nothing but respect for them. Other vets, and especially veterans of Iraq, very well summarized the inaccuracies in this film. A poetic license is one thing, but this film is a complete fantasy, and because of this, it fails. No bomb disposal unit or any other unit could tolerate this scammer for more than 5 minutes. Military units value conformity and discipline for the reason it saves lives. The first scene especially annoyed me. A guy with a mobile phone would be shot immediately. Shouting "Stop set" is not an effective deterrent. It got worse. The scenes with the sniper were especially glaring. As others have noted, your regular guy from EOD does not know how to be a sniper, and to think that any Arab sniper is good, really broadens the imagination. Abduction of an Arab businessman for any form of personal revenge will not happen. Someone may shoot him, but this risk is limited to movies. I could go on, but as I said, others pointed it out in detail. This is not a very good film, and if it receives any awards at all, this is another reflection of why “La La land” is so named.
