In essence, this is the pale shadow of High Fidelity, a witty and well-played film with a few truly winning character moves. Watching detectives has nothing of the kind. <br /> <br /> The assumption that the geek of the video store, knocked down by a bizarre mysterious woman, is good, but never explored fully or adequately, thanks to a very weak scenario. and an incorrect assessment of the presenters, not to mention the absence of any real visual style of storytelling. I mean, this film is about films, but it’s not incredibly cinematic in itself! This is a serious flaw. <br /> <br /> But the main problem is that we simply do not care about the main characters, because the script and the actors (Murphy and Liu) cannot make them truthful or sympathetic in any real way. Thus, the film simply becomes a series of two-person episodes that seem, well, not very interesting. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, one more thing: for a romantic comedy? It's not funny. And romance is also not very romantic. <br /> <br /> So avoid that. Even for more than 90 minutes of running, it’s just not worth worrying ...
