SCARECROW is one of those films that are so bad that they are even incredibly annoying when they are watched. The lonely loser, who is constantly chosen by classmates and rejected by girls, ends up going to his trailer mother having sex with a drunken redneck. Then he chases the child in the near corn field and kills him. Apparently, the child's soul was turned into a scarecrow, which then kills the bullies who tormented him, as well as the teachers. This scarecrow, besides the fact that each of its victims is characterized by a quick single-row alignment, can also perform a brush in the form of matrices in the air and kill people on the sidewalks in broad daylight. Besides, why did he always look like a rotten corpse? Just like the two unnecessary sequels that followed, it is not even worth laughing.
