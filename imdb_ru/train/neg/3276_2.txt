The 1980s telecast, updated with fresh female flesh and coarse tongue. The "dukes of Hazzard" passed by me; this did not happen when I was in front of the TV in New York or California; or I probably would have looked. Nevertheless, from somewhere (for example, the clips accompanying this film, the updated edition of 2005), I knew that this was a quick orange Dodge Charger - and “General Lee” is still good. <br /> <br /> Orange Sage's new horsemen are cousins ​​Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville (like Beau and Luke Duke). Beautiful Jessica Simpson (as Daisy) fills her meager short haircut well - but even her awakening pink bikini can't beat the competition from the hostel, full of bouncing topless female students. Too stupid conspiracy includes the gray-haired Bert Reynolds (in the role of Khosg "Boss"), threatening to turn Hazzard County into a mine. <br /> <br /> ** Herzogs Hazzard (07/27/05) Jay Chandrasekhar ~ Seann William Scott, Johnny Knoxville, Jessica Simpson, Burt Reynolds
