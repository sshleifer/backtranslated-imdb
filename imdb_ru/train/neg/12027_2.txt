I saw this movie in the middle of the night when I was browsing through the channels, and I had nothing more to watch. This is one of those movies where you stop to see what it is - for a moment! - but be aware that after twenty minutes or so you simply cannot turn it off, no matter how bad it may be. One of those films, which is somewhere in the middle: it is so bad, it is good and so bad, well, in general, just BAD, it's worth a look to experience confusion, realizing that this and that and that! Excellent fare in the middle of the night, if only for the fabulous burden of tennis. Do not even ask yourself why no one can say that Chad Lowe is obviously a man, because logic does not apply.
