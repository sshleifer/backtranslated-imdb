Returning (again) to Scotland, Lassie (again) is tried for his life. Since the faithful dog sleeps on the grave of its owner, it must be put to death according to the law. Strangely enough, it is also explained that Lassie did not have a “legal” owner, which also seems to contradict the old Scottish law. If after three days the owner is not found, the dogs must be destroyed. Edmund Gwenn (in the role of John Trail) refers to the case of Lassie, which leads to an extended memory, showing the adoption of Lassie by Donald Crisp (as John "Jock" Gray). <br /> <br /> Although it is based on an interesting original story (“Bray Greyfriars”), “Lassie's Challenge” repeats several earlier situations of Lassie; and it does not improve them. Comparatively speaking, this is sloppy and uninteresting; and this disappointing continuation of The Sun Rises (1949) *******. Geraldine Brooks (like Susan Brown) and a few other performers may be charming, but cannot raise this one. Little Jimmy Hawkins (from “This is a wonderful life”) is one of the famous children who support Lessie; much later, he will grow up to marry the Dark Shadows, enchanting Angelica (Lara Parker).
