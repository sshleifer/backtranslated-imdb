When I first tuned in to this morning news, I thought, “Wow, finally, some entertainment.” It was a bit funny for a week or so ... But we have to put up with it, these news reporters (if you can even call them that) TOO MUCH "game around" time. <br /> <br /> At first I thought that Gillian breathed fresh air. But seriously, this woman does not have the slightest journalistic in her. She is very unprofessional. She continues to interrupt Steve when he begins to inform viewers about a particular news story. It just gets really annoying to such an extent that I can no longer watch it. <br /> <br /> Gillian is NOT a good journalist. Damn, she's more of a celebrity who likes to be a celebrity. Consequently, she instantly turns into a celebrity around celebrities with whom she should interview. She is not very professional and probably thinks that her relationship with celebrities is more important than being an insatiable journalist by right, and that is all I can say about her. <br /> <br /> In addition, (disappointingly) this show has more entertainment news than the necessary news about the world, the government, the United States or something that will benefit and / or serve the interests of society. They are too focused on sensations, so that everything they talk about turns out to be a commercial product. On the other hand, their reporters are tolerant with interest ... <br /> <br /> I believe that "Good Day LA" is for young teens and celebrities, and this is definitely not for people who really care about the news . <br /> <br /> Side note: (I would really prefer to see KTLA. However, they sometimes try hard to have fun. Although they are still a bit boring. Oh, well, I will stick with NBC Today ABC Good morning, America "is also good ... until Diane Sawyer becomes too serious.)
