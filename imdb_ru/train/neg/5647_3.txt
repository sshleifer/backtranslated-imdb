We bought this series on DVD because of all the glowing reviews we saw here. I gave him three stars, because there can be no doubt that sometimes acting, directing and composing is brilliant. In fact, they are so brilliant that we did not see the propaganda, which was so smoothly passed on the show. If you look at it with discernment, you will see the whole litany of the radical beliefs of the right wing, proclaimed by Fox News (Faux) News Network. In order not to give out any spoilers, I will not indicate all the dozens of specific cases. A short look at the plots found here on IMDb will reveal that everything, from torture to gun control, to the right of the network, to provide “Commercials” and call it news, is justified by cute plot twists and passionate speeches delivered by some of the best actors. . in the world. We watched a lot of shows and finally gave up in disgust when they justified torture, using Attorney General Gonzalez as a vivid example of why all forms of torture should be used to protect all of us. The series also manages to humiliate men and women, using them as plot tricks depicting evil people. In general, the complete litany of the radical religious right wing. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, the popularity of this program will be used by future historians as proof that America lost its way at the beginning of this century. As a student of history, I would describe this program as being in alliance with Goebbels' propaganda for Hitler and some propaganda produced by Hollywood for the American audience during World War II. <br /> <br /> So if you If you want to use this as a teaching tool to help your students understand how there can be hidden propaganda, then by all means do it. Be sure to buy an inexpensive used copy to avoid the enrichment of the far right in the Faux Network, which produced this parody.
