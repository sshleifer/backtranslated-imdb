Well, well, well. No matter how good John Carpenter’s first entry into the “Master of Horror” is, it’s the exact opposite. He, of course, proved that he was still a master of horror with “Cigarette Burns,” but “Pro-Life” is probably the worst I've ever seen from him. <br /> <br /> This is stupid, absolutely devoid of a terrible atmosphere, stress, and it is welcome, despite the fact that the work time is less than an hour. The script is meaningless, the characters are irritable and unattractive, and the conclusion is absurd. <br /> <br /> And for those suckers who actually bought a DVD (I was one of them); Have you seen Carpenter describe the movie? He is really proud of it and has been talking about it for a long time as his best work, and he praises the script. And in the comments, where he notices an obvious mistake that reached the final part, he simply says that he did not feel the need to correct the mistake, and he simply allowed her to be there. I am afraid that the old master has completely lost touch. I sincerely hope that I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I want to stay on a positive note and mention that the effects of the creatures are amazing. Technically speaking, this film is top notch, with effective lighting schemes and makeup effects.
