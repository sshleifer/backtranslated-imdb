It is true that some fans of Peter Sellers may be disappointed with this, his latest venture. But surely any Sellers fan will find delight in all his films, simply because of this man’s tremendous talent. and Dr. Fu Manchu's “Fiendish Conspiracy” is certainly no exception. Unfortunately, this will be Sellers’s latest film (it was released even after his death), but it’s still nice to see how a man managed to retain his irreplaceable talent until his untimely death. And we not only get one Vendor, but we get one, because Vendors play not only the main role, but also his sworn enemy, the equally strange Nyeland Smith, a detective in the hunt for a crazy 168-year-old Fu. This story is equally strange as we follow Fu’s outrageous antics to make him an age-defying elixir, as well as Neyland and his team of assistants trying to stop him. Like in any other big movie of Sellers, the film comes with guaranteed flawless performance from him, as well as from many of his familiar faces - David Tomlinson, Sid Caesar, John Le Mesourier, Clive Dunn and Helen Mirren, to name a few. It is also nice to see that the clumsy member Panther Burt Kwouk (Cato) plays a cameo with Sellers - although it plays the same role, it’s still nice. The story is really quite funny, as are many of the characters who see it as a film under the strong influence of Guna. And, although he never reaches the heights of Guna's comedy, there are many funny jokes that seem to point in the right direction. The film failed commercially at the time of its initial release due to the mourning of the whole world after Sellers died (the film was released less than 3 weeks later), and always at the thought of Sellers being, the last movie is hiding in your head This is not an excellent film - it is often slow, too ridiculous, and sometimes there are simply no jokes - but nevertheless it is a pleasure - at least for another great performance by Peter Sellers.
