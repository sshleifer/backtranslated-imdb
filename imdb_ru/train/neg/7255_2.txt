I was not particularly impressed with this film, which has a dull music and lasts only 40 minutes. Thank God, because I fell asleep. I use slow motion perfectly to show the passage of time in the movement of light and shadow, people, water, clouds, etc. Unfortunately, that's all there is. <br /> <br /> I prefer the predecessor, the excellent Koyaanisqatsi, made in 1983 in 87 minutes and proved that the sequel could be better than the original, Powaqqatsi did in 1988, lasting 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Try both.
