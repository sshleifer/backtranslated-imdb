Perhaps I could not find the DVD menu item for PLOT: ON OFF. Obviously, the default is set to OFF. When the last credits began, I could not believe that that was all. As our poor but handsome main character, I felt used, dirty, cheap .... <br /> <br /> The characters were drawn in very broad strokes, and the author’s contempt for rich takcherits was obvious. I consider myself a "Roosevelt Democrat", but I would appreciate a little more subtlety. <br /> <br /> Of course, the problem may be with me. I see that many others seem to find some meaning or message in this picture. Alas, not me. <br /> <br /> The only thing that prevented me from giving this “1” is the beautiful landscapes, people and plants.
