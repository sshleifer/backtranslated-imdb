If the writer / director reads this (and I believe that you, since you should now be out of work), then I have to tell you - I have seen some bad films in my time, but this one gets the difference in that I have the worst premise. Have you ever heard. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS - Nothing happens! <br /> <br /> A complete waste of time. I laughed out loud at the end. <br /> <br /> HINT - (if the whole film was in a coma, then the scene where she sleeps with this guy means that someone raped her when she was knocked out?) <br /> <br / > Absolute rubbish.
