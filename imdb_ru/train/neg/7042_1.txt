It must be one of the worst films ever made. Even for a biker movie, this is the bottom. The minimum conspiracy includes a biker gang that captured a small city (as originally!) And the attempts of citizens to repel them. Why don't they call for help from outside? Who knows? The fight scenes are obviously fake. In it, Adam West and Tina Louise, but both can do little, and both look ashamed to be there (for obvious reasons)
