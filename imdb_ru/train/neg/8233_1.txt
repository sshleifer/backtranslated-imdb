It was probably the worst movie ever. I could actually do better, it was not even set up properly. As if this film had a budget of $ 5 and it was left with change. Do not look. I didn't even go through this whole movie, I had to turn it off. I gave it 1/10 because it was funny how the producer of this film wanted it to be a horror movie, but it really turned into a really bad comedy. In fact, a bunch of girls ran into the car, broke the headlamp, and the owner of this car followed them. The piece that I saw is women with a gun, telling lots of girls to take off all their clothes, what the hell? he must be some trashy porn movie as well.
