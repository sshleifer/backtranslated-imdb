My husband rented it at a video store, thinking it was unknown. (He never reads a synopsis). <br /> <br /> Well, it would be funny if it were watchable. This is simply not the case. The same thing over and over again, without intrigue, and WHERE did they find the lead person? The main character, Michael Des Barres, is not even very good, especially for this role, which he is given. In addition, sexual harassment at work - is that, if you want, ride the “Disclosure” of Michael Crichton. At least, Michael Douglas looked good in the early 90s. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul, who can usually be watched, plays an awkward scene here. There are also light effects cheaper than your webcam at home. Don't even waste time renting it. 0/10.
