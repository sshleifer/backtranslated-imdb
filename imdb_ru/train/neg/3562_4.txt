"Indian burial ground": if these three words appear anywhere in the list of real estate, look for another area. A young couple with a small daughter and teenage son moved to a house in Maine, adjacent to the pet cemetery, and after walking to an ancient Indian burial ground. It seems that the Indian land can return Fido or Fluffy from the dead - if you don't mind having a mad hell beast for a pet. It can do the same for dead people - if you don’t mind killing zombies around the house. <br /> <br /> Throw into a busy two-lane asphalt plant, speeding up large rigs, a well-intentioned if slightly vague) old neighbor and one child who really doesn’t get enough control, and I think you can figure out what's going on from there - excessive, illogical mess, which, frankly, really offers a little scary. <br /> <br /> Well, there are some of Stephen King’s worst adaptations (such as Maximum Overdrive, which King also sent). But there are much better ones (for example, Lot Salem, the Dead Zone, and both versions of Shining).
