I watched this film very late last night, and usually, if it is already late, I treat films quite condescendingly. Although I tried, I just could not bear this film, it became worse and worse as the film went on. Although I know this is a comedy, but I have not found it very funny. It was also a particularly unrealistic and haggard depiction of rural life. If one of you thinks that this is village life, this is definitely not the case. I have to agree that some of the actors were cute, but the French guy was really fake. I have to agree that he tried to learn a good lesson from history, but in general I recommend that no one in 8 would watch him, this is too annoying.
