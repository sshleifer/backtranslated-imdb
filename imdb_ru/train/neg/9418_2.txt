This is a weak film with a difficult history of abbreviations and renames. It does not work at all. First, the drama is not so. At first he moves very slowly, and then hastily and unsatisfactorily moves towards the end. But there is also (and this may be due to abbreviations) a difficult movement between genres. It begins with a thriller, which must be taken at face value, and then degenerates into a farce, and not into satire. the finale may be funny, but it is also so stupid that I almost felt that it offended my intellect (which is not enough). Thus, the film tries to be everything, but in fact does not achieve success at any level. You can also see this in a very unstable character development. You almost get the impression that Connery plays three roles, not just one.
