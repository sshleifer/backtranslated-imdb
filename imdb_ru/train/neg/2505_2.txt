I’ve seen Enough Richard in interviews and in performances, and poor enough Leon, stuffing himself into these musical biographies of the 50s and 60s, to understand that Leon was not the right actor for this role. Leon was as human as David Ruffin in The Temptations, but completely unable to grasp the essence of Little Richard in this film. <br /> <br /> Actor Miguel Nunez, who played Little Richard in the film “Why Fools Fall in Love?” was a much more suitable choice, removing the strong but feminine personality of the musician. <br /> <br /> If the performances are inconclusive, then the film will also be. And this is what happened here. Shaded or missing entirely are LR raids for homosexuality and voyeurism. The fact that “Temptations” did so well to capture the growth of the group, warts and all that, this film misses a wide mark. <br /> <br /> What's going on with director Robert Townsend, who started out so well with the Hollywood Event? He is a talented, funny guy, but did not put anything to that first effort.
