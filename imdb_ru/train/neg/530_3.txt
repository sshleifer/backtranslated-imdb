I saw it two days before the official opening, and I must say that I was extremely disappointed. And I have to put most of these problems on a decision to put Claire Danes in the lead. Depending on what you think about the Danes, she was either terribly wrong, or so excited that she should be the first favorite of Razzy for the Worst Actress of 2007. I think we should have sympathized with her. Instead, it is absolutely incredible. Other "great" actresses do a good job, but, of course, do not light up on the screen. Of all the "great" actresses in this film, I would say that the best work is Natasha Richardson. The strip is barely visible in the picture and appears only at the very end. <br /> <br /> Awful script. This is more like reading the lines than actually “in character”.
