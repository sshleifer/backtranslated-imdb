About 4 years ago I liked this movie. I would watch it again and again and again. But now ... I don’t Actually, I think this film would be great for Mystery Science Theater 3000. There are a lot of comedians (Macaulay Culkin, Christopher Lloyd, Patrick Stewart, Whoopi Goldberg) and a pretty funny story. My favorite part is when Culkin rides his bike and meets a gang, and the gang member says, “Hey, Tyler! Where are you going? LUNA? ”Also note the classic line“ Do you feel in your fingers? ”<br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is better than“ Good son ”.
