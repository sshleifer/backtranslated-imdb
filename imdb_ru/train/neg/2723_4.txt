It seems that Claire Denis films are divided into two categories: violent and bloody or quiet and intimate. "L'Intrus" definitely belongs to the first category, but it is not as bad as "Trouble Every Day" or "J'ai pas sommeil". <br /> <br /> Now, since I saw Chocolat, I set a goal to see each new film that Denis makes. And I was always disappointed. "L'Intrus" was no exception. She has yet to make the film as personal and as touching as her first. <br /> <br /> You get a lot of Denis regulars: the older but still gorgeous Beatrice Dalle, who seems to be present in the film just to show her full lips, a gap between her teeth, enough splitting and a pair of good coats ; the black guy from "Trouble Every Day" and "J'ai pas sommeil", Gregoire Colin, and this Lithuanian or Russian girl. The character of Michel Subor was quite interesting, but the camera lingered on him for such a length that I was annoyed by that curly hair comb hanging on his forehead and felt relieved when I think somewhere in Korea he finally cut his hair . <br /> <br /> Of course, there was some kind of action - horrible murders, the search for a son by a man - and maybe there was even a conspiracy, but one viewing was not enough to figure it out, and two viewing I am afraid that this may be out of the question. On the one hand, the assessment was sharp and intrusive (as in the “Beau Travail”). On the other hand, the seasons have changed too drastically, which has confused you even more in what is happening. Oh, there were some nice pictures, and if you liked Friday Night with its wrinkles in heavy drapes and sheets, you could appreciate the aesthetics of L'Intrus. Otherwise, stay away. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in French, and maybe I missed something. But the dialogue in the film of Denis rarely amounts to more than five pages with double spacing and sufficient margins. In "Chocolat," silence is sublime; in "L'Intrus" it's just boring.
