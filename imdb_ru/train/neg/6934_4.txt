So, obviously, in 1955, people thought it was a good movie. <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for the fools who still think so ... This is complete nonsense. <br /> <br /> The story is simply true. .. funny. Characters are absurd caricatures - but this film is not meant for satiety, I'm sure this is a serious drama, isn't it? <br /> <br /> Dean and the others are too old for their roles. People say that Dean is great in this film, and maybe he played his part as well as he could. His character must be 16 or 17 or so. But Dean was 24 years old when he made this film. See how he agonizes and throws little tantrums, like a 4-year-old boy ... that's a pity. <br /> <br /> Natalie Wood is gorgeous, but the first scenes at the police station, where she cries and whines, are very unconvincing. It creates a bad precedent for the film ... and otherwise you feel that every time one of these badly played emotional scenes appears, you shrink. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it was good for him. time, but, in fact, is nonsense. <br /> <br /> It must have been a sensation about the death of Dean, which inflated the reputation of this film.
