I can’t believe that I spent 80 minutes of my life watching this horrible movie, I continued to hope that by the end it would be better, but I was wrong. The plot was terrible, the game was very bad, and the special effects were terrible. Even two beautiful girls could not revive my interest in this boring and bloody mess. However, I cannot lie, some of the lines in this film were quite memorable, for example, when an Asian boy says: “I lost my virginity because of my nanny, so that the **** stereotypes” <br /> <br /> please do not waste time for this accident if you are not ready or do not want to laugh .. maybe this way you can watch it to break this movie with some friends
