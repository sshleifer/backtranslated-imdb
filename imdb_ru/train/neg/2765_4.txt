How this movie was made with a budget of $ 70 million and without re-equipment, I do not understand. Storyline and dialogue outside amateur. Characters say something that no real person will ever say, and almost never react to what has been said before. It seems no one was grounded in the real world. The acting role is good, considering that the scenario is so stupid ... but a few actors on secondary roles really drag out the production. The hero's hair probably should have received his own credit, it was so strange to attract attention ... not to mention the fact that it gave one of the best ideas in the picture. Finally, for the movie that LA besieged by giant reptiles, this film is terribly dull. What a disgrace! If you see this, your mind will constantly beat, coming up with ways you could take SFX scenes and build a much better film around them. Unfortunately, it would not take long.
