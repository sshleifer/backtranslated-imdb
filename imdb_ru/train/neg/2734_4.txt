But, let's face it ... he got some nostalgic sighs from me. <br /> <br /> The show is so consistently consistent that several hiccups are allowed. I get a new season and just go through them, as if I had 2 days left to live. I like the idea of ​​wrapping it up, but it was rather the episode of the end of the season, which would explain the following: <br /> <br /> Dr.Cox should not be bald for a couple more episodes. The only explanation I can think of is that they changed the sequence of episodes or were forced to re-start the beginning. <br /> <br /> and that, my friends, is damn bald <br /> /> In any case, the show is amazing ... in the seventh season.
