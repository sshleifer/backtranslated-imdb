One of the main shortcomings of this film is that, although the mockery of the pretentious yuppi brings satisfaction, he does not realize that the filmmakers themselves are guilty of being one of those who deserve ridicule. One of the characteristics of these types of yuppies is the vain misunderstanding that they (yuppies) are the only ones that are sophisticated enough to understand art. While the film ignores this feature and instead focuses on their misunderstanding of dinner, I find it ironic that only people who enjoy this movie can boast the same vain taste in movies as the heroes when choosing dinner. If these pompous characters who were in this film had a home video library, I would argue that American Psycho would be one of those films.
