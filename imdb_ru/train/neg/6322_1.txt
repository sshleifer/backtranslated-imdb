It was one of the most stupid and most expensive films against nuclear bombs of the 1980s. <br /> <br /> The idea that a child and a basketball star can “change the world” is rather far-fetched, considering how many “Children's marches of the world” and “celebrity protests” were and are. <br /> <br /> But the idea that the Soviet Union would agree on TOTAL nuclear disarmament, because some children apparatchik learned about the "silent protest" in the West is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> How did the cold war end? America is tough, I dare say, "Reagan" position and the internal failures of socialism. These were NOT peaceful marches, “dying” or films like “Amazing Grace and Chuck”, “Wonderful Mile” or “Testament”.
