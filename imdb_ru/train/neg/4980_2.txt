I just read a review protecting this film, because it had a small budget, and now I get down to business. <br /> <br /> CGI monsters were quite animated, but implemented in the worst possible way. The fight scenes weren't even fights, it was just one actor shot, and then a monster one shot with very interactive interaction. When the monster really interacted, it looked like it was done in painttshop pro. In my opinion, if you have a low budget, you should use models and dolls. They may not seem so bizarre, but at least they interact, just look at Peter Jackson's early films. <br /> <br /> As for the actor’s role, Beowulf did an excellent job, but the rest of the actors either didn’t try or forgot where they were. <br /> <br /> The script seemed confusing to me. In one minute they will speak as if it is a modern day, and next time you will hear Shakespeare performing in a drama club. I'm not saying that it should be all “you” and “what it will be,” but you need to find a close-knit balance so that the lines sound like they come from the same person. <br /> <br /> I noticed one part at the beginning, when Beowulf quoted the Old Testament, which would have been found if he had not conducted the rest of the films, talking about gods and omens. <br /> <br /> In short, this film is very slightly polished. turd but twist nonetheless.
