Stalker is right! A girl sees a guy, a girl wants a guy, a girl invents worldly ways to continue to face him, a girl will not leave him alone, a girl pretends to be patient, a girl can't stop talking about him, a girl pretends that she loves another guy (or secondly) he does not pay attention to her, because she is annoying, the girl will not leave him alone. If played correctly, Drake's character may have been charming, but she is completely, completely, relentless in her pursuit of Cary Grant's character, her girlfriend is dull, and, unfortunately, Drake’s attempt to play “charmingly talker” looks like anxiously crazy. Grant, as usual, is good for Cary, but it’s as close to talking on the phone as I’ve ever seen him. The direction is dull, and the dialogue is dull. <br /> <br /> It’s very hard to make a comedy with Screwball successfully, and when she fails, as in this stub of attempt, she is just in nyaet. What's worse, Drake spends the entire film, in need of large amounts of Valium and deterrent manner. It destroys any sense of humor, which can be found in the drier than mummy dust.
