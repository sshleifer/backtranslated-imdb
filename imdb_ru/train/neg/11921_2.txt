I can summarize this movie using 20 words or less. Too predictable for a storyline with the potential to be funny, but instead it makes no sense. You see, 19 words, however, I did not fully pan this click with one star, but instead decided to increase it to two stars due to the fact that Julie Bowen smokes hot and provided enough eye candy to prevent me from ripping the DVD straight from cars and blow it up with the M80. My advice: take the $ 4.00 rent you would pay to watch this movie and just send it directly to me as an advance. Thank you for saving time and frustration with having to sit out during a train wreck. I need to pay $ 50 for replacing your 12-gauge caliber to use this piece of trash as skeet shooting.
