I found out about it a few months ago on the Family Channel, and, having some memories of the series from my youth, I decided to watch it with my 4-year-old daughter. I should have brought psychedelic mushrooms with me because itâ€™s just weird! Not only is it a musical with annoyingly forgotten melodies, necessary foolish effects and cameos of stars that have long passed their collective simplicity, it seems to have been created as someone's good acid trip. Speaking of flutes, British children are too old for this kind of shit ... with the words of Crowley Clown "uuuuuugggghhhhh! What was I?" If you are a big fan of all the work of Sid and Marty Croft, do it; otherwise, if you do not want to get hung up before watching, stay far, far, far.
