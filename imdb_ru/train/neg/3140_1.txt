I think I’ll probably like the new Star Wars movie, Phantom Menace most of all, and he’s probably throwing Titanic out of the water if you’re sorry for the pun when it comes to pure destructive the boxes. office receipts, and thus knock it out of number one space. Every time I hear someone say that “Titanic” is the greatest film they have ever seen, I think to myself: “You don’t see a lot of movies, do you?” What a parody. You could make 50 good movies that are much better than Titanic and for the same price. <br /> <br /> “Well, he received many awards from the academy, many people liked it a lot,” as someone can say in his defense. Well, many people like Spice Girls, and billions and billions of people eat at McDonald's, but that doesn't mean it's high quality. Yes, millions of Elvis fans MAY be wrong. <br /> <br /> I will be the first to admit that part of the problem for me was the mega-hype on the film. I waited a month or so to see him, and, ultimately, he did not live up to expectations, which simply attracted more attention to the horribly stupid love story. It is true, the "Phantom Menace" is likely to suffer the same fate. but. <br /> <br /> James Cameron’s “Titanic” is. a) a stupid film disguised as a serious historical play. b) a three-hour epic, in which the best moments are given in the trailer. c) a juicy love story without faith or entertainment. d) something remains better for documentary filmmakers than I would have enjoyed much more. e) a movie with arrogance that corresponds to the level shown on a real ship. e) robbery for 3 hours, which I will never return, so the biggest motivation for the time machine I can think of. When I meet a person who has not yet seen him, I say: "I would like to exchange places with you." g) slap any genuine victim of hypothermia. How long should we believe that people can be immersed in cold water and still make clear sentences? h) Fortunately, a film that was not recognized for any acting achievement at the Oscars. i) technological advances in filmmaking and a little more. <br /> <br /> The only reason I publish this as an anonymous comment is because I DO NOT welcome the refutation of 10,000 thirteen-year-old Leonardo DiCaprio fans who, no doubt, come to his defense and I don’t very interested in hearing the protection of the history of the Titanic, its action or duration.
