I saw it when he was in the theater, he started so hard that I mean that in 1980 it was a bold film, and the special effects were excellent at that time. Now you should have had at least 30 or so in 1980 to truly understand this point, because studying a film does not historically correspond to expectations set at that time and other related psychological factors. Now, as I said, the film was interesting and entertaining. Then he will reach an excellent climax ... It ends, I mean the person who described it as a broken ball of water in his hand before throwing it, besides the fact that it is a very poetic description. In my experience, it was just not enough. My wife and I were healthy ... how can I say this? We were upset, I mean, we paid the money, spent the time watching the movie, which was excellent. “We both felt that we were robbed with an ending that convinced us that the production company did not have enough money and we could not raise enough money to finish it properly. In fact, my wife said that it’s better, this is not the end, IT JUST STOPPED!
