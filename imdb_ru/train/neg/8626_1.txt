Looking through the other comments, I am amazed that there are no warnings for potential viewers about what they should expect when renting this garbage. First, I rented this thing with the understanding that it was a well-made fake by Indiana Jones. What I received was one of the most offensive films I remember trying to sit down, making it even more shocking because of the relatively high performance of the film. <br /> <br /> I don’t think this is a spoiler, but if so, be careful ... <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​entertainment is to watch Bimbo being raped from behind by Scary Leader To the tribe, while she looks into the dead eyes of the severed head of her significant friend, by all means rent this film. If not, then I would advise you to look for entertainment in other places. <br /> <br /> If you think this scene sums up the film so succinctly that I have nothing more to say about it.
