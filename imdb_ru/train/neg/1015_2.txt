Pathetic ... worse than a bad movie for television. I can't believe Spacey and Freeman were in this film. For some reason, Morgan Freeman's character constantly speaks and says "pussy", meaning the girlfriend of the NSync guy. Morgan Freeman is simply embarrassing to call women "pussy" ... What the hell were the people behind this movie? Too many plot holes that you can imagine, combined with a terrible game, tangled camera angles, an unconvincing scenario and cheap background music made this film absolutely unbearable. <br /> <br /> I rented this flop with low expectations .... .. well ... it really sucks.
