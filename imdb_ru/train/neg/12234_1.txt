I think it was pointless to shoot the second part of the film, like My Girlfriend. My Girlfriend was a very good film, but itâ€™s ridiculous to shoot the second part of the film, in which one of the main characters dies (Macaulay Culkin, like Thomas J.). The story was finished after the first movie. I wonder why someone tried to find a way for the story to continue? It was pointless!
