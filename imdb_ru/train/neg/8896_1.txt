I saw Brigadoon on TV last night (September 12, 2009). I am 61 years old and I watch films as much as I can remember. I can honestly say that Brigadone stands alone as the worst movie I've ever seen. Accents were shameful. The local kids club would prepare the best kits. The characters were so wooden that they probably picked up the dry rot from the tears of patrons who had the misfortune to watch them. It is to be hoped that the stars of this film had thick enough skins to protect them from the embarrassment they must have suffered upon seeing this film. The owners of this scar should be of great service to humanity and destroy all copies of this film.
