I admit that I liked the first one, and I was really looking forward to the continuation. <br /> <br /> I was let down. Of course, the special effects were technically amazing - but they did not look believable. It was more like a cartoon. Well, I confess that I like 80% of the chase scene - but the fight with all Mr. Smiths? It was too obviously animated. <br /> <br /> I can take it all. What I can't accept is that the parts without action were crap. Every time Morpheus opened his mouth, I knew that a speech was waiting for me that lasted forever and meant nothing. <br /> <br /> I was also disappointed with the little story that existed. This film told us that in the first film there was no truth (except for the existence of the matrix). This film was a bit like an episode from Dallas, where you learned that the entire previous season was a dream. <br /> <br /> Ugh! I want my 7 dollars back!
