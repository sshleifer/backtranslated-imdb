Why such a common name? Santa Claus??? So soft and unpredictable. Previously, movies tried to make money on a festive spirit, especially “Santa Claus conquers the Martians,” at least it was interesting to watch because of his courtesy, and all the frames used ... for some reason, it seemed happy to me. But this film simply brings Christmas to the ass and pleases all children. Does Santa live in space? His enemy is the devil named Pitch? Does Santa get help from Merlin the Wizard? How random is this !? Well, since it was made in Mexico, some of you might understand how the movie was made. I had to admit that some effects were just wacky for that time. It was a general accumulation of madness! Although, despite all the problems with the film, it still resembles a Christmas movie. Good triumphs over evil, and Christmas still plays a role in our hearts for every good girl or boy in the world, or perhaps in the universe, thanks to Santa Claus, the Martians are winning ... obviously. So, I think you should try, even if it’s one of the worst holiday movies of all time ... although it should bring a smile on your face on any given day.
