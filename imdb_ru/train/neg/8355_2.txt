Wanda Nevada is a fictional fantasy film that uses 1979 ideas about what constitutes an illegal novel for 13 year old girls. Scenario, pace and direction are equally terrible. Sequences of actions are not amenable to faith. Characters speak with simplified diction, which is usually found in films aimed at a set of up to 10 years, but also include several sexual references with the participation of the character Shields, as well as graphic deaths. <br /> <br /> A film at some level wants to be a comedy, but it is never funny, an adventure story, but the plot and action are boring, but a children's film, but presents pedophilia and rape of children as real possibilities. It also wants to be a picture of a friend, a picture of coming of age, ghostly cinema, Indian spiritual cinema, travel and western. The overall effect is tremendous nonsense with an unpleasant incline. Wanda Nevada is a waste of time if you donâ€™t want to see a lot of amazing shots of the Grand Canyon. What he manages to do is just fine.
