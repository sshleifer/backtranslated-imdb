As a person who loves chase scenes and was truly intrigued by this fascinating real-life story, I watched this film with optimism, but too many obstacles prevented the good story that it should have been. <br /> <br /> BAD - I'm a fan of Robert Duvall and many of the characters he played, but his role here is boring as an insurance investigator. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is tasteless and cute. Catherine Harrold is real rubbish. From what I read, there were several directors who succeeded each other in this film, and this is very bad. You can tell the story is wrong. I also could not be "connected" with the image of Treet Williams about Cooper. He was supposed to be charming, but he was not in this film. It is also a kind of sad commentary that the guy who committed the crime is a kind of “national hero”, but I admit that I, too, was rooting for this guy. <br /> <br /> Not everything was disappointing. I can not complain about the scenery, from the lush green forests of Oregon to the desert in Arizona. <br /> <br /> I would like this film to be remade and made better, because this is a one-of-a-kind story.
