Well, firstly, this film sucks. But let's look at why. The statement that the machine is capable of converting matter into energy, storing it, and then transporting and recomposing it, at least, is intriguing. But this is as far as they accept this premise. Instead of delving into what might happen if someone makes such a machine, they will break this damn thing. This could be a good prerequisite. To live with the responsibility of this kind of power and to deal with the constant temptation, i. E. Invisible person. But no .. they break this damn thing. And Lembach wants to leave. Then the doctor collects things again and tries to transport himself. Just to be deceived by his beautiful, but stupid secretary (yes). What would have happened if Lembach had not decided to leave. So now he wanders around the countryside, killing people, because his little experiment failed, and they would not give him money. Wah. Then, to make the film worse, add a dry British relationship between two semi-competent professors hired to help him. Between loving sessions, they make a couple of half-hearted attempts to find him while he kills half of London. All this could have been prevented without breaking this damn car, which would not have happened if Lembach had not gone. I tried this movie, so I give him an honest 2 stars for the effort, but it would be better if they didn't break this damn car, forcing Lembach to leave, forcing him to try again. Damn you Lembach !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
