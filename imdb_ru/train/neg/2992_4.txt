Along with the slasher films of the 1970s and 80s, the walking dead films were probably the second most popular horror genre. While the slasher films were “Black Christmas” and “Halloween”, all the zombie films were “Dead”. And it is not surprising that soon after the success of his first two series, other directors wanted to make money. Many Italian filmmakers were particularly interested, for example, Lucio Fulci, who brought us Zombies a year after Romero “Dawn of the Dead” Romero. known as "Zombies" in Italy and some other countries, and it was there that the film Fulci was known as "Zombies 2". In addition to the walking dead, he has nothing to do with Romero’s movie, but is itself a good movie. It was a great success in Europe, and a continuation appeared after 9 years. <br /> <br /> Pros: a lot of beautiful, lush landscapes. Awesome rating. The acting is not very good, but the cast is a game and seems to enjoy the experience. After a slow start, the pace moves like a movement. Lots of cheese and unintended fun for bad movie lovers. Good job on makeup effects. Lots of blood and some decent blood. <br /> <br /> Cons: practically less plot. Nothing you have not seen before. Frankly breaks some things from the first couple of the films The Return of the Living Dead. Cardboard characters. He didn’t get too old because of the bad rock music of the 1980s (I'm not saying that all the rock music of that period is bad), the clothes and the overall feeling of the film. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: First of all, this is not a real continuation of the cult classic Fulci. In fact, I don’t know if it was supposed to find out where this film stopped. For those who do not know, Fulci was ill during production and eventually left and was replaced by Bruno Mattei. Matthew's films are quite funny, but, like this film, many of them are very funny. And this is all that is actually in this film, just for fun. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5 (rating is bad, good) 2/5 (serious rating)
