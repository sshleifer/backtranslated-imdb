The choke can have strong elements of the porn industry truth - but this does not do for the fact that it is a rather poor director and acted. - and with a very mediocre B class script <br /> <br /> from the start to an incredibly long finish. <br /> <br /> It would be embarrassing to think of the general public offering this play as an example of creating a modern gay film. <br /> <br /> Let's hope he has a limited period of participation in the festival of gay films and he is allowed to die a natural death on video. <br /> <br /> This film opens the Queer Film weekend in Brisbane on April 10, 2002. I think his success there will greatly depend on the amount of alcohol used at the previous party - they will need it.
