The Good: <br /> <br /> Effective color range. Nice costumes. Top quality production. Well detailed CGI buildings and vehicles. <br /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> <br /> A terrible mix of actors with all the CGI actors mixes Fifth Element with Final Fantasy. CGI actors look even worse than video games a few years ago. Vicious logic. A giant pyramid appears, and no one explores it, no one even wonders? And there is no explanation why the god Horus was even banished, and there was no reason why he should do something as trivial as to soak Jill? <br /> <br /> Ugly: <br /> <br /> Awful script. So many unnecessary scenes with too many ideas that are not fully implemented. The dialogue was almost ridiculous in some moments. Random characters and events that are not needed. Boring characters. Jill should be this mystery, but apparently it was just a mystery to the writer. There is nothing for her. It is not interesting and boring to look at it. She has no substance, no texture. Her character has no redemptive qualities. In fact, there is not a single character in the entire film that has any goal, any goal (except for the obvious Gore), any motivation. They are weak and ill-conceived. No bids - the key to writing the screen. Horus will not become immortal, but, by and large, he is a bad guy. You can't even decipher whether Chorus or Jill is the main character. That's the problem: dedicating half of the film to each character means that the writer never fully explores one character, never realizes it. These are cardboard cutouts that walk and talk and do almost nothing but explore the beautiful scenery. The first time the director Slow, slowly, slowly. I'm still watching a movie when I write this. I can not pay attention because it is boring. Everything is flat. Even the action is not interesting, because it is short-lived and sometimes not needed. <br /> <br /> In general: <br /> <br /> Not worth watching. Worn history, the development of characters below par, a banal CGI does not save the production of good scenery.
