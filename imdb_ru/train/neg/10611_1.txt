The terrible game of Potter and the flat plot without tension, as before. As for the feminist controversy, it is ridiculous. I saw this trash when it was first released, and, although I found it tedious, incredible, I'm glad I went to see it. This is because I now have an immediate answer to the question: "What is the worst film you have ever seen?" Plus, I am pleased to know that every film that I watch for the rest of my life will be better than the tango lesson . But I have to admit that I was impressed with the way Potter wrote the script that would collect the maximum number of artistic council grants from around the world (as shown in the closing credits). <br /> <br /> I saw Orlando very recently, and I see Potter drawing the wrong lessons from this movie. All it took was a bunch of frilly costumes, a few hard looks of the lead lady at the camera and a free storyline to seduce a movie going out to the public. So why shouldn't she think that she can get away with indulging herself, what is a Tango Lesson?
