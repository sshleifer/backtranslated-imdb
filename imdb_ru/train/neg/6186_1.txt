Suzanne York makes a mistake - bright young Jane Eyre, and her game is impeccable. However, Edward Rochester must be 35 years old. Gray-haired George Scott looks and behaves like arthritis 80. Uncle Jane died in better shape! He squeaks and growls, nasty and gloomy. He looks like an ax murderer who sent his ax to sharpen; we are not surprised that he keeps his wife in a cage in the attic! The great love story looks like a sadomasochistic nightmare. There is enough darkness in the novel, but Rochester Bronte is relatively young, athletic, strong and charming when he wants. He has a good speaking and singing voice, a good mind and conscience, which he unsuccessfully tries to strangle.
