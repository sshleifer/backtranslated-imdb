So, I, like most people, give me free tickets, and I will go and see most of the things, now that multiplex cinemas are so good (I remember the old one-screen flea cinemas, and Iâ€™m a good 40) In England, this film was released as "Liar", this is a dog. It is a complete waste of good celluloid. 4/10 for photographing and installation only.
