Horror movies can be very funny with a low budget, a bad game and a bit of frustration. I think that the film simply lacks a panacea, because, one bored dull scene after another, people make ridiculously innocuous claws with airborne claws. If it were not so boring, it could be funny. <br /> <br /> A horror film can go a long way with such a weary concept as “children from college in a haunted house,” much as much as evil. Dead films had a lot of fun with a similar standard storyline. Hallow's End, unfortunately, does not go a long way. In fact, it is not going anywhere. He spends most of the hour setting up faceless and anonymous characters with something like an endless interpersonal drama. I have nothing against character development, even in horror films, but these are strictly one-dimensional characters (alpha male, milquetoast, ... um ... disposable characters that exist mainly for sex scenes.) Spending more than forty bloodless, the humming minutes with them were worse than when the bloodshed began. <br /> <br /> Well, in any case, bloodshed is meant. When kids from college turn into everything they are wearing for their haunted house (someone from vampires, someone in OR clothes and some kind of white pancake), they look almost the same as in their amateur haunted costumes; Dead hate To live using a similar theme is a masterpiece in comparison. In fact, there is not a single cackled speech or real fright. <br /> <br /> I thought about it from almost any approach. If it were to be a tough, tense horror film (which would explain why everything was happening so slowly), pitiful sex scenes and cheap monsters would nullify it. If it was supposed to be a real horror film with blood and guts (which would explain the devil) ... where are the blood and guts? And anti-climax is one of the inconclusive endings of the film that I have ever seen. This is the film that, although it does not have a narrator, was added off-screen commentary, because the whole pointless dialogue was not enough. <br /> <br /> It was a difficult movie. ... coming out of this, I wonder, I just watched a Christian horror movie. Maybe "I know that hell exists" the discovery was not so, but there are some hints (or the wrong direction - I'm not sure which one). Despite all the profanity in the film, such a line as “damn it” sounds a bit absurd, like most of crucifixion worship, piety and horror of Satan, especially after some depraved T & A sex scenes (one heterosexual, one lesbian). <br /> <br /> If this is a Christian company (the Highland Myst logo is even a bit like a crucifix), then this film is very important for an atheist camp. An omnipotent being cannot be such a bad director. <br /> <br />
