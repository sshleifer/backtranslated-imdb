Ariyaun Albright is a really good actress, but why she participated in this unconvincing parody remains a mystery. What could be funny turns into classic boredom. Ariauna's unique feature is that she can act just like looking very sexy, unlike her partner Lilith Stubs, who looks great, but itâ€™s obvious that she spent the money on an acting school in a spa or beautician. It was a production that required some T & A, and the author of scripts with creative imagination could achieve this in the flow of things. However, Ariyaun does everything in the circumstances and to some extent saves his reputation. Tempe should know that when you dress two attractive women in a meager police fetish, the audience will expect fetish games and T & A.
