The script was VERY weak without enough symbolic arcs for you to care a bit about the characters or what happens to them. The script is too talkative, and there is not enough blood or action to even call it a slow step. The story comes to the point that you just want everyone to be silent and die as quickly as possible, so that you do not have to listen to how they talk about this very muffled hard dialogue. From a technical point of view, the music mix is ​​too high and difficult to understand what they say in most cases. Again, this can be called a blessing. In general, the same story would have been better told in a short film with a duration of less than 30 minutes. Obvious “in your face” tribute to Sam Raimi and the Evil Dead would be good if they were more subtle, but here they seem more like a naked face. Come on, this kind of 35mm budget and IT is the best thing to do? Nevertheless, cinematography, lighting design and frames were really very well made.
