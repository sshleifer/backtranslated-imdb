This is really a horrible movie. The plot (as it is) is completely indecipherable. (I think this is somehow related to blackmail, but I'm not quite sure.) <br /> <br /> Half of the dialogue consists of useless clichés. The other half is written by various actors in such illegible imitations of “southern” accents, so that (fortunately) words cannot be recognized. <br /> <br /> But the only real tragedy of the film is that such historical talent since Mary Tyler Moore was obviously in such dire financial or personal circumstances that she ended up in it. <br /> <br />
