"John Hughes son wrote a school drama! Wow!" I thought checking out the movie information here on IMDb, late on Saturday night, when I found myself watching the opening credits on BBC2. <br /> <br /> I just finished watching it, and unfortunately it was downhill from there on. You may not be able to spoil this poor movie, but I will leave spoilers in this review ... <br /> <br /> They have a lot of style and he has little material: unfortunately, the style doesn't date too well for eight years since its release. As a matter of fact, the film tries to present an interesting look at the nature of control in society through a microcosm of school life; but under brilliant plywood, a remotely significant or relevant argument cannot be realized. The characters are drawn in childish broad strokes, falling into the generic stereotypes that the writer's father sought to question in the Breakfast Club. <br /> <br /> Directed by Kyle Cooper does a decent job, maintaining the pace (perhaps relying too heavily on editing information, which soon becomes a tedious device, but at least pushes the story), but don’t diminish his efforts enough bad script and weird actors (as someone has to side with Maddox, when Blake Shields jumps and sneaks through the role, I just can't understand), not to mention the numerous gaping holes in the plot (I'm all for a creative license but when the “bad guys” know are the identities of the “good guys” who make their lives miserable, but they cannot stop them at all, do you really have to wonder why this script was not subjected to several more alterations before staging - did dad even read it?). <br /> <br /> I’m sure that a younger audience can enjoy this film (and all the power for them)), but they’re better off sticking to the results of Hughes High School, and if the idea of ​​school time rebellion is what is really In my opinion, the classic “If ...” of 1968 is a much more satisfactory study of the subject.
