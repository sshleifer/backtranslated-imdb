You should not be shocked when I say that Alone in the Dark is a crappy movie. Simply put, it is as if the dung monster defecated, ate the result, and then vomited it. The final product still eclipses this film. <br /> <br /> Apparently, based on the ancient (!) Atari video game, the film has something to do with the portal to the bowels of the earth, unleashing demons and ancient civilizations. Something in two worlds: the world of darkness and light. (Guess which one of us is ours.) Oh, and 10,000 years ago a truly super-dude and advanced civilization opened a portal, the demons came up and blew up, and then destroyed civilization. That is why we have never heard of them, quite comfortably. <br /> <br /> Christian Slater, possibly Heathers yearning for days and pumping volume, is played by Edward Carnby, a paranormal researcher with whom something bad happened when he was 10 years old. He is hot on the trail of one of the artifacts of a developed civilization. Carnby was part of a secret institution called 713, which tried to figure out what happened to this long-standing civilization. But Carnby believed that he could not find the answers he was looking for, so he left the group. <br /> <br /> But, you see, these animals do not exist, and they get their prey in various ways, such as gutting them, dividing them in the middle, embedding neurological control devices in them, or simply turning them into killer zombies. Yes, this is another zombie movie. <br /> <br /> This is about how I can make the plot. It is rather confusing and incomprehensible. In such films, you can see how a fearless explorer / adventure seeker deals with something step by step, and when we mentally communicate with the audience with the researcher, it is a lot of fun. But when the scenes go from attack to attack without any perspective or context ... not so much fun. <br /> <br /> The action is terrible, with the exception of Slater, who (although he seems to be embarrassed by what is in the film) showed that he is capable of carrying the acting load. He should have been; get it - Tara Reid is on display as museum curator! Honestly, I thought that I had seen casting for life when Denise Richards was chosen as a nuclear physicist in Tomorrow Never Dies. But Reed here corresponds to Richards, a trashy emotion for a trashy emotion. Among the highlights: Reed utters "Newfoundland" as the "New Earth of the Fund", Reed transmits most of his lines in a dazed, guttural monotone (sort of like she was up all night at sunset before filming), Reed is the curator of the museum, notice that you spend a lot part of the film in the top, wearing the belly, and jeans to the hips. Oh yes, she was as believable as Jessica Simpson, who gave stock quotes. Oh, why should the cute ones be so stupid? (Note: I don’t think Tara Reid looks so good. It looks like she constantly needs food.) Almost all the other actors are completely forgotten, with the possible exception of Stephen Dorff, who was played by Burke, one of the leaders. of 713. Dorff's character was not terribly well developed, but there was nothing in the film, from the sets to the characters and Tara Reid. But I digress. <br /> <br /> In any case, the perplexed and extremely ridiculous storyline is complicated enough to understand how the film moves at such a dizzying pace, but director Uwe Boll throws into an amazing, heartbreaking soundtrack; it's so loud that you can't hear what the actors say in some scenes! It can not be true. However, given the acting level, perhaps thanks to Mr. Ball. <br /> <br /> Yes, and a funny note. The opening moments of the film include narration ... words that crawl around the screen at the same time. Remember the first Star Wars? You heard this already familiar Star Wars topic while the prologue crawled. There was certainly no need for narration; Why do I need some kind of fool to read what is on the screen for me? Did manufacturers just look after blind people? Perhaps this also explains why the soundtrack was so loud - they also looked for people with poor hearing. In addition, the narrator inexplicably found that the first few lines were crawling, and then lost it. Quaint. <br /> <br /> Alone in the Dark is a loud, intoxicated mix of terrible game, rambling script and cutting hand. Hardly a note sounds. There is so much chaos there that the public simply stops caring for the characters and the roots of their demise. Even in darkness, demonic creatures seem cooler and much more advanced in comparison. <br /> <br /> Ironically, since there were only three people in the theater, I watched this film Alone in the Dark. I wonder if Uwe Boll planned it like that? I can't give it the lowest rating because I had low hopes of starting with him — and because he never grabbed me enough to start worrying about it. It's terrible, although Slater buys himself a little.
