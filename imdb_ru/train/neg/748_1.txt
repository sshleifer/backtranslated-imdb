I love movies, and I will watch any movie to give it a chance. Finally, I can say that I have found a film that I cannot watch to the end. The action is terribly stale and monotonous, CGI looks like a computer fan who did it in his mother’s basement with minimal software, and ... long scenes just ... walking !!!! And this film lasts three hours !!! I didn't even have 15 minutes, until I quickly sent the DVD. Scenes with aliens are very short. Mmm, instead of calling this “War of the Worlds”, let's call it “War of long-distance walking.” It cost 5 million dollars! What are they spending money on, a dramatic opening song? <br /> <br /> Yes, but on a positive note, you need to watch one scene when aliens first start killing people. It's funny, not because people die, but because when they turn to skeletons, they still writhe 20 seconds later. <br /> <br /> So ... as I said, if you are a lover of boring, stale, inactive movies, here is your DVD collection. But I didn't write it for you, I wrote it for billions and billions of other people who would hate this film. It is not worth your time or money. <br /> <br /> I know this is a book, but the book is not so long, and I'm a complete worm / nerd / geek / whatever, but why? Just get the version of Steven Spielberg, it is not so good, but 10 times better than this !! <br /> <br /> I give it a BIG, FAT ZERO of 10.
