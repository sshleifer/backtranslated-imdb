A famous show master enters the elevator with his girlfriend. Suddenly she kills him and runs away, and an elderly woman has a heart attack. The name of the female killer is Sava. She still goes to school and works for the evil criminal Akai who sleeps with her. One day, Sava finds out that she killed her parents. <br /> <br /> ------- <br /> <br /> Even the biggest anime fans will have to admit that this horrible fighter is the frustrating blood fest. Kite has a style, but it's still trash. A strange plot about a teenage girl who kills people when the killer tried to be both frightening and touching, and this only affected the story. One of the highlights is the sequence of actions in which the good / bad heroine Sava falls along with the bodyguard from the building, but the dramatic structure is not as well organized as the strange and grotesque animation of the director Yasumi Umetsu on the characterâ€™s faces. This is terrible. Moreover, the sequence of communication is simply terrible. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10
