Famous Japanese director Takashi Miike seems to be unable to make the wheels move with this torpid thriller, an adaptation of Yasushi Akimoto’s book about a wicked old woman (and a child offender!), Which is part of a new urban legend: if your mobile phone rings in a strange tone - and you see “One missed call” message - you will play the message only to hear your own last words before dying. The most successful part of the film is a creepy satyr from the Reality TV cameras, which invades future victims, but not so elaborate deaths (which include a hidden piece of red candy!) Disappoint and depress. Frequent shots of devastated corpses are actually shown quite unnoticed, and this general politeness may be the reason why the film is ultimately so revealing. Hollywood predictably jumped on a contrived story in 2008, but the US version was no better. NO STARS from ****
