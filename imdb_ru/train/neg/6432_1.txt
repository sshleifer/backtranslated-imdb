The name speaks for itself. Joe's Tail Shooter was a tag given to a senator who relied on public ignorance about World War II aircraft. The guns moving in the opposite direction rested on the latch, which would not allow the rear arrow to shoot at the tail of the aircraft, not allowing the weapon to shoot when it is aimed at the tail. When the senator once practiced on the ground, he managed to bring down the tail of the plane. He could not have done this if the gun had been properly aligned. The artillery officer responsible for this publicly admitted to the camera that he was guilty - he made a mistake, not a senator. The fact that the film did not cover this fact shows how one-sided it is. This film was designed to do one thing, to destroy the reputation of a complex person. <br /> <br /> A much better program was specially made for him in PBS. He was a hardworking, intelligent, ambitious politician who overcame extraordinary shortcomings in order to rise to extraordinary heights. He made some mistakes, some serious mistakes, but shooting the tail from the plane was not one of them. <br /> <br /> The popularity of this film is explained by the fact that the public likes simple stories, one-sided stories, so that they donâ€™t have to think.
