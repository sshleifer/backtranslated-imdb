Two qualifiers at once: I really think that Joe Don Baker may be good or even great with the right material and the right director (a remake of "Cape Fear", a small role in "Goldeneye", "Walking Tall"). And I even liked Baker at Mitchell because he played an anti-hero, which was supposed to be incredible. Yes, the MST3K coverage was fun, but they made a lot of cheap shots at Baker — which he didn't deserve — to keep life alive and interesting — it matched the level and tone of the film, and it was the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> “Final Justice” seems more similar, but, despite the exotic locations and the theme of “cowboy justice,” it is somewhat weaker than Mitchell. And the main reason is that the character Baker, as written, is an idiot. In the film, it is conceived that, since Baker embodies the bordering style of the old style, he challenges his opponents in quick-draw competitions in the style of mano-and-mano. And since he is so cool and macho, he always wins, even when he is hurt, wounded, in the minority, and so on. <br /> <br /> This vanity has great potential (it worked for Gary Cooper), even condemns the film on the status of the film "B". But Baker is so damn stupid and obsessed that he unnecessarily challenges three of the bad guy's minions to disassemble in a public market where civilians are everywhere. He CAN just send them to the main bad guy's headquarters (that is why he followed them first), and they would never have noticed. Or he could get them and make them surrender, and make one of the minions take him to headquarters at gunpoint. But no, he has to be a hot dog in the Bush league and a macho pig, and so he gets the child hostage in a subsequent shootout! <br /> <br /> Is this the guy we should admire? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is basically one. Most of the supporting actors are somewhere between OK (henchmen) and pretty good ones (the main bad guy and his father, who are two well-known European actors - they just go through the movements, but they are professionals and even try to cope with it. Decent ones) . But through all this, Baker's character makes stupid, unproductive stunts and mistakes that kill at least two relatively innocent people, as well as a couple of bad guys who could be killed without using lethal force. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, since 90% of the film takes place in Malta or in the Mediterranean, you can see many beautiful landscapes and many beautiful and exotic-looking add-ons. Indeed, Baker himself may be in a difficult situation and slightly dyspeptic, but he is not so bad ... of course, not the thug whom the critics of this film (including Mike and Bots in their hilarious lighting) seem to think <br /> <br /> In short, this film is good for video wallpaper, but the viewer should not pay any attention to it.
