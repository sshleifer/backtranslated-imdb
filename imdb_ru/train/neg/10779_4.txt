I found that this film was a complete disappointment. The talent available to the director, in particular, Stanley Tucci, Chris Walken, Hank Azariah and Alan Arkin (without even mentioning the four main roles), was completely wasted on an unfunny, mediocre story, the conclusion of which in fact should not anyone got acquainted with horrible stereotypical characters. Julia Roberts is weak, Zeta-Jones is just annoying (it seems that her role is repeated with high precision, without humor), Crystal just plays her old hyperactive, neurotic, irritating alter-ego, and Cusack just goes through her role. Apparently, boring from the whole project. <br /> <br /> For what should be a “romantic comedy”, there is absolutely no romance between the central characters, not to mention chemistry, and as for the comedy - (possibly SPOILERS) well, the only moments of soft humor occurred in the end of the role of Cusack in Grosse Pointe and his relationship with Alan Arkin, a screenwriter, clearly unable to show any originality at all. (Spoilers) Azariah was pretty funny, since the Mexican lover and Walken made a rather funny turn as a parody of a director like arthouse-maverick-Dogme - but these parts made very little time on the screen, and instead of that (Spoilers) we were treated with Billie Crystal his groin sniffs a dog. Pure genius. <br /> <br /> For a big fan of most of John Cusack’s works, not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast, I was completely disappointed with the film with a lot of good ideas, and at the same time not wanting to explore or clarify any either of them, instead resorting to the same old genre stamps, and even sometimes stooping to the depth of an almost “rough, youthful cinema” of humor. <br /> <br /> Very poor 4/10.
