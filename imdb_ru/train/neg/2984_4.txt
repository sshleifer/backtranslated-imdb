I admit that most of this movie was boring, but I was still having fun. He has a wonderful feeling of violent energy, music is above average, and the women in the film violently defend themselves, there are no ghosts here. I can recall dozens of other films that were much worse, at least it had an intriguing storyline along with some social commentary. They refer to how the military cope with viral epidemics, destroy everything in sight, even if it means the people you need to save. Also, how dangerous martial law can be, because at this moment democracy ceases to exist. Fulci seemed to be trying to combine his earlier works (zombies, the gates of hell), trying to somehow improve them. He failed, but definitely not with a bang, as many think. I have a weak point for zombie movies, so I admit that I am somewhat biased when it comes to watching them. All I want to say is that this film is good once, if there was not so much descent in the making of this film (Fulci threw and Bruno (I can hack with the best of them) Mattei took over), this could be much better and more focused. It will remain in my collection as the Fulchi Zombie Swan song. One surprising note that there is a scene in zombie 3, where a person from a cemetery really blew, I myself could not believe it, check it out, you will be surprised.
