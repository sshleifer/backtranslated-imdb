Even when I watched this movie with a teenager, I was surprised how ironic it was that Pia Zadora starred in a film about an artist who slept upstairs. Such a beautiful and sexy, like Ms. Zadora, even she could not keep this pitiful excuse from tanking the film. Even her photo shoot for Penthouse, in which the Lonely Lady advertised “in those times”, could not keep this film from tanking. The only thing that could save this film? A completely different scenario. Give it a miss.
