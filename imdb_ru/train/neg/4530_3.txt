SHARING SECOND, may have been a good movie. In the story of a road rage kill, he tells of a young Clive Owen, who performed quite well; BUT ... but .... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the filmmakers blew up their own film with the help of idiotic camera work and truly horrific editing. The camera jumps all over the creature in an unsuccessful attempt (I suppose) to reflect Owenâ€™s stress on business, family and traffic. In fact, this causes the viewer a headache. <br /> <br /> Since the filmmakers did not care about creating a good film, but only to impress each other with their idiotic photograph, one should not waste time on this parody. ,
