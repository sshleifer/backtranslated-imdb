In the HOUSE OF SPIRITS, stellar power is enough to create another galaxy, but the final product is quite controversial. The film and its messages are very noble, and I think that perhaps the majority will agree with them. (Liberal democracy is good, violent fascist regime is bad; openness is good, racism is bad, and so on. D.). Unfortunately, we deal with it from head to toe, and we use as many subtleties as I described them. <br /> <br /> In the end, we were left to watch very noble people without any flaws competing with nasty cretins who do not have redemptive qualities. He radiates all the uncertainty of a poorly organized “professional” duel. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons plays the patron, a man of many contradictions. Meryl Streep as his gifted bride and Glenn Close, as her sister-in-law. When the camera stays with these people, the film tends to move, and this is quite nice. Unfortunately, "THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS" includes too many scenes, and the characters appear and leave the picture, as the targets of the shooting range. We do not recognize them, so we do not care about them. The result is boredom. <br /> <br /> If Bill August, the director and screenwriter (from the book of Isabel Allende) lengthened the film or shot several characters, this film could work completely. In its current form, it was a good attempt, with good messages and a stunning yawn. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
