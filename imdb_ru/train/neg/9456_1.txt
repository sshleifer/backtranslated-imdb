The sun did not shine, it was too wet to play, so I went to the movies on that cold, cold, wet day of dating. <br /> <br /> “The Cat in the Hat” was the name of the film. and when it was all over, my stomach ached. <br /> <br /> Mike Myers played Cat, his humor was lame, and the children should not see it, the humor was not tame. <br /> The film was like drinking milk from a mad cow, so it was fun to have fun, but the filmmakers didn't know how. <br /> <br /> In short, this film is terrible. The game was bad, the plot was too much altered, and the humor was surprisingly very rough. <br /> <br /> It all starts with Conrad and Sally, the rule breaker and the sheriff’s future. When their mother needs to go to work, she forces Mrs. Kwan to look after the children. Perhaps the only funny part in the film is when Mrs. Kwan watches a Taiwan courtroom, a la C-SPAN. Soon she falls asleep, and here comes the Cat. <br /> <br /> The film starts to spin out of control. The cat came to try to entertain the children. He has item 1 and item 2, which suddenly begin to smash the house. He improvises a commercial and accidentally cuts off his tail. And when the Cat is filled with Carmen Miranda, it is not funny. Perhaps his only funny disguise is a hippie activist. And there is a fish that is trying to warn children about Kota. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that he did not warn us that this film was as funny as sour or chopping off the tail. <br /> <Soon, children on the street are looking for a family dog ​​with a box key on its collar. If the box is not closed soon, their home will be home to the Universe of Cats. It gets a little more interesting here, but that's not enough to save the film. <br /> <br /> Overall, the game is terrible. Mike Meyers introduces his cat to his disrespectful Austin Powers humor, saying something like “You're a dirty ho,” and imagine that you are a woman for the rest of your life after hitting your testicles, posing as a pinata. Spencer Breslin is great as a Conrad causing problem, and Dakota Fanning is good at Sally, although they alone are not enough to save this terrible analysis of the aorta, waiting for John Ritter to be killed (an accident that is waiting to happen). Smooth and slimy Lawrence Quinn Alec Baldwin is disgusting, ever tried to care for the mother of children played by Kelly Preston. And Shaun Hayes - Mr. Humberflub, mom's boss, and also the voice of a fish. The last three are also soft. <br /> <br /> In general, if I were a parent, I would not take my children, who are in a great mood, because there are a lot of them and even more. Save 7 dollars and see something else. As the late great Dr. Seuss said, <br /> <br /> It's fun, but you need to know how to do it. Indeed, Universal, stop! Theodore is already turning in his grave. <br /> <br /> As my mother always says: “Curiosity killed the cat.” Cat in the hat * of *****
