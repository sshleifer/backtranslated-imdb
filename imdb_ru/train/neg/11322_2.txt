There is a word for this kind of film, and that word is “crap.” It was shit when it was rolling a VHS, and that shit on satellite re-launches now. <br /> <br /> This can fool you because he has 2 moderately famous names in Kistofferson and Henriksen, soundtracks and beautiful landscapes of the Monument Valley. <br /> <br /> There is also some curly woman who fights a lot. <br /> <br /> If this is all you want from a movie, then maybe this will save you. happy. <br /> <br /> This is still rubbish, though.
