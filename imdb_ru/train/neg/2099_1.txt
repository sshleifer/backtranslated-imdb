ATTENTION: POSSIBLE SPOILERS. This is bad but certain. <br /> <br /> We know that space travel is a risky venture. There is a complex system with great potential for irregularities, radiation, stress-related symptoms, etc., and unexpected things will inevitably happen under unknown conditions. They knew that things could go wrong. In fact, everything went wrong. This is called learning. Of course, Appollo 11 was not safe by today's standards, and it was under great political pressure, but the overall performance of the technology in the mission was impressive. <br /> <br /> Various errors / comments that I didn’t even look up: <br /> <br /> 1) Nixon prepared a speech in case something goes wrong. Well yes. This is what I would do. In the end, it was the pinnacle of propaganda war. <br /> <br /> 2) NASA gives the green light, despite the fact that Appollo 11 is likely to explode. (This is “only” implicit, though.) Yes, that is why they allow people and click to watch almost in real time. <br /> <br /> 3) Ejection of the capsule will not work. As if that didn't work when there was a chimp in it. The one that survived? It was a test launch, and the rocket exploded, the capsule accelerated and landed with a parachute. There is a video about it, you can probably find it on YouTube or at least watch it somewhere. <br /> <br /> 4) One of the respondents said that the explosion would have destroyed a significant part of Florida. I can only assume that it was meant as a hyperbole, because if not, I'm just terrified, how could he have been so mistaken. <br /> <br /> 5) The technology was then primitive compared to today's standards. In fact, relatively primitive software and hardware is used even today, the reason is that it should not fall. This is even worse for spaceships, because their computers must be built from relatively large components that are not very sensitive to radiation. (And in any case, the ship itself must be manned manually, so a complicated steering system like the B2 will not work.) What about the fact that they used “television screens” and not “computer screens”? This is the same damn technology. In fact, television monitors were and are produced with a significantly higher resolution. <br /> <br /> 6) “If this object was not part of a rocket, it could be only one.” We see where it goes. Besides the statement being wrong, who said that it was not a rocket? At the very least, the interlocutor finds out that if something is flying, and you do not know what it is, it is by definition an unidentified flying object. <br /> <br /> 7) Voice overs, as well as some incorrect quotes make it seems that the ship’s radiation foil was actually its hull. What will make it thinner than a spacesuit. <br /> <br /> 8) The death of Neil Armstrong during a training flight is frames that I can appreciate; I have not seen this before. As I said, any technology manifest can go wrong, especially if it has not been sufficiently tested due to what you know is unprecedented. <br /> <br /> 9) The inconsistency between the descending vessel’s trajectory (due to irregularities in the density of the moon) has never been very life-threatening. There was also no "remaining fifteen seconds of fuel", which were actually "fifteen seconds of fuel before they had to interrupt the mission and return to the command module." <br /> <br /> 10) A “catastrophic“ chain of events ”usually leads to a catastrophe. I really do not know how to express it easier. This, however, is a prime example of the rhetoric used. <br /> <br /> 11) A short episode in which one of the astronauts wanders aimlessly and jumps aimlessly, like a cheerful child, and then the voice-over tells us that the reason for this strange behavior "can now be revealed." It turns out that he was walking and aimlessly jumping around like a joyful child. Funny things. <br /> <br /> 12) It is mentioned that upon re-entering all contacts were lost. This is a completely natural phenomenon, and at that time it was so well known that it cannot be bypassed with the help of modern technology. Again, the seriousness of this is implicit, but very deliberately so. <br /> <br /> 13) In the space itself, the shuttle has never been lost, while the voice-over represents this “fact” as evidence that Appolon 11 is a bunch of crap. Appollo 13 was almost lost, but two real catastrophes occurred during the start and re-entry, respectively. In any case, comparing shuttles with Saturn’s missiles is somehow ... well, okay, just silly. Even ignoring this, successful shuttle missions did not seem to be considered interesting to the audience. <br /> <br /> 14) What the hell with a UFO? Even in the context of the film it does not make sense. Unless you assume that this was done for entertainment purposes, aimed at a specific audience (which, it seems, includes people who practically do not understand neither history, nor science, nor rhetoric). <br /> <br /> Even the meaning of the film is somewhat unclear. Catching phrases such as “covered up until now,” “first published here,” but there’s no guilt in the film, no lesson, or anything you would expect from a film made so emotionally. In the good old tradition of sensations. there are numerous interview frames and recordings of fragments that are often out of context or with people about whom we know nothing, except for the “NASA scientist”. Wow, so the astronauts were very nervous before that? Submit it. What does this have to do with the essence of the film again? Oh, yes, what a moment. <br /> <br /> In general, besides the fact that he is intentionally or incompetently inaccurate, it is not even good fun. And believe me, I'm a guy who likes his shitty documentaries; this film is not funny, witty, weird, nothing.
