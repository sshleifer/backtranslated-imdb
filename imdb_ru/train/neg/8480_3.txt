I can't say that this is one of the best films I've ever seen. But on the other hand, I can not say that this is one of the worst that I have ever seen. Ok, so this is basically a girl skating, good at it, wants to go to an expensive school, can't afford it and should get a hockey scholarship. She has to hide her skating secret from her friends. Personally, I did not like the actress playing Katelin. She absolutely could not cry to save her life, just screamed like a baby, pretending to cry to make her own. <br /> <br /> Katelin was just an annoying person. The way she tried to behave all well and useful to people. Also, the part where the two skaters call her names, and they say something about her choreographer, and she says that she “draws a line” made me cringe. <br /> <br /> We all knew where she would go with her and Spencer. Classically, they did not like each other, and in the end it was just typical. <br /> <br /> In general, I think this is a movie to watch if you like to skate, but if you don't mind the main skater is extremely annoying. It is good to kill time in principle.
