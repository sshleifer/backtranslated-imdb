Another of my tricks in the shopping basket, this film gave me exactly what I expected - a bunch of terrible horror with screaming ladies. <br /> <br /> It all started so well - I liked the little introduction from Newsreel that the young couple was exposed to a nuclear explosion and was completely absorbed until the first person caught fire ... <br /> <br /> Since then, the film plunged into frank stupidity and at times it became almost embarrassing to watch. When it turned out that the heroine was suffering from the same state as the main character (the ability to light up her own bunches without the help of a match), it seemed as if someone had abandoned this idea at the last moment ( as they say ...) As for the almost extrasensory connection between the main character and the nuclear power plant, well ... <br /> <br /> The film seemed cheap TAT - if you pay more than 1.50 pounds sterling for this you did.
