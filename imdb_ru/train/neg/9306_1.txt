This film is the worst excuse for a film I've ever seen. First of all, I would like to say that the cover of this film is certainly misleading, if you think you're going to see a really scary horror movie with a monstrous clown, you are so mistaken. In fact, the killer's face doesn’t even look a bit like the front cover, it’s just an image that they must have found on Google and thought it looked cool. Speaking of the things they found and thought it looked cool, this film has a scene where some gangs are looking for a friend in an old forest, and then suddenly the screen turns into a scene where a mother deer brings up their children. in the glow of sunshine ... I mean seriously WTF ??? What does this have to do with the dark forests they wander? I bought this film from a person on the market, hoping that it would be interesting, if it’s not horror, then at least it would be funny, right? WRONG! The next day I gave it to my work colleague who was ridding himself of the plague named S.I.C.K <br /> <br /> As a result: do not watch this film !!!
