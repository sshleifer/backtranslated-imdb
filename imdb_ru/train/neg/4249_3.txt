I didn’t even know that this movie existed until shortly after watching Blade: Trinity, I was idle on the Trinity board, when I saw some users mention that the Wes Craven series is much better than “crap” that Blade, so I’m I did a quick study: I ​​checked the IMDb and RottenTomatoes scores for Dracula: Ascension, and somewhere in the search process, I discovered that this is a continuation of Dracula 2000. I also noticed that there were very strong followers of Wes Craven Dracula for this film, which is a big contradiction with the estimates that I saw. <br /> <br /> Now let's do a brief personal review. I remember watching Dracula 2000, and I remember that I didn’t like him at all, and then I saw how many Dracula points: Ascension just lowered my expectations even more, but again, I’m the person who really needs to watch a movie myself (any film) so that I can form my own opinion. <br /> <br /> When I started watching this film, I realized that it had a small budget, so I’m going to ignore most of v / fx and just think that this will be compensated by history and acting skills, I’m also slightly impressed by some of the actors in this film (Jason London, Roy Schieder and Jason Scott Lee) <br /> <br /> Oh god ?? This film was CHEESE! But cheesy can be interesting, at least I find it quite ridiculous, poor synchronization of sound from rewriting the dialogue in several scenes, the stupidity of the characters in this film. Of course, they all knew about vampires and some basic things, Luke even had a book about it, but did this prevent them from getting infected on purpose? No, it's worse than a slasher, when a girl should get out of the shower and check the noise that she hears, no more than a towel. <br /> <br /> I, too, must have blinked at some point because I am not sure how “Dracula” got the clothes on his body, especially since he is big wild and angry, and I think that if I were in such a situation, I would not want him to wear it. <br /> <br /> So, the movie ends, like any average movie trilogy ?? it is not, instead it is Cliff Hangar, where I now have to wait for the 3rd part of the Heritage. Oh, the entertainment value of Cheesy movies.
