“American Nightmare” is officially connected, in my opinion, with “This is Pat!” For the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> Seven friends (strangely reminiscent of the K-Mart version of the cast of “Friends”) gather in a cafe to listen to the pirated radio show American Nightmare. He is led by a guy with a beard. This is the most exciting aspect of his show. <br /> <br /> Chandler, Monica, Joey, and ... oh wait, I mean, Wayne, Jessie and the rest of the bad single-row gang take everything turns, revealing their greatest fears to the bearded DJ. Without their knowledge, a crazy nurse / serial killer is listening ... <br /> <br /> A crazy nurse starts to torture Ross and Rachel and ... wait, sorry again ... forcing their fears to come to life. Such fears include such staggering as "voodoo", and older women with removable dentures. <br /> <br /> No. Really. <br /> <br /> In short, this film was rotten. The murder of the Mad Nurse lacks motivation, there is nothing that would make the viewer jump, hit, and finally voodoo? <br /> <br /> If you don’t care at all about your loved ones, rent an American Nightmare with them. <br /> <br /> If you care about your loved ones — even a little — go to a local blockbuster , rent all copies of the American Nightmare and hide them in your freezer.
