I can not believe that so much talent can be lost in one movie! The gingerbread man starts off with the right foot, and he manages to create high hopes for the final. But at some point, the film turns into one of the worst stories I've ever spent my time on. It's incredible how enchanted Mallory Doss manages to pull Kenneth Brann's character by the nose. The climax of the movie is as uninteresting and flat as the beer that had been left in the sun for too long. The Gingerbread Man is probably the worst film about Grisham, and this has not changed due to the fact that talented stars crowd in the film. Do not waste your time here!
