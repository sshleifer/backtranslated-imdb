Everything I could think while watching this movie was a B-rank brand. Many have said that his redemptive quality is how this film depicts such a realistic view of the effects of drugs and man and his subsequent spiral into a state of self-preservation of unsuccessful events. However, indeed, the methods used (as many have already mentioned) were over-used and, therefore, inconclusive and not relevant to the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it was dim, unimaginable, implausible and confusing. You can read most of the other stories on this film, and they will say almost as much as I do. <br /> <br /> Of course, some actors and actresses are attractive, but when faced with such boring actions ... it looks like it can only carry the film so far. The action is bad and intermittent: a few blows back and forth, and the final shootout near the end. Nothing special about that. <br /> <br /> As others have said, “bad” films are nice to watch for the very reason that they are “bad”, you enjoy this fact. This film, however, is empty. This is nothing. <br /> <br /> Moreover, if someone really needs an educational film to scare people away from drug use, I would seriously recommend any number of other films that affect such issues to a much greater degree. effective method. “Requiem For A Dream”, “Trainspotting”, “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” and “Candy” are just a few examples. Although you should also watch some more carefree films on the same topic, such as “Forward” (in general, both serious and funny) and “Semi-finished products”. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, we note that one of the possible lines of redemption in this film, produced by Vinnie Jones, was stolen from the film “Lock, drain and two smoking barrels”. To think that part of this wonderful film was spoiled by the movie “Loaded” is disgusting. <br /> <br /> In general, I strongly recommend that you save money and your time by NOT seeing this movie.
