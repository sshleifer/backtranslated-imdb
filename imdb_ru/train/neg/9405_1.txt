I just finished watching it on TV and what can I say, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen! I am ashamed to be from Melbourne where the film was made. Devilish play, amateur make-up effects and REALLY a bad soundtrack. As for the plot, well, it's even more stupid! Some scenes just stunned me at how bad it was. There is a reason why these films are filmed on nightly TV channels - because they are complete nonsense! Avoid at all costs.
