The last of the films of Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan and a good thing, as this is easily the worst of the 12 films that he shot in 16 years. There are also no mermaids here, because a beautiful island woman is trying to break free from the clutches of her people, who worship god and try to make her become his bride. She finds Tarzan and Jane who are trying to protect her. George Zucco is present as a potentially villainous High Priest, but does not fully exploit him. Also on hand and worthy of mention is the extremely annoying guitarist / singer who often enters the song. Even the “great” Robert Florey cannot help this. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of four)
