One scene quite well demonstrates the mentality of the "female terminator": Karen Shepherd and another woman are trying to escape from the camp of villains. Karen stumbles upon an armed guard, who points his gun at her, but after a few seconds throws him out and challenges her. Karen kicks him in the balls, raises his gun and runs away! On the other hand, when a movie is directed by a martial artist and written / produced by another member of his family, you know that you should not expect too much. Karen Shepherd and Jerry Trimble started a funny banter early, and the film could have turned out better if it focused more on their relationship of love and hate. But after about 20 minutes, they are separated, and the film slows down to creep, and even with an episodic fight, in order to revive the events, it lacks excitement. In the finals, Trimble fights Kissy in a cave, and Shepherd fights with beautiful Ashley Hayden in a speedboat, but the fight is interrupted in a way that disrupts their flow and diminishes their value. On the other hand, thanks to the costume department for giving Karen a chance to show an impressive split throughout the entire film! (* 1/2)
