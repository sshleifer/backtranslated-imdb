Unfortunately for Sarah Silverman, this show does not make her completely complimentary. The character is not even remotely cute, and this is not the situation when you think: "Oh, she is, I love her," just "she is so wonderful." This character is just an old virtuous self-confident, angry, damn it. Sarah seems to be struggling to carry this show, because she is the only half-funny one in it. Mood, dialogue, it's all so damn boring and dry, like Listen to how your grandfather continues to talk about the marbles that he collected as a child. <br /> <br /> Sarah Silverman’s program is so incredibly boring that I thought about changing the channel to watch old replays “Married with Children.” it's funny because the characters are so "immoral" and "rough." Sorry, but I don’t find a show filled with dry humor and banal plot lines about some evil, bitter, evil, bitter life of a loser with her annoying, hellish, sister and gay friends who sound like Keanu Reeves with a cold somewhere next to ridiculous. I hate this show, although, as a rule, I find Sarah Silverman "I love her because she is such a wonderful character", as in School Of Rock, and most of her stand up. I think this show is boring with characters who consider themselves evil, speak and do something for the sake of shock, for example. persistent pube, diarrhea and $ hit overall for a laugh. Sarah Silverman’s program tries to be fun and fails, or needs a track of laughter, or the best writers. Someone compared it to South Park, but it's not even close. opinions about the program Sarah Silverman, and I will not become an annoying troll, which means that you will not see that I constantly and constantly publish such things as "This show sucks" and "Why it is not canceled yet." like the program Sarah Silverman, if you like.
