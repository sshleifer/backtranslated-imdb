To shame, to shame, such a wonderful actor like Joseph Fiennes would allow himself to play in this piece of nausea. The film was not only bad, but absolutely horrible and of poor quality. The plot, (was there alone?), Seemed not to go anywhere. Russians played stupid “kill or be killed” games, and the rest of the actors should be declared invalid for their pitiful performances. I passed about 3/4 of the way and turned it off. “1” for terrible just because there is nothing lower. Do not waste your time on this, you do not miss anything.
