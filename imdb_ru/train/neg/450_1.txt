This show is painful to watch ... <br /> <br /> Obviously, the creators had no idea what to do with this show, with constantly changing "places", guys and actors. It seems that they wanted to play Amanda Bynes in something ... but they had no idea what they did with this shitty show. They threw her in her teens, surrounded by twenty-thirty with something, and put her in mostly adult situations in repeated failed comedy attempts. Soon they realize that she needs a “click”, and they are leaving people over the age of 20 to try to become teenagers. <br /> <br /> The way this show has gone through 4 seasons does not suit me. Anyway, ABC has now decided that this is a “family” show, and threw it into his day line-up on ABC Family.
