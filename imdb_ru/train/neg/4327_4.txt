Some funny humor, some unfortunate, some decent act of acting, some terrible. This film is just hit and miss, guaranteed to entertain 12-year-old boys more than any other niche. <br /> <br /> Children-actors in the film are simply unfunny. When you make a family comedy, this is usually a problem. Beverly D'Angelo rises above the material to give a ridiculous and, I dare say, human game in the midst of this mediocrity.
