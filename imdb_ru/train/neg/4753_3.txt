Director F. W. Murnau wisely carried away with a silent cinematographic plot, which he knew so well to cover this story about the life of the indigenous inhabitants of the island in the southern seas. The documentary style works very well for the first half of the film. The landscapes are beautiful and it is interesting to observe the daily life of the islanders. The film, however, loses its strength when it begins to concentrate more on the narrative story of two doomed lovers. The storyline never becomes so interesting, despite the fact that Murnau copes well with it. Won the Oscar for Best Cinematography, although the award probably should have been for the best landscape. You can't give DP credit for shooting in such a beautiful place.
