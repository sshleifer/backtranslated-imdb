Someone will tell Shaq to stick with the fact that he is good at basketball. This film was not even entertaining at the stupid level. In this film, Shaq plays a genie who lives in a boom box - it's not just a gin in a boom box instead of a lamp. He must help a little boy played by the equally annoying Franse Kappra. This film had the most fragile storyline since the days of the water world, the acting was terrible, and I think anyone who likes this flim will be afraid to admit it.
