I do not agree with much of what was written and said about this supposed “masterpiece” of the German New Wave: <br /> <br /> 1) There are serious flaws in the simple presentation, in the main communication of the critical points of the plot, as for abortion Mary and the secret contract between Oswald and her husband. How many viewers understood that the husband agreed, in exchange for a substantial financial reward, not to return and return his wife until Oswald died? <br /> <br /> 2) The ending is extremely unsatisfactory, because it is arbitrary and random. The original script called for Maria to commit suicide after reading Oswald's will when it turned out that her husband had sold his marriage to Oswald. In the final version, however, Maria only draws water from the tap through her wrist as a sign of suicide. Then Maria finally exploded, instead of facing the consequences of self-deception and moral compromise and living with them. <br /> <br /> 3) Fassbinder seeks to forcibly impose the public on a private, political personal. Contrary to what critics and “experts” claim, I do not think it works. Just the invasion of historical broadcasts or the sound of jackhammers of German reconstruction in the soundtrack to the dramatic events of the film does not make these historical events an integral part of the drama. <br /> <br /> Maria’s selfish desire to move from poverty to prosperity is designed to parallel with the so-called economic miracle of post-war Germany. Thus, Maria is meant to be a special woman, reflecting her time and place, but in reality she is unoriginal and non-specific. For centuries, women have defended their independence, using sex for self-improvement. <br /> <br /> 4) Finally, there are several instances of unpardonable negligence and dilettantism - Fassbinder's addiction and subsequent impatience and inattention have had an impact. Unknown people talk offscreen, not noticing them; music is clumsy intrusive in some places; and melodramatic posturing replaces action from time to time. Strange, but for a film that condemns the country for deliberate collective amnesia of the Holocaust, this is never mentioned in itself.
