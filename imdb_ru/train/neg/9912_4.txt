I fully agree with another reviewer who was pleased that For The Birds won an Oscar in 2002 for Best Animated Short Film, and not this sick material, which is at best pretentious and attracts everyone who believes in paradise or hell. <br /> <br /> The animation was good, but there were a lot of animated shorts. And, by the way, I love dark humor, but it was just unattractive from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> As for the story here: a guy walking around and surrounded only by gray (here is symbolism) tells the TV (which appears every few hundred yards) that he is in heaven, in hell or purgatory. Each time he puts a gun to his head and shoots himself upon hearing this news. I think it would be funny in two of three cases.
