This film was strange ... I watched it when I swallowed a quarter psilcybe cubes. It was really weird. I'm sure you should look this high, but the mushrooms were not enough. I could not stop laughing .. maybe lsd will work. A film is a bunch of things turning into other things and dancing. It's really stupid for today's standards, but when it was released, Iâ€™m sure it was good ... one of a kind. I could see how some people think that this film is good, but I did not think that it was very interesting, and I was on mushrooms at the time. If you are having a party or something like that and everyone is well lit, put it on and you will get some laughter.
