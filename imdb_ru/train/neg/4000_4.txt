I liked “American Cinema”, so I made the first film of Chris Smith, which I also considered documentary. In the first minute I saw that it was not, but I tried. <br /> <br /> What a dead end movie. Being truthful is unlikely to come in handy if you're just going to explore boredom, especially. fatigue with which we are already familiar. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but for ANYONE it is appropriate if 1) many jobs are sloped and 2) most of them are crappy, minimum wage work in the service sector ??? I knew this before I saw the movie. In any case, this did not give an interpretation, since the film tries to feel "real" (hand-held camera, no music, etc.), and what happens is unlikely to end, as in the "real world." br /> <br /> Does the employer really please Randy when he takes his check after Randy left him after 3 days, when the guy said he expects 6 months from him? Or the day after he quit his job (and messed up the car he was working on) so that everyone would be so easy with him? <br /> <br /> The big problem is our “hero” (?), Randy, This guy is a loser. Not because he is stuck in these jobs, he has a bad apartment or he looks like him. He is dope. He does not pay attention and does not even try on these works. He has zero personality. If I had to hire someone, he would not be able to go through an interview. <br /> <br /> I look forward to what Chris Smith will do next, but guys, drop the “this-and-that” important film "material." American Work "does not work.
