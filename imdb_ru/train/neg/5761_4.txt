Hollywood does it again. A lot of money, no creativity. I'm sure the authors were on something other than oxygen when they wrote this. Based on the preview, I thought it would be a funny movie. But if you are not familiar with the latest stupid pop culture, you will miss most of the stupid humor in this movie. Why waste your time. You can sit on a log without doing anything and have more fun than this movie. <br /> <br />
