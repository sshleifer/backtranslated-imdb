I know that films do not necessarily reflect reality, but this one is getting on my nerves. This perpetuates ignorant stereotypes about “psychological trauma” and mental illness. Psycho mom was done too many times before (and usually it was done better), and most of the rest of the story is also contrived. The acting was not terrible, but nothing to rave about. <br /> <br /> One of the points: I'm a longtime fan of the general hospital, and it was a trip to see one of the roles played by former GH associate John Lindstrom. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you can skip the fictitious psychoanalytic part, just as a person should suspend reality / judgment when watching a large number of films, then this film can be tolerated. If you have nothing better and reasonably low standards. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I spent the time watching it.
