Of course, if you ask any mother who is the most beautiful child in the world, she will tell you that her son is the most amazing child in the world. She is right, at least in her own world. <br /> <br /> The film was produced by Biggie's mom and his good friend Puffy. Oh, well, do I need to say more? I'll break it for those who don't want to make a simple conclusion. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was a fake. You can just collect some videos from MTV Biggie and call it a movie. <br /> <br /> Beautiful Angela Bassett played mother Biggie. The present in life is like a dog. <br /> <br /> I just wonder why he called himself biggie small. Big body Small dick? Big mouth Small sound? Big fat little eyes? Disclaimer: I am a man of color.
