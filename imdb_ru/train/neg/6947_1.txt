Without a doubt, one of the worst films I have seen in recent years. The plot tells about four women who were robbed in banks, which we should somehow sympathize with. It is difficult to sympathize with the characters who continue to make such stupid decisions. Oh no, the cops to us, they know who we are, what we do? ... Let's rob another bank, then we leave here! What kind!?! Each character is a stereotype, and it is easy to say who will die.
