Draw a story with numbers and a mediocre game, preserved in some genuine color - and a few moments that are truly wonderful and deeply felt. It really reflects the girl’s subtle transition to adulthood and is very sensitive and inventive about the cultural conflict that the main family is going through. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this embryo of a good film is enclosed in an aimless and extremely intricate plot, in which it is possible to include religious strife, conflict over the road construction project, the sex life of secondary and even higher characters, a mysterious person who lives in the forest, a bunch of racist hooligans, at least three different carnival, the subtleties of local church politics, and so on and so forth. And all this does not even include the central plot, which concerns only the hopes, dreams and disappointments of two girls (and their entire families) at a turning point in their lives. I was shocked when I realized that all this had to take place within one summer (and so many films were reached in 1.5 hours!) <br /> <br /> In the end, the film is melodramatic, each plot is Point predictable, important life-changing events take place, and then are forgotten in about 10 minutes ... and some of these events are extremely unpleasant. It is very shocking that one of the characters is involved in a terrible crime (in an absolutely predictable "turn"), and then completely forgiven, and since then the whole incident has been forgotten. In the same way, the secondary character is introduced solely in order to die in a couple of minutes and give another “turn”. This is all completely mechanical, right down to the end, which neatly ties all loose ends (well, not all of them, only those that the film thinks you care about).
