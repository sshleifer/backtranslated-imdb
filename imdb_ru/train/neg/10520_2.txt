The angels, who got a little angry, were banned from heaven and now live in the British forest, where they seduce and cut the teenagers. Let's talk about the high concept. On the other hand, this little mother gives us Tom Savini, but since his range is limited to two minutes of screen time, his five-minute presence seems a bit long. Angels run around the forest bare most of the film, but although they may have an angel body, their faces will most likely look like Joan Rivers on a bad day. Mediocre acting and amateur bloody effects do not help, and the night scenes fatally resemble the most famous film Paris Hilton. So bad that it is really bad.
