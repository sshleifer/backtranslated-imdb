Anita and I seem to be nothing more than an excuse for Mira Syl, the author of the novel and the script, to express their prejudices, offenses and general antipathy towards the British. The general feeling of the superiority of the Indians over the English in this film is dirty. <br /> <br /> Englishmen in this film are depicted as full, cruel, with dirty lips, promiscuous, participating in children's homelessness, stupid, uneducated, racist, ugly, eating bad food and stupid - which is characteristic of only turning to Indian culture , the local priest can be "redeemed" at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, the Indian family is beautiful, intelligent, educated, can speak many languages, caring and loving parents, as well as food for high school. The film is so insidiously detrimental that I am surprised that the BBC financed it altogether. If it were the other way around, the English family in the Indian community would be portrayed in this way, the film would be racist. <br /> <br /> There were a few moments when my eyebrow hit my forehead so hard. I thought it was stuck in my hair. Firstly, the scene of gossip between women in the celebration of Diwali is the subtext: the British are dirty and dissolute, and the men are the subtext: the English women are prostitutes. Secondly, the meal with Anita, where the Nymes family lies to her about the cutlery - the subtext: the British are so stupid that you can get them to do anything. <br /> <br /> But the main contempt for all English - even for English Weddings are the object of contempt - this is evident throughout the film. Anita's character was painted so badly - almost a fallen woman - I ended the movie with a feeling of anger. <br /> <br /> This is not “Bend like Beckham” where humor is focused on love. exaggerating the behavior and customs of the community of someone in this community, and this is a film about two girls from different walks of life who get together. Instead, Anita and I seem to convey that the form of cultural apartheid is inevitable, since the British are almost a version of the Indian untouchable caste, and this is underlined by a series of attacks on the “other” community of the film: English. <br /> <br /> I felt that Anita and I were hate-filled work based on complaints. On this basis, the BBC should not have financed its production.
