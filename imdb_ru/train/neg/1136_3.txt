Every film of the thirties is dated, but if you only watched John Ford films, it would seem more outdated than if you watched the others. The Grand Hotel is a relatively modern romance. With Ford, there is always the trick of someone's nobility (Abe, The Joads). Always reappraising evil some kind of heavy. Always poorly crafted, clumsy and obvious scenarios. This is no exception. This is just a pretty sophisticated device for creating moods. And the mood is all that is needed for this. <br /> <br /> What Ford is doing here does not make me thankful for Lincoln, but just makes you wonder how the states were ever populated with the population of complete idiots depicted here, Ford continued to make decent films. It is too outdated to be bad. It seems completely false. <br /> <br /> Henry Fonda with a fake nose is weird. And no one from Illinois utters the final “S” and says “Shonuff!”
