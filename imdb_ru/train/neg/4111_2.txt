Think of a low-budget version of Syndrome of China, directed by a student of the film who worships John Wu, and you get Power Play. The idea was good, but the performance, actions and dialogues absolutely killed her, not to mention the ridiculous amounts of violence and natural disasters that were used to compensate for the lack of content and the development of more interesting parts of the film. <Br /> <br /> This is the story of a reporter investigating the disappearance of three members of a partisan activist group who mysteriously went missing after they broke into the offices of a power station suspected of causing an earthquake. A rather cavalier reporter going against what should have been a more ruthless group of company managers is being pursued around the city (along with everyone he speaks with) in order to “clear” any convincing evidence that may remain from the mistakes of the plant. br /> <br /> Unfortunately, in reality there is no sense of an emergency, because the characters interact with great indecision, combined with the idiotic dialogue and many horrible actions. Not to mention the fact that the viewer, who is attracted by the film only because of its attractiveness in the action movie genre, is forced to endure a growing number of bodies and an absurd number of violent shots, as well as scenes of catastrophic earthquakes. All attention was focused on the wrong place to apologize for the lack of direction and a more interesting sequence of events that were supposed to advance the story. Perhaps it would be much better if the directors focused more on the thriller and paid more attention to the development of the corruption aspects of this story. Creepy villains, naive reporter and those who are trying to warn the reporter about illegal actions. This is formal, but at least it would be interesting.
