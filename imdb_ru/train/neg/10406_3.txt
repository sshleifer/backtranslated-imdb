Warning: this review contains minor spoilers. <br /> <br /> Well, the authors of the first Tremors are officially out of ideas. I'm a big fan of the first movie, and the first two sequels are pretty good for live coverage. Tremors 4: The Legends Begins, however, is a very boring movie. Where the hell are Graboids ??? <br /> <br /> Due to the relative lack of graboids during the first 90 minutes, I am convinced that this entry in the series is supposed to be a “character study”. Unfortunately, there are no interesting characters in the film, except for the character Billy Drago, who is given too few lines, too little, and as a result, too little time on the screen. What saved the 2nd and 3rd films is the presence of Michael Gross in the role of Bert Hammer. Whenever there was no action on the screen, you can be sure that Burt Hammer will be interested to listen and / or watch too. However, in this film Gross plays Hiram Gammer a very boring and boring replacement. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, when the Graboids (Dirt Dragons in this movie) appear on the screen, they look good, but this is about as good as before. <br /> <br /> I was I was impressed when I saw that Tremors 4 was listed at 101 minutes. Pretty good for live video. But after watching, I'm sure this film lasts 15 minutes. There are long dialogues that are boring and do not promote the plot. Was there a rush to make this movie? I think no, more time could and should have been spent on the script. <br /> <br /> I thought I was in a gold mine when I saw Tremors 4, packaged for sale with ... Tremors !!! Well, it seemed to me, pay for number 4 and get number 1 for free. Well, after watching Tremors 4, I like to think that I paid for the original and got this mess for free, I can't imagine paying one cent for Tremors 4. For fans of the series, it's better to forget that Tremors 4: The Legend Begins even exists. <br /> <br /> Tremor 4: Legend begins with 3 out of 10.
