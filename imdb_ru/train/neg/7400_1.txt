I've seen some pretty bad movies, and this is right there. Nothing to talk about, it's like one of those bad episodes of coma in a soap opera. I just wanted to hit this little girl, because, well, let's say, she is very suspicious throughout the film. The monsters running around, dressed in some kind of trinket, were funny. I also saw a little "Silent Hill" there. And I read that it was done and / or watched the Finnish metal band Lordi. It is therefore not surprising that this did not make much sense. It seems to be a means to promote the group there and nothing more. The fx are very good, the look of the movie, monsters and even acting is also good. But the story and the story about it is simply no.
