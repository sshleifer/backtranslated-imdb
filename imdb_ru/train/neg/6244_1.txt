Mario Lewis from the Institute for Competitive Entrepreneurship has written an unequivocal, line-by-line refutation of this false 120-page film, which should be called “COMFORT FALSE.” The address of the website where you can find his disclosure report, entitled “A HANDSMAN GUIDANCE ON THE WRONG TRUTH”: www.cei.org. A shorter 10-page version can be found at: www.cei.org/pdf/5539.pdf. When you read these demolitions, you will realize that the alleged “global warming” is no more real or dangerous than the 1999 attacks in 2000. Gore also supported, as in the pseudoscientific film Day After Tomorrow, based on a book written by the alleged UFO abductor, Whitley Strieber. Like James “The Awesome”, Randy deals with psychics, and Philip Klass with a UFO, so does Gerald Posner with the conspiracy theories of John Kennedy’s idiocy, as well as Mario Lewis with Al Gore’s film and the whole “global warming” scam.
