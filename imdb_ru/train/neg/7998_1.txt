Not only did he invariably annoyed to listen, but he had no jokes. I swear, some Asian fan boy telling your jokes to your mom would be funnier than Leary's crap. (Well, maybe funny for a couple of minutes, but at least I can laugh at least once!) Liri claimed that he stopped taking drugs during one of his "jokes" ... obviously, he is still was fascinated by something; he was just some kind of stupid scoundrel, mostly drug-related. One of his jokes was something like: "I would not use crack, especially if I had the same name as my ass." Oh man, how did he do it ?! I swear, the only guy who needs to shut up is Denis Leary. Thank God, I did not have to see him live. This guy sucks. <br /> <br /> If you are easily cheered with curses and “jokes” when you can think of yourself, then spend your time on this trash.
