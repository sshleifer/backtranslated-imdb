Seeing how I hate reading long essays in the hope of finding meaning and giving up, I will first tell everyone that this film was terrible. Totally awful. And not surprising for the reasons mentioned in the first review. I thought that I could agree with him, seeing how he awarded the film the title he deserved, but, unfortunately, reproached him by reading his words. I am very ashamed that I take the same side as the one who commented that the film "definitely lacks beautiful women." Let me be the first to say, “Wow! This has definitely been a serious in-depth review. My mind can hardly understand the philosophical reflections on this film. ” Seriously, however, the absence of "beautiful women" should not be considered essential to the film. If you desperately need “beautiful women,” you really should watch other types of movies that don't necessarily fall into the category of science fiction.
