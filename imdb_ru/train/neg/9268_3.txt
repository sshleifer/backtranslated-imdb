*** SPOILERS *** Like some evil combination of the double play Tinkers-Ever-Chance that we have in “Omen IV”, the evil seed of the late Antichrist Damien Thorn returns. His parents, his classmates, his neighbors, and finally the whole world, whom she called Delia York, Asia Vieila, are horrified. After she was given to a “worthy” couple, York Karen and Jean, Fay Grant and Michael Woods in the orphanage of the Catholic Church of St. Francis. <br /> <br /> Little Delia wasted no time in making her peasants feel like scratching their mom at a house party. Later, Delia was nearly killed by a runaway truck, and she saved herself from this “Devil Dog” named Ryder. Going to school, Delia takes care of the local bully, forcing the big guy to wet himself in front of all his classmates. Later, when his father threatened the Yorkers with a lawsuit, her head was cut off as a result of a traffic accident caused by self-induction! Delia is the one with whom you never get involved, if you know what is good for you. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Dahlia Jin's dad himself becomes a big man in the city, or, in his opinion, he is elected to the convention as a protector of clean air and green trees, instead of allowing the concrete boys to take over the surroundings , now watching the White House itself! Was his crappy and strange daughter Delia somehow related to Gene York's sudden success? <br /> <br /> Only later, when Joe, Ann Heeren, hired Delia's nanny, did she learn the truth about her strange and evil. powers Joe, the New Age type, understands that Delia is a bit strange after all her white crystals have turned black, and calls on her New Age Guru Jim Byrnes to come and check on her. Noah is so upset that he sees Delia Kirilian in color vibrations, all black and blue with a little red pinch that scares him so much that he almost crashed into Delia’s mom's car. <br /> <br /> Shot during a trip to the extrasensory festival Joe Delia turns the whole event into hell, which with the help of mental telepathy sets fire to the place and sets fire to all who run there, including poor Noah, who was at the festival and as a result broke a leg. Both shocked and shocked, the Guru was so shocked by all this experience that he later left the country to become a hermit in the Tibetan desert. <br /> <br /> Joe herself was later thrown out, with the help of Ryder's cute and pleasant pet, from the second floor window to her death, because she knew and talked too much. It is when Karen is pregnant again that she finally decides to find out the truth about Delia’s real parents. It is then that she and we in the audience face the truth. She is not only the terrible Antichrist of Revelations, she is his twin sister! Her brother, the antichrist, himself is going to go on the scene, like her younger brother, not yet born Alexander Yorke! <br /> <br /> Thrice it was more than enough for the antichrist to return to earth to summon Armageddon. The public film is already tired of him and his evil adventures. The fourth really is not needed, since Dimen Thorne, the antichrist, was dead and buried for years. We were given normal calls, and no one believed that little Delia was “You” Antichrist, before it was too late to stop her in her death circles destroying the entire human race. The film, as bad as it is, is also too long, 97 minutes, for a horror film, which could well say that its story is only 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> Earl Knight’s personal eye, Mchel Apprentice, and then the former sister of Yvonne’s Catholic nun, Meghan Lech, and now Felici’s healer in the film, which was to be killed, also did not help the plot. It only prolonged the suffering of those of us who watched the movie. You could see that the unexpected ending came almost immediately after the film “Omen IV” began with the clearing of the grounds for the possible seizure by Delia of the civilized and uncivilized world. What was a bit surprising was that Delia did this with a little help from friends.
