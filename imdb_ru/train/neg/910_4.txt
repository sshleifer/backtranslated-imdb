The storyline was very straightforward and easy to understand, and it contained a lot of simple comedies to such an extent that it became boring. Some of the viewers thought it was funny, but I like smarter humor. <br /> <br /> There were several famous Swedish actors in the film, and their performance was not bad, considering the script. Lena Endre looked good, as always. <br /> <br /> I don’t remember the original film, so I can’t say if it’s better or worse. <br /> <br /> If you like movies like Sällskapsresan this movie is probably worth watching.
