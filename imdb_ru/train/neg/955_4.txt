I donâ€™t think that any player in a Hollywood story lasted until David Niven gave most of the weak films that he had to carry because of his incredible charisma. He could act, got Oscar for it, but most of the material he did was as light as one layer of two-layer tissue paper. <br /> <br /> Happy Go Lovely is a case in point. This is a musical, and for the most part you will remember the Faith-Ellen dances. You remember that they are in Scott costume, as the film was made in Edinburgh during their festival. But if you can remember one song from it, you should have a photographic memory. <br /> <br /> The plot is easy. Vera Ellen is the American lead in the musical, which appears to be coming out of the city in Edinburgh. She starts in the choir and is late for one day. She will be brought up by the driver of the millionaire King's greeting cards. Now everyone assumes that she is the main problem of the millionaire. The doors open like never before. <br /> <br /> The millionaire is David Niven, and he agrees with this and with the various situations that are caused by an error. Cesar Romero has a few good moments when he is madly producing this musical. <br /> <br /> In the end, Happy Go Lovely is a light and harmless fluff that David Niven was so tired and tired of.
