The best shorts of Laurel and Hardy are filled to the brim with failures, accidents and destruction, mostly caused by Stan, but with Ollie getting the most (!) Punishment - see the Big Musical Box (1933) or "Towed in a Pit" (1932 ), as some classic examples. <br /> <br /> Here, however, for some reason (because it was made according to the sketch of Father Stan?) The boys play it “straight”. in a comedy built around jokes and supposedly funny situations. It does not come off. This is just another tedious comedy of the 1930s, which is reinforced only by Stan and Ollie’s personalities, who never show their trademark gestures (Olli's finger swaying, Stan’s empty gaze, etc.) Or comic abilities. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the fact that they run away from the police. Since we never see and do not know why, it is difficult to believe or accept their fear of being caught and thus hiding in the mansion of Colonel Bookshot. The package for “humor” was that Ollie presented himself as a colonel, and Stan presented himself as a butler and maid, never to be attractive. They do not play "Stan and Ollie" in this film. Their role could play any of the actors of the pedestrian studio, and he would have been just as poor. <br /> <br /> Stan could emulate and do everything he did funny, but he had no chance to do it all here. He is forced to utter too many dialogues to "move" the plot, but none of them rises above stupidity. We are treated to endless third-rate comedic chestnuts, such as a gag due to the incorrect pronouncement of the name of Lord Plumtri, "Call me a taxi! Good, you are a taxi!" joke, the cops lose their clothes and see them in long john's, not Stan's and Ollie's final finiteness, when the two parts in a painfully obvious horse costume run a bicycle for two, and James Finlayson still makes his whole body of a silent era and jumping into the jungle Keystone Kop. <br /> <br /> Stan and Ollie cope much better with the comedy Sons of the Desert (1933), where we see that they are doing what we love about them - be yourself. In fact, the years 1932-34 seem to be their best years. <br /> <br /> Since this film does not play on any of its strengths, why bother him? I have to give him 3.
