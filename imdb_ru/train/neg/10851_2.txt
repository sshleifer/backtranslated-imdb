This movie was made for Dany (and Cradle of Filth) fans. I am not one of them. I think he is just an imitator riding black metal (nevertheless, I am not a black metal fan at all). But since I carried this DVD case to pay for it, I convinced myself that the less authentic something is, the more it tries to be convincing. Thus, I assumed that riding on a roller coaster with rubber blood and homemade splashes with an ominous background awaited me. Now this is what I like. <br /> <br /> I went home and put it in. My patience lasted 15 minutes. HORRIBLE camera work and disgusting quality. And it was then (2002) that looked as if it was being filmed on a Hi8 video camera. I left it on the shelf. Maybe a good evening with beer and Bmovies will create a good atmosphere for this ... picture. <br /> <br /> After a couple of months, I went back to him (in the said environment) and saw half. Then I was annoyed not only by the mentioned aspects. My dislike has evolved. I noticed how Dani (1.65 m; 5'5 "tall) looked in his shoes on the platform, tearing the robber's head. (Yes, tearing. There was clearly no skull in his head.) I also discovered that this film it may not make any sense. However, I haven’t finished it yet, so I wasn’t sure. <br /> <br /> After a few more attempts, I finally managed to finish this click - a couple of months ago ... (Yes, It took me 5.5 years.) So, Dani was really funny, because HELP to Satan / Manson / super-evil man, and the film did NOT make sense. See, our bad man hires Dani to do bad things. He delivers Why? Well, I think he is just very, very bad. In fact, they are both, and this is largely true. <br /> <br /> We have a couple of short stories that were joined by Dani's character. My favorite was about the guy who stole someone's feet because he wants to use it as his own. Yes, exactly. <br /> <br /> ROCK BOTTOM of the cast. CGI - the worst of all. I mean that Stinger wins him (and, boy, CGI Stinger baaaaad). History does not make sense, and the quality ... Let's just say it does not satisfy. The only thing that can keep you under surveillance is unmotivated violence and blood. Blood and guts are made pretty well. Yes, in fact, you can see that the film originated right there, and then went on. (Example - Dani 'The Man' Filth takes a stuffed cat - fake, how can it be - and gut it ... and then eat what fell. Why? We never know. However, we know that this cat must be , was on illegal substances, because his heart is almost half his size.) <br /> <br /> After my comment, you might think that this film is so bad that it is good, but it is just bad. Cradle of Filth fans can add 3 points. I added one for blood.
