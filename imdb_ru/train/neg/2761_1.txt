Everyone does what later regrets. Things they would like to blame for drugs or alien possession. Things that seemed rational at that time later turned out to be engraved invitations to suffer and endless accusations of stupidity. <br /> <br /> For some, this is a signing note for the new Hummer, for others it is a collection. before the hitchhiker, for others, he sends information about his bank account to third-world millionaires mysteriously tied to cash for others. <br /> <br /> For me it was a movie. <br /> <br /> D-War: Dragon Wars Looking back, I had to guess how clean and carefully reworked the film would be because of its stuttering and repetitive name. But with my willingness to suspend disbelief and the naive faith stemming from a cool looking poster in the lobby, I really wanted this film to work. Unfortunately, by the time the old man at the pawnshop explained the whole background, in fifteen minutes of the picture, I had a sudden, sinking revelation that comes from knowing each point of the plot of the still-invisible film. And what's even worse: I knew how badly every point would suck. <br /> <br /> Let me be completely clear here, in English, there are not enough nuances and depths in the field of absolute evil to correctly describe how bad this film really is. <br /> <br /> With regard to the knowledge of all the turns of the film, I was mistaken. In the spirit of the old films of Godzilla, whose scale does not deserve to be filled, he conveniently grew additional plots every time the main character was threatened by the specter of meaningful dialogue. <br /> <br /> It was filled with close calls, wonderful shoots and concentrated deposits of poorly explained fear. <br /> <br /> This film is what would have happened if you gave the manufacturers of the Mighty Morphing Power Rangers access to the national defense budget. And a lot of liquor. <br /> <br /> Let me try to explain. <br /> <br /> Imagine that you can get all the coolest scenery from the successful militants of the last decade: First, pick up a growing army of amphibians from the First Star Wars Episode and remove Prozac until they are ready to kill the Navy Seals. <br /> <br /> Then take the close approximations of Keira Knightley and Tom Cruise (you can even call him Ethan as a “subtle” hint of the Mission Impossible missionary franchise.) and give them a lot of noir film stories trying to trace the depth of their thoughts. <br /> <br /> Finally, add a sharp-voiced villain in pointy armor worthy of the Lord of the Rings yard, and a pair of giant cobras, evil for the fact that their scenes have been removed from the latest edition of King Kong, and put them in or a certain order in modern day los angeles. <br /> <br /> Now run to the pharmacy to find something for your sudden migraine. When you return, wipe these ingredients until any missed hint of originality dissolves into a homogenized mass of cheese and serve it with a half gelatin. <br /> <br /> In some moments in this photo I found myself saying out loud: Stop a bad movie "and burst into tears. <br /> <br /> Calling it a B-movie means that you deserve it. After summer school and a lot of physiotherapy, it can pass for a level C film if you can somehow sleep much of it. <br /> <br /> In short, if you ever find yourself with money and mind Cell burning and the need to punish yourself for disgusting, unspoken sins against humanity, Dragon Wars can be just a movie for you.
