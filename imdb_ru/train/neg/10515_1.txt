Well, this is a typical slasher film "straight to the toilet." <br /> <br /> In short, a group of teenagers / young people are in distress in the midst of a terrible forest and are being attacked by naked nymphomaniac demons. <br /> <br /> This film has all the basics for this slasher: <br /> <br /> - Naked women, teenagers or young adults who find themselves in some kind of creepy, deadly place - the last remaining alive - a well-built young woman who will always show off her tummy, but never lift less, - a creepy, crazy man who knows about the evil, - the lesbian kissing scene, - sex is a murderer, - there is no conspiracy <br /> Even then, for a crappy slasher film, it was really awful. The atmosphere is absolutely dead. Nothing, even sexually explicit scenes and nudes was not enough to interest a male and lesbian female audience. Watching this, it was felt that he was being watched by an unpleasant stagnation in the head or an unpleasant cold. <br /> <br /> Give the demonic ..... 0/10.
