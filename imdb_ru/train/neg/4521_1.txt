The whole genre of Biker Movie should consist of the worst films ever made. This one delivers many battles, a generous amount of blood, bikers fighting Indians, and a slum city that is blown up and destroyed one shack at a time. The game is beyond horror. What happened to Robert Walker, Jr.? At some point, he was in several major studio productions, and then just disappeared. This film is really blowing, but if you have not seen a film about bikers for a long time, it is worth watching. At the end of the movie you should feel a little disgusting for watching this movie!
