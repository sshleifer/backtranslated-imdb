As for me, I can not understand why someone can make such a film. The plot is tired, the game is tense, the language is constantly dirty, and sometimes excessive use of the word "F" seemed insufficient for dialogue, so "let's add a couple more" F "for good measure that's what the American public wants to hear." Gossett was particularly dirty and seemed to enjoy his role. Forget it c__p, rent a Shrek and laugh.
