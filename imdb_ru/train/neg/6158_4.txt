Once, in the mid-1990s, I wrote for the DOCTOR WHO fan magazines, and the whole fan held his breath about the new American TVM DOCTOR WHO. As soon as Eric Roberts announced that Eric Roberts would play the sworn enemy of the Doctor Master, everyone scratched their heads and exclaimed: “Who is Eric Roberts?”.
