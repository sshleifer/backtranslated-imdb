Oh my God. Some of the best talents of British television made this series, and therefore I can only assume that they worked in conditions of an incredible lack of time, and they had to be content with the first filming of many scenes. <br /> <br /> There are some frightening scenes in this Highland puzzle (mostly when the monster attacks, and we see it from his point of view), but I'm afraid I found most of the story unintentionally funny! For example, at that moment, when the hero discovers a dismembered corpse on the golf course: â€œOh, look, there is a hand ... oh, and there is another hand there ... hmm, this is a little puzzling ... <br /> < br /> For many years, fans of the British cult television show have been agitating for this series to be released on VHS or DVD, but the BBC has always said no. Now I think I understand why!
