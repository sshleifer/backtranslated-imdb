Offering nothing more than the full-length version of the 1970s television hit, American Love, adorned with nakedness flashes, Superchick (1973) is a frivolous piece of fluff that somehow manages to entertain. And the main character here, Tara B. True, really, something like a super. A stewardess (not a stewardess), who is so good that even the autopilot of her plane made a pass over her (!), And with a tough guy in every port, this winged, cool girl really puts "lying" in the "transition". As for her New York-based hermaphobe surgeon, her playboy with gang problems in Miami, and her creatively sophisticated rock star guy in Los Angeles, Tara, of course, remains busy. And when she doesnâ€™t exhaust these guys with all her courageous energies, as the viewer learns, she can attend karate lessons, play clubs a mile high, fight off flashing lights and rapists, attend steep pot parties, and stop attempts to hijack an airplane. As I said, carefree fun and definitely good for the night when you feel a little dead and just want to eat before the pipe. Future astrologer Joyce Djilson brings some meaningless charm into his role as Tara, and the film looks beautiful enough to please. Unfortunately, the lush favorites of the 70s Ears Digard and Mary Gavin (also known as Candy Samples) are lost in very small roles here, but still get the opportunity to do what they do best - show your chestiks! Although the picture is never funny, and in its metaphorical head there are not really many thoughts, it manages to be constantly funny, and I suppose it is something. It is strange that the end credits should draw attention to Mrs. Gillson's double body; I don't think I've ever seen this before!
