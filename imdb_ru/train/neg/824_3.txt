Gene Hackman is being kicked out of jail by an unnamed government agency that wants to kill him. It is, of course, of course, that Hackman has experienced skills for the job. <br /> <br /> Nobody says anything to him, though, he is given, because the audience is given pieces of information. It must be tense, instead it is annoying and boring. <br /> <br /> Hackman completes the mission, but the flight is confusing, and the guy on top of this mysterious creature orders all the dead to cover him. So everyone in the cast is dying, and in the end, you don't care. <br /> <br /> One of the other reviewers noted that the original film was twice as long, almost three hours, and was cut down quite a bit. Perhaps something was really lost in translation, but I tend to think that it was an act of mercy in the audience. <br /> <br /> A very talented cast in which people like Richard Widmark, Candace Bergen, Mickey Rooney, Eli Wallach and Edward Albert were so thoroughly wasted that it was a crime. <br /> <br /> And we never know what all this was done by the federal agency: the FBI, the CIA, the DEA, or even the IRS.
