This is a bad, bad movie. I am a real swordsman: believe me when I say that this filmâ€™s claim to this film. This is especially true during that vile little scene when fencers combine footwork with pop music from the 80s. The ending is predictable, and the film is a bore from start to finish. Horrible.
