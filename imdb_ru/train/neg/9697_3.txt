I saw the first movie about the dwarves, and sometimes it was not enough for me to watch it. In the first part, many famous television and comedians appeared who presented typical small episodes of their stand-up program in fantastic costumes, and this is the problem the second film faces. Everything was already there .... nothing new to get. You are familiar with most of the often boring and stupid “jokes”, and you always feel that their goal was to put every Comedylooser of the last decade who wants to return to the stage. There is nothing important in the story: a typical tale of Rumpelshtiltskin, without any significance. I was expecting something similar, but I could not complain about that. I actually complain about lazy writers who have had a whole story; their only business was to get a lot of jokes and parodies, but they still did not understand. This shit, besides the great looks of Helge Schneider, is a waste of time and money. (If you do not like it, remove 2 points from my score). broadcast every Friday night on SAT1 or RTL for free. I am sure that you will recognize some of the “laughter” that I saw last night at the cinema.
