Horror film I can not believe how bad this film is, what's the point in this film ??? the film is almost 1 hour and 30 minutes and the first 70 minutes, Lena just walks with such a stupid expression on his face after the accident ... doesn’t talk much at all, not even a lot of actions ... a little tiny action ... and it was still stupid ....... and the end, oh my god, I don't know where to start, it also ends with Lena’s stupid expression, lol .. don't get me wrong, I I love Lena Hidi, I think she is a great actress, but I don’t know what made her make this film ... do not waste your time and Motril because in this film, there is no history, no acting ... and it makes no sense ... not to mention how slow the film, and it seems like you're watching it forever.
