When this play was first shown BBC more than 30 years ago, it would have been very different for that time. So for some people it would be pretty scary, and maybe they would be impressed with the special effects? <br /> <br /> Looking at a performance these days, it seems, not everything is so scary. Moreover, even special effects can leave much to be desired. <br /> <br /> Can the train let the RED LIGHT into the dark tunnel? I don’t think so ... but if you watch this performance again, you will notice that the first train that enters the tunnel rushes right through RED LIGHT! (maybe it was during the time of Dickens)? <br /> <br /> You will also notice that the path leading down to the signal box is very steep and in poor condition. Of course, for Signalman, there would be a series of right steps with handrails to climb or descend into the wheelhouse. (I can not fail to notice such things). <br /> <br /> I won’t take anything away from the actors, and Denholm Elliott (the signalman) and Bernard Lloyd (the traveler) gave wonderful performances. <br /> <br /> I'm not quite sure what's going on ...... I mean, was the ghost a traveler, or what ??? Does anyone really fully understand this rather confusing story ??? (well, maybe I'm the only one who does not) ??? <br /> <br /> To summarize ..... <br /> <br /> The play has a wonderful atmosphere, a character. He suffers from the fact that today he is not so scary, and a little, if not very confused in some places, and has some rather unusual alarm methods .... <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading my review.
