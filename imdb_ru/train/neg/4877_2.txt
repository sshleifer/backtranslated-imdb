The work of Frank Capra must have been spent by the time he made this film. Although it has several charming moments and many wonderful performers, Kapra’s frank reworking of not only the script, but also significant shots from his first version of this story, Broadway Bill (1934), is completely indecent. It is clear that he will reuse shots with climate jumps, which is exciting. But he uses entire scenes of dialogue with secondary actors, then returns these actors and, obviously, expects us not to notice, for example, that Ward Bond is 14 years older! If you don’t want to see one of Oliver Hardy’s latest appearances, skip it and look at the Broadway Bill instead.
