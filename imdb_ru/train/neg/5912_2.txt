Enjoying the previous work of Mike Myers (“The World of Waynes” and “Saturday Evening Live”), my expectations from the fake bonds of the 60s were quite high. After the first minute, it became clear that it was an exercise to be as fun and unfunny as possible. I turned off after ten minutes. I watched it the other day a second time to see if I was unjust the first time. I turned it off after ten minutes. I find it hard to believe that even a twelve-year-old boy may find it funny. Dialogue is an accusation, Myers is painful to watch (as is Heather Graham), and the sequence of characters, including Fat Bastard, worsens the situation even more. Besides the slightly funny title and psychedelic scenery, this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I personally recommend that you avoid it like the plague, although several of my friends liked it (perhaps they were blindfolded at the time).
