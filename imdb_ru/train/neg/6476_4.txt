I had high hopes for this film, because I really loved the original. It seems that Disney, however, is trying to perfect the art of crappy sequels right on the DVD. They deserve Razzie. A few, in fact. I thought the idea was a virtue, but the music was absolutely terrible, and the story was not much better. What happened to the great music that Disney had in his films. Mary Poppins, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, the Lion King ... even Hercules and the Hunchback of Notre Dame. Over the years they have shot so many great films, which is very sad that they have reached the point that they began to shoot sequels that are not even good enough for staging in cinemas. <br /> <br /> I hope this film is not a sign of what awaits Walt Disney Corporation.
