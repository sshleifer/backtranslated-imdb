This film had a great cast: Christopher Lee, Dean Jagger, MacDonald Carey, Lew Eyres - all these are b-movie actors. But this hero of the film did not use any of them for any advantage, since none of their characters even met on the screen (although Christopher Lee did play a few scenes with himself). <br /> <br /> The motivation of the aliens in this film seems to change without delay. First, they just want to repair their ship and leave, then they turn on the main character, killing most of his friends and not freeing his wife after he gets them the important role they need. Then, from nowhere, this “peaceful” race decides that they need to destroy the planet, because it causes too many “diseases” (although they do offer the main character and his wife a place in their society). <br /> <br /> Most of the film is about how a man and his wife drive a car, walk, stand or sit at their desks, doing nothing. You almost would like to be eventually killed along with the rest of the planet, just in revenge for having weary to death. <br /> <br /> If you really dislike Chris Lee or the low seventies low-budget science fiction writers, I would give this miss. It falls into that narrow range of lost celluloid between Star Odyssey and UFO: Target Earth.
