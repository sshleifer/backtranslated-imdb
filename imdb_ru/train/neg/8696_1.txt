I'm Anthony Park, Glenn Park is my father. First of all, I want to say that the history of this film and the creation of the Amber Alert system is good. However, the film itself was poorly made, and the game was terrible. The main problem I encountered in the film is related to the second half of the film with Nicole Timmons and father Glenn Park. The events related to this part of the story were not entirely correct. At that time, my father suffered from psychological disorders and picked up Nicole, not intending to harm her. He loved her as a daughter and thought he was saving her from some harm or neglect, which he probably believed came from her mother, who paid little attention to her for more than three years when my father cared about her and briefly raised her so that her mother could frolic. The film portrayed my father in such a way that he was going to harm her in one form or another. The funny thing is that Nicole sometimes spent many nights with my father while Sharon worked or did what she did. The reason my father was originally considered violent was because he had items in his truck that could be considered weapons. My father was a landscape designer. Items that they considered weapons were tools for landscape design, which he kept in his truck for work. My recommendation is to take this film with a grain of salt, this is a good story based on real events, but the details of the film (at least the part “Nicole Timmons - Glenn Park”) are largely inaccurate and reflect the director’s inability to know the truth by telling the story. The funny thing is that if the director had interviewed someone from Sharon's friends who knew the situation, they would have accurately stated what I wrote here.
