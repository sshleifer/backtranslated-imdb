Not quite spoilers, in my opinion, but I still wanted to hide. As an executive producer, Morgan Freeman wants the audience to ignore his character's many absurdities in the movie “10 Objects or Less,” a film with a deliberate indie feeling, and just plunge into a mentor / “all you can” theme a half-washed version of the real Morgan Freeman, who has been living in Carson, Calif., from Brentwood since childhood, to explore his next movie role. Why Carson is a mystery to Co. Cal residents. He could save the trip and go somewhere in the San Fernando valley and find the same elements. Paz Vega is very cute, a cross between Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz, who plays a disgruntled buyer of products in a large but slow local market, which seems to be the main source for Moragn Freeman's research. His character is known only as “He”, and he hints at how actors are perceived in real life by ordinary people - “Psst, this is“ he ”, etc. Unfortunately, I was too distracted that He had all kinds worldly wisdom and advice, but did not have a safe return home to Brentwood, did not have cash or debit cards with him, or had the wisdom to keep a mobile phone with him. If someone thinks so highly of himself that they believe that he has the answer to everything He does, then I have to see cash and a Blackberry that shows intelligence and good survival instincts in order to preserve that big ego he definitely has. Nothing really happens in this movie. I do not believe that any of the main characters was essentially changed as a result of their meeting with each other. It flirts with the idea of ​​adultery, but then this thought disappears. It seemed to me like Steve Martin's shop girl, without sex. It was self-indulgence for Freeman and unconvincing to the audience. ,
