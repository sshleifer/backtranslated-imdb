The story of Norman Maclean is a masterpiece; Redford film - mediocrity. He adds banal scenes in which the Maclean brothers pass through the waterfall, and their double acquaintances in a rundown bar, which was not even hinted at in this story. Cipher Brad Pitt, trying to play the charismatic Paul Maclean, a genius in the open air, is either risky or depressing, depending on what the original story means to you. Some of the fly casting scenes are beautiful. In addition, Tom Skerritt in the role of father and Craig Schaeffer in the role of Norman are strong and courageous, as was once supposed to be men. None of the women make any impression in the film, which is regrettable because Macklin loved women in his history and made it clear, even poetic.
