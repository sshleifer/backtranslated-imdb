This is one of the most hated and cruel films I've seen in a long time. Unfortunately, I was deceived to stick with this, since the presence of Donald Sutherland was misleading. [This is the last time this happens.] <br /> <br /> Lesley Ann Warren's character was vexatiously weeping and as stupid as possible. There were smarter characters than her who were killed in the film. This is one of many things in this film that made me ask: “Where is the justice?” <br /> <br /> Why is the nightly TV show so full of sadistic trash filled with pathological chaos? Most of these films seem to have a particular problem with women, and seem to focus on the fact that they are being terrorized and killed. This film could be just as tense without being sick and perverted in the process. All he ends up doing is turning the viewer's belly with his illness and insulting the viewer's mind. <br /> <br /> The cast is deceptively good. I guess they first hit Sutherland and used it to lure others, like lemmings, into it. <br /> <br /> I beat myself for wasting time giving a chance to this garbage.
