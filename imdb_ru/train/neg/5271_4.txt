Quarreling, an American family, resting in the west, discovers a strange ghost town in the middle of the desert. Little did they know that this ghost town was once a test site for nuclear bombs, and a deadly presence haunted them. I generally like these horror films. Spielberg's The Cube, The Duel and The Birds are great examples of films that do not give answers, but nevertheless leave us intrigued and wanting more. Obviously, the writer / director of The Disappearance, Walter Clenhard, tried to make just such a film, and whether it will succeed depends on the viewer. Personally, I think he moved about halfway through, then the film just sank. <br /> <br /> All the actors are just "ho-ham." They are not particularly bad, but we, as an audience, never feel their fear and react to situations unrealistic. Is anyone else a BIG TICKET of characters just leaving to explore strange sounds?!?!? At least give them SOME excuses for this!?!?!? <br /> <br /> As for films made for television, this is certainly above average. Director Clenhard deserves praise for the fact that he really milked the desert environment for all that he offered, and some of the situation was striking. There is a really cool scene where two characters find an old nuclear test site where the sand was completely melted to glass, as far as the eye could see. I wonder if it was real? <br /> <br /> No blood to say that “creatures” or what the hell is what happens after these people? Never shown, not to mention that they never even give us the real key to understanding who they are (mutants, aliens, ghosts or ancient evil Indian spirits? Oh, it really narrows it for us!) Or where they come from . <br /> <br /> There are a lot of cliches here too. Why are city dwellers in such films always very, very stupid? Why is there always an old guy who everyone thinks is crazy and that turns out to be right? What for? What for? What for? How about a new script guys! <br /> <br /> “The Disappearing” is trying to be different and clever, but ultimately fails, because in many ways it is too familiar to us, the fans of the direct horror. Hey, have I seen much worse movies, and fading is pretty good, just too ?? Average. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
