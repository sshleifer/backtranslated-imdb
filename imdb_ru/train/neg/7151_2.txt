I can proudly say that I have watched all three films “Fast and Furious” and “Fast and Furious”. Of course, the plots are pretty stupid, and maybe they are a bit stupid, but I like their car chases, all the beautiful cars and the secret midnight races. And I’m happy to see the fourth one. <br /> <br /> Want to know the difference between these three and Redline? A decent game, a somewhat thoughtful plot, even if they are action films, and, last but not least, directors who Understand that the producer chose a dozen women with whom he slept on the couch and made them extras. He then took his conclusions from the Hollywood unemployment line. And the script. Yikes.Its Mystery Science Theater 3000 is bad. This 70s for a television film is bad. <br /> <br /> Yes, there were some cool cars in the film, but in fact you don’t see that many are in action, and the action is so bad that you cannot be excited by the chase, If cars don’t care, Why go to this movie? <br /> <br /> I am in the audience with a group of teenagers, and I can't stop laughing out loud. I get dirty, but It was just a rout. <br /> <br /> Rent F & F movies. Go to the Nascar race. Go to the go-kart track and chase yourself. Whatever you do, avoid Redline like bad cheese.
