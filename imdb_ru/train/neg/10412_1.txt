This movie is of the MANDINGO & DRUM type. <br /> <br /> both of them were terrible, BUT they are 100% better than this deception, <br /> <br /> Oliver Reid acted badly and made - the main name Eartha Kitt is also in it. It's a pity. A rating of 1/2 * is about as low as you can get <br /> <br /> as always <br /> <br /> Jay Harris
