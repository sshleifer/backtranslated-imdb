Dr. Tarra Dorture Dungeon talks about a journalist who travels to an insane asylum to write about a new technique that they use with their patients. However, the journalist soon learns that things are not what they seem, and the shelter is managed by the patients, and the doctors are in the cells. First of all, some parts of the film are just boring and just make you want to fall asleep, and interesting parts are interesting for all the wrong reasons (for example, a guy who thinks he is a chicken). I have to admit that the story is actually pretty good, but the film itself is exploding. The film's music is really strange and looks like what you hear in some crazy comedy, and yes, there is a scene with dancing chickens that made me want to turn off the screen. Watch this movie at your own risk! <br /> <br /> Rating: R for violence and nudity.
