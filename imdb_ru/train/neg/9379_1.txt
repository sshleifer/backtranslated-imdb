This movie . , , I dont know. Why they will not take such an infallible character as Peppy Longstocking, and choose the extraordinarily charming Tami Erin, I will never know. Why they will spend money on art management and some are not so bad special effects, and then do not bother to edit them properly, I will never know. Why scenery and costumes are sometimes in a historical period, and sometimes itâ€™s strange why they ordered SO bad songs, why the script makes no sense (even at the level of silly children's films). what are they thinking about ?? Nothing in this film is quite the way it should be. Every part is duplicated (and always bad), every sound effect is a bit wrong, every edit is in the wrong place, every performance is kind of bad. He manages to create the right atmosphere, despite all the problems, but it NEVER reflects the magic created by Astrid Lindgren.
