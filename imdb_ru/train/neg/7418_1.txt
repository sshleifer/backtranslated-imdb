Oh god, what a horrible, horrible movie. It implies a comment on the state of society, it is simply a reflection of the worst of the worst in the reality show. Intermediate messages by Jason Jones and Don McKellar are the most unpleasant part, written in a tone that may need to be reflective and insightful. Rather, these moments are stunning when they speak to the camera with a dialogue written by someone with a love of offensive, condescending speech, which pushes the film’s “meaning” into the viewer's throat. <br /> <br /> In addition, the point of view of future filmmakers: long shots and quiet scenes are not equal to art. Moreover, extreme angles or logic do not reach the point of absurdity. <br /> <br /> If anyone is interested in watching this movie, please do not do it. Seriously. You are welcome. You have better things to do.
