I did not like this movie for many reasons. During the first ten minutes of the film I was very disappointed and came to the conclusion that if this film was going to save itself, at least for me, then he would have to pull himself out of the huge hole he dug, Unfortunately, that did not happen. For me there were two roles in the film: Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman. I do not know enough about the work of Lindsay Lohan to be interested in what she brings to the film. After that, I simply became disillusioned with all three, although there were “moments” in each of their speeches. I believe that it was very difficult for each of them to find their “moments”, given the fact that there was a striking lack of character development and boring dialogue. Although the plot is interesting, the film as a whole is so poorly written, directed and edited that any act of acting, as an actor, will suffer and be spoiled by it. I believe that the disrespectful attitude towards sexual violence and the banal and offensive point of view of the small town of America were the two main reasons why this film failed. As one reviewer noted, and I would agree, the film is almost impossible to sell, given its finished form. I suspect that, or at least I hope that (for the sake of an actor anyway) there are real gems on the floor of the cutting room. It's sad for us, but if this is true, then the actors can find solace in this and feel a little better by giving their talents and time for such a failure. Oh, and one more thing ... I would like to see an American film once, which included sadly disappearing, but wonderfully bucolic scenery, like in this film, where the main characters are not absent-minded and / or disrespectfully littered the countryside with pop banks, broken discs and other similar trash!
