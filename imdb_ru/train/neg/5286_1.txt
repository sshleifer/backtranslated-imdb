I'm a big fan of Jane Austen, and I ordered the film from Amazon.UK, just so that I can see it without waiting for its arrival in the USA. I really had to save my money. What's up with Ann running after Wentworth? The whole point of Anna Elliot’s character is that she was calm and refined. She is not impulsive and not vulgar. And Mary, did she suffer from a stroke or something? Her speech was not normal, and she did not go normally. There was no chemistry between the two main characters, which made their entire “novel” incredible. In the final scene, they even have Sally Hawkins, wearing the same dress that Amanda Ruth wore during the writing scene. The same clothes don't make it the same movie. In my opinion, they did not look at the 1995 version, which, although it had its drawbacks, remained fairly close to the book. The book, I don't even think they are reading this. This is something like the Cliff's Memoirs film. Hit all the high moments without explaining anything.
