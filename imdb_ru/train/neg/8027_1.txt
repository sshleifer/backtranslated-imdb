I watched this movie. By the end. And it was really not easy. It's so boring, badly played and in almost all the details stolen from "BLAIR WITCH PROJECT" that you can't believe that the creators take this seriously. It is even harder to believe how this “product” got on VHS and DVD. <br /> <br /> So, if you want to watch a horror movie, just watch “Scream”, but if you want to laugh out loud and have a good time, watch some of the children running around the forest shouting at each other and showing their failure to observe the dark area.
