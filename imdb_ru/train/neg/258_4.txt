This is the first time I've seen a movie with Jamie Foxx, and I bet he will be my last. I could not understand why he was funny, although people in the audience thought it was very funny when he was looking at the camera or saying “I'm going to take a shower”. <br /> <br /> The plot is completely predictable. A bad guy goes for a good guy. The good guy has a woman, so the bad guy uses her. Between them, the officials screwed up. The final scenes are absolutely incredible. You spend 2 years and millions of dollars chasing a guy, but you are not doing your homework to solve a trivial riddle? <br /> <br /> There is no good game, not so much plot or plot. and filming done in the style of MTV. Do not waste your money on this. <br /> <br />
