There are two kinds of musicals of the 1950s. First, you have brilliant MGM products with big names and great music. And then you have a junior league with a lesser-known cast, less well-known music and second-rate directors. "The girl can not help" refers to the latter category. Neither Tom Ewell nor Edmond O'Brien became famous, and Jane Mansfield became famous for her ... well, never mind. It seems that every decade has a share of Bo Dereks or Pamela Andersons. The plot itself is as thin as a razor blade, and one cannot but suspect that this is basically an attempt to sell records for Fats Domino, Little Richard or other 1950s rock bands that appear in the film. If you like this music, itâ€™s worth a look. If not, do not worry.
