I was not going to comment, but then I decided that I had something to say. I saw this film two days ago and, although I think that this is not a complete waste of time (although it may have been money for producers), it is obvious that he has serious problems. He has really good cinematography and (a little, but) good music. Much has been said about Anna Cristina Oliveira, but, frankly, what? She is not really an actress, and she constantly balances between excessive and ridiculous actions. Her performance goes well, because in any other film there was never anyone like Dress Up: crazy? sad? childish? impostor? nobody knows guys. So she sort of dictates the rules. <br /> <br /> I thought this film was also a good example of the problem that most Portuguese films suffer from: soundtrack. There is a constant NO for duplication, and this results in this ordinary mass of noise that appears out of the blue. People in other countries may consider Portugal the noisiest place. What struck me was that some of the dialogues were duplicated, but they did not necessarily solve the syndrome. I must say bad dubbing. It is strange to watch a movie in which the first thing that amazes me in the first scene, when the first character speaks, is duplication. And all this suggests that the film has technical problems. <br /> <br /> He also has problems with the script. He tries to be classic from the first to the last scene. There was a desperate fear of leaving things suspended, and it shows. The author obviously tried to fix everything, and he does, but ... it shows !! The whole dialogue is too revealing, and there is not a single conversation that sounds like a line from a movie. It's all a bit rude and a bit unpleasant. <br /> <br /> It’s not that the film is a complete mess, I have to stress. I just think that the good parts are so obvious that I prefer to concentrate on the bad ones. <br /> <br /> Direction does little for a weak scenario. All frames are classic and not innovative, but they are beautiful. By the way, great work from Rui Posas. <br /> <br /> Now I think it was a problem, one that doesn’t allow people to believe in this story and laugh throughout the entire film, and not to take it seriously: the guy who plays the guy who dies is obviously , not an actor. In fact, this is a rather important role, and I cannot understand why non-actors play such roles. This guy is not an actor or a handsome man. This means that the entire film is rolling down the mountain, since we do not for a second believe that this magnificent woman is obsessed with him, even if he has left, and that his healthy lover who survives is in fact badly going through a loss when we all we see that this character is apathy. Very bad. The world is full of wonderful people, who even turn out to be good tempting lovers. The world is full of good actors who are also cute boys and are able to impose obsessions on people after they leave. The world is full of great films, as well as not very good films. That is life!
