I did not know that Willem Dafoe was so hard for money that he would disgrace himself with such a shocking pressure on this monster. Hell: I will donate the money I was going to send to Ethiopia, if he is so desperate. I have not seen such a pathetic and disgusting film for a long time ... who paid for it? They are either pulling some kind of tax scam or abnormal. A 5-year-old child will be ashamed of the plot, and Iâ€™ll rather get cancer than sit for more than an hour, which I have already suffered. All involved should be imprisoned for a year in a third world prison. Avoid at all costs. I would give minus 10 if possible ... unbelievable.
