Wow, how bad can it be. It was seriously bad. Not in terms of blood - which was mostly ridiculous CGI - but in action, atmosphere and direction. <br /> <br /> The story was terrible - the characteristic feature of the main character was a complete joke. Over the course of several nights of Winnie Jones' pursuit, he begins to become a “ghost” to the extent that he cries while photographing his girlfriend. Hmm ... are all New York photographers so childish, suggestible and weak? His character development had absolutely no excuse or meaning - and by the very end you will laugh out loud at the completely predictable and completely absurd turn that his character requires. <br /> <br /> The terrible moments were clearly just weak, low self-esteem, to jump on the modern MTV style MTV station wagon - all this, blood, but no real emotions. These parts were inadvertently funny — and distracting themselves with self-awareness — the wacky camera angles, etc. <br /> <br /> In general, this film commits a crime involving the disclosure of another potential idea. What could have had an atmosphere (until stupid monsters appeared at the end) collapsed in favor of a self-conscious guide “look at me.” This film was not made for an audience - it was made for a summary - a deeply selfish motive.
