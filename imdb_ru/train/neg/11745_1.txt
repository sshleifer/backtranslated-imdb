The fact that I didn’t like music is a very personal opinion, and historical inaccuracies are not. I really understand that this is an opera, not a documentary, but some important aspects are missing, especially if other people because of this are mistakenly commented. <br /> <br /> Abba Abbas was the leader of this operation, which was organized and reorganized in connection with the discovery on board the ship to release 50 Israeli prisoners of terrorists, one of which was Samir Kuntar, a hideous terrorist whose history you can search by searching for “klinghoffer samir kuntar” on Google. Abbas Abbas was responsible for many other terrorist operations, even if he never stepped on Ahil Lauro. Bin Laden never set foot on planes that crashed into the WTC, did he? <br /> <br /> *** possible spoilers *** <br /> <br /> The film almost justifies the actions and reaction of terrorists because of the horrors they may have lived, always emphasizing and exaggerating how many Israelis done to harm them. However, they never depict the damage the Palestinians have ever caused the Israelis. The film uses (rather awfully !!!) images from the horrors of Sabra and Chatila, and does not say anything, emphasizing the general conviction that it was Israel who was responsible, not even mentioning that it was the Syrian Lebanese army that conducted the Massacre. <br /> <br /> As a rule, the acting was very bad, but I think that can be expected from opera singers? <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I am shocked at how a person can justify terrorists. to kill the hostage because the hostage tried to kindle 400 innocent hostages against armed terrorists and added that this person should not be considered sympathetic because he is a supporter of Zionism. Imagine how he did not like his wife, spitting on the terrorists who shot her husband and threw his body into the sea. I hope no one in the world is as cruel as she (winked)
