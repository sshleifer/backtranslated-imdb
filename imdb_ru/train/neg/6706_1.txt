I saw this move a few years ago at a film festival in Central Florida, if I remember. I liked it, it showed great potential. I assume that most people here are blowing up this film, because the film seemed intricate (as the director himself admits, the short film was shown as “rough”). nonetheless, it was a light comedy. I think many people read too many comedies. All they have to do is make you laugh - that's all. I did exactly that in his show, so it was possible at this level. In any case, only my 2 cents.
