I was sadly disappointed by this film because it seemed false, and the characters were not strong enough to withstand a rather weak horror attempt in the films. The main idea of ​​the film was interesting, but, unfortunately, it could not excite, frighten or shock me - there was one part in the whole film, which, in my opinion, was terrible, but even that did not help. I really liked Kate's character by the end of the film, as she seemed to soften and become a little more realistic by the end, the character played by Jeremy Sheffield was not really needed for this film, and I think the director / screenwriter got carried away characters that were used without a goal, if he left it on the main characters, making it more solo effort by Kate, it could have worked - Jeremy played at least wooden, and I felt uncomfortable watching the bad chemistry on the screen - or lack thereof. Such a shame. Unsatisfactory.
