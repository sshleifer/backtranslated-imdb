Dieter Bohlen, a famous German composer and producer of slightly cheesy pop hits like “You are my heart, you are my soul,” felt the need to tell his story - and gracefully decided to hire a ghost writer. The result was a fun book about his life. Well, more or less fuzzy image of this. He did not deny that he was a selfish asshole, but the whole story was distorted to fit his image of himself. There are no words that he probably beat his ex-wife, and she was in the hospital. However, he was written in a ridiculous style and was a huge success after he became a member of the jury of the German version of “American Idol” - especially his unforgettable comments. <br /> <br /> This should be the end of the story - really. In the hype of the television show Idol called “Deutschland sucht den Superstar” (abbreviated DSDS), someone must have come up with a terrible idea of ​​making a film from a book. The result is “Dieter - Film”. <br /> <br /> I rarely saw a movie that so desperately tries to be funny and fails. None of the gags really fit. Nadel's voice and style of conversation immediately got on my nerves, although Verona’s voice should have done more. Obvious, childish, predictable and prolonged jokes destroy any motivation to watch this movie to the end for a few minutes. The content of the film is a sloppy adaptation of the film, written carelessly by a ghost-writer based on Bohlen’s sloppy idealized memory. They could use this freedom to do almost everything. It was supposed to be satire, but they failed. The story is completely uninteresting, and the fact that Bohlen himself is the background voice ensures that the entire film has nothing satirical. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, he was considered bad for going out to the cinema. The likelihood that this thing is rotten in some kind of archive was quite high until recently, when the current DSDS season turned out to be a mediocre success. With the “friendly” help of the largest German yellow press newspaper “BILD” and the desperate situation when the RTL channel included something in the program, the still unbeatable show “Wetten dass ...?” On the second channel, the film finally appeared on television - Unfortunately. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is a waste of time - there are sure to be the best cartoons with a lot more fun and a story that is really worth seeing. /> <br /> Therefore: 2/10
