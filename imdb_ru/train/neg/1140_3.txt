It is terrible, but mainly in the sense that everything will end before I turn 70. I saw it as a late night restart around 1976 and thought it would never end. Like crackers, it's better than nothing (but just). <br /> <br /> Ray Milland is a bit intimidated because he looks like a taxidermist is filling him. Yvette Mime looks like she smoked the whole beautiful center of Burbank Brown. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of Rose Rogers, the Rosary Baby version. This is one turkey that should never have been made. If you have insomnia, and on Saturday morning 1:30, and nothing happens, except for replays of the 1972 Roller Derby Chamionship championship, then I suppose it is better. But God will help you if this is your only choice for entertainment.
