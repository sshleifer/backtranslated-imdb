This film was bad. This film was terrible. The game was bad. The setting was unreal. The story was absurd: a comet that appears once in eternity should appear one night. Most of the world's population decided to see this comet. Then the next morning, all but the elect turned to dust from the radiation of the comet. Folk clothing is still intact, there are plants that are still alive, but people have turned to dust. No bones, nothing. This is ridiculous. How can radiation burn people, but leave their clothes and other biological substances intact? <br /> <br /> Better yet, the comet has turned some people into zombies who eat monsters. Their cosmetics would not even look frightening for a newborn baby. A squad of Mad Clowns scares me more ... and they should look stupid. <br /> <br /> Then there were the survivors. People who were surrounded by steel when the comet passed, were spared zombies and death. How can steel block the radiation of a comet that supposedly burns people on its tracks? <br /> <br /> No less offensive is the horror music of the 60s, playing in the background through fragments of the film, or the hair of the 80s rock, which is useless film and makes you want to shoot a TV. <br /> <br /> However, the stupidest part of the film is the characters on which it is focused: two girls from the Valley and Chakotai from Star Trek: Voyager. These three characters were completely unreal. Who will go on looting the day after the apocalypse, when mutants eat around the world? There were four 5-minute horror scenes throughout the film, and most of them were dreams. Between these scenes is a simple dialogue that makes South Park seem smart. The silence between the elementary dialogue was painful. I could make a better movie with four monkeys and a cheetos bag. Never watch this movie.
