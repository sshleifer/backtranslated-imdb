I rented this film on the merits of what the trailer showed, and, of course, Sir Anthony Hopkins. <br /> <br /> If Jackson Pollack had teamed up with David Lynch and Timothy Leary to make a film, this would be the end result. I don’t think I’ve seen one in which the LSD trip looked like an episode of Sesame Street. <br /> <br /> This is a set of scenes in which characters flash and disappear from reality, or different realities, and the film does not end with anything until the last 5 minutes, where suddenly it makes sense. I wrote a horrible review on my blog of film reviews, in which, in fact, everything is distributed, and I will not do it here. This is a well-played part of the movie, and the soundtrack was written by Sir Anthony Hopkins, and let me say this, if there is one redemptive feature of this film, this is music. This is perfect. Some dialogs are incredibly good, and at the same time incredibly bad. <br /> <br /> I liked parts of this film, and I really did it, and as soon as you get to the end, you really find out what's really going on. Unfortunately, you need to pass 2 hours of crazy to get to the characteristic point, which minimizes the effect of the entire film. <br /> <br /> I give him 3 out of 10 for the simple fact that the real problem with this film is not acting, that's all.
