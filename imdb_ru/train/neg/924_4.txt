WARNING SPOILERS ***** A really stupid film about a group of young tourists in Italy who find the armor of a mythical warrior with demonic souls. One of them carries him and becomes obsessed with the spirit of the demon. Time kills, and several of his friends die under his blade to resurrect the demon's corpse. <br /> <br /> The audience doesnâ€™t need a waste of time, because the beautiful young ladies in the film leave their clothes and the blood is ridiculous at best, but the game is terrible, the perfect combination for such a bad script <br /> <br />
