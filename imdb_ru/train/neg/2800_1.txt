One of my best friends brought this film overnight with the words “Do you want to see the worst horror film?” I always enjoy a good laugh at a bad click of horror and say yes. I was expecting your typical cheese b-slasher, but it was outside of B. This is a Z-slasher, the lowest of the lowest. With an obviously low budget, an extremely bad game, poor lightning speed, a lack of plot, really bad so-called “special effects”, shaky cameras and a terrible soundtrack, this makes films like “House of Wax” look like Oscar-winning masterpieces. The only good thing is about 15 seconds, when one of the characters became topless - she had very beautiful tits. Most of what I said in this film was like, “Wow, this is really so bad,” “This is the worst film ever” and “I'm not drunk enough for this.” So in conclusion: do not waste your time (or money!).
