I went to see it at the Esquire Theater in Cincy, OH, and now I hate my life. <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeves would be a more believable boxer. <br /> <br /> As the film was painful, but seeing Bret Carr personally is seeing despair on top of it. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the film is to see how BC slapped in the face with the letter "C". battery. The jury is still on it. It was from the dildo, and it was in slow motion. Yes. <br /> <br /> "Shoot the left side of your face ... people become famous thanks to demanding things!" - Bret Carr B. Carr put on "Chicken Costume" for a bit of reverse psychology, wandering the streets of Clifton and making his own film. He should. That's right when you need to make a movie. <br /> <br /> My soul felt annoyed after this movie. <br /> <br /> Bret Carr is not charismatic enough to be a cult leader, or not smart enough to make it important. This is the feeling you get from an impressive brainwashing trickle of impressionable neo-yuppies who came to see this work of Bret Carr. <br /> <br /> This is an emotionally draining experience, when I just think about writing this movie, so goodbye. <br /> <br /> - Anonymous
