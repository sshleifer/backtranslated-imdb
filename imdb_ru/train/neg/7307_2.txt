This is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. The events in it are absolutely random and have no meaning. The fact that there is a continuation is so disgusting that I can get a fever in the cabin (I SO WISH). I describe it as a mistake leaning against a newspaper, because it seems to be different parts of things mixed together. For example, Kevin, who loves karate pancake, is strangely strange in itself, then there is a policeman who is a bit strange and perverted, then an addict, and the fact is that they attack a random guy who clearly needs help. then suddenly the main character has sex with his girlfriend because she says something stupid about the crash of the plane. then, at the end, some good old family racism, followed by a rabbit operating on Kevin-karate. It is actually rather contemptible that they can use racism as a joke in this film. No one has any reason to enjoy this movie, unless you love Eli Roth, even that didn't make me like that movie. Hate is a strong word, but seeing that this is the only word I am allowed to use, it must come up. BOYCOTT CABIN FEVER 2 !!!!!
