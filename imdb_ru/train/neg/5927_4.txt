I am a very non-politically correct guy, so when I say sexist, I really mean that it reduced the leadership of female guests, Dr. Miranda Jones, played by Diana Muldar. in spite of all her supposed brilliance and self-control, for anything more than a big, jealous, foolish child. You have already received the plot, after her technical assistant Marvik, also a rejected lover, slipped out when he tried to kill Medusan. Ambassador Kollos, out of jealous rage, but instead saw the first one. (You think he could just enter the room with his eyes closed and place the box in the field too easily), he takes the Enterprise into non-navigable space outside the galaxy before the boys can conquer it. Well, the ship was stuck in limbo, at that moment they could go to the good lady doctor and discuss it. “Spock must team up with Medusan so that we can return home. I mean, like a beech, you want to stay away until we run out of supplies and we die? ”But ladies in the true fashion of Star Trek are jealous monsters who whine and cry when they talk about it, even when Medusky idol told her to shut up and go along with them. Thus, the beech, due to anger, spoils Spock, forcing him to forget to put on a visor that makes Spock go insane. Kirk naturally found out what a complete fool she was, and put her to shame so that she would correct Spock with her excellent telepathic abilities. Of course, at the end of the Lady and Meduzan leave, and everything is forgiven. You almost want the President of the Star of the Battle of Galaxy to appear to throw the witch out of the airlock for her destructive stunt. But on Star Trek Earth, women are allowed to be completely unreasonable and cruel, but at the same time there is supposedly sexual equality. This is what I mean by sexist.
