In a sense, the concept of the storyline was a rather interesting mix of several typical types of films in an interesting combination. However, not one point in this film was so obvious that it did not deserve the close-up of close-up shots. I felt as if I had been hit on the head with a so-called mysterious explanation of a disease that killed people. <br /> <br /> The author seems to have simply removed clich√©s from other films as a replacement for writing customized lines. to real characters. Actors did not help questions. No chemistry. I guess they had to develop some kind of attractiveness, if only because this is an important element of these stories. However, the authors did not work hard on the development of chemistry. Of course, they are both attractive, but the question of whether they are attractive to each other remained an open question. <br /> <br /> The confidence shown by the character Turner in Sabato, develops too quickly and for no particular reason. Sabato's character must be a discredited doctor who simply cannot play by the rules. Think of Jeff Goldblum's character from Independence Day. Usually such a character should show some talent or brilliance. Sabato no character. He is Cassandra, who possesses only the insane and all the prophetic skills of the magical eight ball. It seems that he is right by chance. <br /> <br /> Deadly scenes are ridiculous. Every actor really tried his best to demonstrate the agony caused by him. The symptoms looked like bad clay, sort of like a video from the 80s, Peter Gabriel, I think.
