There were many films with the participation of Bigfoot, most of which are not very good, but most, at least, have for them a dull charm. Sasquatch Hunters doesn't even have that. It is just a crash. <br /> <br /> Sasquatch Hunters is a group of paleontologists, primatologists and foresters who go to a remote part of the Pacific Northwest Forest. The bones belonging to some unusually large primate were found in this region, and since monkeys are not natural for North America, this leads to a scientific expedition to begin with. Of course, they will soon discover a burial ground full of the skeletal remains of these huge ape-like creatures. I think we all know what happens to people who are disturbed by the ancient burial places in films. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film consists of uninteresting, interchangeable characters who collect their equipment, hike through the woods, stop to rest a little while traveling through the woods, pausing long enough to explore and discuss several finds. traveling along the forest even more, looking for the missing member of the group, traveling more through the forest, digging through the mud, randomly theorize and gather around the fire to discuss what little they did that day. When Sasquatch finally appears, it simply turns into people stumbling in the dark when they are shot one at a time (done instantly, and you missed it, and the actual murder happens off-screen). All this is painfully boring. <br /> <br /> The cinema wants to be taken seriously, and the director is clearly trying to create tension, but nothing can be found, so we still have boring, prolonged scenes of people roaming the woods, just to get somewhere, and roam the forest at night trying to get scared. I would have lied if I said that I did not use the liberal fast forward button to speed up these scenes. <br /> <br /> As for Saskvotch himself, the same thing as any other character in the film has nothing in common and lacks an excellent personality. It seems to be a stranger version of King Kong, which is not so bad, except for scenes where they used CGI instead of a man in a snowman costume, which is painfully evident in scenes with monsters in daylight. Part of me can not help but feel that even using computer effects to revive a snowman is sacrilegious. If there is any monster from the films, which, I believe, should be brought to life only through the situation, then this is a snowman. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films in which the plot is not as important as in the premise. This is all that is, in fact, the premise that the people involved stretched out to make a full-length film without bothering to add all the ingredients to create a decent movie.
