KILLED FROM NATURAL BIRTHDAY (1994) <br /> <br /> Cinema Cut: R <br /> <br /> Directorial work: NC-17 <br /> <br /> This is an unusual picture of Oliver Stone, but when I he was reading drugs during filming, I didn’t need any further explanation. "Natural Born Killers" is a risky, insane, complete production of films that we don't often get; strange, psychotic, artistic paintings. <br /> <br /> “Natural Born Killers” is a story about how two mass killers were popularized and glorified by the media; there is a great scene where the interviewer asks some teens about mickey and mallory, and the teenager says, "The murder is wrong ... but if i were a mass murderer, i would be mickey and mallory." Mickey describes it with the situation “Frankenstein (monster) and Dr. Frankenstein” - Dr. Frankenstein - this is the media that turned them into these monstrous killers. <br /> <br /> Most Oliver Stone films explore the flaws of America, a country that the director loves and admires. I believe that “Natural Born Killers” is the influence of the media, technology, and how naive the Americans (and most of the world) are in such things as mass murderers and weird situations. <br /> <br /> The killers played by Woody Harrelson (Mickey) and Juliette Lewis (Mallory) are stunningly executed by two beautiful actors who enter into the life of two interesting cruel killers. Mickey and Mallory believe that some people are worthy of murder, perhaps in the cruel theory of social Darwinism (survival of the fittest) - in an interview in prison, Mickey says that other species commit murder, we, as humans, ruin other species and exploit the environment; The script is interesting, but it is doubtful how this film is worth, in the sense that it makes us think about society and human behavior, and not about the intensity of the two-hour bloodshed that we saw. <br /> <br /> The last hour of the film takes place in a high-security prison; we see the harsh realities of prison life; the attitude of the prison governor, etc .; an overflow of prisons - perhaps Stone casts doubt on the future, the path that society leads. <br /> <br /> Two other interesting characters; First, the reporter who leads the series about American Maniacs and is obsessed with rating upgrades, he goes to great lengths to tell the story of Mickey and Mallory. Another is Scagnetti, a policeman, a mad, possibly sadistic officer, in love with Mallory - he also has some strange obsession with mass murderers, because his mother was killed by Charles Whitman during the massacre in Waco, Texas. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is great; different colors, shadows, styles create a sense of disorientation; the green color, the most obvious of all, is green, resembling the killer disease (in a pharmacy when they are looking for an antidote to a rattlesnake). <br /> <br /> Camera work is insane; wobbly, buzzing, it takes a certain determination to get used to it and accept it. Highly unorthodox, psychedelic and unusual. <br /> <br /> “Natural Born Killers” do not extol the existence of insane killers, but cast doubt on it and how we, the public, can feed this attribute ... <br /> <Although the above review sounds quite positive, I did not like the movie. Quentin Tarantino, who originally wrote the script for the film, was not pleased with the modified script and asked him to remove his name. I understand why. While Natural Born Killers sometimes look a bit more interesting, they are just erratic. <br /> <br /> 4/10
