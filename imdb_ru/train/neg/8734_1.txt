Maybe I saw too many crime films, or maybe I do not take the right drugs. <br /> <br /> This was the most cliché, plot, ridiculous, absurd, just silly film that I have seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> With regard to direction, it seemed to take less time to show this than to connect. <br /> <br /> In fact, it looks like this to make it right on the video before it is completed. <br /> <br /> This is a bad excerpt from the “M” of the classic Fritz Lang film with Peter Lorre in the lead role. You would be much better off renting it instead.
