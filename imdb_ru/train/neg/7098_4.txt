An interesting idea for a film that shows the last dragon on earth and shows the struggle that he and someone are waging with evil together. When he was younger, Ainon got stabbed in the heart, so Bowen (Dennis Quaid) took him to a dark lord, who gave him half of his heart. Adult Ainon (David Theulis) is now a selfish and evil king. In the meantime, Bowen uses the new dragon friend Dragon (voiced by Sir Sean Connery) to get rewards for killing dragons. But since Ainon has half a hearing for Draco, they both feel that the pain in one of them is injured or killed. Also starring Pete Postletweit as Gilbert from Glockenspur, Jason Isaacs as Lord Felton, Julie Christie as Queen Auslin and John Gilgud as King Arthur. He was nominated for an Oscar for best visual effects. Worth watching!
