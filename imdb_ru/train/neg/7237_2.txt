Life is really too short for such films. I knew that this could not be good when I realized that I already suspected - that David Schwimmer would play the exact same person that he plays in Friends. <br /> <br /> Let's face it, either the guy can play nothing but a nerd, or he is never offered any other roles. I have a feeling that this is a mixture of both. <br /> <br /> And I must say that it is very difficult to love a film that completely squander the considerable talents of Gwyneth Paltrow, Barbara Hershey, Toni Collette and Carol Kane !!!
