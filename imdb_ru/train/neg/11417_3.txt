The youth group in Fire St. Elmo, which has just graduated from college, is hardly able to go through high school in much less than four years at any famous university. For the most part, these children are irresponsible, selfish, greedy and stupid, but co-author and director Joel Schumacher seems to consider them a touchstone for a generation. With an already outdated "up and comers" composition, a background rating that sounds terribly similar to the "Tenderness Conditions", and an inscription that governs the complacency of this circle over us, "Fire" is an insignificant flame that becomes even more confusing over the years. * 1/2 of ****
