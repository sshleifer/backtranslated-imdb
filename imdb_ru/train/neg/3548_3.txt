For those who like depressive films with sloppy characters and a disgusting plot, this one is for you! From the gloomy atmosphere of New York, which looks extremely gloomy and almost hopeless, to two different main characters, deprived of a special morale, this film is a real depressor. <br /> <br /> Why she won the Oscar, is that at that time she was so shocking that Hollywood, a completely new person who demonstrated his freedom to show everything he wanted, with the rejection of all moral standards , wanted to celebrate this fact. Filmmakers then looked like an immature six-year-old child with an unlimited score at a local candy store. So, Hollywood gave the audience of the theater (probably for the first time) a dose of rape, prostitution, homosexuality, nudity, homeless existence and other such wonderful performances and sounds that only his twisted brain would have considered attractive ... and then awarded his Work. <br /> <br /> I also hoped that this shocked a wide audience. Well, it succeeded at this level. The audience was stunned by what they said and heard, and the Academy, proud of being able to show dirt and make money at the same time, could not help but pay homage to this piece of gilded garbage. <br /> <br /> Forty years ago, while still a very young man, I found this movie fascinating. However, seeing it again in the 1990s, I felt a bad taste in my mouth, and I never watched to see it again. <br /> <br /> The game was good, so what? Acting is good in many films. No one ever said that Dustin Hoffman and John Voight cannot act. Hoffman was especially good in his youth, playing in amazed people. He was something like Johnny Depp of his era, he played guys like “Ratso Rizzo” in this film, and then became “Rain Man”. Yes, Ratso is a character you will never forget, and Joe Buck (Voight) is the one you want to forget, but the story is so disgusting that it overwhelms the beautiful game. <br /> <br /> This film is not “art” and it is not worthy of many awards; it only turned the envelope in 1969, and that is why it was so dearly remembered in the hearts of filmmakers and critics. These are two hours of profanity and ultra-mean, religious cheap pictures, glorifying eccentrics (Andy Warhol even gets into the act - not surprising), and generally disgusting people. <br /> <br /> I really liked the catchy song "Everyone Says" that helped make Harry Nilsson famous, but even that was fake because Fred Neil wrote the song and sang it better before Nilsson did it .. .. and few people have ever heard of Nile (which is their loss). And, as already mentioned, the name “Ratso Rizzo” remains with you! <br /> <br /> The film is significant, but in a negative sense, I am afraid: it marked him as “official” Hollywood went down the toilet, and since then it has remained in the sewer.
