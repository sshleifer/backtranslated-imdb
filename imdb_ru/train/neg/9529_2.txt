In this iconic 1977 film, two crazy lesbians (Sandra Locke and Colin Camp) appear in the house of rich socialite friend Dr. George Manning (Seymour Cassel) in the hope of helping to find a place that they do not seem to find. But these two have other plans: when they find out that George’s wife is not in the city, they end up gaining control of the residence, tie George in, kill the courier, destroying this place in one evening. A strange and disturbing film, but both of them receive only a reward in the same bizarre way as the film ends. Most people either don’t like it, or they’ll get into this ridiculous movie in about 30 minutes. In any case, some even consider it a cult classic. <br /> <br /> Larry Dodson
