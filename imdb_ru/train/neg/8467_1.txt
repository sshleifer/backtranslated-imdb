My friends and I rented it from Blockbuster because we saw the name Nana Visitor on the box. This film is a parody, I hope she denies her resume. <br /> <br /> “The Story” was lost and sluggish, the acting was mostly dry and unbearable in some parts. The film does not make any sense. A rough plot about alien types of parasites infecting people, many times they made films with much better scenarios than this, for example, the invasion of body thieves and faculties. <br /> <br /> If you ever had the misfortune to meet this film, I suggest you burn it. <br /> <br /> How it is classified as a horror film, when there was no point in using fear, suspense, blood, terror or any other ordinary horror film methods I don’t know, however, if you still want to watch this movie I suggest you drink a lot of sugar, so you can find parts of it funny.
