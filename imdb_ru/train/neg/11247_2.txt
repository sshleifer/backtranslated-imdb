This film was too bloated. Many viewers who thought it was “awesome” were probably in old school films, because the whole movie was in the past. At first I thought that the film simply shows something from the past, so I expected that the extinct, like lighting, clarification of the characters would pass, but it only goes. In fact, it was a film that tries to blend the future with the past, and these two films do not mix very well in this film, even with special effects. You could actually see the blue screen with which the actors worked. There are too many films that do exactly what this film has done, so critics have no reason to advertise this film, saying, "This is the best film ever made." It's just crap on a stick. It also did not help that the storyline was sooo crappy. I do not understand why Hollywood agreed to create this film, and I also do not understand how the actors / actresses in this film want to be in such a film. It’s as if everyone is reading the script and forgetting to read the fine print ... "Everything will be done on the computer." It was a film that was supposed to be on the network of films, because nothing in this film was revolutionary. I am very upset that I paid money to see this. Whatever you do, do not waste your time and money on this film today or tomorrow.
