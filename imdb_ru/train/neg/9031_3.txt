Payback is a game that is played in this drama, and the plot of revenge is canceled by an absurd storyline that sets the stage for fireworks that will appear later. Why would a man mess with the trophy wife of a ruthless mafia boss in his own gangster mansion with suspicious minions around? Why does an unhappy wife encourage the attention of a complete stranger and expect him to take her with him and leave her husband and boredom to live long and happy with her new love? Of course, the hero, here Kevin Costner, must have expected the reaction of the cuckold husband, which gives the film an excuse to indulge in meaningless blood and violence. Anthony Quinn, the great actor he certainly deserved better, and Madeleine Stowe the tragic figure who suffers greatly when she clings to her charming prince. Stowe is fine, but her Spanish accent does not work. Cameo junior players are good, especially Miguel Ferrer and John Leguizamo, and Sally Kirkland is interesting as a fading rock star.
