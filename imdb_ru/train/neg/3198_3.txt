In short, the film had a slightly weak 1st act with some forced action and a bit scattered rhythm and rhythm, something like a decent 2nd act that managed to create some tension and intrigue, despite some inconsistent stimulation and some worse actions. on the part of the cast and the third act ... there was practically no third act! <br /> <br /> As for the third act, the film suddenly ends. There is no resolution and no way down from the climax of the second act, so there was no third act. Bad guys are dying, that's all; end credits rolls. There is nothing to show what happens to the main character and supporting characters, and so on. The audience would probably leave the theater after the film by asking "is that all?" A real disappointment. <br /> <br /> The music was written by David Bell, who worked adequately enough to serve the film most of the time, but this is certainly nothing outstanding. It is simply functional, but achieves it by being simply generic and derivative. It is also obvious that the evaluation is VERY dated using synthesized timpani for some percussions. What impressed me the least about this was the fact that some moments of tension foreshadow musical remarks that sound like they were ripped off by James Horner from 48 HRS. and "Commando", especially copper. <br /> <br /> In general, the film had potential, since the main story itself is good, but the performance was dim, with a mediocre direction, a weak play and a somewhat inconsistent rhythm. <br /> There was practically no third act to finish the story correctly, and this omission is serious and unforgivable, as it does not allow the film to finish satisfactorily. This could be either a script or perhaps the production had to abandon filming or editing the third act in the finished film due to budget constraints (but I ponder why the third act does not exist). Whatever the reason, the sudden ending really hurts the movie as a whole. <br /> <br /> It's good to watch if you're curious and you can get the movie for VERY cheap, and also find out the reason WHY you need to have 3 actions (start, middle, end) if you write scripts and shoot films. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, you may not waste time if you cannot get the MST3K version to laugh at least a little.
