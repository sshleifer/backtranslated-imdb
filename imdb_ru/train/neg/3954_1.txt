ENTIRE FILM is memories from the first Bogeyman movie, as well as, inexplicably, footage from another film called Brain Waves by Uli Lommel / Suzanne Love. It is framed with even more recent (from the early 90s) shots that are boring, poorly played and cheaply filmed. The film is not only almost completely reminiscent of memories, but also repeats the same memories throughout the film. Thus, you see recycled material again and again, as if you have not seen it yet. As if the originals were not bad enough. I have never seen such a soft film ... Someone milked the last dollar from these films. Total robbery. And to talk about filling ... why should I write 10 lines about this garbage? If I can convey that this is garbage in 2 lines, this should be enough.
