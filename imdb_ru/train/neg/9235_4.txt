This woman does not stop talking throughout the film. She memorized every line and delivered everything without natural emotions. She also has a very strange sound, and her voice sounds like nails on a board. In this film, too much Betsy Drake and not enough Cary Grant, who carried only what little was left of the film, in itself.
