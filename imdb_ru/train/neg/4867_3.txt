Just what we need! Another remake of vintage Hollywood movies, when Eddie Murphy made the second mistake again after THE NUTTY PROFESSOR (1996)! This shows why we end up with special ideas in creating a quality film, ladies and gentlemen! It has some signs of hope for its cute and adorable images of animals that can act and speak with people. Unfortunately, things can only get worse. Jokes in the bathroom and sexual references kill this piece of "family" fun instantly. Even parents and children saw a commercial on the Family Channel, followed by complete fear and disgust at the cinema. It is sad to say that this is a more progressive epoch before the millennium, but enjoy it while it lasts, because with time everything can only get worse. More went wrong with a completely new DR. Doolittle It is absolutely plotless, feeling too flat. I also hate this annoying voice of Chris Rock !!! We need more talented voice-overs than a group of overpaid celebrities who donâ€™t want to go bankrupt. I have to agree that my local newspaper will include this film in the top five worst films of 1998. On the other hand, the original version did not do any good either. The next project Murphy could be Patton, if he is not careful!
