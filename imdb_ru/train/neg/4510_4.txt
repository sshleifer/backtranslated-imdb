I love “Memoirs of a Geisha,” so I read the book twice; This is one of the best books I read last year. I was looking forward to the film and was afraid that reading the book would ruin the pleasure of watching the film. I did not expect the film to be so bad. Some of the best parts of the book were excluded from the film, and the characters were weak, and Hatsumomo (Li Gong) was the worst. If I had not read the book, this film would have been a bit confusing and inexplicable. The plot of the film says: “Nitta Sayuri tells how she surpassed her fishing ...” Has anyone seen how or when Sayuri became Nitta Sayuri? Forget the movie and read the book.
