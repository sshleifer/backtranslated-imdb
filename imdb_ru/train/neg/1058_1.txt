No fireworks, despite the brutal actions. <br /> <br /> Sci-fi films reflecting quality are actually scarce, largely because the transfer of artistic themes from the genre to the screen is too often ineffective due to insufficient funding or inadequate invention, and, unfortunately, for its producers, this work is missing on both points, unfortunately, in the case of the latter. Essentially, having no means to work, it would be a serious mistake to try to describe such a gamut of events as the events in this scenario, and, in particular, the special effects of war in space opera, which seem only clown, while the seeds from the writers â€œImagination is false because of one of the most stupid misunderstandings of the basic scientific principles that can be found. Among them - the frequent shooting of weapons in a sealed environment and the wayward law of gravity, which gives the freedom of movement of cast elements, while inanimate objects float weightlessly, but it is easier to accept them than to pretend that any of the episodes has a basis in plausibility. The plot includes escaping life-sentenced prisoners from a correctional colony of a space station to a waste dump on our moon and their various attempts to get back to Earth, with several capable players present, who are unmistakably guided by rookie Paolo Matscuato, whose production team is a waste of effort, on of those holographic pornography, while ignoring the pressure and basic requirements for the creation of states of suspense and incentives. <br /> <br />
