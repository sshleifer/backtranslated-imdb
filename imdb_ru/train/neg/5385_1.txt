I do not know where to start. The cast is full of people who have never done anything before or after. Debralee Scott is listed on the covers, but does not appear in the film at all. Writing is pretty bad, even for college films. Obviously, this is a very low budget when extremely unstable editing takes place in one of the student dormitories. <br /> <br /> Characters are pretty typical for student films - a timid guy, a nerd, a suave black guy, cool guys, a mustache guy, an attractive girl, a girl from a small town, etc. The teacher in question, talks about what you expect ... a heavy middle-aged guy who is easily distracted. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to attend college click, stay away from it. It's so bad, it's not even funny.
