Monitoring tenants was an interesting experience for me. This is the first film I ever saw where I was changed at speed in parts of (not) action - and I can usually watch anything from turgid fighters to Serbo-Croatian indie, and I find them exciting. <br /> <br /> Tenants are disappointedly sluggish and overly organized. One of the main problems of the script is the lack of realistic dialogue with the characters, except for scenes in which the characters “collide” in a very structured setting (to make this work, the film had to feel more conceptual, which was not the case). This leads to a lack of realistic character development; all seem two-dimensional. <br /> <br /> So much the worse is the character of Bill Spira, he's Snoop Dogg. I found his characterization very uncomfortable and not very sympathetic. At some point I even stopped the film because I was so annoyed by the aggressive, brutal and monotonous character delivery, the absence of any other layer of personality other than the on-reaction switch (which becomes really predictable after a while) and I am so desperate I wanted him to have some redemptive qualities. However, one of the reasons for this flask may be the foggy time course of the film (presumably the 70s, it looks and looks like earlier noughties). If this were more reliably corrected in the 70s, his character might seem more understandable. <br /> <br /> Movie lighting was also awkward. Throughout the entire soundtrack, an attempt is made to create a certain sandy atmosphere filled with jazz that simply did not work, mainly because the scenery was too well lit. <br /> <br /> Tenants, for me, is an incredible film. He does not depict real people and does not suggest any interesting ways of thinking about race, identity or the life of a writer, be they white or black. <br /> <br /> Strange, but I got the feeling that this project needs David Lynch; his eerie, clastrophobic and obsessive gaze and sensations would have raised both the actors and the script into something quite remarkable.
