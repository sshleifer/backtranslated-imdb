First of all ... I never considered myself Uwe Boll the Hater, because I think I never even saw any of his films, but after seeing this cheap excuse for a movie called "Seed" (the so-called serial the killer that this film is about I am close to joining the hate club.This film makes absolutely no sense at all ... the plot is a joke, and although Ball is clearly trying to draw attention with shocking people, 90% of this film is just boredom. The result of this film is as follows: <br /> <br /> 1. The killer with the hood he looks on TV for clips of animals that are tortured. These are real footage from self-sufficient farms, and the film begins with a ridiculous reason to “declare humanity" and give Peta's address. Because this film has no message at all and the worst piece of torture porn-exploitation has you already have a reason to hate the movie from the very beginning forward. <br /> <br /> 2. Death from an electric shock with a pretext that gives what happens later in this movie printed on the screen, so every retard receives it. <br /> <br /> 3. Cops watch videos about animals, babies and women dying of hunger and decaying Seeds in the basement, with wacky nightmares and crying in whiskey, because Seed is such an evil, bad mofo. Although the acting is all right, the film is immersed every time he tries to convey any emotion ... <br /> <br /> 4. The cops go through Seed in their house, behave foolishly and fall into darkness. This sequence reminds me of a video game, you see almost nothing except flashlights. The seed is a super killer who is everywhere, and all the policemen behave so foolishly that they can be killed ... except for the one who ruins him. <br /> <br /> 5. The seed sits on a chair, and we see how its electric current is long, like everything else in this “film” ... it will not die, and we are reminded of the introductory statement that it must be released if he survives three electric shocks. Guess what ... they just buried him alive to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> 6. The seed comes out of his grave, kills everyone in another chopping part, and then searches for the chief policeman for revenge. <br /> <br /> 7. From one point of view, a woman smashes her head with a hammer in an endless sequence, just for fun and shock. <br /> <br /> 8. The seed seizes a family of policemen, lures him to his home, threatens to kill his wife and daughter. After killing his wife with a nail, the policeman shoots himself in the head, believing that this is what Semyon wants (it’s hard to penetrate this guy’s head, as he not only wears his mask even in prison, but never says a word ... the film in any case has almost no dialogue, so do not mind). <br /> <br /> 9. Ball goes to the nihilistic shocking end, where Sem locks the daughter with her dead father to rot, like the people we saw on the video in sequence 3. <br /> <br /> Here and everything ... no message, no plot, no reason, no face behind a mask, no background, except for the silly story that the Seed was burned as a child. <br /> <br /> This film is based solely on several key scenes and their shocking value. I hardly remember a movie in which there are no emotions, messages or entertainment. It's like watching the August underground ... I'm fine, some people will like this brainless tobacco. But what is really difficult to defend is the pseudo-message at the beginning and the fact that the film is well made considering the camera work, the effects and even the action is too good for this waste of celluloid. <br /> <br /> So how does Ball get money to make such “films” when thousands of talented directors work on tight budgets? The “seed” is not just a ridiculous entity, it is a living proof that the free market is imperfect ... Owe, that the German taxpayer pays for this waste in order to get deductions.
