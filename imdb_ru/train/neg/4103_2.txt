This film had an IMDB rating of 8.1, so I expected much more from it. It starts in a fun and charming way with energy that feels spontaneous. But before the movie is halfway through, it starts to pull, and everything becomes incredibly predictable. The characters in the office were adorable in the first third of the film, but we recognize them too well; they become caricatures, not real people. This is the same story I have seen hundreds of times, told here only under slightly different circumstances. The fact is that I could digest one more predictable love story, if the dialogue were not so stale! <br /> <br /> The only thing that could be worse was if the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motives, and, unfortunately, also the case with Dead Letter Office. I hope this film will appear in the Dead Movie Office soon.
