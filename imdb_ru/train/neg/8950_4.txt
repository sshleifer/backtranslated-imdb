I heard about this novel a long time ago, many of my friends recommended that I read it. I searched for it in every place and finally found it. This is a book that every man should read, because it is brilliant and because of his vision. I liked every page. <br /> <br /> I knew about the film and could not wait to see it. When I finally did it, I was very disappointed, many things in the book are not in the film (I don’t think it is a spoiler), which just makes the film illogical ... Michael Radford may be a good director, but bad writer Especially as a book follower. The film is not at all dark, the script is really bad, the only thing that is good, even great, is acting. John Hurt is an amazing actor, and the only person I could see as Winston Smith. <br /> <br /> The one person in IMDb who called it “The Best Adaptation Ever,” even without reading a book makes me angry. Or knowing something about writing a screen! <br /> <br /> After reading the book, you can understand the brilliance of the story, but do not consider it as an alternative. As a fan of the book, I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> The glasses that I gave for this film relate to acting.
