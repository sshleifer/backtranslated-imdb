Starring Kim Basinger - Della, a desperate housewife with a somewhat abusive husband who has problems when she makes Christmas shopping at the last moment in a local mall. Placing a scrawled hateful note on a piece of paper and inserting it into the windshield of a car that occupied two parking spaces, she learns that the car owners are the Rainbow Coalition of villains consisting of a white guy, Mexican, Chinese and black. They encounter her about the note, cover the helpless guard, and the chase continues. During the film, Della will hunt for hunters, unleashing her inner Bronson. <br /> <br /> I discovered that this is a slightly tense little thriller. The action was good enough (except for a few scenes, the bit “Why God, why” was terribly decent in its badness, though) It is slightly canceled due to the fact that the villains pursued by Della from / after are stupidly stupid, If if they didn’t have the intelligence of a particular villain, “Home Alone,” perhaps their eventual defeat would be something that could be savored instead of the reaction he causes. The factor of improbability, which I want to lose sight of, since both the director and one of the producers participated in the output of “Shoot em up” on the screen (the film, which threw trust into the window, was incredibly funny). This film, although not reaching the heights of this film, was good at its own rights. <br /> <br /> My rating: C- <br /> <br /> More info on Anchor Bay DVD: Comment with writer / director Susan Montford and producer Don Murphy; 25 and a half minutes "Production"; a trailer and two television spots for this film; and trailer for lower training
