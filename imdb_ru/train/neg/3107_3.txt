Woody Allen made "September", proving that even a genius can screw it up. This is September of Mel Brooke. Monumentally stupid, boring and unfunny, I must admit, I didn’t see through to the end. Flick is among the disgraced few (for example, “The Pit of Money”, “Into the Sea”, “Spitfire Grill”), which either put me to sleep, or forced to reach for the “rewind” button. And I say this, unfortunately, as a devoted fan of Mel Brooks. He should stick to direct comedies and leave social comments alone. Like the same guy who created Young Frankenstein and Space Balls, he could wind up a dog like this, I can't do it. Avoid at all costs.
