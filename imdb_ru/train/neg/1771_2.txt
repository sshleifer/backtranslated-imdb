It must be one of the worst films I've ever seen, without a doubt. The only thing that is interesting in this film is a cameo from the great directors of the genre and King himself. The film has a great premise, but it falls apart in about 15 minutes. I really liked Madhen Amick in this film, and I think she could have made a very good film career.
