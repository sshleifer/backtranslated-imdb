I am a big fan of Mr. Rama Gopal Varma, but I could not believe that he made this film. I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag does not come close to the real Sholei. This does not leave an indelible impression on the viewer. Ram Gopal Varma cannot create chemistry between characters. There is no camaraderie between Hiro (Ajay Devgan) and Raj (Prashant Raj). There are hardly any scenes with more than two people in the frame together. The consistency outside the courtroom, face-to-face with Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal, is remarkable. Amitabh Bachchan should not have starred in this film. Ajay and Sushmita Sen tried their best, but to no avail. Rajpala Yadava's voice modulation is ineffective and rather pointless. Mohanlal showed complete justice and proved once again that acting is an expression of the face and body language. The rest of the cast was below expectations. A comedic situation that was adapted from the original film “Sholay Fall Flat” in this film. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma could have worked on the script, but because of the controversy surrounding the film, he screwed up and just for the sake of making he made this Aag. But there is no fire.
