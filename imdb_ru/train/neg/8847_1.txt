This American soap opera, "Knots Landing" has all the entertaining value of being trapped in an elevator. Each episode contained plots, such as rape, murder, kidnapping and drug smuggling, not unlike the plots of other dramatic shows of that period. As for the cast, I have seen the best actors on the cereal box. From the middle to the end of the 90s, the repetitions of the “Knots” stank in U.K-Gold, like a mountain of diaper mold. I regret to inform you that I had to go through this, as my mother was a big fan of the show and would have watched him religiously. Although since then, reruns have been rare and far apart (hopefully, that will remain so). The only positive thing that can be said about Knots is the catchy saxophone signature melody, later used as the title music for the I.T.V sitcom, The Upper Hand. Great legacy, huh?
