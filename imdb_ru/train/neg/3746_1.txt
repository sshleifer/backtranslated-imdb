No matter how hard I believe it, given all the terrible reality that has manifested itself over the past few years, this one should take first place for the worst. I'm still wondering if this was really a parody made by the SCTV gang. If Andy Kaufmann were still alive, I would be sure that he was behind this. Can a rock band go lower than INXS to do such a shameful thing like this? The premise is simple and moronic. Listening to a karaoke band refuses to become a new INXS vocalist to take the place of Michael Hutchens (who committed suicide in 1997). Eight years and not a single hit later, the group performs the final act of pity, exposing itself to listening to a group of mediocre imitators, to become a new vocalist of a group that is 20 years after its heyday. So they run around all these horrible singers (I thought American Idol has its own share of duzy) who make horrible performances of almost every classical (and predictable) rock song imaginable. And then they turned to the members of the INXS group, who are seriously discussing the merits of each of these candidates. You could see the best (and more original) rock artists in almost any nightclub in any city in the world. <br /> <br /> It has all the usual non-creative elements of any other reality show. Lame participants of reality shows, inconclusive interviews, slop presenter / presenter, slop "judging" of performances and unsuccessful loading of one participant at the end of each show. Can these shows become more predictable? This is clearly a publicity stunt by the group; a last sigh of hope for the revival of their lost glory, before they are finally consigned to oblivion. Michael Hutchens, if he had at least some shred of dignity, had to roll over in his grave. Not that the INXS were ever a great band, but I had no idea that they were so pathetic. If INXS generally represent rock and roll, then this show will be the ultimate proof that rock and roll is dead once and for all.
