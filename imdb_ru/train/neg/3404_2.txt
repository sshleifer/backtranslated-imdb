I am not going to collect this film for all the innumerable technical tasks, it would take two days to describe how all this is impossible even remotely. Others have already pointed out all the relevant nonsense. <br /> <br /> With all this in mind, I could still get pleasure from it, if only they didn’t include all the dirty, nauseous, infuriating, Disney sentimental nonsense, it is somewhere inappropriate, but nowhere else than in space, where the smallest mistake can mean instant death. <br /> <br /> The “crew”, like the “real” cosmonaut, were equally guilty of putting all their silly nonsense ahead of the rest. This completely destroyed any value that production could leave. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that NASA released this garbage so that so many people would get so much misinformation about something so important to them. If you have not seen this yet, save yourself from irritation. See Apollo 13 again. At least it tried to be something real.
