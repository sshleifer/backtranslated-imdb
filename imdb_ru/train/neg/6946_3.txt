I watched this movie a long time ago (about 10 years or so), and then I liked it. I remembered this the other day and decided to look again. The second time was not pleasant. The acting is “so, so”, the plot is illogical, unwise and predictable. <br /> <br /> Acting ... I'm sure these actresses could not play these characters. The plot ... in hell for nothing these women would not have gone from the first robbery, much less than the second. (side note: why TT didn’t understand that even if she comes with a lot of money for a date in court, they will ask where she received her and she will not have a logical answer! Dean, Dean ... we have cheater!). Black women stereotyped terribly, saying that the only way black women could “beat the system” or get a large amount of money was to steal it and not use their intelligence or other resources. It plays too much on sympathy, because they all die at the end (Jada's bar), but it's not sad (you think: “They were so stupid, they deserve to die). You just do not care about the characters, if you are not a small person. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that this film is rated higher 5.
