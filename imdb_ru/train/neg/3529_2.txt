I heard that this film was much more stylistic than the film's director Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Trick), the problem is that it may be too stylistic. In fact, Jake Green (Jason Statham) was released from prison after seven years of solitary confinement, and for two years he has been playing out a bunch of his money. He is ready to take revenge on the violent casino owner who sent Jake to prison, Dorothy Mr. D'Macha (Ray Liotta). At the same time, doctors tell Jake that he has only three days left to live, as he dies from a rare blood disease, oh, and Macha puts killers on him. Zack sharks Zach (Vincent Pastore) and Avi (Andre Benjamin) require Jake to give them back the money and do some strange work for them. The film is filled with Jake's story through some memories and the last three days before he came to a great revelation about Zack and Avi and Mac, well, I suppose that was the case. Also starring Terence Maynard as Frenchman Paul, Andrew Howard as Billy, Mark Strong as sorter, Francesca Annis as Lily Walker, Angela Lauren Smith as Doreen and Alan Binish as Rachel. This sequence, including a small animation, repeating lines twice in different angles and changing speeds for a moment, and all this is annoying to the degree of confusion and boredom, turning it into a silly criminal drama. Pretty poor!
