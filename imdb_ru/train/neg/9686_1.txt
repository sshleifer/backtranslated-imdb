Writer / director Peter Greenway secures his title of “High Lord of the Arts pretentious home” with his latest exercise in disgusting self-indulgence, “8 ½ women.” The film tells how a rich Englishman and his son seek sexual satisfaction when they lure and blackmail women (guess how many) to join their personal collection of concubines. <br /> <br /> Think of any possible way this premise can be offensive, and there is a possibility that Greenway did it. Female characters - this is nothing more than a catalog of fetishes for the two main characters. This is obsessed with Kabuki Mio, eternally pregnant with Jakonda and Beryl, who love farm animals. Juliet has no legs and she uses a wheelchair, she is “half woman,” you understand? Greenway furiously denies any accusations of misogyny, but if this is not the case, then what? <br /> <br /> The film continues to eroticize anything and anything relating to Japan, a continuation of the snoring from its worthy (but less sexist) 1996 film “Book of Pillows” But where the Book of Pillows was erotic and elegant, 8 ½ women just become agitated and exploitative. Greenaway’s work is tasteless and arrogant in his fetishism, and the only person who would probably like to watch it is the author himself.
