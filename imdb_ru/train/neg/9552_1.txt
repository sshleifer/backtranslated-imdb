Just a good old fool. <br /> <br /> I mean really stupid, and not such a fool as Killer Tomatoes or Ed Wood films, this is probably the stupidest film I've ever seen. To give this film a wonderful Turkey is an insult to turkeys. Calling this film stupid is offensive to even stupid people. <br /> <br /> If this is the future of American cinema and art, then we'd better really start World War 3 and 4 at the same time and let the cockroaches run the show after. <br /> <br /> Now I have to get drunk to wash this insult from my only mental person .... <br /> <br /> This is a really good movie if you are suicidal.
