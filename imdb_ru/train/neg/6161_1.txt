This is perhaps the worst film about fencing and sword fighting. This is not only because the so-called sports fencing leaves much to be desired, but also because the plot, the characters are so weak that they have to rush into the half-naked sex scene, and later, the intended group dances around the fencing scene in the fencing club I suppose maintain the interest of the audience. What a waste of talents F. Murray Abraham. You better serve up bloated fraudulent films such as Zorro, Scaramouche, with anything in which Evil Rhysbone plays the villain. As a swordsman himself, I recognize the almost impossible shooting of fencing as a sport on film, but if it ever happens, he needs more fresh, better traced characters and a plot with greater depth.
