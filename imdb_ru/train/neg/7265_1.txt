Just saw it at the Chicago Film Festival - avoid it at all costs if you have no trouble sleeping. This is a film full of claims - it starts with a small quote from Hiroshima Mon Amour and from there everything goes down. Camera work - imagine the child trying to imitate Wong Kar Vai. Storyline - Smokey Robinson and Miracles “The love I saw in you was just a mirage,” expanded from 3 minutes to over 2 hours, but filled with repetition. For sickening pain, this film is on a bench in the Methodist church where my parents dragged me when I was a child. I want 2+ hours of my life to be returned. Promoter Julian Hernandez anticipated watching with a commentary that the film was “controversial” - this is true only for the narcotic effect of the film.
