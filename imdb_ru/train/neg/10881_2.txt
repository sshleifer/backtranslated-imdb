My friend's mom worked in a video store and watched movies before they came out, so when she brought home Monastery, a horror film, I could not wait to watch it. Considering that it must be scary, but really just ridiculous, I can say that in some strange way I like this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, the game is bad, and yes, this is the cheapest movie I've ever seen, but it's damn funny! "WHAT DO YOU HAVE A COUP?!" I didn't know that this film was even ever released ... I thought it was too bad ... <br /> <br /> Yes, so ... overall the film is pretty bad (you should recognize that so much at least) but I promise you, you will laugh at it. <br /> <br /> * This movie sucks, but it's good for a laugh ... especially the guy who holds the "dagger of despair" .. DAGGER DESPAAAAAIR!
