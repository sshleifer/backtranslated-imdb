Lois Weber, a self-proclaimed missionary through the cinema, wrote, directed and produced other films on controversial topics, but thanks to TCM this film can be the first to be widely distributed This film is her abortion charge, but she cleverly confuses the issue, bringing in eugenics and control fertility, leaving the impression that they are somehow equivalent to an abortion. Her talent for writing and other cinematic skills are clearly visible here, but you can be forgiven for using them less didactically. If you're wondering what Tyrone Power’s “famous father” looked like, this is your chance. 1916 mod and cars are also on display to add to the interests of this museum piece. It's nice, even if you do not appreciate the propaganda.
