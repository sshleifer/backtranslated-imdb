Another Die Hard right on the video rip off the cardboard villains ?? How many more of these godly, horribly cheap (and terrible) ripped off from the more popular militants of the late 1980s and early 1990s are still hiding there? For reference (not that you really care), this is another glaring breakdown of the combination of Die Hard, Under Siege and Speed ​​2 with a full set of cliches and predictability. <br /> <br /> The indescribable villains are the usual choice of cardboard thugs who are sent in various ways during the film, the hero, of course, a former policeman or something that has problems with family and attitude, and, of course, he does not carry with him to the party only ordinary emotional baggage, as well as a piece of eye candy and his annoying son. <br /> <br /> The proposed luxury cruise liner, which runs between Florida and Mexico, is carefully described as a cross between a liner and a ferry. ?? does this somehow explain why they appear on a rusty ferry crossing? in New Zealand! The game is as wooden as a deck, the scenario is terrible, the predictable liner, the villains are completely inappropriate, and there are holes in the plot through which you can swim in a boat. <br /> <br /> It never seems to end with this kind of robbery streaming directly to video junk that pollutes late night TV slots and DVD supermarket bins everywhere (although even this film is so bad that I haven’t seen a DVD release yet give him time!) Is there a chance for something at least half decently made, semi-believable and the most important ORIGINAL?!? No, I did not think ??
