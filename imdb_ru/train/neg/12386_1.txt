It's hard to make an impartial judgment about a film like this, which had such an impact on me at such a young age. This is without a doubt the worst kind of film exploitation. I was not lucky to see this film for the first time in my youth, I will never forget it. I thought it was the worst movie ever made. Then I saw it again at the beginning of this year and was again terrified. <br /> <br /> I am not a fanatic or one who says that others should and should not see, but I was very offended at how awful something was, as rape was considered in this film. I love low cinema, but it's just disgusting. Rent a little Rus Meier instead.
