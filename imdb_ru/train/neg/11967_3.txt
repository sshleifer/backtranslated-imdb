Given the risk of showing same-sex relationships before the end of the 1980s, Personal Best could better play the same-sex relationship between Hemingway (Chris Cahill) and Donnelly (Tori Skinner) as more than an experimental phase of Cahillâ€™s life. br /> <br /> It seems to me that the creators of this film threw same-sex relations between two rather attractive women in order to attract viewers. Also note the 90 seconds of a crotch outcrop of several women jumping backwards through a pole for high jumps. This random scene had a VERY LITTLE relationship to the film, and it seemed like it was just to get the audience interested in this soft film. I guess the producers tried to resist the boring plot and the even more boring environment of the film (1980 Oregon Athletics Competition). <br /> <br /> This review may seem harsh, but it's true. The exploitation of the body of young Muriel Hemingway and same-sex relationships destroyed any credit I would give to this film. <br /> <br /> Pepper Thompson
