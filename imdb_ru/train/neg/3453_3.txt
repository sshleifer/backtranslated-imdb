It seems that in the IMDb reviews of this film more attention is paid than to the sources. <br /> <br /> Here is a review without complaints: <br /> <br /> Just when you think that nothing is going to happen, it is not. <br /> <br /> Dress it the way you like, it's a boring movie, full of restless characters, with little interest. <br /> <br /> One of them that needs to be put If you want to convince an impressionable emo chick that you're so deep, man. <br /> <br /> Although this is not what you need for your own pleasure. <br /> <br /> Unless <. br /> <br /> You. <br /> <br /> Arty.
