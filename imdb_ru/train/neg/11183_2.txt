“People I Know” is a clanker who has no one to root for and no one to care for - despite the efforts of a talented actor. <br /> <br /> Pacino plays the role of Eli Wurman. his former main advertising agent, devoid of life of moral decay. But unlike Michael Corleone, it is impossible to emotionally invest in this character, his dilemma or his fate. <br /> <br /> The film traces Eli’s preparation for the benefit of a liberal political affair, although he is distracted by the client (Ryan O'Neill, good at the signed part) the last dirty wash - in this case, the television actress’s companion which is related to the wrong people. Thea Leoni brings her usual star power to this supporting role, although, again, the script does not give her much work. Like Eli's sister-in-law, Kim Basinger manages to evoke sympathy, despite the implausible mechanics of the plot. <br /> <br /> This film is intended exclusively for those who like to watch Pacino flaunt his work and enjoy other directors. Unfortunately, between the script and the direction “People I Know” is strictly amateurish. Hence his limited theatrical release and quick DVD tour. Consider yourself warned.
