Guy Ritchie's third movie (not counting the ungodly “Swept”) is a complex action movie dedicated to gambling, gangsters and chess. Fans of Richie’s previous efforts are likely to hate the Revolver, just like me, with his twists and turns. Richie steadfast Jason Statham plays Jake, a newly released ex-convict to take revenge on the ridiculously named Dorothy Mach (great OTT Ray Liotta), but instead gets caught up in a couple of other minuses (one of which is Andre 3000) from Outkast rap outfit) throw him and us, the audience, a lot of red herring throughout the film, and it all becomes extremely tedious. The highlight of this clutter of the film is a piece in the restaurant, where the dialogues are transformed in favor of the wonderfully filmed, slow-motion shootout set for Beethoven’s sonata in the moonlight. In general, the Revolver is an erroneous job, not entirely horrible, but far from the best of Richie. It would still be Lock, Stock. If this film were the school's homework it would be appreciated "you have to try harder!"
