I, like many, are a fan of Tony Scott films. When this film came out, I had high hopes that it would be like “Man in Fire”. To find out that a movie is the furthest thing from it! The story was on the move from the start, and Mickey Rourke's choice was not such a good idea. And the whole scene was too gratis! <br /> <br /> The film is dedicated to Kiera Kinghtli, and this film shows that she will never become a movie star! The film was one of the worst acts ever. <br /> <br /> I like the directorial work of Tony Scott, but this requires all the damn cake! Sorry, Ton, 1 out of 10!
