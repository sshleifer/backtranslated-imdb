This is one of the worst games I've ever seen. I love Nadia Almereyd, but this is just an absolute idea. In addition to a few interesting moments of cinematography and music, this film is simply non-stop and dull material. Jared Harris is especially bad, but no one is so good at it. The plot is a joke, but not haha. I don't even know if you can forgive films that are so bad. Please erase the last hour and a half of my life. How did this director make Nadia and the other girl another planet?
