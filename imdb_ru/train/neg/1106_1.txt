Don't waste your time on this thing. As depicted, the characters do not have redemptive values, and to observe their interaction is an obvious torture. "Gothic" was entertainment, at least that shit. If you like to look at pretentious and spoiled poets who are trying to outwit one another, this may be right in your way. Lord Byron is portrayed as a complete jerk, and why others decided to spend more than five minutes with him is truly amazing. Mary Shelley seems to be the only character with any spine, but even she comes out of the whole ordeal without a drop of respect. What a waste of time. Look gothic instead. I also remember watching another excellent film based on the same topic, but did not catch the title. I hoped that was the case, but not such luck. Not recommended.
