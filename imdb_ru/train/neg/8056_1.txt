A clumsy, boring and rambling supernatural “thriller” in which college student Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller) is a constant victim of hallucinations and nightmares after a car accident that kills her boyfriend Shawn (Casey Affleck). <br /> <br /> I can't start telling you how bad it is ... nothing important ever happens and there is no real entertainment value. I did not like this cast in this particular film - all of them, unfortunately, are not convincing (again, their roles are not suitable). To promote it like a horror movie is a joke. Where scares? There is no point or expectation in it - there are some good songs, but that's all. <br /> <br /> How did this project get the green light? Screenwriter Steve Carpenter doesn't have any visible vision or talent that I can sense. Worst of all, the conclusion really makes the whole movie meaningless. <br /> <br /> The estimated “killer cut” I saw is 86 minutes of sheer fatigue. <br /> <br /> 1/10
