I have not read the original story to find out all the literary moments that went wrong here, so I am not going to go this way here. <br /> <br /> But I’ve found out for a while that Stephen King’s films are simply not horror films, perhaps with a few exceptions. It was not one of them. It started quite well, and this time I am not going to complain about the acting, although Fred Gwynn was, as usual, wonderful ... I will also forgive the complete lack of parenting skills, as they were necessary for the story to develop. ... <br /> <br /> But there was one constant moment that I could not help but annoy. And it came pretty close to the end of the film, and at least 2 characters took part in stupid stupid activities. The moments I refer to are as follows: a tiny zombie runs around the house. You suspect it's under the bed. <br /> <br /> (a) Come as close to the bed as possible before blindly lifting the duvet cover, exposing pretty much your whole body to any damage that such a small undead cannibal can do to you or <br /> < br /> (b) Move away from the bed a little so that you can look under the fully open end from a slightly increased security position, or at least see how the mini-terror approaches you, giving you a little response time. <br /> <br /> I know, let's move to (a). I feel that I am offering myself to the slaughter today. Bleh <br /> <br /> Although the movie is quite funny ... Just not very scary.
