A rather obvious thriller by numbers, in which the only possible twist is hiding anything. I mainly looked at Isabel Huppertâ€™s English-language presentation. It was not great, but then it was a strange role. I would not be surprised if half of her contribution is on the floor in the workshop, along with several script rewrites at the last minute. <br /> <br /> Acting is the least attractive thing about this film. Steve Guttenburg looks like he is trying to fulfill his role in charm, which everyone says he has. There is a sensationally silly sequence in which it is assumed that his sexual mastery can help in the treatment of PTSD. This is an uninteresting presentation. Elizabeth McGovern is more of a draw with true charm and character, but this is a small consolation. 3/10
