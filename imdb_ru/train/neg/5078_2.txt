If the Exorcist II: The Heretic of 1977 did not do him any good, it is difficult to imagine that this outstanding actor Richard Burton saw in this gloomy exercise without thrills. You've seen it all before: Burton plays a writer who found that at an early age he has the power to move inanimate objects with the power of his mind (and you thought that Carrie did not affect Hollywood!). Medusa, although adapted from the novel by Peter Van Greenaway, plays like recycled goods, although the special effects in the final of the cathedral are solid (if they are characteristic). Lee Remick is somewhat present as a doctor, but otherwise the maintenance compound is extremely weak. Burton Hammy, but tired ... even telekinesis cannot save him at that moment. * 1/2 of ****
