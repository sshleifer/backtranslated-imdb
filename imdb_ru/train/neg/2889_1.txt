The case is the best part of the film, but it alone is not worth the purchase price. I expected that in the film “On the basis of a true story” there would be only an adhesive tape from poorly made clips shot on home video, with pretentious acting scenes and scenes of slaughter. Video scenes had numerous rewind situations that were used, probably, to increase the length of the function, and not for effects. I started this review before half of the film went through, and waited until it ended, in case it had a better end, but unfortunately it only gets worse. If I could mark it lower, it would be a negative ten. Learn from my mistake and save your money and time with it.
