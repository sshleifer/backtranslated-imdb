So, Angela grew up and received therapy and surgery to turn her into a real daughter, and not into the son from whom she was born, and now works as a - wait - a camp counselor! How appropriate, right? I know, I like it. In any case, the first sequel to the Sleepaway Camp franchise is subject to all the rules of horror sequels - more blood, more murders with more imagination (which are not original, but still more original), more nudity, more complex plot and, as a rule, worse than the original. <br /> <br /> It’s as fascinating as the original is that the characters and wardrobes are so dumb and so authentic from the 80s that it’s impossible not to laugh. At some point, the guy asks Angela, and she says, "I will call you," and then quickly leaves. The guy says to herself: “How will she call me? I don't have a phone! ”And then he sniffs his armpits, wondering what turned it off (this is hair, dude !!). <br /> <br /> It is well known that in slasher films of the 1980s, killed teenagers were more likely than not to be punished by a murderer for some kind of bad behavior, usually because he was too erratic. When I first started watching horror movies and first saw Friday, the 13th in the mid-90s, I was not aware of this. I learned about this in a film lesson a year or two later and was amazed that it was some kind of madness method. I was very impressed not only by the fact that the films conveyed a message, albeit a painful one, but also by the fact that some thoughts were actually put into it. <br /> <br /> But not in this movie! At some point, before Angela kills one of her victims, she says: “Let this be your lesson. Say no to drugs! ”Real thin screen labels, guys. Again, dialogue is the most interesting thing in the film. Angela (who, by the way, went through all this therapy, all these operations and all these troubles, to clear her past and rediscover herself as a normal and well-developed person, and then changed her name from Angela to, well, Angela), one moment says: “I don’t like being an evil western witch, but I know what happens when things get out of control.” (People start killing ... from me! HA!) <br /> <br /> Then she demands that one of the advisers, Mare, apologize, to which the girl replies: "I'd rather die!" Sorry, Mare, but you really went into it ... <br /> <br /> Two years ago I was a camp counselor who looked like the one shown in this film (except for the camp I taught) more than three children from 15 to 20 consultants, and he also had rules that are not in the film). It made me notice a discrepancy in the film of what camp life really looks like. <br /> <br /> It's okay, you can hardly make such a film when 9-year-old children run around, although in this film about 10 or 11-year-old children were killed. I have not seen this before much. <br /> <br /> Definitely bad taste, even for the 80s cheesy cinema.
