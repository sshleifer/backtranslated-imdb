I was intrigued to see how a little-known film of 2008 somehow won an Oscar for the best picture of 2009 and, thus, went to the “Lord of the Storm”. Unfortunately, everything I received during these two hours was a grim confirmation that this film received awards exclusively off-screen. <br /> <br /> The direction and visual style of this film are some of the weakest you will ever see. when he is not engaged in yet another worship of the personality of Bourne with terrible, annoying visual effects of "shaky cam", he shows all the signs of a second-rate daytime soap opera in terms of lensing. <br /> <br /> the “plot” is frayed, the characteristics are about as well developed as the rejected ideas of the comic strip about Beetle Bailey, and the dialogue is when the film ceases to be “minimalist” and turns one or two soldiers in the right talkers - one of the worst recorded ever. For the sake of justice, the actors do everything they can under the circumstances, but this is not enough to hide how bad the project is. <br /> <br /> In the whole film, it seems that it was conceived as a kind of “offensive” that they worked, was deprived of humor and, thus, edited as best as possible, to give it a serious drama. <br /> <br /> If you spend two hours on this film, these are two hours that you will never return, and two hours are wasted, that you will regret the rest of your life.
