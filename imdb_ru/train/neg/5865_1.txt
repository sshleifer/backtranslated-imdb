I can't say enough bad words about this train crash. This is one of the few films I've ever wanted to leave. At first it was a bad premise, first a pregnant man, but then they tried to make it a hoax. What do they fake all these real pregnant men ??? It was the worst movie I've ever seen. If he had enough votes, he would have been at the bottom of the IMDB 100. If it were possible to give him zero, I would do it, and I still would feel that I gave him too many credits.
