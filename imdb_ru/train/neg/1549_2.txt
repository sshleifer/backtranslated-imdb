While Leon is cute in SNL, he is only for a minute. Like most SNL movies for movies, this one cannot take 90 minutes. This one has a few nice moments (the ones you saw in the trailer), but the actors are mostly wasted. Tim Meadows does his best, but the plot just doesn't have a lot of high points. Will Farrell has a small part. Farrell may be the funniest man alive ... but not in this film. What a disgrace.
