When Stanvik's future husband was killed on the eve of their wedding, she retreats to the mountain lodge where she slides off the cliff and escapes a wealthy lawyer Morgan. Morgan falls in love with her, which leads to a definitely one-sided marriage, held in a huge estate in Chicago (which seems to be surrounded by mountains!). Stanvik is tempted by the dashing Cortez, but eventually returns to Morgan in a very muffled and unconvincing plot resolution. <br /> <br /> In this film there is a great cast (in particular, Morgan is one of my favorites) and a great director, but the script is tortuous and at times seems meaningless. I was so ready to enjoy this movie, but in the end I was disappointed. Still worth seeing the cast, and it's good for anyone who loves movies of the 1930s.
