This film was just painful to watch ... not in a good dramatic sense, which makes you feel emotions for well-developed characters in dramatic situations (yes, I pretty much made this last sentence while I was walking together), but only Absolutely boring for more than two hours. Now, you all might think that I am just some kind of ignorant reviewer who does not respect Shakespeare or “artistic filmmaking” ... well, you would be mistaken in both cases. I like the works of Shakespeare, especially the tragedies of Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth and Hamlet, and I watched many “art-house” films, such as the surreal and well-made film “Eraser” and “8 1/2” Fellini. ... but it was just over two hours lost in the translation of Shakespeare, TOO too much nudity (I can understand artistic nudity in SOME scenes ... but not in every other frame of the film !!! NOTHING FOR HISTORY !!!) and basically just overdone in filming. I had high hopes for this film because he was said to be “very artistic” and was an adaptation of Shakespeare's “The Tempest” ... but it was just utter disappointment. I gave this film three ONLY because of the acting presence of Sir John Gilgud (which far surpassed all the unnamed names in this film) and the combination of cinematographic / stage design, as many scenes looked like pictures in motion ... however, most of this film it would be better to just have a picture with a scroll of text under it. True disappointment ... maybe if Zeffirelli was given the director's chair, it would be much better. But this is the opinion of one of the audience, many people may like it much more than me. However, if you cannot find it in any of the nearest video stores (it is currently not on the DVD), do not try to go too far to find it ... it's not worth it.
