Well, I was a big fan of Black for a long time, and I was disgusted after watching this movie. Let's call the problem ... First, this film has a large part of the same team as the first two. He was also named PREQUEL for the original black stallion. Why can't they correctly name the color of the Shetan dam or its color? In the film “The Return of the Black Stallion” we learn that Sagra was the mother of BLACK DARK BLACK, and in this film her name is the gray mare Jenny? WTF? And it was installed in Africa in 1946 and 1947 ... I could be wrong, but the first one was installed in the 1940s, when the ship crashed. The timeline doesn't sound quite right for me. In addition, as nonsense, at the beginning of the film there is a frieze, which is supposed to be the father of Shetana ... after further notice, it seems like a geldinger. Ben Ishaak is the only character who even made this film in any way related to the previous two. For some, this may be a cute family movie, but this is my biggest disappointment in the movie of the year.
