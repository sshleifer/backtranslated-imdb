Although I usually advocate a well-made film, I do not limit myself to films that go beyond this, and more often I enjoy and admire films that successfully "break the rules." And it is absolutely true that the director Pasolini violates the rules of established cinema. But I also believe that he did not break them successfully or at any particular moment. <br /> <br /> Pasolini’s work looks ominous, but it’s not so much a matter of what’s actually on the screen than what it is. was shot, and the nervousness of his films seems not so much a matter of artistic choice as the result of amateur cinematography. This is true for DECAMERON. Pasolini often chose to use non-actors, and although many directors did this with remarkable results, under the guidance of Pasolini, his non-actors do not usually act as non-actors. This is also true for DECAMERON. Pasolini quite often includes images intended to shock, insult or otherwise embarrass the audience. Such elements can often be used with a striking effect, but in Pasolini’s hands such elements are rarely useful for a film. This also applies to DECAMERON. <br /> <br /> I was given to understand that there are many people who love, even admire Pasolini’s films. Despite this, I have never met any of them, and I could never read anything about Pasolini or his works that would make the reason for such sympathy or admiration understood by me. Judging by him only by his works, I believe that he was essentially an amateur director who “broke the rules” not so much by choice as by lack of skills - and who was originally welcomed by the intelligentsia of his time for “existential boldness”, thereby simply confirming his bad habits as a director. I find his work boring, unimpressive and pretentious. And this is also true for DECAMERON. Unfortunately, this is also true for almost every Pasolini film that I had to face.
