What the hell is this? My little cousin clearly chose this because of the overly female DVD art and the title ... I decided to watch it with her so that she would not be bored, and I was definitely shocked by the terrible quality. <br /> <br /> First, the acting was terrible. They seem to be amateur actresses reading cue cards. Delivery is not at par and very sample. The scenes of the scene were terrible ... it looks like they took it straight from the storyboard, if there was one. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the jokes and stereotypes were not original or not reproduced at all - again, very sample. I can't count how many times I could predict the next joke. I got a few laughs from the obviously “subtle” sexual hints. Cat, beaver dressing, Hung Wong? .. Come on! Just ... stay away from this movie. This is not nice, this is not funny, this is not even silly, funny. This is just stupid, stupid. This is similar to a children's PG movie with unnecessary sexual hints, vulgarity and violence to raise the MPAA rating. STAY. <br /> <br /> “Do you want to ride my yacht?” <br /> <br /> “Is this what they call now?” <br /> <br /> “You can ride on my dine. "<br /> <br />" Oh! I think I have blood on my stool! "<br /> <br /> Poorly played, sir.
