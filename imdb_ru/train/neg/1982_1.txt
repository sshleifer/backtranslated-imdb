Who! What kind? Where? When? What for? The game was terrible. Very robotic, rehearsed. I have seen all the actors in this film in the best roles. The script was very elementary. By the end of this movie, the storyline was connected. And Jean Claude Lamarr should be related too. So he never tries to write / direct another movie.
