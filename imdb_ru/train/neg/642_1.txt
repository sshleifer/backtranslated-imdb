First of all, if you are a fan of comics, you will be VERY disappointed, I'm sure! Low budget movie !!! Largo is supposed to be in a Serb comic, now he is suddenly becoming a Croat, pfff! producers of chicken, it gave some zest and courage to comics (by the way, in the film his father speaks Serbian, and he speaks Croatian ... Lol). The striking building N.YA. The winch becomes the usual medium small yacht in HK Cute Largo becomes some unshaven Tsigan / Turkish guy. Freddie, a cool pilot with a “neck-faced”, becomes somehow fat, out of shape, sad, ordinary guy. Simon, Largo's good friend, doesn't exist at all! He gave some pepper! Largo does not throw knives at all, but simply looks at the snake ... The whole story is confused and looks like a pretentious television film. French directors and producers, if you do not have the money, the possibilities or the technology to properly adapt the comics, please follow the romance that is being filmed in Paris. Very, very bad movie, it's good that I just shot it, do not expect me to see the sequel (if you have one!).
