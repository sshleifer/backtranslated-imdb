Probably more people are afraid of the dentist than, say, small monsters or scary looking dolls. Which makes it the perfect subject for a horror movie, really. <br /> <br /> Dr. Feynstone (Corbin Bernsen) has been a successful dentist for several years, but when he catches his wife cheating on him with a pool, he snaps and brings his anger and frustration into his work. Well, give the crazy dentist a drill and a mouth, and you can probably guess what will happen next ... <br /> <br /> As I said, a brilliant idea, but not implemented as it should. In particular, the final is a huge disappointment. One final note: follow Mark Ruffalo (you can count on me, Eternal Sunshine ...) in this. <br /> <br /> 5/10.
