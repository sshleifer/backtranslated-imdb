Unfortunately it's true. "Legiunea sträinä" with absolute clarity reveals the parameters of the irreversible failure of Danelyuk. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, the author has lost the ability to combine their meaningful factors and artistic intentions in a consistent form. Maniculously concerned with the mechanical technique of choosing random news stories and combining them without any legitimacy, he collects only an inordinate heap of events unable to follow the smallest storyline. The level of the script is similar to the amateur play “Cântarea României” about the glorious exploits of socialist realism - only turned upside down: while the communist line dictated narrow concern only to positivism and sweet festivalism, now Danelyuk is just as devastatingly obsessed with only negativism and disgusting skatologiya . The content of ideas is zero, and the “message”, infantile and didactic, at the level of kindergarten. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he also forgot the most elementary professional principles. He can no longer organize a dramatic situation, arrange it in the correct scene of the film, form it correctly and edit it, following the simplest rules of cinematic grammar. His level of storytelling in image films is like an expression of something like: "Holy man, this is not true, and all that people are asses!" What a great distance from the impressive artist of 1976-1984, who created unique works such as Course, Microphone Test, Vânätoarea de vulpi - and even Croaziera and Glissando ... Sic Transit Gloria mundi .. .
