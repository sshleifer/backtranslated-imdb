Five passengers at the bus stop tell each other their scary dreams, waiting for them to be taken away. But is there more in these nightmares than it seems at first glance? <br /> <br /> Fortunately, five bad movies for the price of one! Each segment features the worst acting skills, special effects, makeup, and music. And it was supposed to be scary? Hmm .. I think I was more excited about the Teletubbies episode. I swear you will sit there, like me, bored to tears, waiting in vain for something interesting. Do not worry It never does. In fact, I even stopped quickly sending commercials, as they were much more interesting than the main function. And the end - the final retreat. Yes, none of this really happened. If you could say the same thing the day I installed the VCR to record these shoemakers. 2/10
