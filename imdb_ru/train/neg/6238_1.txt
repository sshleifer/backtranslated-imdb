Oh dear, it is amazing how someone can claim global warming to be a science, well, I think that this elite nonsense replaces the science of eugenics! Al Gore is trying to make this question sound complicated, even if common sense is just needed, to see that all this is a big lie of a man with his own program of making money! <br /> <br /> How did scientists estimate the historical temperatures of this planet? Evaluating sunspot activity. No one ever asked if this method was accurate? No, not even Gore himself! So, how the hell won't it be accurate to predict future temperature with sunspot activity if it was so accurate in the past? According to the activity of sunspots, the temperature today is fully consistent with what should be. Why did the temperature in the whole universe grow (relatively) just like on Earth? Does our SUV cause a temperature increase on Jupiter? <br /> <br /> Use common sense! You do not need to be a rocket scientist to understand that this is nothing but HOAX. Please explore it yourself. What will Al Gore and his elite friends like the Rothschild (the banking family who organized the live earth event) benefit from? Well, a new global bank will be based on carbon credits, that is, a tax on everything that CO2 passes, and it is easier to get away with these taxes if people are inclined to think that it will save the world when it is only about money, central control. and the greater power of elite bankers. Al Gore even has a company that sells carbon credits! Isn't it noble voluntary to pay carbon credits to save the world, especially if it goes to his own company? <br /> <br /> I do not want you to blindly believe me, please do your own research and use your common sense, and I am sure that you will come to the right conclusion!
