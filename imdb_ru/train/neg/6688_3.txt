This film is pretty awful, but I have some interesting information about it: <br /> <br /> It was filmed in 1976 at the University of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff, Arizona, and also in Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona, state Arizona. Most of the extras in the film are drama students from NAU. That year I was a novice there, I was engaged in the theater, but for some reason I was not interested in staging. Nevertheless, I knew several people who did this and could lead to this rather strange fact: <br /> <br /> In this film there is a scene in which two leaders, within the framework of their hazing ritual, have to face the woods. They are seen from behind in the film, doing just that. The fact is that these are not actors at all, but two guys whom I knew from the theater department. The identity of these “tricks” will remain anonymous, at least on this site, unless they decide to “reveal” themselves!
