This poor film shows that even some of the best in Hollywood cannot save a real deposit at a dump. <br /> <br /> I could have spent a lot of time describing everything that was bad in this effort, but it would have taken more time, and I We already spent 91 minutes watching ... THIS. <br /> <br /> Looking at it now, after Brandoâ€™s death, it is clear how tragic the life of one of our greatest actors is. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland? What for? <br /> <br /> I need to fill in more lines for this to be accepted. I have to fill in more lines for this to be accepted. I need to fill in more lines for this to be accepted. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on this movie. I have to do something interesting. Goodbye.
