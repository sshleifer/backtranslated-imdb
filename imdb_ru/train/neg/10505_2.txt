If you like Blair S, you will like this one. He has the same lousy cinematography work and soundtrack, and he has the same non-existent plot and disturbing moments. <br /> <br /> Tom Savini is also there, so if you like Dawn of the Dead Romero or Tarantino and Rodriguez "From Dusk Till Dawn" are waiting for you. He is an icon, and a very good actor. <br /> <br /> No, seriously. This film is by far the most disgusting film that I have seen in a long time, and I have seen quite a few films, including bad ones. I can tell you that I think most horror films are interesting in some respects, but it was just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this film 2 instead of 1 was naked chicks. and hot action with all sharp plastic teeth ... No, I'm just kidding. I must have missed before clicking “send” in the voting form. <br /> <br /> Stay away, although the cover shows sexy girls with teeth!
