If you are not an evangelical Christian, then become like an Egyptian and avoid like the biblical plague. <br /> <br /> Awful - why IMDb lists the most favorable reviews at the top of the list - this was due to one of them I just lost the end of what began as a good evening on this pop. <br /> <br /> The plot of the story began quite strong - I was dragged into the film, and I was interested right up to the point where the biblical sermons took over. What a waste. <br /> <br /> This film so outraged me that I first signed up for IMDb just to complain about it - I hope that at least in this way I will save someone else's evening. <Br /> <br /> Hey - what a Christian act on my part ;-)
