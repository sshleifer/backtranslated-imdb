There were so many films based on the same theme. a lonely sweet girl needs a beautiful boy to impress the former, pays him, and then (guess what?), she falls in love with him, there is a little awkward, followed by a number before everyone makes up for the happy end ..... has been done many times. <br /> <br /> The fact is that I knew this before I started looking. But despite this, I was still waiting for it. In good hands, with a good cast and a bright script, it can still be a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. <br /> <br /> This was none of that. <br /> <br /> this was terrible. <br /> <br /> A female leader, devoid of charm or wit, who absolutely could not ignite even the slightest spark in me. I really didn’t care if she “got her man” or was left lonely and unhappy. <br /> <br /> A male leader who, after several of his endless words of wisdom, I wanted to kill. Just to take that smug look away. I had no idea that the life of a male whore was the path to an all-seeing all-knowing enlightenment. <br /> <br /> A completely unrealistic film filled with unrealistic characters. none of them seemed to have a job, they all had more money than sense, the groom who still continues her wedding, having learned that his bride was sleeping with her best friend ... plus "I will miss you , even if we had never met "!!!!! I could go on, but I just realized that I was spending even more time on this dross ..... I could rant about the character’s presentation, just to laugh at the name "Woody" very cheaply, but in fact it was the only remotely funny thing that happened in the film.
