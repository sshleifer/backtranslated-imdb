End the weekend? Then it is a film to speed up their departure, otherwise it will cause a catatonic state in order to bring welcome relief from constant whining. <br /> <br /> The film is supposedly set on board a luxury cruise liner, which is a more senior car ferry; The plot has more holes than the average colander, and the cast, extracted from the depths of the celebrity list D. An interesting part of the additional entertainment is the “Find the Villain” game when passengers join the ship. You can not go wrong !!!! With a script that sinks faster than brick, clichéd fragments and copious amounts of raspberry jam, doubling in blood, this film tries to cover the genres of thriller, action movie and casserole and at the same time cannot perform any of them. > <br /> We must watch the movie, just to laugh at how bad everything is.
