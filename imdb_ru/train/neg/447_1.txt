Well, what can you say about comedies. There is often quite sucks, morally, selflessly and simply. So this show! He got a boring lineup, although A. Beynes is in her perky manner, the rest is just stereotyped crap ... as always We all saw it before, and probably will see it again when this show is canceled. Because, let's face it, this is a mediocre and smug show. Like most sitcoms .... <br /> <br /> Well, in short. If you want to see good entertainment, you can take a twenty-minute pause in front of the mirror. Make a few faces and move on ... It's more fun than this show!
