I rented this on a DVD without any prior knowledge. I was suspicious of seeing Michael Madsen in a movie I had never heard of, but it was a freebie, so why not check it out. <br /> <br /> Well, I think Mr. Blond would very much like to forget that he ever took part in such a disgrace of the film. <br /> <br /> Obviously, if your script and dialogues are terrible, even good actors cannot save the day. Not to mention the amateur actors who flooded this film. Too many non-native speakers of English play the role of native speakers of English, reading lines from a script that should have been discarded, not turned into a movie. It's incredible how incredible all the lines in a movie are. The music is terrible and completely out of place, and it all looks and sounds like a bad school play. <br /> <br /> I recommend that you watch it just so that you rate other, better films. That's why I gave him 3 instead of 1, which he deserves.
