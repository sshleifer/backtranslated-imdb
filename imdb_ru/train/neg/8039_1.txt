This meaningless movie is a piece of shit and boring, like a full house of repetitions. All people who want to see a wonderful, exciting and awesome horror film should not even think about watching this meaningless work. F- in my opinion. I have one question, what were they thinking? Let's make a list: 1) bad script 2) bad script 3) bad script 4) bad behavior 5) bad direction and, finally, a bad script. I mean, I don't like grumbling about every movie, but I was disappointed when I watched it. This film should be banned in the box, locked and lowered into the sea. So please, don't do something like that again, please, please, please !!!!
