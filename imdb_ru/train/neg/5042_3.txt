The main claim to this film is that I CAN'T say who is who. No racism is supposed, but these Asians look alike! I can tell something from the story, but damn it, that’s all. The identities of nations are not a mystery, if they were a mystery, I would take care of them. Instead, I haven't been off the screen. <br /> <br /> Tons of wide cadres and silent speechless people occupy this film. Damn, this is boring, not only do I not know these people, but they just sit there. <br /> <br /> The script is a typical Chinese John Woo, a terrible video with worn scenes. It only looks a little better than Andy Lau's “Fulltime Killer” (which was a great movie). You might think with a decent budget, they could at least make it look like Hollywood in the 90s. I did not know that the Chinese had these art-house beatniks.
