For 50 years after World War II, the United States was in a state where military interests dominated key segments of the economy. At the same time, because of the draft and wars, everyone in society served or were associated with someone who had. <br /> <br /> This allowed for a minimum level based on the concept of American agility in the midst of an inflexible military machine. Sometimes this machine was non-US military, for example, in prisoner of war situations. Once the stories were deleted in other machines: science fiction and corporate, but they always refer to this military genre, and in fact testosterone shots even refer to their comic brother. <br /> <br /> You can track this, I think, perhaps starting from the comic, meaning Amrican, the sections of the Great Escape, which immediately spawned TeeVee in Gomer Pyle and Heros Hogan. Then the second wave, called "Catch 22" and "MASH", which were real life, then books, then films, and in the case of MASH, then TeeVee. <br /> <br /> But first and foremost was the Phil Silvers show about Sergeant Bilko, and this was followed from Mr. Roberts. A happy crook who committed only harmless crimes, and only in response to an overly rude system that tried to limit his life. That was the day TeeVee shows mattered. You absorbed them instead of just taking them to work to chat. It was not very clever, except that we found a gap between what we wanted to control and freedom. <br /> <br /> This is one big zone in which the Americans decided that they think about the excusable, even sweet, lies in a military context, an area that was assigned to one of our political parties here. <br /> <br /> Since he is big, he sometimes pays off with laughter. The Stripes were pretty darn funny, I thought. There were some losers in it who actually defeated serious opponents, something like the “dirty dozen”. And a sexual adventure. <br /> <br /> Now this is long before the escalation of cultural wars. He is trying to touch this sweet spot, like the other remakes that beat Steve Martin. This is so unfair, you are actually supporting the army to be a stronger player. Another way to track how society solves the problem of military power. <br /> <br /> Ted Evaluation - 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.
