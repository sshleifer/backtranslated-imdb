This movie was sold for one dollar at Wal-Mart on DVD, and so I don’t feel that I’ve lost anything to watch this movie except TIME. I enjoyed playing Tom Hanks (Robbie Wheeling), who was very young and looked great, considering that it was a terrible scenario. The story of the students who decided to play the Mazes & Monsters game only in a very realistic setting. Robbie Wheeling has had problems with playing this game in other colleges in the past, and his parents advise to leave the game alone and get good grades. Robbie meets a very cute girl and romantically falls in love with her, and as soon as he starts to play the game, he stops making love to her and behaves like a Monk. The film has several scenes shot around the former World Trade Center, as well as in the observation room and on the roof. It is rather sad to see this part of the film, where so many people died from evil in the world. This is not a very good film, except that Tom Hanks is trying to keep the film above the sinking level of entertainment.
