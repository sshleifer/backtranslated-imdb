This film is supposed to be a mysterious, serious thriller about a man searching for a missing girl. However, after 30 minutes, the film turns into a funny, unrealistic story with annoying characters and random scenes. I can not imagine that someone laughed when Cage randomly kicks this blonde or when he “bear” beats this old woman. Lines, characters, and actions are all poorly done from the start. I always liked Nicolas Cage as an actor, but this year he made some horrible films; this is by far the worst (for now ...). <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this film to anyone who wants to watch an exciting plot thriller. If you really want to enjoy this story, go on renting the original. However, if you intend to watch it, get ready to laugh at some lines and final scenes, and not take them seriously; This is the only way to enjoy this movie.
