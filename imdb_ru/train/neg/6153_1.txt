So let me start by saying that I saw this film as part of a deal. I was very bored one day in 1997, and I rode a bicycle to a rental shop. I asked the clerk what the worst movie he had available. Without hesitation, he escorted me to "Lucky." He told me that he would refuse a rent of $ 1 (he said that it would be wrong to charge an additional fee) if I promised to watch the entire movie. See what I did for free ... <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. Awful even. I do not need to go into the details of the plot, read other reviews. Jokes do not make sense. The game was terrible. I know that it was supposed to be a comedy, but the main character’s stupidity was exhausting. You can try to see it as something you can laugh at, but it’s so bad that it’s not even funny in that sense. Avoid!
