One of the most boring slasher ever .. If you can even call it that. I would not watch this if he even ended up with some kind of porn movie that she completely reminds. The fact that you are watching a small group of middle-aged people in the forest is really unbearable. They made such films for teenagers, so who did they strive for when they organized this dream festival? My favorite part of this movie is the cover, and this is the only reason I decided to search for this movie, which turned out to be part of the movie Suspense Classics 50 Movie Pack ... and after watching other films in this 50th package, you will understand that does not belong anywhere. So, if you are set up for a decent killer in the woods, I recommend Just Before Dawn and The Final Terror.
