it seemed like a strange combination of Scotch and I with Room with a View. Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it didn't. The tragedy is that they changed the name for the release in the United States. Keeping Apidistra Flying is much better than the name "A Merry War". the acting was fine, the script was fine .. overall it was a mediocre film ..
