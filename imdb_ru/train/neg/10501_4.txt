Some people say that the tricks and sociable personality of Steve Irwin is just an act. Watch this movie: it is obvious that he can not play. <br /> <br /> Steve Irwin, the Dangerman small screen star in his Crocodile Hunter's Diaries, Crocodile Files and the Crocodile Hunter series of the same name (do you see the naming tendency here, or is it just me?) sends his person more than a strip to the big screen with the help of “Crocodile Hunter: Collision” * (yes, there is a certain tendency of words starting with “C”) - basically the episode with “Crocodile Hunter” * stitched together with B -Movie. <br /> <br /> On the mission to move a large crocodile to save it from being shot by an eccentric farmer (Magda Shubanski), Steve and wife Terry do not know that American spies track a crocodile (Lachy Hulme and Kenneth Ransom) to find a satellite the spy he swallowed. Will it hurt my credibility if I say: “They are on their way to facing the fools”? (What is trustworthy? - Ed.) <br /> <br /> The plot does not matter, since it is Steve's animal magnetism that drives the film. If you find that his personality is trying, the film fails, but if you are a fan of him (as a businessman, environmentalist or just a clown) or his television shows, expect more from the same on the widescreen budget. <br /> <br /> John Stainton, a loyal liege, best assistant and helper of the crocodile hunter * oeuvre * (can you call it with an imperturbable face?), writes and sends with the same provincial conceit that made Steve a home jester about wild nature. <br /> <br /> The most unpleasant aspect of this film is that Steve (one of the few who can hear exclamation marks when he speaks) and Terry (Steve is a spouse of 10 years, the most cruel ally and closest friend) , treat it as one of your documentaries, breaking the “fourth wall” and turning directly to the camera, while all the other characters behave as if they are in a bad movie (Well ??). It would not be so inappropriate if Steve and Terry were kept apart from the rest of the characters. but when bad Americans constantly threaten Steve’s life, we, the Confused Viewers, have to ask ourselves why an indifferent film crew, at least, doesn’t call the police, if it doesn’t try to stick microphones with booms into the eyes, or rushes to shout everything in the bush, except to continue shooting, with excellent lighting, clear sound and seven angles of action. <br /> <br /> While Terry is unfairly painted as a slightly incompetent assistant to Steve (her game consists of boldly inept lines that read and walk in pear-shaped jeans that hug the buttocks - the last I’m not complaining) Steve talks about his common affairs: show and tell about the creatures intending to kill him, performing all his tricks himself, because for him they are not really tricks, just “A day at the office”. <br /> <br /> Of course, observing the adventures of this crazy Ku-Ku after his tragic death in September 2006 causes a strange detachment about the proceedings. But for those of us who have never met him, this type of malaria (as well as various incarnations of the Crocodile Hunter series in constant re-runs) supports him more than ever in our crocodile holes. The painful reality of his absence will be apparent only to those who are near him. And I sincerely wish them all the best in its huge tracks? <br /> <br /> So enjoy this entertainment for what it is ?? unfinished movie with a legend. He died doing what he loved ?? communication with wildlife - and he would never have asked for more of his first feature film, in which he portrays that this is what he does. <br /> <br />
