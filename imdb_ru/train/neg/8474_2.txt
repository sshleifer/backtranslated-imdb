Opening scenes move as smoothly as frozen velveteen. Attempting a dramatic dialogue only makes me want me to better control fast-forward. Vampires are usually portrayed as sexy and intelligent or hideous creatures. This vampire is trying to seduce his victim by imitating a lost puppy. I usually count the number of corpses, so there was a cat (which doesnâ€™t count), an ass, a girl who fell from the sky with a sword in it (whatever it is), and then a plot. Foley artists are respected for using celery to create the sound of a broken arm, but using the sound of a biting apple for a vampire biting a victim is just silly. I liked the Warlock, but this film just stank so much that we turned it off, and it was so easy to forget that we rented a year later only to turn it off again.
