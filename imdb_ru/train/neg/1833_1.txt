Please, someone will prevent Ben Stiller from filming ANY movie. Write studios, hell, even write to a local congressman. I had more fun at the funeral than when I watched ANY Stiller film. Jack Black is trying to come up with a comedy about the disappearance of dog shit, and Christopher Walken, perhaps one of the greatest actors of his generation, just looks confused when he is there. Stiller is his unflattering personality, but now, even when someone has rescued him, he proves that he is too overrated as a comic. No wonder why this film failed and became available from dollar cinemas in just a few weeks. I warn you, and you must warn your friends, do not watch this film, it is just terrible, worse than Gothic (personally, I never thought I would say this), worst Plan 9, Worst Ishtar, worst then the Golden Child. Please, Hollywood, stop letting Ben Stiller star in your films, he's not funny, he's a terrible actor, and he brings others along. The next film was rated as 1, because negative evaluations are not allowed, therefore, as long as one is written on the blackboard, I will give him zero.
