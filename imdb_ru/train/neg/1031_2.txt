This movie is one long chick after another. First of all, although they have contributed, there is an unreasonable dope scene where John sniffs grass like an idiot. Wigs and accents are terrible. They sound worse than old Beatles cartoons. John is a nasty, envious, secretive homosexual, servant of Yoko, whom he portrays in the discredited book of Albert Goldman. They even continue to pronounce the names of the songs in the usual conversation “it was always only two of us”! John, too, would not be angry for his fans. As if his death showed us that he was too sweet, if anything. One funny scene is when a dumb fan of the Beatle finds out only John and asks him to sing the song of Paul last night. Insulted John says something like: "Of course, and while I am humming, why don't you get on your knees, put on your wife's wig and lick my liggin." It made me laugh for a few days. In fact, this film is funny by how serious it is trying to seem funny. John and Paul also did not sit pontifical all day, they were funny, carefree guys who even break up during the Beatles, where they are much more personable than they are depicted here. Forget it.
