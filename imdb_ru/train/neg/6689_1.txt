I can only assume that the other reviewers of this “film” are shareholders in the production company, since this was possibly the worst film I have seen in the past five years. From the first picture of the rabbi, who was laughing uncontrollably for no apparent reason, it became clear that the actors in this film would be killed in order to be considered “B-Level”. My wife and I were in a great mood before the start of this film, and we sincerely expected a funny movie about popcorn. We knew that we had not rented Citizen Kane, and we did not expect to see the most amazing film ever. However, after 40 minutes of patience in the most painfully unfunny piece of garbage I have ever seen, we turn it off, instead of wasting other minutes of our life. <br /> <br /> If “comedy” is a terrible game without laughter, subtle plot and annoying characters are your thing, then this film is for you. Honestly, Troll 2 is better - at least I laughed at the sex scene with popcorn. <br /> <br /> I cannot justify a longer review of this picture, because I have already spent almost an hour trying to find one joke,
