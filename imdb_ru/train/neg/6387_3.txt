When I first took this film, I was intrigued by the main idea and wanted to see what would happen. I am a fan of animation, and I like it when it is successfully combined with live frames. However, the animation in this film was about everything that I liked. Although I must say that the performances of the actors were excellent. The visual look — including the animation — gave the play a surprisingly unnerving look. However, this quality of awkwardness was lost among the bloated images, both visual and in scenarios, with which you practically blows to the head. Most annoyed by this relative lack of plot importance. It seemed that the plot was in a shoe with irregular intervals, which gave the effect of stuttering, which strongly interfered with the flow of the figure. The voiceover from Felisberto - especially the one at the end - was very much like a desperate attempt to fill the gaping holes in the plot, which were ignored in favor of side problems, such as the whole ant (and even this is not correctly addressed). I am afraid that all the material was at best a “sensible first attempt” by a teenager who spent too much time reading D.H. Lawrence Not what you expect from experienced directors in general.
