For loyal Duran Duran fans who want to watch a good music video, skip this. The producers decided to show creativity and make this video of the 80s something like science fiction with the evil villain Barbarella, from whom the group got its name. <br /> <br /> What is failing this idea is that right in the middle of some of the great 80s Duran Duran songs, confusing and annoying scenes take place, featuring a fictional antagonist trying to stop a band at one of their concerts. Not only good music is interrupted many times, but we also have to suffer because of the cheap side story that the evil Dr. Mario leads. It is almost too much to endure. 2/10
