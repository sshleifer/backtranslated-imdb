The cauldron is a cauldron, if I have ever seen it. The supposed thriller, borrowed from Time to Kill, Silence of the Lambs, even flipped Into the Heat of the Night with a small reverse killing, cast as Strangers on a Train, fails terribly where all of the above has largely been achieved. Namely, in the delivery of thrills. The plot seems compressed from a larger book, which makes plot development obvious and unattractive, while the direction has no pace and excitement. To curb any praise, a big turn had to be made along the way, and here it also clearly fails. Connery is clearly slowing down in old age, barely caring about his attempt to focus in the US, and, moreover, seems too old to be the husband of Hope Lange and the father of these damn his children. He even has a father-in-law who seems younger than him. Laurence Fishburn barely gets a chance to take his role, and from the very beginning you do not understand whether he is a bad guy or a good guy. Someone once said that memories should not lie - they are embarrassed doing it here. The rest of the game is merely average in terms of reasonable composition in their signed stereotypical roles. The estimated climax also succeeded in rolling, leaving me firmly rooted in the back, and not as a goal, the leading edge of my place. Mediocre sloppy Hollywood filmmaking for sure.
