Before I comment on this film, which I just watched on YouTube, I must admit that the reason I checked it was to revise what I first saw in a television advertisement in 1980: the split of Barbara Bach . And since the film received a rating of R, I expected to see her naked. Alas, there is neither a cube nor for her, nor for another gorgeous actress: Stacy Nelkin, who was supposed to be a teenager, but in fact she was 20 years old when she did it. Seeing her in her bra and panties, and then wearing a dancer costume, was the same as Miss Bach. They give some scattered laughter from this movie. In fact, I don’t blame Ron Leibman for removing his name from the titles, because his role as a mean Litsman is rather embarrassing, although I liked the “seduction” scene he did with Miss Nelkin. This also happens to be the debut of Ralph Macchio, who is lonely among the losers sent to academic school. Others are a black child who really loves his stepmother, and Ms. Bach, an Arab who loves motor oil, and a politician’s son who loves his girlfriend Candy so much (Nelkina’s character), he risks slipping in the middle of the night and see her at the academy girls Among the support staff, Tom Poston plays a ferocious character named Sisson, which I found kind of funny. With the screenplay of Tom Patchett and Jay Tarces and director Robert Downey Sr. (whose son Robert Downey Jr. has a cameo role on the football scene) in fact, a rather harmless comedy, for which you should not be ashamed of Mad Magazine and its cover with the logo - Alfred E. Newman, even if once their name and character were taken from a photo. .ps Another “loser” was Harry Teinowitz, who was born in my hometown of Chicago, Illinois. He played Rodney Wevergaert. He also says one of my favorite lines: “I'm trying to come.”
