The most terrible retelling of an excellent series. He was not supposed to be called Battlestar Galactica, because he is the same. Too many changes just to have changes. You have characters that turned from male to female, from black to Asian to cylindrical, in order to "attract a female audience" when there were already strong female characters that could only be strengthened. Egyptian feelings are gone. Passed the search for land. The absence of cylinders to go to the terminator takes away from the film, especially when someone becomes a fembot. Of course, the original show had a lot of cheese, but he had a lot of fans. They tried to stick to it, but they didn’t give the fans anything to work with, and mostly spat in their faces, making it “their own story”. Changes are good when they do something better, and not just do them.
