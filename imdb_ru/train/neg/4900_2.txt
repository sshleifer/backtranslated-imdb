SEX WISH was really released (minus ten minutes more, hmm, "extreme" shots) here in the UK, in the early days of the video boom, and caused a violent storm in a tea cup when it allegedly inspired the murder of a copycat. Strangely enough, the newspapers brushed away this disturbing click under the carpet during a rapid jerk to get relatively harmless similar “Frozen Cry” and “Demon's Night”, and as a result the film was almost forgotten. I jumped at the opportunity to watch it on DVD-RW and spent most of the movie with my jaw on the floor. This is not so much politically incorrect, as completely insane, triple X takes Michael Wiener's DEATH OF DESIRE (did the name show the game, how inspirational was it?) With hard sex and some really nasty violence thrown into the already-boiling drink of the seventies. If you do not consider yourself squeamish, it may make you think again. By the time SEX WISH is over, you will want to clean your eyeballs with a disinfectant and take a hot shower to clean yourself. If any film really deserves the tag “this is just a film, only a film, only a film,” then this one. <br /> <br /> Highlights (or low moments) - a rapist using a vibrator on a victim while he is masturbating over her, sleeping the scene with Harry Rems's mustache, a helpless young dark-skinned couple who is forced to screw in front of him the killer of a sword cane they won an Oscar for their completely credible views if the Academy went insane) before the man was neutered because of his troubles and some kind of sharp slippery direction that threatens to lift the process over their apparent origin from the mill. Do not say that I did not warn you. If you thought the world was a more innocent place thirty years ago, SEX WISH proves that you are very, very wrong.
