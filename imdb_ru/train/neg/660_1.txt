Oh my god, I can't even describe how poor this film is. Do not get me wrong, I did not expect much from the very beginning. Let's face it, the click of the PG-13 slasher is predetermined by the fact that it misses ... umm ... chopping, so no one should be surprised at the lack of blood. But it was the level of incompetence and cliché shown in all other aspects of this film that really hit me. <br /> <br /> We have a main character who is so useless that you support a bad guy. And here is the queue for the books ... SHE NEVER CHANGES - therefore, violating the main rule of the main screen writing - character development. If you think that by the end of the film a poor little girl will turn around and finally kick her ass, think again. <br /> <br /> On top of that, we are being handed over, perhaps the least intriguing (and definitely least terrible) killer, to beautify the genre. I do not joke when I say that Dora the Explorer has more terrible villains than in this film. <br /> <br /> Finally, because all the potential for stress or reward is eliminated by an incompetent (and, obviously, thirteen) director, what can be left to fill in 2 hours of screen time? <br /> <br /> Cabinets, that's what. <br /> <br /> Many and many cabinets: large, small, mirror, Narn, so many damned cabinets that you do not want to dress for another year. In fact, this film was simply called “CLOSET”, and a big scary pile was depicted on the DVD body. On the back he could have a picture of a falling asleep audience and a quotation from Roger and Ebert - something like: “What the hell! We just spent time watching! ”
