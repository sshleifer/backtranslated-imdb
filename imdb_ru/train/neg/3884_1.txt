Many moons ago, when I was seven years old, I vaguely remember watching the trailer for this film. This gave me a naive feeling of curiosity, and I decided to ask my parents to take me with me to this film. Being equally wise adults, they said to me: “Absolutely not! It's a bunch of trash. ” Of course, I was very disappointed that it was not the first child in my block who would see the "Incredible Melting Man." <br /> <br /> Some time has passed - perhaps a couple of days. I forgot about the "Incredible melting man," and my disappointment disappeared. Twenty-five years passed until it became one of my thoughts. Looking through the channels through a digital cable, I discovered this long-lost relic of the film. My curiosity was excited, and I finally decided to take part in this fruit, forbidden by my parents. I had to listen to them. The Incredible Melting Man is probably the worst movie known to man. This makes films such as Def-Con 4, Metalstorm, and Freddie Got Fingered look like Oscar nominees. I feel offended by the fact that I spend almost two hours of my life on this nasty dirt. it's damp even in 1977. How someone convinced the film company to create this film outside of me. <br /> <br /> Don't repeat the same mistake as me. Listen to your parents if they have forbidden you to watch this movie. They were right.
