A series of painfully unfriendly parodies that seem to go on forever and all day. Not as terribly stunning as, say, “Freddy Got Fingered” or “Lost Reality,” but this is by no means an endorsement in ANY way, meaning or form. Features the worst rhymed clown ever. Any majority, if it is not offensive to anyone, but the most boorish or politically correct. He also has the worst parody song, EVER placed on tape, the worst personification of Arnold EVER (not only the worst, put on the film, literally the worst EVER). I have no idea why Karen Black, Michelle Clark Duncan or Slash will play a major role in this (the reasons why I watched it in the first place). The only thing that was a little amusing is Dickman. In conclusion, I would not recommend this film to ANYONE, but the people who set themselves the task of getting it in Bottom 250 on this site are pathetic. Do something remarkable with you life of people. Plus, if it's true, the Church of Scientology hates it, it cannot be ALL bad. <br /> <br /> My rating: D
