I saw an omen when I was 11 years old on TV. I liked the Trilogy. Therefore, when there was a chance to finally see him in the cinema, I did not miss it. I went to the cinema, knowing that what I was going to see was not a release for the cinema, but created for a television movie. However, being a fan, I could not resist. But this film Omen, which I saw during the midnight show, did not bring a chill, it caused laughter. A picky dialogue, such as "it is written that if a child cries during baptism, he rejects God there." What kind of nonsense. No decent set of pieces. Fei Grant, so good in V, wasted with this script from hell. No surprises and no fun. However, several times I laughed out loud at our failure. Really Pathetic. 1 out of 10
