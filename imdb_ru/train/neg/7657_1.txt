There should be a rule that clearly states that films like Resident Evil should be created in the spirit of the game, and not in the spirit of blowing up everything possible. RE was a horror game of survival, and damn effective, but Paul VS Anderson managed to make her look like any other video game movie. Alone in the Dark is essentially the same spirit as Resident Evil, so, of course, there is little hope that the director has enough brains to make a horror movie, not an action movie. Instead, Alone in the Dark simply proves that there is no longer any hope that video games will become movies. <br /> <br /> The plot, while clearly not important, is the biggest of many problems. with the film. The film begins with what can only be described as five minutes of scrolling text, which may or may not be important, because after a minute, viewers stop caring and just sit through the rest, hitting the object closest to them. In addition, there is something about a shelter, some artifacts, an ancient tribe, bureaucracy and some demons, and they are all so mixed up that viewers cannot understand what is happening. Characters come in and out of the plot, like candy, some of which have huge groundwork for meaningless deaths. In fact, I can understand that some of the demons were freed, and Edward Carnby (Slater) has some connection with them thanks to some operation performed by the children in his orphanage that failed him. He finds an artifact with the participation of demons and brings it to his former anthropologist girlfriend (Reid), who, of course, manages to immediately have sex without a good reason. Then, out of nowhere, all hell breaks down, and the couple eventually gets a military team led by some commander of the assholes (Dorff), who obviously has a mutual hatred for Carnby. <br /> <br /> This is all ridiculous, and the reason why I don’t really understand, not only because it’s complicated and mixed, but also leaves no room for anyone who really cares. Instead, I highly recommend that if you want to watch this movie, take a tennis ball or something to do when the plot manages to confuse you. <br /> <br /> The scenes in the movie with the plot are so awful, as it should at least raise it a bit, right? It is a pity that this film is similar to any other corrupt nonsense ever made, with quick enough blows to decapitate the hen house. Given that this is based on a horror game, rather than an action movie, this is especially annoying. <br /> <br /> The first scene with a man chasing Cranby out of a taxi is one of the worst I've ever seen. and the rest is also not so great. The demons look somewhat cool, although the fact that they turn into powder when they are killed removes this entire effect. Scenes in which many guns are involved that should be cool to watch include muzzle fire as the only source of light instead, and zooming and panning the camera is faster than at the head of the addict. This is all shit-causing seizures that keeps children in bed at night. <br /> <br /> Acting is what I like to call actors, forcing them to do nothing. Slater plays only an important role for the entire film, although he seems to have more talent than he allows. The same applies to Dorff, who gets an ungrateful role, despite the fact that he actually has some talent (something that happened to him a lot). Reed is pretty much exactly what she needs to be in terms of sex appeal, because whenever she tries to act, it is a disaster (like the scientist’s incredibly bad look that she had at the beginning). <br /> <br /> In general, this is a type of movie that worries me about future video games. If they continue to destroy the spirit like this, then it is only a matter of time when Samus Aran will kill the Middle East with the help of the AK-47, and Tommy Versetti fights with an alien squadron. However, unlike Resident Evil, this one doesn’t deserve a second chance, since I don’t think something could help me forget how terrible this film is. It is soft, uninteresting and uninteresting. This film is equivalent to diarrhea; it all comes together, nothing fits, and in the end, you're just glad that it's over. <br /> <br /> TOTAL: 4%
