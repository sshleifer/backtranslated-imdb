I will start by apologizing to filmmakers everywhere for using the terms filmmaker, film or film in connection with this, but crime and crime against humanity seem a bit harsh. <br /> Caption: pathetic. <br /> <br /> Director: pathetic. <br /> <br /> Acting: pitiful. <br /> <br /> Cinematography: too inept for words. <br /> <br /> Technical skills used to assemble this atrocity: NO, WHAT IS. <br /> <br /> This pile of waste is hardly a movie. Most family home movies are closer to making the difference than Revenge Quest. No, these are just 10 cars captured on video. <br /> <br /> We’ll skip the story in this review, because there are too many holes to close at the same time. Let's just say it stinks worse than the rest of this movie. To call actors one-dimensional means to give them credit. The fact that there is little is terrible from the very beginning and is aggravated by terrible video and editing. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this crime, although, besides the plot, there must be effects ... or, rather, an alarming lack of it. There are no spaces, flashes in the weapon, and some sound effects existed either as standard “weapon” sounds, or they were generated by the mouth (yes, you read that correctly). The filmmaker really had the audacity to write down the "hush" sound for the elevator doors; I think he felt it makes them sound more futuristic. This should be installed in 2031, after all. However, this does not explain the sounds he makes with his mouth for scenes with fisticuffs. <br /> <br /> If it wasn’t too bad, the sound quality is terrible (he just used the installed microphone on the camcorder, and it shows), the use of standard pistol sounds was almost worse than the absence of any sounds at all. The sound effects stand out from the rest of the soundtrack, like a drunk yak in a flock of sheep, and they are just as clumsy. Imagine: a bad guy enters an office building in search of his victim. The lady begins to run in fear. He raises his pistol (Uzi) and shakes it. We hear a sound that is clearly not an ultrasound. A woman runs away from the camera, and suddenly one back of blood (only 1) explodes on her back (it looks like she was hit by a paintball), and she falls on her face. <br /> <br /> Bear in Keep in mind that my description is too fair to the ineptitude of the actual sequence. <br /> <br /> In a different sequence, which almost - but not quite - makes the film fun enough to watch, happens in the stairwell, the bad guy chases a nice guy and a lady whom he protects down the stairs, shaking his plastic ultrasound You may want to crouch; poorly planned sound effects fly everywhere. <br /> <br /> I assumed that Alan De Herrera could not be locked in to the design of this train wreck, but he had gone all the way to editing and releasing it. If there is any justice, there will definitely be some karma with his name on it. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch this piece of industrial waste - and I strongly recommend against it - be sure to look for the whole scene shot almost literally from Bladerunner, as well as the AM radio, which becomes a walkie-talkie. Try not to focus too much on the plot; it only hurts you if you do this. <br /> <br /> 0 stars out of 10. And this is generous.
