After the working day, I sat down to relax and turned on the movie channels. The film appeared in the guidebook and sounded interesting, so I set up just before it began. The first 30 minutes were enough to interest me, but the lack of acting skills in Jamie Foxx and the slow movement of the plot made me want to get up and find food during the film. If there is any merit in playing in this film, he should turn to David Morse, who at least tries to make the film interesting. In general, do not plan to impress your friends by choosing this as a tenant for a movie night.
