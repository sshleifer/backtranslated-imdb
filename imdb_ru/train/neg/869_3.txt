Where to start ... If this film were a dark comedy, I would say it was FANNN-TASTIC! Unfortunately, for me and anyone else who has free time and an extra dollar (note that it was the price I paid, got it from Wal-Mart), this film was supposed to be a thriller. The only GET I received was watching Kirkland's Ann Wilks from Misery without the snowy wooded area. If you want to have a good laugh on a rainy Friday night with friends, I highly recommend this movie. But if you want to see something, at least half decent, then do not even worry. <br /> <br /> I, for one, like shitty movies, the worse, the better in most cases. But wow ... I meant WOW !! The only person in the whole film who did not stink was the little boy Vincent Berry played. The only reason why I even give him 3 stars is that it gave me something to do.
