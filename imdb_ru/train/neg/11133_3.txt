Except for the acting skills of the two presenters, this film is really very bad. The cost of cheap production does not help. Of course, you would not have noticed that production values ​​are cheap if they did not try to convince you that they had production values ​​from the very beginning. Even for a fan of the B-film genre like me, this film really sucks.
