I have never heard of this film until it was played in retrospective by Robert Mitchum at the National Cinema in London. Almost 60 years on the list of actors looked delicious, to say the least, with seven names - in addition to Mitchum with a top score - in the public domain; Charles McGraw, shortly from The Killers, Barbara Bel Geddes, long before Dallas, and perhaps even better known as the daughter of Norman Walter Brennan, a theater set designer who didn’t need an acquaintance, Frank Filein, a sadistic nurse in Lost Weekend and Robert Preston, a much more pleasant little town in the movie “It's a Beautiful Life” is still ten years away from Harold Hill in The Music Man, in which Tom Tully and Phyllis Thaxter make up the numbers. Alas, most of them were wasting their time. I searched in vain for any "subscription" scenes, given that it was Robert Wise on the megaphone. By this time he had shot half a dozen films, and he had yet to find a style. This story is our old friend, shooting at targets, and Mitchum must have thought it was just a cut over Hopalong Cassidy’s coughs, on which he cut his teeth. There are no new turns - except for an incredible scene when Mitchum accuses Preston of sleeping with Thister to get information about his father’s plans to move his cattle. This is quite true, but how did Mitchum know? We did not see or hear anything that would indicate how he found it. As a result, not much to say about it.
