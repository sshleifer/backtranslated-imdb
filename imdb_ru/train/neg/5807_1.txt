Do not even worry about this film, this is bad, judging by its own merits, but compared to the original in 1972 (which is a classic) it is terribly bad. And by the way, someone noticed that the 1972 film is bad compared to a book. This is silly, films should never be judged by the books from which they are taken. These are two completely different forms of art (as if this had to be pointed out, but, obviously, it is). If you used this criterion for all films, then “2001” sucks, as well as “Forest Gump” and “Silence of the Lambs”.
