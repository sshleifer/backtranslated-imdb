It hurts me to write such a terrible review, but without doing this, I just encourage these people. Firstly, the fact that the film is shot with a small budget does not make it good or attractive. In fact, in this case, a small budget is probably the only achievement of the film, since it prevents the waste of large sums of money on a one-legged racehorse with shit. Have you ever seen a comedy in a theater? Have you ever heard people laugh and think, “What the hell are you?” Well, even these cunt were not laughing. By the middle of the road, everything became so bad that my cat took a bath for the first time. This is not a film, these are children ... no monkeys creating images that make you want to move to France. I have to go, my clown is at my door .............
