I don’t like this film, but I also didn’t really think about the book, which, although many people evaluate as a “masterpiece”, I found that it lacks character development, it is incoherent and illogical in the plot, although it was much more readable than the terrible first attempt by Fante “The Road to Los Angeles”, which was not published until Fante came into vogue in the mid-80s. <br /> <br /> I was intrigued to see which town soup was made from such scanty ingredients. He worked a lot on the script to correct many of the shortcomings of the book, but for my money it did not save. In Ask for the Dust there was never a movie, although he tried to remain faithful to the book. I think this movie is Madness Town. <br /> <br /> In one word: forgettable.
