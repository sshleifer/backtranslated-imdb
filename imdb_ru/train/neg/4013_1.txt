After watching some of the great things about HBO - Band of Brothers, Rome, etc. - I have to say that I expected quite high expectations before watching the first episode of "True Blood". Jeez. Often the script seemed to be written by an 8-year-old, some parts were simply horribly shot, (the scene in which she “saves” Bill, I mean, come on. She throws the chain at the guy and oh! Around his neck, and this is magical strangling him! It was rather embarrassing if you wanted my opinion. Or a few moments before the scene when she finds out that the couple left with Bill, it's funny. She hears how they plan their things and how 5 seconds, magic! All three have disappeared, and without any struggle, noise or anything else! <br /> <br /> I mean, the idea of ​​the show seemed to be inter sleepy, mysterious, intriguing, the vampires coexisted with a man in our modern society ... but honestly, I don’t think they really wanted to do more than a petty soap show that an ordinary teenage girl watches all the time, but about which nobody cares anymore ... Unfortunately, the script is poorly written, mediocre at best. It’s small and extremely predictable. Often I thought it was some kind of joke or something. <br /> <br /> Actors give really unconvincing performances, if you want my opinion. They seem to take the show very easily, as if it were some ordinary family TV show with a low budget (well, maybe that’s what it is if you take a part of the family). The only actor who seemed kindly to me was Stephen Moyer as Bill, given the poorly written, very short answers that he had to say: “What are you ...” “May I call you sometime ...” I I think he succeeded in revealing a somewhat mysteriously frightening part of a vampire, which, in fact, everyone should have a vampire role. Anna Paquin was all right too, but no more. But the guy who plays her brother, damn it, he's terrible. The scene in which he is arrested is just a shame for modern television. The acting is bad, the construction looks fake to the bone, and the other two guys are "Why are they arresting? Um ... I don't know ..." It was rather embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I think was completely missed is how they presented Suke’s psychic powers. They make us hear what people think And speak at the same time, and that’s just wrong. Often it just seems unnecessarily chaotic, as if people think that this is some kind of annoying radio channel, and that when it approaches them, it reaches the desired level of frequency and must hear everything they think. <br /> <br /> And finally, the sex scenes are just not needed, and this sex record with vampires was just disgusting. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong - I wrote all these comments not because I thought the show was bad, but because I was very disappointed. I expected quality things. I did not think so. Although it is definitely not a GOOD show. Mediocre at best.
