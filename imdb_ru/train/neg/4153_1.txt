I really have no idea how to comment on this film. The special effects were dim, the acting was terrible, and if there was a plot in all of this, then it was on the back of the box. I don't think I can remember a movie that has been THIS bad for a long time, and I'm a big fan of lesbian sex and boobies !! ;) Even this could not save this film from just a terrible excuse to pay someone for standing (or lying in this case) in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> I was pretty much summed up by the overall zombie effect. Since in this film, apparently, zombies are so commonplace that they run across the pair in some places, and casually talk about it at the gas station (one with the windshield repair in the house, but without an internal bathroom), the genre of the film about zombies not even a factor to the end. Even then, a cameo with a dozen zombies ripping off girl clothes is not really a zombie movie. <br /> <br /> Concerning vampires: obviously, all zombies are men, and all vampires are women, this is normal for me. I'm not sure how vampires come out in daylight, or why / how a soldier vampire ended up in the middle of the road, still holding his pistol with a stake in his heart, just waiting for the queen vampires to scroll through it all. The last segment in the old convent did not make sense, and when one hot lesbian vampire asked another hot lesbian vampire: “What do you think we did right?” Killing two obvious heroes in the film, he turned it over. <br /> <br /> Actor and special effects were also at a record low. You could almost see the hoses from which they were pumping out fake blood during a close-up of the zombies that the general shot down. Speaking of a general, where did they find IT Kenny Rogers anyway? I have no idea who he was a general, except that he is usually confusing and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> In general, watch a movie if you have nothing to do or you have a strong desire to spend $ 3. Just my 0.02 dollar.
