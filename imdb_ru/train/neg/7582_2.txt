High heels are tricky things. They can elevate women (or change into men) to new heights, push a sharp statement of style and bring a touch of fragile elegance. Alternatively, they can be dangerous pain in the legs, which will inevitably lead to trips, falls and tragedies. Tacones lejanos is more a journey of disappointment than a stylish high elevator. <br /> <br /> Drama of the mother-daughter of Almodovar is certainly stylish, but from the point of view of the plot this is a tongue-tied and tedious business, full of confusing, complex characters who never fully participate or have no meaning. A few moments of comedy aside, Tacones lejanos is simply not interesting. The best comes first in the surprisingly dark case of manslaughter organized by a child. From this brilliant black comedy story, the situation is better, but then the film comes on the heels. <br /> <br /> There is quite a solid acting, and there is some stylish, artistic direction that you can expect from Almodovar, but otherwise Tacones lejanos is not an impressive example of Spanish cinema. With a story of murder, show business, femininity, fragmented mother-daughter relationship and a character who is alternately a judge, a transvestite and a police informant, this could be melodramatic power. Instead, he is poor. High heels stumble for sure.
