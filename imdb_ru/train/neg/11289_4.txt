Elizabeth Ward Grasen, who is likely to be remembered only as one of Bill Clinton's “eruptions” (they have tablets for this now!), Is probably the weakest element of this show. It really continues the weary formula of the Highlander series. The immortal hero meets another immortal with memories of the last meeting, but there is some conflict, and at the end there is a battle with swords, where you have a cheap sequence of special effects. <br /> <br /> Then you have the character of Nick Wolf. Basically, your typical unshaven hero of the 90s with a typical storyline "Sexual tension". (Seriously, why do you, Hollywood heroes, think that sexual tension is more interesting than sex.) It was a joint Canadian-French production, so half of the series takes place in Vancouver, imitating New York, and the other half - in Paris ... as the Highlander did.
