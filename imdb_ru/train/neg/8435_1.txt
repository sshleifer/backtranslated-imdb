Very disappointing movie. By the end, I no longer cared about any characters. I really liked seeing Vin Rames in a very small part, and William Macy was good, as always, still not worth watching. It starts strong and becomes weaker and weaker. Insomnia will love it, because I'm sure it will lull them to sleep.
