This rather formal film about swords and flying fists is a worthy show of John Woo's talents. The cinematography is excellent, and some of the works with the sword are really wonderful. Unfortunately, the film works under the weight of a boring story and a clearly low budget (see some battle scenes if you doubt me). However, it is worth a look, especially if you can catch it in your inbox.
