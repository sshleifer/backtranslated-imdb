I have never commented on IMDb before, but I feel that I have to do it after watching The Batman animation. This is absolute rubbish! Warner Brothers had a great animated series in Batman in the early 90s, so what the hell are they doing trying to spoil the winning formula? I want to write a letter of complaint in the WB. The original animation was dark and thoughtful, just as Batman had intended. WB had to spoil it with some battered Batman of the Future. Now they produce this nonsense. Joker is not remotely similar to DC Comics Joker. DK must sue. I urge everyone who agrees with me to write an e-mail or write to the WB and use the power of people to return the original formula
