Have you ever seen a movie made up entirely of long wide shots? Not? Me neither. Well, I finally saw one in “Spring in my hometown,” and I must admit, now I KNOW why people do not do this. The technique is “artful,” of course, but it is definitely NOT mature for public consumption. The technique is badly damaged simply because the viewer does not have an emotional attachment to the characters, and perhaps this may be the goals of the entire director. I don't know, I can't read minds, and I certainly don’t know enough about the director to judge. <br /> <br /> But one thing in this film that is painfully obvious is its absurdity, anti-American sentiment. As an American, I know well about my country's participation in the Korean War, and I know very well that we were not always angels, but I will be bloody if I take this guy's version of how things have turned out. According to this blind fool, the Americans were not only at the root of the war, we were the CAUSE of the war, and we almost single-handedly destroyed the country. Anything, Mr. Director. And I believe that you would still shoot this film in “Communist Korea”, if we had not intervened, right? Talk about forgetting your story. This is almost akin to turning the Nazis into "good guys" and transforming the forces of the allies into "bad guys." This film is so historically naive and so inaccurate that it is almost embarrassing to watch it. For a man who has come from a country that owes its existence to American intervention, he is sure that he is so tall, mighty and condemning.
