The first was the best. The second sucks because the dialogue was terrible. Although the storyline was not so bad (in fact, all the storylines are good and bad). Throughout the film, I dosed several times. I know that Jackie Chan is a great martial artist, but not a very good actor at rush hour. Chris Tucker was not good either. And Zhang Ziyi, what I can say is a few lines, a terrible game (but this is based on her script). All the characters there were not so good. But some things that I like during rush hour 2 are always action and less sex scenes. I know that Jackie Chan is not doing what is good for him.
