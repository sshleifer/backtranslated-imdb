!!!! POSSIBLE YOUNG SPOILER !!!!! <br /> <br /> While I watched the first half of the film “GUILTY AS SIN,” I could not believe that it was made in 1993 because it played like a clone of JAGGED EDGE / Joe Estershas from the mid 80s It starts with a murder, and the audience can only think: “Is he guilty or innocent, and will he go to sleep with his lawyer?” "a movie of a type that ends in a ridiculous way, and WINE AS SIN is even more ridiculous ie the end in this respect. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad thriller, but the most unforgivable thing about it is that it was Sidney Lumet directed by the same man who brought us the all-time classic courtroom drama 12 EVIL MEN
