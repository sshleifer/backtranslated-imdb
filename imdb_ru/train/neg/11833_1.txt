So don't even think about renting it in stores, because it's a damn bad movie. You would think that JJ Abrahams wrote this film. In fact, the rat is flushed down the toilet and somehow has to return. Fans of the absolutely terrible "Shrek" may like it, but the fans of "Wallace and Gromit" will probably turn away with disgust. Also, why didn't they do it in plasticine or clay? I mean, CGI animation ?? For the film AARDMAN ?? !! Obviously, Aardman was idle while Dreamworks was doing all this. Wrong, wrong, wrong !!! Almost every character is terrible, except for that strange frog guy who is just right for the villain from the movie. But everything else in the film is boring, boring, boring !!! I almost fell asleep from boredom while watching this movie. No, wait, actually, I fell asleep from boredom while watching this movie. That's just terrible. But, fortunately, it is not as bad as Shrek.
