I love Colombo and have seen almost all the episodes, but this one is undoubtedly considered the worst of all. An overwhelmingly tedious, senseless, tangled pile of invisible rubbish that wastes the audience time and acting talents of extremely bored Peter Falk. “The plot”, whatever it may be, seems to have just been invented, since the film is not accompanied by the slightest hint of the ingredients in the formula that made the show such a brilliant success to begin with. One part of the process, which I find extremely mysterious (or perhaps annoying), was that the character of Peter Falk was introduced to guests at the wedding under the name “Lt” Colombo. If the producers insist on keeping Colombo's name a secret, why couldn't they skip this line altogether because it sounds funny? As I said, these are pits, and all true Colombo fans would do well to avoid it, like the plague.
