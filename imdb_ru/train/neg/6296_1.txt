This film looked interesting; I read a book a few years ago, and she informed me that this feature quite closely follows the outline of the plot. <br /> <br /> I started looking at it, and almost from the very beginning it did not meet expectations. Actually, I didn't bother to watch it all ... complete nonsense - bad performances, bad play of actors and instantly hostile characters - that was the meaning of the film, I think. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie left a bad taste in my mouth and put me on depression until the end of my weekend. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about this feature.
