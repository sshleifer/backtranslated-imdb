I was looking forward to the opportunity to watch this film and see the performance of these great actors. However, I was sadly disappointed in the script and in the whole plot of the story. David Duchovny, (Dr. Eugene Sands), "Connie and Carla," 04, was a doctor in this story who uses drugs and loses his license to practice medicine. Dr. Sands attended a nightclub and could use his medical experience to help a wounded client, and was assisted by Angelina Jolie (Claire), “Take Life”, 04, which immediately attracts Dr. David Sands. Timothy Hutton, (Raymond Blossom), Kinsey, '04, plays the Big Shot Gangster and a man with all kinds of money and connections. Timothy Hutton seems to be replaying in most scenes and completely losing consciousness, trying to keep his gang members from dying. Gary Durdan, (Yeats), The CSI-Vegas Series, plays a huge supporting role and portrays the real COLD DUDE, which is Raymond's so-called bodyguard Blossom. Angelina Jolie looks beautiful and sexy with her ruby-red lips that attract much attention from all men. This film is not the best, but it is entertaining.
