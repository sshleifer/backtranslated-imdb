By the time this film was released, I had already seen “Chorus Line” four times on stage and looked forward to the long-awaited production of the film of this story. My wife and I were in line for an hour before the opening of the box office on the day of the film. It was not just a disappointment, it was a punch in the stomach. <br /> <br /> First, the story was, so to speak, “moved outside,” including scenes that were not part of the theater. These restrictions are a big part of the meaning and impact of history. <br /> <br /> Second and third together (assign your own order): one of the original songs with a very dynamic dance number has been deleted; A song that was NOT in production was added. What ?? I do not quite understand! <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1 is my admiration for the talent and hard work of the performers. Now I saw Chorus Line on the stage 6 times, and would not mind seeing another 6 times before I die. It is beautifully written, with beautiful music and heartbreaking true stories. If you want to watch a musical that includes a great beastly audition, I recommend All That Jazz. If you want to see the story of A Chorus Line, watch it on stage.
