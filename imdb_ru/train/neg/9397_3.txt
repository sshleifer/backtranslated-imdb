I saw most of the episodes of RMFTM in adolescence at the Cliffhanger Theater, which ran at a local station after midnight several years ago, and then again, when it was endowed with Mystery Science Theater in the early 90s. Time was not kind to him. <br /> <br /> Of course, I can take into account the special effects that were quite impressive for the low-budget series of the 50s (the IMO Commando Cody flying scenes were better than those of George Reeves / Superman in his TV show). And I can also make a discount on um, "acting," and martial choreography -. except the guy who plays the ruler of the Lunar People. He was incredibly wrong. He looks and behaves like a guy who comes to fix your bathroom fixtures, not the tyrannical ruler of an alien race. Even a banal dialogue works well - each rumbles its own strings, like strings of fireworks, without loss of time and pauses for such things as “thought” or “introspection”. Since everyone does this, the viewer after a while finds it by immersion in himself, and even, as far as I understand, it doesn’t bother him much. <br /> <br /> What really annoys me is the writing and the plot. I'm not talking about sunny weather on the Moon, or about rocket ships with baking soda, or about a flying suit with controls labeled “up / down” and “fast / slow”. I do not even care about the frivolity of resolutions that end each chapter. I am talking about the fact that our alleged heroes are dumber than fence pillars and do not have a cumulative memory. And due to the fact that, despite the fact that the dialogue moves like a high-speed train, the plot repeats the same movements over and over again. <br /> <br /> Dig it in: commando Cody and his buddy are the head of a top-secret high-tech science lab charged with protecting the Earth (or at least the US) from the cunning invasion of aliens. But in his office there are no guards or checkpoints. They don't even have locks on the front doors. So the bad guys go DIRECTLY and beat the crap out of Cody and his co-workers ... more than once (perhaps understandably), but SEVERAL times. They even kidnap his assistant at the second attempt. And they never get smarter. To prove my point once more, let me point out how Cody jumps in his flying suit and flies, getting in trouble, and it never seems to be able to catch anyone. He does it over and over and over. Cody also takes her ship to the moon (a female helper comes along to prepare), stays about 30 seconds and immediately turns and returns. Cody grabs one of the Atomic Ray pistols ... and immediately loses him to the bad guys again, because he can't be bothered to lock him. And so on. <br /> <br /> And you might think that if Cody’s efforts were so important for saving the US from the Moon People that he could ask for several soldiers with carbines, several helicopters and a tank or two to support him, instead of constantly working with the local police. It was supposed to be a military operation, but they behave as if this is another episode of "Gangbusters". <br /> <br /> This is all quite difficult for the stomach. I appreciate the fact that the creators were severely limited in their history by budget and time constraints ... and I appreciate that Cody is actually quite a strong homeowner (although he loses half of his fisticuffs). But I just can not shout "DOOR! CLOSE DOOR !!" when gangsters just enter his laboratory or try to blow up a ship, and there are NO security measures at the landing site ... even a fence (!). <br /> <br /> However, everything is in order. Of the three Republican TV shows I watched, “Ghost Creeps” had a better plot, and “Underwater Kingdom” had more atmosphere (ha!) And a better hero than “Radar People”, but this is a normal waste of time. <br /> <br /> By the way ... why are the "Radar" men? They did not use radar, they used atomic beam guns. Shouldn't there have been a headline "Atomic Archers from the Moon?"
