It's a kind of weird movie, considering that Santa Claus lives on a cloud in outer space and fights with Satan and his minions ... but he is still quite funny. <br /> <br /> He laughs a little sincerely ... .whether they were all deliberate, of course, debatable though. This film is not very good, but I can say that I really enjoyed watching it. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film on top of “Santa Claus Conquers the Martians”, “Santa Claus” with Dudley Moore and John Lithgow or “Santa Claus” with Tim Allen.
