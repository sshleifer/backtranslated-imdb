As some other reviewers mentioned earlier, I would like to know what kind of moron actually read the script and said, “Yes! Here it is. This is the next film we are going to give the green light !! ”And whoever this man is, his head should be checked for brain activity. Because no matter who is responsible for actually allocating money in order for it to work after reading the script, I would like to give you my email address, and maybe you just want to give some more money. This film is terrible in all respects. <br /> <br /> The Wayans are fun, at least they can. They made some good films and played incredibly funny performances. But here not only the premise defies all logic, not only badly behaves, not only the whole film is offensive from beginning to end, not only the direction as amateur as you can find, but they really want you to pay to see This movie. Perhaps, if it was free ... naaa, it would still be a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Usually I would be inclined to write some long detailed review about why this film is so bad, but suffice it to say that let my brevity speak for itself. This is a film with the lowest common denominator, and it's about as funny as a heart attack. <br /> <br /> 0/10 ... hit the top ten of my worst films of all time!
