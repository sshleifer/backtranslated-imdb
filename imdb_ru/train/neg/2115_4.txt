Only glandular secretions — and, please, do not ask for more details — young quickly can be saved quickly and young by the rapidly deteriorating body and mind of the wife of a crazy old amateur gardener. Since, like most people, with the exception of those who take part in medical trials, virgins rarely voluntarily give up their secrets, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi) organizes their abduction and preservation. He will make the booty himself. <br /> <br /> What a great low-budget horror movie for a horror movie. If the Corpse Disappears, it turns out, not the horror of Havarti, as a simple limburger, this leaves an interesting aftertaste. <br /> <br /> Of course, the acting is almost terrible, except for the actors who were lucky enough to play a crazy dwarf (Angelo Rossitto, who later played "Masters in Mad Max Outside of Thunder"); his mad brute of a brother, Angel (Frank Moran), who grunts a lot and has a fetish for virgin hair; crazy mother of two (Minerva Urekal); crazy wife (Elizabeth Russell), who sleeps in a posh coffin and, of course, a crazy doctor (Lugosi). <br /> <br /> The enterprising young journalist Patricia Hunter (Luana Walters) is tracking down a doctor because of a strange orchid with an extraordinarily sweet smell that the victims carried. When the doctor and his wife invite Pat to stay overnight, a raging storm will erupt immediately. This tip tells us that frantic violence will soon break out within us. Since it is well known that all the unmarried young women were virgins at the time in Hollywood, Pat may face some unpleasant surprises. They include dark passages, a dirty lab where the dead virgin is kept, a mausoleum in the basement and, later, a direct threat to Patricia’s own glandular secretions. If she survives, what story will she have to tell her editor. <br /> <br /> If you try this wet piece of moldy velveteen (and why not? Do not be better), do not judge Bela Lugosi by the company he holds here. He had a great influence on Dracula (1931), but my favorite film is “The Black Cat” (1934). Like Dr. Vitas Verdegast, he is a sad, ironic man who protects his two young friends. When he finally delivers the scalpel to Hjalmar Pelzig (Boris Karloff) and begins to tear him alive, well, well, this is a great scene.
