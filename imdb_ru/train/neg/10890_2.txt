I thought this movie was pretty lame. If you're looking for cheese, you might like this. I myself do not mind a lot of cheese, but it was funny. I was fed up with the film progress, and the storyline was very weak. <br /> <br /> The only thing that took place in this film was the daytime zombie, but even that is not enough to see this movie.
