My children had to watch it at least 10 times during each of the last two Christmas, I feel competent enough to pass judgment on this version of Dr. Suzeâ€™s classic tale, and, well ... this is not very good. First, after the classic act, such as the animated series Chuck Jones, it will be difficult for everyone, but this interpretation is so hard and soft that it can be simply stunning. I admit that there are some inspired jokes, but in general the film looks like a calculated grab of money, at the same time that it allegedly condemns the commercialization of Christmas. Jim Carrey, as a rule, is above all praise, but it does not correspond to the nature of Grinch. As Boris Karloff described, he was a slow burn; methodically and cunningly. There is no method for Kerry madness, and this is only the most obvious mistake. Talented actors like Jeffrey Tambor and Kristina Baranski are completely wasted. Why, wagon, why? I mean, I understand that Tony Hopkins will take on almost any proposed role (just like his compatriot Michael Kane), but this one must be registered in the section "Movies that should never have been made." This does not bode well for Cat in the Hat, the even thinner volume that Universal is preparing for this Christmas. I have a feeling that I will give the same recommendation as I do with this one: skip it, either read the book or watch a special TV. These are 2 hours which you can never return.
