I watched this movie last night and was a little disappointed. Many "time facts" have been disabled. At the beginning of the film, grandfather made a comment to this grandson and his friends about how they felt when 9-11 came. This film was to be held in 1994. In addition, one of the grandchildrenâ€™s friends was wearing an Eagles jersey Donovan McNabb. He was not even called up to this day. The storyline was good, but the facts and the relevance of the timing were so far from the base that the film seemed crappy. My boyfriend is an avid reader of books and memorabilia of the Second World War. I made this film in the hope that it will be good. The game was so so. The dog was cute. But the way this film was made pleased me that I paid only $ 4 to rent it, not the $ 50 I would need to watch it in the theater. I hope that those who ever read this will understand that I do not mean any dissatisfaction with those who waged the war, but the facts and deadlines should be monitored a little more carefully.
