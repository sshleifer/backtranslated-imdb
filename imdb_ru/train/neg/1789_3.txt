Although I enjoyed Bing Crosby in other films, I find this film especially enjoyable. Perhaps because I am from another epoch and another country, but I find that Crosby's constant references to “Good old USA” are pleasant at first, trite after a while, and then finally annoying. Don't get me wrong - I'm not anti-American at all - but it seemed that the British could not do the right thing and / or needed this bold, oh, such a clever American guest to show them the way. This is a story about “fish out of water”, but unlike most similar films, this time “fish” has an advantage. To be fair both to myself and to the film, I watched it several times over several years and each time I got the same impression. <br /> <br /> (I watched another Crosby film last night - The Emperor's Waltz - and this also caused the same reaction in me. And, to my surprise, even my wife, who, anyway, is an American , considered that the attitude of American Crosby "in your face" is annoying. There are too many references to Teddy Roosevelt, as she put it. <br /> <br /> As for the premise of the film, it is quite unique for its time, and the auxiliary composition, Of course, very good. Landscape and music are as good as great costumes - although I agree with the previous rec nzent that the wig on William Bendix looks awful (Moe's picture of three puppets). <br /> <br /> In general, for me it would be a much more pleasant picture without Bing Crosby's attitude, but since it is in almost every frame, quite hard to watch this movie.
