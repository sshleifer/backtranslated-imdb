The budget, the worthy actors ... who knew that these things are important. Do not waste your time on this piece of garbage. Effects of shit. Acting is shit. The only thing that could make it even bearable was a small, cheap T & A that was wasted during the first 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> The only even remotely redeeming quality in this film is a very awkward profanity. As if they found the only 7 people on the planet who have never cursed before. Take off your hat! <br /> <br /> If you want to see some dude in a bad suit, just go back and look at old prom photos. The only way to make the film “Bigfoot” is good if it has a big budget and some actors who have not come from the Frogballs Community Theater.
