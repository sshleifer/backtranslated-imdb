as an actor, I really like independent films, but this one is, at best, amateur. <br /> <br /> The boys go to government service in Vermont, but when the plane lands, it flies over a palm tree - did the director know that palm trees are not in Vermont? Pines yes - no palm. And the same for the wedding service - again, a good grove of palm trees. <br /> <br /> When the boys leave VT, they obviously could not get a ticket in any major airline, since the plane being filmed is Federal Express. They sent themselves at night in a box? Come on guys, such small details as this separate indie film from a completely amateur one. <br /> <br /> The Christian Brother is much more fun than Arthur with his bleached hair and tattoo from a tribal group. These two had to swap roles. <br /> <br /> Minor characters are ridiculous and replay something awful. <br /> <br /> Applause to directors for making a funny movie, but pay attention to your location and the next time casting
