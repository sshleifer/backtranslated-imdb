Doesn't someone else get tired of that old cliché, where an almost dead person appears in a horror film, gives us some information, and then shoots his head off for no apparent reason? I know that it is. <br /> <br /> Sadly, its use in this film is useless. If you saw the first film (the first remake that I have to say), then the above information is completely useless, because you would already know it. I think you can, that it is not useless for the main characters .. but then why does the idiot shoot himself in the head? Doesn't he want to live? Of course, he would have died anyway. <br /> <br /> This is the second film entitled “The Hills Have Eyes II”. The first is the sequel to the original 70s film. That's where it gets a little harder for someone like me. You see, I am probably part of a minority of people of my age who even knew that there is HHE2, and even more so the original HHE1. And now, when we have a continuation of the remake and the fact that this continuation is named exactly like the continuation of the original HHE1 ... it only worsens the situation! But in any case .. <br /> <br /> The original Wes Craven "The hills have eyes" were decent. After all, the idea was better than the presentation, but it most likely had a low budget. Frankly, Wes Craven is not as good as a horror director. He made only a few good horror films (“A Nightmare on Elm Street”, “A New Nightmare”), a few good ones (“Scream”) and a few terrible (“Damned, Shocker”, “Vampire in Brooklyn”). Oh yes, and he also did Swamp Thing ... but the original HHE2 falls into the latter category. I saw only a few minutes, but it was terrible. <br /> <br /> Now he has written the co-author of the new HHE2 ... and this is such a disappointment! Last year’s remake of HHE was even better than the original film. It was tense. I guess this was due to the fact that the main characters were a family, not a bunch of beer, a pot, and crazy teenagers. It made us feel dirty. During the first hour we were in hell, and finally, in the last few minutes, the good guys took revenge on the bad guys, and it was good .. <br /> <br /> There is no tension in this new film. No expectations. Just brutal things that happen mostly to stupid people. There is hardly anything threatening here. Just ugly strollers, hiding under the stones. <br /> <br /> I'm tired of horror movies, where people die because of the stupid mistakes that they continue to make. The other day I was watching the “Deep Blue Sea”, where Samuel L. Jackson continued to walk on the water, giving a speech, and then a shark ate it, just because the idiot stayed near the water .. something that nobody would have done this situation! Here is exactly the same. People leave themselves to escape, even if they know that people are dying ... seriously, couldn’t one wait a short break? And then when you think that people would find out, someone else is walking by itself! Seriously, not worse when the characters bring their A-game and still lose? I would think so ... <br /> <br /> This is even under the supplies. This was supposed to make the first remake look like a remake of The Fog (which was less threatening than the Becker episode). More bad guys. More time in the caves. More tension. Most. <br /> <br /> But in fact it lowers the rating. Less bad guys. No voltage. Of course, we have more time in the caves, but there is little that happens. In the end, it seems that there are two or three bad guys. The last film made him look like a whole tribe of people. Where is this tribe? Who continues to watch them with binoculars? Seriously, this is what this film was supposed to bring to us, but it ends with the same promise that the last film gave us, with the same scene that is “watched”. Come on! I will tell the devil that this is due. The appearance of the film is good ... but it is. <br /> <br /> I don’t even think it will please Gore fans ... although I’m probably mistaken! There is blood (although most of it accelerates in the dark), but without tension and characters that you don’t even care about ... blood does nothing in my book! In the end, you are not afraid. You are not shocked (unless you are 8 years old). You do not even feel that you have seen something new.
