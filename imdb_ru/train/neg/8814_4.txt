This film is not so interesting, except for the first ten minutes. Pace and editing is a great introduction to the ensemble, even better than, say, Gosford Park. Then, for inexplicable reasons, he slows down, loses focus and begins to resemble a traditional French film, in order to regain a focus with the love relationship between Antoine (Depardier) and Cecil (Deneuve). In the middle there are too many supporters and loose ends in the story; a few started threads don't end there. <br /> <br /> ******* SPOILERS AHEAD The main story is the relationship between Antoine and Cecil. He was faithful to her after his relationship with her many years ago, despite the fact that she married again and settled in Morocco. As a builder, he now restores his own life and restores it, taking the mask of marriage Cecil. By doing this, he is buried after a strange accident (literally) and becomes comatose. He wakes up only after she has burned their old picture, as a sign that they have reconciled with the past and can properly begin their life together. ******* THE END OF SPOILERS <br /> <br /> It remains unclear what vision of this director wants us to see us, because there are so many other stories: illegal immigrants want to enter Europe, radio broadcasts often appear about the overthrow of the former regime of Iraq. Child Cécile is bisexual and bitten by dogs (devotion) as soon as he meets his boyfriend, while the girl with whom he lives seems sick (because of this?). Her sister is traditionally Islamic and enters into a relationship with her husband Cecile. Morocco is depicted as unnecessary in the opposite direction, despite the fact that a strange colonial vision shines through the whole building, which almost glorifies the past. He portrays Islam backward and prone to extremism, which can sometimes be true, but certainly not as a whole. In the end, all this is best described as adding a certain language locale and “Art for the Soul”. <br /> <br /> Deneuve and Depardieu are great. They are so familiar with this material that they can twist something special in each scene: raise eyebrows, body language, radiate pride, and embarrassing behavior. The film itself is disappointing and only confirms the limited role of French cinema in the world at present. With some notable exceptions, of course.
