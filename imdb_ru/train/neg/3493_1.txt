I rarely write reviews for IMDb.com, but I have to warn potential viewers that this film is terrible. Just awful. I like Shaw Bros. movies. (I'm not a hater.) And I had high hopes for this film because I found it on the list on many websites of the “10 Best Kung Fu / Martial Arts Films”. (Now I am convinced that these top 10 lists are all works on cutting and pasting.) First, there are almost no actions in the film. Much of the film consists of talking about the plot, which is an amazing feat, because it is thin at best. And the action itself may have been impressive back in 1978, but by today's standards it is a routine. A special warning to Netflix users: the DVD they deliver is terrible; The picture is terrible and not even improved 16: 9.
