And what's wrong with the actors who participated in this shit? Michael Dorn must stick with the Star Treck merchandise. John Deale, does anyone remember him at Miami Vice? He liked it there ... Well, anything - what can you expect from a movie with one of the Baywatch rescuers at the head? Nothing, and that's what we get. None of the characters is even cute, the special effects are funny (but not funny). This story is a (very bad) joke. There is no logic in what is happening. I got the feeling that the filmmakers are trying something like “Attack of the killers of tomatoes.” Especially in the scene where all the important people were discussing national security in some closet ... <br /> <br /> If you happen to see this on TV, change channels - your TV will always be grateful.
