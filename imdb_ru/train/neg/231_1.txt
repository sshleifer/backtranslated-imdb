It starts badly, because three women behave like simplified high school students, giggle with their gin, endless cigarettes and caramel chocolate delicacy for someone who tells the best "male" story, and then it gets worse - = - spoiler alert = - = that because Andy’s character fell in love with a young musician who was her student when he was 14 (she’s the headmaster of an English school, believe it or not), only to be destroyed thanks to his bitch - from under hell "friend". ... and then from there, it’s mostly unsightly cotton: she forgives her “friend” and she has a favorite child playing the organ, and 3 women finish from the moment they start, drink more gin and smoke more cigarettes, blah blah blah. The character Andy throws caramel chocolate on the street in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth. Pity
