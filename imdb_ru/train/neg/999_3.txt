I saw The Descent last night at the Stockholm Film Festival, and that was one huge disappointment. The disappointment because the storyline was potentially powerful, the prospect of seeing Rosario Dawson in a small intimate film was exciting, and being a fan (it sounds perverted, I don’t!) 70s rape / revenge movies, I was unnecessary to say very curious to check This movie. My conclusion: let's stick to the classics! Yes, the storyline has potential, but the dialogues are flat, the actors are inconclusive. Even Dawson is empty. Someone will say that this is the correct image of the world of colleges in the United States, that the emptiness of the characters serves the purpose and all that jazz, but that simply makes the whole film irrelevant. Just like the scene where Dawson is raped: he seriously lacks intensity! I did not expect anything “irreversible” style, but still, shouldn't we sympathize with her? I did not for a minute, she was so lame to the end ;-) And I read that the photo was impressive. Well, this is really good, but nothing fundamentally new either. I have to admit that the show at the festival was not so good, so maybe I missed something here, but at the end of the film I could not help but think: “I want to see Argento Hell again. lol More seriously, the first scene in the club was beautifully filmed, and everyone except me had the bitter feeling of watching a longer and more boring version of the scene in a dirty bar near the US-Canadian border in the Lynch movie Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with ... coarse red and blue lighting, heavy bass music, general slutty / decadent atmosphere ... No, I just could not get into this movie. Very bad.
