I bought this movie on blu-ray because it promised great visual effects and music. I was also a big fan of this movie ... Barak. The film is very stylized for Baraku, wide angles, very similar frames with cameras set to capture long passes in each frame. Even some scenes were identical (street with traffic). While Baraka told an amazing story combining nature, the artificial environment, spirituality and horrors of the world in exciting fashion and great music, this film just jumped from place to place without a comprehensive story, mediocre music, and then ... puff, it's over! I thought there must be some kind of mistake! History of the world? Half of the film is Egypt and the landscape (similar to Arizona, but I didn't bother to check). Seriously guys, it's terrible, rent it if you need it, but don't buy it. The filmmakers should be ashamed of having exposed it.
