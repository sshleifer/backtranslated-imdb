There was a cartoon Bugs Bunny called "Baby Buggy Bunny", which was exactly this storyline. Finster with a childish face robbed a bank, and the money in the car rolled back and fell into the Bug rabbit hole. He dressed like a child to get into the hole of Bagg and take the money. The scene in "Little Man", where he looks in the bathroom mirror, shaving with a cigar in his mouth, directly from the cartoon. It was a fun 5-minute cartoon; not much of a movie. If you're really interested in this, buy the Bugs Bunny DVD. It was much more original for the first time (1954). In addition, you will get much more classic Bugs Bunny cartoons!
