This film has a really good story core. The work of the men and women of the Coast Guard, especially in the North Pacific, is the stuff of heroes and legends. In this film, a good story with three endings (none of which satisfies), a pair of unnecessary and meaningless bar fights and two supposed “romantic” relationships that cause as much spark as a dead fire. The scenes of salvation are great - even if the computer generation is unnatural and the scenarios are rather unreal - but the back story is lame and frustrating. Costner is good - especially his hand acts (watch out for it). Ashton Kutcher is flat but not terrible. The main female characters are one-dimensional. The best woman is one of the Coast Guard sailors in the rescue center, and she takes a full two minutes on camera. It could be a great movie - and Costner is needed!
