Everything that could have been potentially interesting in this material drowned in the first few seconds, with the proviso that the events we are going to see will never be known, and “This is a whisper [hearing] that is most often told” about one of the most sensational "mysteries" of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Good. Thus, we do not get anything new (and “Secrets and scandals” from E! Give you a better foothold on a specific incident ... and this is not so important). What do we get? <br /> <br /> We learn that Hollywood is the nest of a viper and decadent. There is no big news. Even more interesting is that we learn what the director is ready to do in order to regain power in the entertainment industry and / or in political circles. The question arises whether Peter Bogdanovich speaks from his own experience through these characters. But what has been said is so cynical, ugly and confusing, that we feel guilty for having witnessed a hooligan who is posing as a story. <br /> <br /> The tone of the film has an oddly insane quality that I found more annoying than funny. We do not empathize with anyone. And the great “Citizen Kane” hones the relationship between Davis and Chervami in a much more convincing way. In Feline Meow, we are never sure about Davis's motives for being with Hearst. As soon as we were told one, she stopped doing the other. <br /> <br /> And we have to believe that Davis was the love of a chaplain's life? Or is he simply trying to deceive one of the most powerful and, obviously, idiotic citizens of America. The film never clarifies. <br /> <br /> What is convincing is production values. There is a great vacation on a yacht and in vintage costumes. I looked more at the construction of some lapels on men's jackets than on history, which slanders many of the most famous personalities in Hollywood history. No one will remember that the script is fiction. The disclaimers that frame the film only make it even more cautious and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> The performers cannot be blamed, although Meg Tilly passes the parody here. Kirsten Dunst never disappoints. She gives the most sincere performance in the sea of ​​scenery, chewing. Only Joanna Lumley rises above the material, but so much so that it seems that she moves away from the entire enterprise, and does not tell it. One of her first lines: "I am not here!" And I am sure that she would like her not to be. <br /> <br /> This is not on a par with the trashy Bogdanovich, so bad it is good "In love, finally." This happens when you try something serious, but he hesitates and stumbles mainly because he is so full of bitterness towards the “beast” named Hollywood. This is the film "National Enquirer". And this not only spoils the names of those whom the film puts on Oneida this weekend, but the public is getting pretty dirty.
