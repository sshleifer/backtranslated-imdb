This is the worst movie I ever remember. Everything was incredibly cliché and backward. The game was terrible too. The camera work was not bad, but it still could not buy it. The author / director of this film must suffer from Down syndrome, if he believes that this film will help his career. I want to give back one and a half hours of my life, which I wasted by watching this shit. I'd rather watch a video of growing grass than this. I can't believe that IMDb makes me write 10 lines to publish it, but I feel that this film is so bad that I have to keep warning others about it. The reason I came about this film is because my friend requested it from the local library, thinking that it was Chris Christopherson’s film, called Disappearances. I don’t know whose fault it was for my DVD player, but I feel that someone owes me at least $ 20 for my time, pain and suffering. In conclusion, the director / screenwriter of this film is better to hope that I will ever recognize him on the street.
