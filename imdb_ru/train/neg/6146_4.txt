How this film escaped the wrath of MST3K, I will never know. Gimkata is a funny action movie filled with (or empty?) Plots, paper-thin, stupid characters and ridiculous situations. But take it from me, if you like to watch bad but stupid movies, you will really like Gimkata. <br /> <br /> An action center around a gymnast chosen by government agents (at least I think they were government agents) to become a spy. You see, his dad was another quasi-government agent who went missing while participating in this game, which is eloquently called "The Game." So the gymnast (politely played by Kurt Thomas) is trained to participate in this game and find out what happened to his lost father. <br /> <br /> Sounds promising, doesn't it? So, this is not the case, but still, this storyline does not begin to describe the joys of this film. They can be found in the strange details of the film. Like a gymnast's mysterious Asian girlfriend, who does not speak for the first half hour of the film, then suddenly begins to speak and does not close to the end! Or a really cool bad shirtless guy who likes to create and break the non-existent “Game Rules” whenever he likes it. And, of course, there is a delightful romp of our hero through the Village of Mad Men (obviously, this is the real name of the place!). Good place to visit, but I would not want to live there. <br /> <br /> But where this film really shines is action movies. Since our main character is a gymnast, the director found it expedient to attach gymnastic equipment to the back alleys and city squares of the cities of the Middle East so that our gymnastics master can better use his gymnast skills to fight the evil parallel bars and beat horses. Must see to believe. <br /> <br /> One interesting thing. A lot, I would say that half of the actors die from an arrow shot. Interesting, because the arrows are the only plausible effects or actions in the entire film. If these were really effects, I would make one major compliment to someone who came up with these very realistic arrow wounds. Most likely, this was the film's way not to pay extra. However, “Gymkata” deserves to be seen if you can see it without payment, and you are looking for some kind of nonsense, which is an easy target for a riff. <br /> <br />
