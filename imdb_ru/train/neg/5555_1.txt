Usually I am rather inclined to like low-budget gonzo films, but Darkman III is so terribly uninteresting that I only have contempt for him. <br /> <br /> It looks and feels like a television show and especially the cheesy one in it. The sets are rare, the lighting is even, the score and the effects are scattered, and the camera one is the film school 101. There is nothing to talk about with the plots, the characters are one-dimensional, and the actors are lunatics. Most of the actors look like they should do soft core porn ..... In fact, the only reward I received from this mess was the spotting of astonishing squint faced Roxann Biggs-Dawson (B'Elanna from Star Trek: Voyager) without Klingon. Her skin tone is about two shades lighter than in Voyager; Either she was bleached for this role, or dark-skinned on Voyager. Anyway, very strange.
