This interesting idea went bad. The hidden meanings in art, left by serial killers as clues, sound intriguing, but the performance in Anomorph is painfully slow and without much interest. There is no other way to describe the film, except for boring. The keys to death are the only interesting part of Anomorph. Everything that binds them is tiresome. Willem Defoe as an investigator demonstrates reliable work, but he has nothing to do with the scenario, which is stretched to the limit. Several actors of secondary characters were wasted, including Peter Stormare as an art expert, James Rebhorn as police chief, Paul Lazar as a forensic investigator and, in particular, Deborah Harry, who is depicted on the back of a DVD, but has only a pair of lines pronounced through a cracked door. Not recommended. - MERK
