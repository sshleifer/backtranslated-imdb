I am a big fan of Western spaghetti, and, as a rule, I like most of the cheap ones. The notorious director Demofilo Fidani, however, is rightfully known for some of the cheapest, dirtiest and, well, worst contributions to the genre. The plots of Fidani’s films were usually very weak, and since his talent was very limited, he usually tried to sell films, adding famous Western names for spaghetti, such as “Django” from “Sartana”, to the titles. In the particular case of “Gi71 La Testa ... Hombre” of 1971, he simply took the title “Giù La Testa” of Sergio Leone (aka “Duck You Sucker”) and added “Hombre”. The film can be found under various names (“Handful of Death”, “Western History” ...), I personally bought it under the name “Adios Companeros”, which this film shares with another film of Fidani with almost the same actor, “Per Una Bara Piena Di Dollari ", also called" Adios Companeros "in the German language version. <br /> <br /> The plot is rather weak, basically it follows a guy named Macho Callaghan (Jeff Cameron) and his participation in two rival gangs of criminals led by Butch Cassidy (Jack Betts) and Ironhead (Gordon Mitchell). <br /> <br /> Jeff Cameron’s lead statement, kindly stated, is not very convincing. I also did not find Jack Betts very good, like Butch Cassidy. The legend of the bi-film Gordon Mitchell, however, is always worth a try, and although he was probably not a very good actor, I always found his performances in Spaghetti Western quite amusing and original, and he actually saved some of the Fidani films (for example pretty shitty "Django and Sartana ... Showdown in the West"). <br /> <br /> In G-la-Testa ... Hombre, there is one very funny thing - the great Klaus Kinsky plays the priest! I could imagine Kinski in any role, but before watching this film, I would never have guessed that someone would choose him as a priest. Kinski, again, is great, although he has little time on the screen, and the one scene where he stops the fight is probably the only good scene in this. Another interesting thing in this film is that the legendary director and king of mean things Joe D'Amato has starred in cinema. <br /> <br /> "Giù La Testa ... Hombre" is a cheap, crappy movie, but nevertheless He has some funny moments. Being a Western spaghetti enthusiast, I was interested in watching, but if not, do not forget about this film or watch it only to see how Kinski plays the priest. 3/10
