Well, basically, the film is blowing! This Blair the Witch meets Sean Penn’s ill-conceived fantasy of traveling to Iraq to show the world what the “War on Terror” is. The script sounds as if it was written in 8th grade (no offense from the 8th grade); the two main actors play the entire movie; they used the wrong type of camera and the wrong type of film (not that I knew something about these things - but it didn't look like real documentaries I watched), and worst of all Christian Christian Johnson took a great idea and made it sucks. It reminded me of the time when I tried to draw a picture of my dog, and the result was a very bad shape, like a stick that looked more like a gigantic shit. I'd rather see Blair the Witch VIII than deal with it again.
