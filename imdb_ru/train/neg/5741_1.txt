<br /> <br /> Iâ€™m a big fan of horror / science fiction, regardless of budget, but after watching countless horror movies late in the evening on cable and video, this should be the worst of all movies. With bloody special effects (what looked like a roast, covered in fake blood or ketchup, which was shown again and again), and people ran around screaming from the left, then to the right, then again. It had to stay with the beginning of the store scene and stopped there and it was 15 minutes. Instead, he stretches for a very long time. This is a very, very budget budget. Many scenes were too long. The narrator sounded very amateur, as a casual high-school man used to say. In my opinion, this is the only film that is rated lower than Manos, Red Zone Cuba, Benji and Godzilla vs. Megalon, despite higher budgets. 10 reasons, try not to sleep throughout the film in one place or even better, avoid it, as if you were an inanimate crowd with brains. Why-I-ever see this piece of zombie dung-blues. The incarnation of sickeningly bad films, etc. To infinity. -infinity / 10
