It’s absolutely unbelievable for me that someone can make a comment that this film does not preach. This is not only an oppressive sermon, but also an absurd, scenic, dramaticly straightforward and painfully exhausted. Watching this, you feel like an 8-year-old child who is punished by writing to the board “I will not become a fascist” 100 times. <br /> <br /> Now I understand that this was done in the midst of World War II, and should have become a bold condemnation of Hitler and the terrible suffering he brought (which someone sincerely welcomed), and I’m sure that it definitely conveyed the mood of the day. But he is represented in such an immature, overly obvious, way of a sledgehammer, he fails terribly as a work of art. <br /> <br /> The only good results here are from Paul Lucas, who brings sincerity and intensity to his role as a quietly heroic anti-fascist; and Lucille Watson as an amusingly ill-mannered, rich grandmother, who gradually realizes how dangerous the world has become. Although their rootless upbringing subjected them to all sorts of hardships, children ridiculously demonstrate how timidly well-behaved little scissors lead themselves. They are not even remotely like real people. And Bette Davis, a great actress, that's such a measured noble, I cringed every time she was on the screen. Her every word, her every gesture is intended to show how SUPPORTING and UNDERSTANDING she is about the VICTIMS her husband must make, and the great REASON for which he fights, that she must have been connected to get painful electric shock, if she dared to allow any hint of doubt or shading to surface in her image. <br /> <br /> So yes, this is a very IMPORTANT movie, but not very good.
