Simply put, this is the worst film since the “Police Academy: Mission to Moscow” (if you liked this film, you might like it). <br /> <br /> What were they thinking about? Some ideas should remain just an idea. The fact that this idea itself can be withdrawn should be a criminal offense. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with that, I heard you ask. In a word ... ALL. <br /> <br /> Cost of hiring: $ 4.50. Watch Time: 89 minutes. <br /> <br /> I want to return the money to both!
