It was a disappointment to see this DVD after so many years. For me, the main problem is the uneven scenario. <br /> <br /> While some of them are witty and fashionable, a lot, but boring, unfunny and lifeless. Many of the jokes just sit there, lacking spark and energy. <br /> <br /> Mae West and Rachel Welch come to the cast well. Roger Herren as Rusty Splendor (sorry he didn't make more films). But for my money too much John Houston and poor Rex Reed are hardly given a chance to fight. His character seems to be forced to run on the sidelines, marveling at what he does in this film. <br /> <br /> A low user rating should give an idea of ​​how the public perceives this work. The original Vidal provided a lot of potential, which was largely wasted. Even the “classic” clips haven't done anything special. In general, a rather weak effort, and is unlikely to become much better over time.
