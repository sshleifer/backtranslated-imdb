If only to avoid making this type of movie in the future. This film is interesting as an experiment, but does not tell a convincing story. <br /> <br /> Someone may feel virtuous if you look at him, because he touches so many IMPORTANT questions, but he does it without any noticeable motive. The viewer leaves without any new perspectives (unless he comes to him, while his thoughts wander, as it will always happen during this meaningless film). <br /> <br /> It is better to spend time staring out the window at a growing tree. <br /> <br />
