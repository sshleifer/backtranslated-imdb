I could hardly refrain from either nodding or simply turning off this shit, but I decided to post it, if only for the reason that maybe something would happen. This is the work of writer / producer / director / special director Kenneth Hearts, who wants to make a statement about the environmental damage when creating a monster film. In any case, this is what he wanted. What turns out to be is a lot of action, either a little silly or just plain mundane and without special dignity, and scenes that seem to repeat themselves as monstrous ATTACKS in river waters (oh, and what luck, a woman just happens to be naked in this ... even though they have already disappeared!) <br /> <br /> These are just meaningless things, but I suppose this is not too harmful; it's not very unpleasant, at least once or twice we get a semi-interesting look at the Brazilian "culture" (that is, the father walking through the city with his flock or other parts of the similarity "hey, this is NOT America!"). But all the hopes that the director had for the role of Mitchum or Carradine are spent, at best, on pedestrians, and at worst, on a painfully banal and stupid dialogue. It does not help that when we finally get a good look at the monster and the “action” takes place, it is also stupidly placed, and only with obscene attractiveness. I usually feel sorry for the director who had a lot of problems getting a particular picture - in this case it took most of the mid-70s - but with Monstroid or Monster or whatever it is called ... no. <Br /> <br /> If you have a dual Elvira DVD feature (bad print with poor transfer quality) with Blue Sunshine, be sure to skip it. Unless, of course, you are a stubborn Elvira and cannot help yourself hear her juicy comments; I personally would prefer to get Joel or Mike Nelson with robots from the Mystery Science Theater on this roast turkey.
