Roger Corman is undoubtedly one of the most versatile and unpredictable directors / producers in history. He single-handedly was responsible for some of my favorite horror films (for example, the film adaptation of Edgar Allen Poe “The Mask of the Red Death” and “The Pit and the Pendulum”), as well as some unbearably cheap and sticky juices from the garbage (for example, “The Being”). from the sea with ghosts "and" She, the gods of the shark reef "). Korman also shot a couple of films that simply cannot be classified and simply put ?? almost impossible to judge correctly. For example, “Trip”, as well as the figurative name “Gas-s-s-s”, may be somewhat called psychedelic exploitation. In other words, these are incredibly weird films about the influence of hippies. Half the time you have no idea what's going on, who these characters are, who go back and forth on the screen and where the hell is all this going on. The plot is simple and yet very effective: a strange but deadly nervous gas is accidentally released and quickly destroys that the entire population of the world is over 25 years old. This * may * be the main premise of the atmospheric, sandy and gnawing nails postapocalyptic sci-fi landmark, but the writer George Armitage and Roger Corman decided to turn it into a "trip" comedy about a road film. None of the characters even tries to prevent their inevitable death; they just have parties on the streets and find little crime syndicates for minors. "Gas-s-s-s" - disappointingly boring, and he tries too hard to be strange. The whole script seems to be improvised on the spot and not at all funny. Definitely not my cup of tea, but the film has loyal fans and many fans, so who am I to say that it is not worth your time or money?
