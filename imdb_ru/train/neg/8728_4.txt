This is bad. Really bad and boring crime film, in which there is nothing unusual. A series of crimes, a killer that you do not see throughout the film, classic investigations. As well as the classic story about a cop who finds out what is happening and no one believes, so he must fight himself to uncover the truth. Not too much at that. Vote: 4 out of 10.
