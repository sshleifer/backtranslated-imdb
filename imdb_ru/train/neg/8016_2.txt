Firstly, this film is HOWLY slow, and I see that most viewers lose their patience in general in the first thirty minutes. <br /> <br /> The theme of the film was, I think, the basis for a great film; what was missing most was a plot that would advance the main themes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, because in the hands of a writer like (say) Lanford Wilson, I think that a symbolism like the invasion of a mountain lion school campus could take on great tragic proportions without being tough. <br /> <br /> I think, with a good script supporting the film, the same director, with the same tastes and even with the same actors (who in fact did not even have the opportunity to impress me), I could have present a meaningful and touching description of pain and struggle that a boy goes through when he develops a strong “love” for the older boy whom he admires. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I am sorry to say that without this reason and armed with a fuzzy, stupid and extremely uninteresting scenario, without any plot in sight and without any reasonable structure (for example, after its viewing, I believe, you will find that you cannot point to climate scenes, and instead, you will find that you list "well, maybe this scene or this was the culmination ...") - the result is 95 minutes of exhaustion. <br /> <br /> Without a good plot, we will never be interested in any of the characters; their trials and difficulties are just boring and boring. <br /> <br /> Without a good plot, dramatic tricks and surrealistic directorial freedoms become mysterious and confusing, and not an improvement in the storyline. I could never believe, for example, the creation of “Leah,” and I think most viewers would be completely bewildered by the usual way in which her telephone calls were taken. <br /> <br /> Since the film is worth it, I'm afraid this is one that I cannot recommend at all. What I can never understand is why such a film as THIS is not made anew by an enterprising director ... instead of all the mediocre remakes of films that were excellent in the first release! All he needs is a good script written by good writers, and I think that this film can be easily turned into an unforgettable classic about the aspect of the coming of age of men, which is rarely seen in drama. All the elements that were so tedious and seemed so exciting in the film (messages written on the boy's belly, the scenes “Leah”, television fantasies on the screen) could become rich if supported by a good story. <br /> <I see in many comments that people say about this film as something related to “gays”, and I think this is a mistake. Obviously, the “in love” pictured is a recently pubescent boy of an older teenage boy, but Logan’s character is too young to accept any particular sexual choice, and indeed, in his depicted masturbation fantasies, we see all sorts of stimuli, sexual and non-sexual, as expected from a little boy like him. I believe that such "crush", like Logan, are common among young men who grow up to give preference to female sexual partners.
