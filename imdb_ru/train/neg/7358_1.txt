In this film, Lifestyle, it is about an elderly middle-aged divorced victim who eventually fights the genre into a new depth of absurdity, like a caricature. <br /> <br /> Here, 40 former wives left at home, a successful attorney-at-law (daughter in college) starts a new life after a divorce, she is helped by her college friend to open a new clothing store as a kind of agreement to expand the franchise. She even made friends with her attractive, perhaps a little younger, landscape architect / gardener (who is black). But then the horror of the horrors of middle-aged women, OTHER 20 women, whom she took as a tenant to free up a room, begin to “capture” her life. <br /> <br /> What does this new threat of a young woman really do is flirt with the gardener and offer him a glass of wine that * sigh * really belonged to the divorced !! She runs utility bills without turning off the thermostat !! And supports backing up the toilet! And leaves the old food gone bad in the fridge! And hang her pieces of (African) artwork in the living room !! And so on. Well, maybe she killed the cat too. Yes, well, the extent to which it does these things is bad enough, but it is more than a little ridiculous, especially when it turns into a campaign. The reality of the character is that any tiny part of it will bring this crazy woman to madness. (So ​​why did she rent a room - and to the horror of horror? Is the woman much younger?) <br /> <br /> Presumably, this increasingly arrogant (naturally) young woman has a mania for seizing control. And our brave 40th person must learn to fight this evil (and, of course, erotically hot-looking) 20th. But there is this problem. Every time something starts to experience problems, she uses her POWER - and simply flirts or has sex with some guy and avoids the consequences. (Well, actually in this ability there is something that looks beautifully 20 pieces. It's just not * usually * used in this way.) <br /> <br /> The assumption is moving something using a device that is deceiving divorced and draws up her room rental agreement with a written agreement issued by her. Of course, the 40s did not know something about these things, but 20 helped. The rent actually gives the young woman equal rights to the whole house during the rental period with utilities at a fixed price. Although the eviction process is expected soon, a 20-year-old woman will soon receive a temporary restraining sentence against an older woman, presumably because she threatens the 20th country. You know, the judge is sympathetic to all woeful sexual young people. Finally, the “heroic” battle for the HOUSE begins. Woopie !! <br /> <br /> The only realistic or insightful thing in this film is how awfully easy TRO (or orders of defense) is for women to get nothing more than her unfounded words - although they usually are just that easy against men. Sometimes they are just as unjustified and just as motivated to take control of the house, as here. Indeed, girlfriends who have moved with their boyfriends can often evict them from their own houses or apartments, without having any evidence of this, but only unreasonably claiming threats, and sometimes even not hearing his side. Even when there is a hearing, it is usually not possible to refute allegations of threats (to prove denial), when the burden of proof actually falls on the accused, not on the prosecutor. (This is one of the few areas of American law where this is true - and this is a clear perturbation of the feminist surge and the inability of any organized group to resist the rink.) Of course, this is unlikely to be the subject of any Lifetime film in this life. <br /> <br /> The absurd basic premise of this film is based on the explanation that something psychotic and does not take medicine. Even that doesn't make sense. She does not need a successful lawyer of her ex-husband, although she helps him (to the rage of his ex-wife) in her search. She is after DOMA (technically, to drive out the divorced from him during the rental period). This second youngest woman after EVERYTHING THAT REMAINS after the divorce, after doing things with other 20 things, stole her husband !! (The ex-husband seems detached and mostly caring after his escape - it doesn’t matter, he still went astray !!!) <br /> <br /> The main character is good enough looking for her age. But her worldview, attitude and concentration are so unobtrusive, untidy and completely without imagination or vitality that it is impossible to take care of her. Well, I think the core group of Lifetime fans cares, judging by the average score given by a small number of evaluators. (I continued to watch him only because he was so terrible and cartoony that he was attractive in the camp. I could not help myself from how far they would take him.) <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** (if this is possible with this click). <br /> <br /> Well, here's a hint. The film ends with a 20-year-old woman coming out of prison promising to “listen” to her 20-year-old colleague, and sometimes her lover, and “do everything he says” and “let him take care of her” (he wants to get she continued to take medicine), and then deceived him and returned to DOM. There she climbs the stairs with a knife, demonically pursuing something of her sworn enemy who is taking a bath by candlelight, confident that the younger woman has gone out of her life. There is a struggle - and 40 with something that mom wins - to stick 20 with something with a hypodermic needle, full of antipsychotic drugs that she found. Then she starts to stroke her like her mother, and the two women have a moment of solidarity between women !!! So glad.
