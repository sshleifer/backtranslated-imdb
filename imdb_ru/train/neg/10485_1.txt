Darkly comical insight about the cosmetics saleswoman, with strange connections with Elvis Presley, who is confronted with the sea of ​​Elvis imitators, speaking at conventions in Nevada ... and accidentally killing each of them through his own fault. Kim Basinger, still an attractive actress with significant merit, likes to choose fancy movies for the game, but in this terrible scenario (Mitchell Ghanem and Adam-Michael Garber) there is not a drop of good mood. Stereotypes and ingenuity are not intended for a classic comedy, but even at a bashful, shameful level, the picture is rough and sloppy. If you look, see if you can count how many outsider shots from Basinger at the wheel of her pink Cadillac, her hands are always in the same position and there is nothing superfluous on her face. I hope she and Elvis were well paid. NO STARS from ****
