Basing a television series on popular authoring is not a guarantee of success. Yorkshire Television found this out hard when, in 1979, they bought rights to books credited to Dick Francis, three of which were broadcast under the general title "Racing Game". Mike Gwilim was Sid Galli, a former jockey who turned into a private look after an accident in which he lost his right arm, only to replace it with an artificial one. Gwilim suffered from an acute lack of charisma (and looked like one of the bad guys), while Mick Ford (who played the annoying Chico Barnes) made me think of the horse's bum when he was on the screen. For six weeks, this less than dynamic duo roamed the countryside, disrupting vile conspiracies to organize races, usually using the same methods â€” blackmail, kidnapping riders or doping horses. Yorkshire television threw money at the show, but to no avail. Cruel, sexist, contrived and boring, he was quickly brought into the courtyard of idlers.
