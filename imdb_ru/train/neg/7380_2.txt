I think it's time for Sigalu to quietly go into the night. What I just saw makes all his direct video releases over the past few years look like his hits from the early 90s compared to him. <br /> <br /> The secret biolaboratory creates a new kind of medicine that raises the human adrenaline system to such an extent that they become psychopathic killers or something like that. Somehow, Seagal must stop the infection or the end of the world ... or something like that. Seagal also went through fighting units, such as jellyfish, every time I looked up, he commanded a new face, so it was quite difficult to follow the character’s development, and I know that Stephen's atma doesn’t let him shout at the top of his lungs, even so why is it constantly duplicated by people who are not like him? Usually the plot of the film and the sequence of actions can save him from wasting time, but this is not even close. As I said, it was more like a horror movie with a lot of blood and a knife blow, and not a direct fight. The problem was that in fact it was not scary, and Seagal looked completely out of place, because the infected people should have had the speed of light, but the 40-year-old Seagal killed them all alone? I think the highlight of the film was the first 20 minutes, when recruits asked Seagal to go with them to the strip club. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
