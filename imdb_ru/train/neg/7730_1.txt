Despite the great style, flare and brilliance, this French musical does not speak. Melodies are repeated, predictable and tedious. The story is uninteresting, like many characters. <br /> <br /> People rush into songs and dances without motivation and reason. Most of the actors wear fake-looking wigs and hairpins, and the sets look hopelessly tied to the studio. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this video of the restored version was stopped to the end, so it had a negative effect on me. Of course, shame, to have such a talented cast in such a weak final effort. <br /> <br /> It looks like I will show where repetitions (in this case, for the great classics, “Umbrellas”) are often unsuccessful. Unable to return, only recover.
