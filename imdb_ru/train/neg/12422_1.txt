I rented this film to see what could be a bloody, non-stop action movie, and got this overly sentimental and super cheap low-budget action movie that makes Kickboxer look like Die Hard. Lou and Reb are in Vietnam, and when Lou rescues Reb from tricks, he is hit in the head, which is undoubtedly one of the worst effects in history. Vietnamese scenes are shot in the backyard, I swear! Lu now has a damaged brain, and Reb and he live together and own a bar. Super homoerotic. Lou is convinced that he must fight in a cage for money, and Reb continues to kill him in order to return him. There are no good fight scenes, strikes two inches from a person. Characters characters change in seconds. One guy is bad, and in the next scene he is good. The acting is terrible, and the music is some kind of overly sentimental song by Frank Stallone, from which you get sick. I hated this movie.
