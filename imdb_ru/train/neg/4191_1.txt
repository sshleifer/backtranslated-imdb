I saw a lot of horror in my time, all of them are absurdly bad, but none of them reached the depth to which this piece of garbage sinks. This film made me angry and angry when I watched it, trying to wrap my head exactly what this film was about. Now, after I saw it, I understand - something like - what is happening and why, but the film itself is too tangled to be a pleasure when you watch it. Yes, there are the usual scenes of gratuitous violence, one-liners that show the stunning insight of their characters (“The Road Belongs to Me ... I!”) And enough nudity to distract us from the “plot”, but still you leave this film alone and take advantage of it like a puppy, which is no longer sought, and which is left in the box by the road. Blech.
