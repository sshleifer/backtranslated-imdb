Getting lost in space for 15 years is unlikely. Falling into a star ... incredible. Getting into it on the day it becomes supernova and explodes ... ridiculous. Salvation on the ship just then ... is priceless. <br /> <br /> No, this is not the Golden Heart of Zaphod Beeblebrox. It is also not the winner of the award "Parent of the Year." After the sentence of her daughter to two years of solitary confinement on an abandoned spacecraft, the mother calls on her to get drunk and wander alone with the strange man they picked up. This foreshadows their skill in hand-to-hand combat, which makes up most of the action of the film. Highlights of the battle include, for example, a psycho face-to-face conversation with one woman, when he blindly directs a gun behind him to another, about six inches from her, which readily simplifies the line of fire. <br /> <br /> In the end, a family of three leaves a ship the size of a metropolis, which they planned to use to observe a supernova until the last moment, because it is too slow to avoid a blast wave, instead using a warship psycho, which they filled in one minute from 1600 pounds of gas fuel from a 0.7 kiloton rocket. You have to love these tough science fiction statistics! <br /> <br /> While Hollywood perceives the letter as an inappropriate exaggeration, they will continue to make films that are not suitable for display at 3 am on a science fiction channel.
