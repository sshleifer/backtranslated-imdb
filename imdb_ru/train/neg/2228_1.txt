This film is weak, the cover of the box is written by the toughest gang in East Los Angeles, and it's really Santa Ana, James Cahill acts like a closet, killing all the cool guys from the cool Chloe gang. This is fake, boring, pointless and spanking, I tried to get my money back from the video store, this film was so bad. It was also on the homo-erotic tip, far from what the video box proclaims. James Cahill should play Gay Porno. James is in every scene, he cannot act to save his life. In the film, Eva Longoria, which is hot, but James cannot even score with her !!!!!!!!! Sometimes I felt like I was watching Gay Porn, and the whole movie turned me off. James obviously wants to be with the men, but instead of obeying his cheerful wishes, he beats up the gang members again and again and again. His martial arts skills are minimal at best. Some real gang members take him and his weak skills and tear him apart with new ones.
