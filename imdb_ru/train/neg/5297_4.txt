I am really amazed when someone comes across such a film and claims that it is one of the worst slashers. This is definitely not one of the worst films, still not a very good film, but, nevertheless, not the worst. Go see something like a Deadly Nurse or Blood Lake, and then come back to me and tell me if you think that Charlie brings the Night is the worst. The film has decent camera work and editing, which is much more than I can say for many more dark and obscure films. <br /> <br /> The film does not show death on the screen, there is one death where you see how his scoring saw bursts its neck, but all other deaths are hardly interesting. But the lack of graphic violence on the screen does not mean that this is not a slasher, but simply a bad film. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the film was not taken too seriously. The film appeared at the end of the second cycle of the slasher, so that it certainly was a reflection of the traditional elements of the slasher made in the tongue of the cheek. For example, after the murder, Charlie goes to the "salutatory" sign of the city and kills the population one less. This is something you can only laugh at. <br /> <br /> If you like slasher films, be sure to give this movie a look. This is a little different from your usual slasher movie with the possibility of two killers, but not much. The comedy about the film pretty much tells the audience to relax and not take the film so damn seriously. You can forget the movie, you can remember it. I will remember this because I love the name.
