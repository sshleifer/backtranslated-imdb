I often comment on the complete horror of really scary movies on the market, and, unfortunately, White Noise only undermined my belief that the film industry remains capable of such efforts. I was surprised when I felt that I was becoming more and more tired as the plot continued, and my headache caused by static electricity intensified. I found that "White noise" is ridiculous, except for our best efforts to suspend disbelief. Even after Michael Keaton witnessed the heartbreaking ordeal, his death did not affect me. Up to the credits that I diligently expected something — anything — creatures to connect me with the story of the characters, but there was no such relief. Undoubtedly, there were random moments of cardiac arrest, but only because loud sounds, as a rule, do this for the dormant viewer. <br /> <br /> Although acting was lame, Michael Keaton may have played his most exciting role to date. Perhaps the only redeeming quality that White Noise has to offer is the amazing architektur in both abodes of Keaton. In general, “White Noise” makes one think that those who die are trapped in the world guarded by three malicious shadows, managing to deceive the living to follow the dead into their own graves by deception.
