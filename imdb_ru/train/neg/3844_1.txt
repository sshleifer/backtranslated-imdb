First of all, I would like to tell everyone who saw this film that the actor who played Transvestite is one of my friends, his name is Robert Dugdale, he is a terrific actor, although he doesn’t say much about his filmography, he was in several plays and musicals. He currently resides in Terrace B.C. that's where I come from, he comes to our house almost every Saturday * laughs * Well, now about the film, I would not recommend it to anyone who did not see it, because it is not worth watching the film, the main reason I think that This is a bad film, this is something that it never stays in place, it constantly rebounds from time, so it is sometimes difficult to follow, and secondly, it’s really boring * laughs * Although the acting is great, the film simply doesn’t compare.
