Well, I struggled to avoid the fact that, selling EVP as real, the film lied to me right from the start. I talked about it, damn it, I do not believe in vampires, but I still liked Dracula, so I could put up with it. <br /> <br /> However, even with this, it is accepted that the film is simply not very good. It is well done and works, but in fact it does not capture you at all. There are a few moments of "jump", and I just looked at them and thought: "Yes, I did not expect it," without actually jumping in the slightest way. <br /> <br /> Also, the resolution does not make sense. If the force behind this is capable of doing what it seems to be, then why the hell does she need to use a proxy? Plus, the end of the headline was absurd. They obviously put it as part of “giving credibility to the film, arguing that this is all real,” but in order for this to work, it really must be in the beginning. But they cannot put it in the beginning, because then they give the plot ... by inserting it into the end, they simply force it to stick out like a sore thumb.
