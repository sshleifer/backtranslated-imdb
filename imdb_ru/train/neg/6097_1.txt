In 1985, I caught this thing (I can't even call it a movie) by cable. I was in college and was with a school friend whose hormones were getting out of control. I soon realized that it was hopeless. Stupid script (a bunch of old guys hiring young guys to show them how to score with women), bad game (with one exception) and pitiful jokes Naked nude woman left my friend happy for a while here, but even after 30 minutes he was bored . Remember - it was a SCHOOL! This was before nudity could so easily be reached on the Internet and the like. We kept looking, hoping for something interesting or funny, but it never happened. The funny thing about this is the original advertising campaign, in which the studio recognized that this film is nonsense! (On one poster was a fictional review that said: “This is the best film I've seen this afternoon!”). Only Grant Kramer at the head showed some talent and actually made a career in business. No budget and boring T & A. Skip this.
