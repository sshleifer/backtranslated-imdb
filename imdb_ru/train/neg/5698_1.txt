I almost drowned in RAW, watching this movie. In fact, I could not even finish it. I want my money back. Another weak attempt by Hollywood to come up with a new idea. Good thing I keep a bowl of lemons in the fridge. So, just in case. They had to give Nick Cage a hat and a whip. Swashbucklin. Cage's performance in Raising Arizona or Leaving Las Vegas surpasses this “lemon”. People who are fully and completely sold (and most of them) should love this film. If this film were animated, I would take it more seriously. I would rather pay to watch a completely stupid film that did not try to hide it. In my opinion, it was an incredibly stupid film, and he made an even more incredibly sad attempt to hide this FACT. <br /> <br /> Though it seems everyone is fired it
