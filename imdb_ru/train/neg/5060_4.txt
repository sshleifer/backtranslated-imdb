This movie is the perfect adaptation of English Flick Unfaithful. Ashmit plays the role of Richard Gere, Emran, Olivier and Malikki - the ideal role of a liar, Lane. They changed the second half of the film to adapt to the Indian masses. <br /> <br /> Even then, the film has all traces of infidelity, although it cannot be compared with the original. It was cheap soft porn from Bollywood fans, where Mallika showed a lot more skin than anyone dared to show. Emran played more similar roles and even earned the nickname of a serial killer. In the future, if Indian filmmakers plan to remake an English film, they should explore the possibility of a plot with Indian censors. Although the film was bombed at the box office, the actors received undue recognition. In the future, directors should be a little more careful in reworking an Oscar-nominated film. <br /> <br /> Everyone said that this is not a family film, so be extremely careful when watching it at home with your family.
