I wouldn't say it sucks, but if it weren't for Netflix, I wouldn't even have it in my house. The eccentric president Steve Martin at the health food chain failed. He's just not funny. He is another in the long SNL list that can only find work for the next SNL movie. A maternity trainer with a lisp Elmer Fudd is as funny as the original one. Amy Poehler just does the same thing as the 7-minute SNL parody, which is about as fun recently as SNL. The only thing that happens in this film is that Tina Fey is light in the eyes. The ending was predictable as soon as you heard that her character could not get pregnant. The subject could open up for other comedy attempts, but it seems that it just boils together, without actually entertaining or causing laughter.
