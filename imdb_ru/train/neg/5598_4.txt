Saw it at the Philadelphia gay and lesbian festival. <br /> <br /> What can I say? Contrary to my common sense, I liked it, but it seemed to me that this game was a little ... weak (basically I noticed it in the family of a teenage boy). I mean, the script was not stellar from the start, but the actors didn't make me believe in a relationship. <br /> <br /> The plot is also predictable. <br /> <br /> Nonethelss, I liked it. The characters are cute, and the plot is not complicated and does not upset. It's cute, the characters care about each other, and I don't think it's a fifty-minute waste of time. <br /> <br /> But I do not recommend it.
