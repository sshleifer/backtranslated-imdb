It's amazing that you can see if you wake up at 2 am and turn on the TV. I did not know that they showed such films. I immediately thought of Roger Korman, who reused spots for films or used spots for other films for his own films. <br /> <br /> The marks of this film can simply move the camera angles and increase the time, and they will have a XXX film. <br /> <br /> There was no history, only minimal dialogue that led to strip and sex. I can bet that the whole film did not have 100 words, but there must have been a lot of very big busts and hot lesbian action films. It was also male / female action, but it was only about 25% of the film. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing that came to mind when watching this movie, which may interest those who buy high-resolution DVDs. Sony refused to license Betamax to adult filmmakers, and adult films were released on VHS. You can guess what happened to beta max as the adult film industry makes millions of videos. Sony again refused to license Blu-ray for the adult film industry, and they have just signed an agreement with Toshiba. You can guess which HD system will disappear.
