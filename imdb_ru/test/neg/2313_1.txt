I do not recommend watching this movie. This is a film in which they shoot a film without any attraction between an actress and an actor. The sex scene at the end of the film, which explains the reluctance of the actress (played in the film) to collaborate with the actor (played in the film) in it, is a blunt repetition of the same scene in Braylate. Fat Man movie. Everything there was played with greater delicacy, if you can attach delicacy to such a sexual act. A typical French expression for what happens in the comedy “Sex” - “Oh, la la la! In the film “Short Crossing” by Breilat, there is also sensitivity. In “Sex is Comedy,” I don’t see any real sensitivity, and there’s no clear story for the film, so there’s a pretty loose story with the disappointment of the end.
