The sound of thunder. One of the greatest stories ever written. Ray Bradbury, one of the greatest fantasy grandmasters. What a wonderful story. <br /> <br /> But what a gag movie! <br /> <br /> In the science fiction story of Bradbury, Time Safari offers big game hunters the opportunity to go back in time and kill dinosaurs. Rule number one: “Stay on the way”, a floating metal bridge that does not provide interaction with the prehistoric environment. During the hunt, a person leaves the path and involuntarily crushes a butterfly. When the hunting squad returns to the present, the world they know has changed dramatically. Although there are paradoxes in the history of time travel, Bradbury's tale was a swift jugular, a parable of the ripple effect. <br /> <br /> “The Sound of Thunder” was published in 1952 (according to Wikipedia, the most republished science science story of all times) and illustrated chaos theory, Darwinism and the butterfly effect (which will be invented only in the 1960s by Edward Lorenz ). In the history of Bradbury, the miracle of time travel was overshadowed by corporate greed, which in turn was clouded by a mortal danger to the very existence of humanity. <br /> <br /> In the movie “The Sound of Thunder” (directed by Peter Peter, uneven, CAPRICORN ONE, 2010: ODYSSEY TWO), a group of bad actors again and again go through the portal of time to try to correct their mistakes, like an excretive version of BACK TO THE FUTURE. The film has nothing to do with the powerful history of Bradbury, with the exception of the initial thrust of time-traveling prehistoric hunting. Huge liberties take the Bradbury story - reptiles with a baboon face, plants crashing on Chicago concrete, time waves running through the city, CGI insectoids - for which Bradbury must sue the pants, pants and asses from the filmmakers. <br /> <Newcomers Thomas Dean Donnelli, Joshua Oppenheimer and Gregory Poirier should create Big Balls agency, believing that they can really add elements to Ray Bradbury's story that could improve it. How do these guys walk in a straight line with such big balls? Ben Kingsley is Time Safari's corporate owner, who has such a bad haircut that she looks like a hairpin, Edward Burns is his lead hunter, Travis, and Catherine McCormack (who was Murron McClanno, BRAVEHEART) is a scientist with better breasts. <br /> <br /> I can’t connect hundreds and thousands of scandalous nonsense and silly dialogues, but here’s just one that David Oyelo called a kind of “scientist”: he belongs to the Pleiades star cluster: “Seven Sisters, they are like stars , is not it? But each of them is a whole galaxy. ” No, scientists are idiots, in fact they are stars. <br /> <br /> Those three morons who rewrote the story of Bradbury, forgot that they did not know anything about physics or astronomy. Or write. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is Katherine McCormick's chest, straining her disheveled blouses of the same size. <br /> <br /> - Reviewed by Poffey Cucumber (for Pofi Mania).
