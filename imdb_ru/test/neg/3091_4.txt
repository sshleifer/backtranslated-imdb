What a disgrace. What a terrible shame. The table was set, the candles were lit, the guests arrived ... and then ... <br /> <br /> ... well, nothing special. Just fancy bullshit. It could be great, well, maybe not very good, but it could be very good. All the elements were there, but at the end of the day the bottle was empty: there was no lightning! How this happened remains a mystery, since everything is at the director's disposal ... <br /> <br /> ... the story was rather bold, although it certainly took a lot of work, perhaps a few final rewrites, to correct this story and tighten it. There are a lot of characters (the only thing that was consistently, constantly and unnecessarily rigid, is cinematography, but I will get to that). But the direction was lousy, acting was just that: _a-CTin-G_ with a heavy side of cheese and lots of ham, and then cinematography ... <br /> <br /> ... well, that was something to behold! But only if you are in the film school “Cinematography 101, never use a professional movie camera under any circumstances”. Obviously, the student fell asleep through part of the introduction to the lecture and only heard "... use a professional movie camera ...", and then returned to la la land with bliss when the sentence ended. <br /> <br /> What can I say; Amateurish and pretentious to the last! I can only see this film, intended for appeal, like Chick Flick, because it must be sad, but then it fails and just turns out to be “sad” (as an excuse for the film) ... so even these “chicks” will not fooled by this schlockenspiel! <br /> <br /> ps. I felt bad because of Miss Diaz. She is much better in her craft than the film that allowed her to be, although she was completely COMPLETELY missed. In fact, I feel sorry for everyone in this film, except for the director and (you guessed it) filmmakers! I say: “First for the wall for them, when the revolution comes!” Well, not quite, after all, “it was just a film,” but perhaps a good “pitch with feather and escape from the city” could be more pleasant or at least much more interesting !!! <br /> <br /> TTFN :-(
