Dear director: <br /> <br /> In the future, when you are trying to create a sense of urgency, it's best for your hero * to run * instead of jogging / shuffle. Especially if you are trying to strengthen the timeline. For example, if you are trying to convince an audience that a bad guy will actually kill a hostage if the hero does not find her, it would probably be a good idea to convey the feeling that your hero believes that it can really happen ... Let's face it, although. Making a “good” movie was obviously not your goal. Your goal was to defuse the trash, which will bring more money than it costs. Otherwise, you could hire some actors. <br /> <br /> Regards, bored viewer. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I cannot say that this is the worst of all, because I was able to finish it. It was bad, bad, bad. Dude, where is my return?
