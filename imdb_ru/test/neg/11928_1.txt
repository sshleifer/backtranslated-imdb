If you are a fan of the original series, do NOT watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I should have been skeptical of previews when Eon expresses his motives for the murder. In the series, Eon had no family and motives for her adventures, except for selfish interests. Obviously, a responsible chimpanzee writer felt that the film was needed in order to satisfy the demographic “bad grrl”, making the character deadly, but he has a good reason to kill people. <br /> <br /> You would not have thought possible, but the film is more two-dimensional than a cartoon. All characters are portrayed as good in nature with some conflict of interest, which is ultimately resolved. All dogs go to heaven, and the same goes for every character who dies in this movie. <br /> <br /> The selfish, perverted, perverted, dominant characters of Eon and Trevor are nowhere to be seen. In the end, they literally turn into a cute pair of ala Annie Hall. The only character who remained faithful to the show was Relicle, a car flying in the sky. I suppose if you ever thought: “Well, I like Aeon Flux, but I would like it to be more like any other faceless science-fiction game in Hollywood that isn’t good,” pleasure. <br /> <br /> They did not even understand correctly. I suppose the bikini in black metal was too much, but the whole setting is wrong. 400 years into the future is undoubtedly like 30 years into the past. Instead of a distinctly urban post-apocalyptic world, the eyes of the spectator are offended by the fructopies of the 70s fashion detachment, consisting of furniture in the shape of an egg, wood-paneled walls, earth tones and many plants. Bregna was a dystopia, not a utopia. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Bregna, this is the only city on earth, according to the film. In the show, it is clear that there are two cities, Bregna and Monica, which used to be one. In the film "Monicana" just Hollywood freedom fighters story collections. They also have as much technology as Bregantsy, which is not the case with the series. <br /> <br /> The only possible conclusion - the real screenwriter of this film was a schoolboy, and he wrote it. The day before, it was connected with the work of the studio, and he had never seen all of Aeon Flux all over. A huge number of inconsistencies with the cartoon is confusing. In addition to using certain titles such as Aeon Flux, Trevor Goodchild and Bregna, the film does not look like a TV series. <br /> <br /> It seems that the main body of the film is trying to mix the colorful soy-colored scenes, Blade Runner, Logan's run and the tomb raider, from which the boring brown mess came out.
