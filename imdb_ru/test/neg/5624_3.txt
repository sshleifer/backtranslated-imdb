I have seen this movie 3 times. Mostly because I kept thinking, watching it, “did I miss something here?”. Is there any reason why this film was made? He was trying to say something, and I just missed it? After three views I could not find the answer. <br /> <br /> I think the worst thing I can say about any movie is that I am tired of it, and I have not finished it. I admit that a lot of attention and fast editing and hip music to keep my attention all over, but should this all be a movie? <br /> <br /> I am not against extreme violence, it is almost non-stop, but there seems to be some kind of inspiration. Something that is highlighted by this. The word gratuitous comes to mind, but it is somehow worse. In the first part of the film, we all were given an understanding of the motives of the characters. And yes, 3 principles are very good in their roles. But the roles are absolutely unbelievable. So, in the first part, we recognize the characters, and in the second part, most of them die and use sadistic exultation, killing others. It looks like the whole movie. And the first part has nothing to do with the second. <br /> <br /> for example. How could such a smart guy like Zed agree to join a handful of drug addicts and amateurs to do this kind of work? It makes no sense. He is portrayed clever, but he continues this suicide mission. The fact that he survived is completely at odds with the rest of the hyperreal violence and chaos. So what do we see here for a Hollywood romance with a happy ending or a super real, super cruel bloody wash? I remember that I had the same reaction to two other films with which this director starred: “Real Romantics” and “Dogs-reserves”. <br /> <br /> Unnecessary hobby!
