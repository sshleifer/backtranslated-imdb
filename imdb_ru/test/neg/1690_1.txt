This is a terrible adaptation of the story of Charles Kingsley. Animation, frankly, terrible. And these songs are a shame for movies, especially for the song "high cockororim", which they continue to repeat. I feel sorry for John Pertwie and David Jason, 2 of the best British talents who provide voice for a depressing animation sequence. Bernerd Cirbins is trying his best to play in this terrible performance, but she cannot. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs, even if it is the last movie on this planet!
