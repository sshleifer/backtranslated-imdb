I have seen this movie a long time ago, and yet itâ€™s one of the worst I've ever seen. I like different movies; fantasy, action, drama, thrillers, and sometimes horrors. Not a combination of the two. It could have been a great movie, but everyone blew it up. I did not want to watch this film, but my friends insisted on watching it. I did not know that this is such nonsense. I liked the first part, in which Clooney and Tarantino drove through Texas, killing everyone in their path (especially the liquor-shooting scene was excellent), but at a turning point, in twister tits, everything changed. Stupid vampires took their place, and what could have been the perfect gangster movie turned into a stupid horror movie, such as The Nightmare on Elmsteet. If you like horror, watch a real horror movie. And when you love bloody thrillers, don't watch them at all, in the end you will be very disappointed.
