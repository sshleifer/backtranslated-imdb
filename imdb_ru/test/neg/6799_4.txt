Bizarre. It is assumed that this film is based on a famous photographer, but everything that happens in this film is fiction. I guess this is trying to explain why Diane Arbus was fascinated by weirdness and made it her main focus of photography. In the film, Wolfman moves to the apartment above her. She seems to become obsessed with him and falls in love with him. She puts her children and husband in second place after the wolfman and even tries to include him in her family gatherings. Some of the idiots from the wolf cub come to visit, and she mixes with them. All this is very strange. <br /> <br /> FINAL CONCLUSION: Nothing memorable. There is something strange about a woman who takes pleasure in shaving a wolfman. I think you can find the best movies there.
