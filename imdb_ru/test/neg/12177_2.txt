If this film were in English, all critics would have destroyed it. The language is very bad, the scenes are awfully directed, and this is not at all funny. After the film, I thought that this film could have written an eighth-grader, at least considering the lack of believable characters and fixation on certain parts of the male body. (Oh, of course, about dogs ...) This story is just nonsense compared to the more mature Vingar av glas, which premiered almost simultaneously. Of course the audience chose Jalla! Jalla! While Vingar av glas paid little attention. <br /> <br /> What really bothered me was that the film looked very bad. This was probably due to the fact that the director Joseph Fares used the really cheap camera equipment for the first time, and then decided to just play with him, as it seems to me, for the sake of entertainment. The result is a film that can be easily divided into 12 short films with a new directorial style in each of them. It was very difficult. Perhaps Joseph Fares should have stayed in his short films, as this seems to be the only art form he can master. <br /> <br /> Another disturbing fact is that the story does not stick together. Several times in the middle of a movie, the story must move very quickly, and the characters then collide with each other in such an incredible way. <br /> <br /> And then I did not mention the two-dimensional characters, especially those that play secondary roles. <br /> <br /> Although I believe that this is one of the worst Swedish films of the 90s, as well as one of the most overvalued, it is clear that the public liked it. I mean, bad taste has always been the calling card of the masses ... <br /> <br /> I am more surprised that the critics liked it. They should have known better ... <br /> <br /> Grade 2 out of 10 <br /> <br />
