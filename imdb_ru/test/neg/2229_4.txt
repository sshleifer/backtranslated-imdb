Several of my fellow writers talked about the plot elements of this film, so I’ll stick to some of the comments with the cuff ... <br /> <br /> 1. This is interesting, but not for the reasons you are thinking about. This is stupid, but somehow still watchable. <br /> <br /> 2. Tamra, Daniel’s love interest should be around thirty. The Christian girl Dan ignores is much more attractive. <br /> <br /> 3. Muriel stole his shirt from Mr. Spock. Also, if my guardian angel looks like Muriel, I will have to apply for a translation. <br /> <br /> 4. Well ... so obviously ... Dan is responsible for the divorce of his parents! What is this terrible journey of guilt ?! Muriel says that it was Dan’s prayers that kept his parents together. I just thought it was absolutely ridiculous. Listen, I can pray for my parents as much as I want, but the only way for them to stay together is if they decide they are going to do it. I will repeat the atheist’s comments on how this film portrays non-Christians. Obviously, they are all untidy hooligans. <br /> <br /> 6. For something positive, David White is a worthy actor. He gives the film a little credibility, even if it is the only one. He pretty much holds this film together on his own.
