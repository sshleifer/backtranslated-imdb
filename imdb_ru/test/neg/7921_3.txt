All Dogs go to Heaven was a strange, funny movie; With the talent of a good name, whose voices inspired adults with a caricature, mainly for children. It was just interesting enough that adults could like it, besides that children could look at them. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, ADGTH2 is a useless sequel, trying to make some money on the first fur coats. Charlie Sheen is a passable replacement for Burt Reynolds in this second film, and Sheen Easton's voice in several films of beautiful but forgotten songs makes her a worthy choice as one of the main roles in it. Add Dom DeLuise from the first movie, and you will think that it will be a worthy mix to make the continuation at least relatively worthy compared to the first. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, even with the addition of other good voice actors such as Bebe Neuwirth in the terrible role of Anabel, this film cannot be saved from the horrible production values ​​and animation skills (or lack thereof) present in all of this. the movie. Awful editing, synchronization of voices and flat spaces where the mouths of the characters should move into dialogue, but not merged to make this film look like an animation project for college interns, and not a worthy sequel. <br /> <In general, I would say if you were not a big fan of the first film, I would give a very big PASS.
