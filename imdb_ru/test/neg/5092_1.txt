Wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ... WHAT !? This film is terrible, absolutely terrible. 1. The only reason Kiefer Sutherland is on the cover is to sell it to Kieferâ€™s fans just to break their hearts. He kills one guy, gets shot and dies before half of the film ends, not to mention that he was only in the first 10 minutes, and then disappeared until the moment he died ... 2. Where are the promised Are EPIC scenes promised in the preview on the back cover? 3. It was too confusing, I mean, what happened to the girl? She had to tell the film to try to get our attention, she failed! 4. If Kiefer dies in the film ... he fails. Now I will go to watch 24 ..... THIS FILM IS NOT MADE!
