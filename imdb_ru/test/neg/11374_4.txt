Regardless of which PC Enforcers committee is responsible for this film, I achieved what I never thought possible: take some really talented actors (Davis, Hardin and Taylor) and make you sure that you never run into them space. The feelings underlying the script are so reckless and idiotic that it is impossible to understand or imagine which audience will find this picture attractive, and all the more ridiculous. Perhaps student architects? <br /> <br /> Only one scene is visually intelligent: Marcy Gay Hardin, tossing and turning with all the convolutions and rhythms, manages to emit more style and energy in ten seconds than the rest of the film. As for the other cast members, they probably won't want to put it on their resumes.
