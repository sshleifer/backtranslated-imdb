It's a shame that someone whom many children so much idolize, as well as parents, must humiliate themselves by speaking in this exploitative springboard. I often ask myself if Mr. Wisdom in later years looked at the excuse for a film with pride. At the very least, Sally Gizon was decent to resign to do something worthwhile after appearing in this low-budget trash. A cameo of some long-forgotten pop called “Cute Things” cannot save the film from its horror. If you want the nostalgia of the 60s, instead invest in “Here we go around the mulberry bush,” instead starring Barry Evans and sister Sally Judy.
