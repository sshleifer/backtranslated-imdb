The bridge at Remagen contains some of the most ridiculous wartime scenarios I've ever seen. In addition to the action, which is wooden, not a single tank commander attacks with his tanks, parked in good neat rows, in the middle of the roads, and with troops grouped together with weapons not ready. The constant suicidal behavior caused a "turn" in me, so I often found it impossible to enjoy the film. Apparently, the writers and directors never went through a real war and never bothered to bring in an expert who had. This film is the exact opposite of the beautiful detail of Salvation of Private Ryan. If you are under 7 years old, I recommend to look for something else. <br /> <br /> RU
