There are several famous actors in this film that I usually like, so I had at least modest expectations when I was shooting this on DVD. I was very disappointed. In fact, I was somewhere for the last half hour going somewhere to eat and somehow I was in the kitchen, and did not return to the TV. Actor's performances, where practically all the poor, and not a single atmosphere in the film was very convincing. Practically in all the scenes there was a feeling of “just a movie”, I just sat there and waited for the director to call “CUT!” Then the team chatted a little about the scene and then moves on to the next one. <br /> <br /> Since the film tells about gangsters, most of the characters are tough and crowd-like, the problem is that all this is bad -The children's attitude is played so badly that it seems like a joke. The constant guitar drilling soundtrack is really trying to emphasize this atmosphere, but when the same track is played for the 18th time, it just adds to the already strong feeling that everything is just fake. It was a really bad script, maybe it was poorly executed. I am not a film critic, in fact, I believe that it is rare to see something really good, but it was just bad, no matter how objective and forgiving I try to be. NOT recommended, even as a rental!
