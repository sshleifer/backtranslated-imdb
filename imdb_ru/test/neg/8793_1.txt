I just understood why the colors and scenery in Sakuran were so bright and tasteless, and it was just painful to look at them. The story of a high-class prostitute known as a Japanese oyran. Their kimonos were always brighter and brighter than other kimonos, so the oyran stood out. But director Mika Ninagawa had to make sure that the director stands out even more than the main character or even the story. <br /> <br /> What Anna Tsuchiya did in the film just gave me a boost. You could not call it acting. It was nothing more than treating her crazy fan from a high school girl. Hey, Anna, good luck with that when you get older. Yes, that's right, oyran as a rough and vulgar, biker chick. Have we not already seen how you portray this character in a more suitable film? <br /> <br /> The story was painfully boring and predictable. What is the story of "Sakuran"? A hateful little bitch always remains true to herself, and it is simple: an unpleasant bitch. She discovers that, for inexplicable reasons, men attract her, and that she has an inexplicable ability to manipulate men and becomes a successful, high-profile prostitute, even if she speaks and behaves as if she were a member of a biker gang of women. They say about her so-called seductive ability, but we never see her in action, probably because of the incompetence of the main, feigned, deceived chick, I mean "actress." <br /> <br /> The film’s protagonist is angry with her by a rich and powerful person, because she makes him wait while she serves a much more modest client. Not very similar to oyran? How could such a woman become a oyran? Oh, because the previous Voir killed himself, and the house needed a whore who could demand a high price. Who would pay a high price for a whore so cheap? Rumor has it. How could there be no consequences for what she did to an influential guy? Because the scriptwriters are crazy. They just came up with a bunch of crap. <br /> <br /> Then an even richer and stronger guy fell in love with her (why?), and she left him for a penniless guy who is usually cold and far from her, but respects who she really is (what does not make sense. How can you respect someone so worthless?). <br /> <br /> Speaking of shit, the director squatted and took a huge psychedelic dump about aesthetics, culture and society from the Edo period. Which of such things as sabi, mono is not aware of, wabi, subtlety, elegance, rigidly hierarchical society? Everyone cheats the director, who looks like a meaningless, modernist parven. Amazingly, many other Japanese people squatted around the director while watching this movie, took steaming spoons of this smelly shit and exclaimed how delicious it is. <br /> <br /> Argentine tango with violin and bandoneon as background for the Edo period, when Japan was completely isolated from international peace (except for 3.7 acres of duty)? Why not just give Anna, the poor idiot airan, answer her cell phone, and the rich and powerful character daimyo leaves in a joking way in his red Ferrari? The music we were supposed to listen to was sharp and anachronistic (the same as artistic design). <br /> <br /> In the end, I liked that there were only two or three tiny flowers on the shrine of a cherry. But earlier, when she said she would leave the apartment, when she flourished, we all knew exactly what would happen. How boring to wire the ending is so clear. But what is the point in an old flowering tree? This rich and powerful guy had already made the blossoming cherry blossom like the mountains of Yoshino in spring. Was it not impressive at all? No, of course not. I already know this about whores. The guys who treat them well get hit in the balls. Maybe these are whores when people idealize them, when they themselves know the truth about who they are: just cheap and useless. <br /> <br /> Considering the director’s dedication to the goldfish, the second and last scene was supposed to be a bowl of goldfish on the veranda overturned by chance. Two fish fall into the stream, which takes them to break the walls of the pleasure quarter, showing how the goldfish gets stuck in its bowl and cannot survive on the street (just like the inmate’s relationship with the pleasure quarters). Otherwise, talk about the fate of a goldfish does not make sense. <br /> <br /> In the final scene, the cherry trees were full of flowers, but the shortness of the flowers is one of the features of the cherry blossoms. I could not help thinking that soon enough the twilight would erase all the soft pink color and warmth from the stage. The sky quickly shifted from hints of shadow, becoming more and more gloomy, and night fell. It would be cold, very cold. And dark. It really was not a happy ending, was it? Romantic love (during the Edo period?) Can survive in the face of terrible poverty and be ostracized for as long as these cherry trees are blooming. Maybe a few days, if it had not rained before. But we see untapped romantic love here? His existence in this period is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> Anna Tsuchiya walks in the shoes of Ouran? She could not do that. Literally. Look at the scene of her “walk”, where she seems to be wearing the right shoes, but she needs to hold onto some guy’s shoulder so as not to fall on her ass. <br /> <br /> I was going to give this film two stars for artistic direction, but then I realized that it was all: a sick domination on the part of the director. These colors and decorations - this is how the director shouts: “I am the most important here! I! It's all about me !!!!"
