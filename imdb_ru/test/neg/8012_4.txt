I'm a fan of Judy Garland, Vincent Minnelli and Gene Kelly, but this film just left me alone. I was expecting another American in Paris from Minnelli, so maybe I was expecting too much. <br /> <br /> There were few songs and impressive dance numbers in the film. I was impressed with Kelly's very expressionist dance under Mokoko on the ship. I was also impressed by the brothers Nicholas in “Be a Clown”, it’s a pity that the song was so annoying. I also liked how Judy attacked Kelly with a trinket. See the autobiography of Lorna Luft for some interesting information about this scene. <br /> <br /> In fact, the film has what should be some of Cole Porter’s most annoying songs, especially “Nina”. In addition, Judy and Gene constantly scream like shrill children. <br /> <br /> The plot is very thin, which is the norm for musicals, but impressive dance numbers or unforgettable songs do not save it. I suspect that the best parts of this film were left on the floor of the cutting room. Please, some restorer of the film, find these fragments of the film and show us what a movie could be!
