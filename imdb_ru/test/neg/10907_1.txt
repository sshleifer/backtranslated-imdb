There is nothing good about this movie. This is a formal predictable “romantic comedy”, aimed at forcing women to make them look at their significant others. In other words, it is a predictable chic movie that is neither comic nor romantic, and is extremely easy to forget. If you like to watch the same thing over and over again, then this movie will fit just perfect. I was also forced to watch it with my g / f at that time, and it is not surprising that we are no longer together. I like great movies that are nice to watch, and she just wants to see the same thing again and again with different actors. I can’t say anything good about this movie. The name speaks for itself. 1/10 (one b / c, I can not give him a zero.
