C'était Completetement Minable: Fuir Absolution! <br /> <br /> It was an idiotic attempt to destroy the classic source material, and it was completely crowned with success! <br /> <br /> Do not watch this film under any circumstances, unless you want your ten euros to be torn apart and put a bunch of stupid, maliciously unsightly characters in your nostrils. <br /> <br /> This type of film clearly illustrates the abyss, which, unfortunately, still separates directors and viewers. If a person (God forbid, the team could conceive this dross) would be attentive enough to watch the version that is currently playing in French cinemas, he or she would have survived what I had to endure, and graciously rewrote it is or just written off. it at all. The Vienna of adult humor, extracted here, dates back, in my opinion, to Fritz the cat, but it lacks the avant-garde status of this film or even its basic attempt at social commentary. <br /> <br /> With the proliferation of remakes and the growing reliance on pre-existing source material to fund storytelling these days, one can hope that the choice of “Snow White” and, therefore, no need to worry about conceiving characters or a radical new story will give more time, oh, I do not know, interesting animation, smart jokes, perhaps a coherent film, which has something to say, and which does not show its emptiness from the first frame? <br /> <br /> Explicit awful production.
