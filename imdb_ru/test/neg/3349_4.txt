I saw it on a cheap DVD called "The Power of the Essence." As I like the 80s horror cheese films, I thought that I was in for real pleasure. Unfortunately, the film is mostly boring, and you are constantly waiting for something to happen. It eventually becomes somewhat interesting, but it is in the last quarter of the film. This is too little, too late. When the action takes place, it’s not so great, we get dead corpses, “floating” on the ground and chasing girls in a mausoleum. This is not the worst thing I've seen, but you can do much better. I would only recommend this to the stubborn 80's cheese horror collectors.
