This is supposed to be one of the worst films ever to have been released from a science fiction channel. This is how the film “Women are the only people on this planet because the chemical war in the near future is normal if it is aimed only at the soldiers” (in case you are interested in men) shock) and all the people on earth are slowly dying. Then all masculine are doomed to death when Madame President is shot dead by a man. now they are taking us in 60–70 years, two women scientists are working on cloning a female child, and one of them says, “Hey, why don't we bring the men back?” quickly ignores her, and so the man goes to Eath again. <br /> <br /> First, this film assumes that all men who are not genetically altered are bloodthirsty monsters. Secondly, the writer forgot to mention that modern soldiers are a good combination of male and female officers, so there is no real reason to have such a virus. This is the biggest timeline you can find. This film managed to insult my intellect not only with a bad story, but also with a lifestyle. Avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> I give it 1 out of 10, but only because I could not go below.
