This “shlok-baster” must carry a health warning. If you play it on a DVD machine, you risk opening a crack in the space-time continuum and disappearing without a trace in it - this “movie” is so bad. <br /> <br /> The fact that this film was so successful that it testifies to the true desperate state of modern Hollywood cinema and the constant launch of films that appeal to “the lowest common denominator” - although I’m really afraid to think about the “least common denominators ”that this film actually Appeals to !! <br /> <br /> I think Hollywood just did some tests when they did and showed this film! I can imagine the board meeting in the studio ... "How bad can we actually get off work - and LOT a lot of money! ??! Holy cow, I didn’t realize that we could GET THIS bad !! Woooo hooooo !! "<br /> <br /> The only worse films that I can think of (and believe me, this is close) are Die Another Day (the RIP the Bond franchise, as I knew it) and Independence Day! <br /> <br /> AVOID - AVOID - AVOID !!!!
