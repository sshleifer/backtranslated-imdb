Poor Shirley MacLaine is trying hard to give a little seriousness to this disgusting, vomiting, “feel good” film, but she’s trampled by the fleeting sentimentality of a film that is not based on reality. <br /> <br /> Was it the director Curtis Hanson? Has he had a lobotomy since the last time we heard about him? Hanson can play spectacular drama with comedies, as evidenced by the “Wonder Boys”. So I don't know what happened to him here. This is a film in which they don’t want to admit that life is dirty and fussy, and that neat, tidy endings (no matter how unlikely they may be) can be a good final shot, but can seem very deceptive if This is distant, for example, through what the film characters are going through. <br /> <br /> My wife and I played to bring up plot points before they happened - for example, "The old man will teach her to read, and then he will fall dead." Bingo! This is one of those films where the characters give small speeches that summarize their emotional problems, forcing them to wonder why they still have emotional problems if they are aware of what causes them. Tony Collett (by the way, a wonderful actress, and one of my favorites, if not to work a lot here), first gives a speech about why she buys so many shoes and never wears them, presenting neon highlights. clumsy motive of the film. At that moment I knew what was waiting for me, and the film became a downward spiral. <br /> <br /> Rating: C-
