Obabakoak is a collection of stories with a single common point: the small town of Vaske Obaba. In this film, the director tries to explain some of these stories using a young reporter as a continuum. The result is a strange film in which there is a main character (the film spends about 20 minutes on each fairy tale), except for the city of Obab. Any story is really well explained, and the fact is that they are very boring. It was by far the best film of the year in Spain, but, well, that does not say much. The only good thing about the movie is the precious scripts. This is filmed in a very precious valley, and it is more pleasant to spend time watching the script, rather than getting to know the story.
