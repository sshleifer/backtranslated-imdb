Poisonous Avenger, Part II, begins with a startling revelation that after a poisonous avenger (John Altamura, who was apparently fired during production and replaced by Ron Fazio), he saved his hometown of Troméville from evil He really became a good place to live. This meant that Toxie was no longer used as a superhero and now suffers from depression and a sense of total uselessness (just like directors Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Hertz should feel after creating this), Toxie now works as a concierge in the center of Tromaville. for the blind. " Soon the problem rises to the surface, and an evil chemical company called Apocalypse Inc. plans to capture Tromavil for some stupid or minor reason, but for this they need to get rid of Toxie. After the evil chairman’s (Rick Collins’s) first plan failed, he captivates the psychiatrist Toxie (Eric Shikkel) to tell him to go to Japan and see his father. Leaving his girlfriend Claire (Phoebe Leger), his mother (Jessica Dublin) and his house for Toksi, he goes to Tokyo, Japan. Once there, Toksi begins to look for his Father, and a woman named Masami (Mayako Katsuragi) helps him in his search. Meanwhile in Tromaville Apocalypse Inc. they are fighting for murder, and without Toxie, citizens cannot protect themselves. Toxie eventually finds Big Mac Bunko (Rikiya Yasuoka), whom he considers his father, but Big Mac is part of the Apocalypse Inc. plan. Once and for all destroy Toxie ... <br /> <br /> Produced and directed by Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Hertz, this continuation of the successful work of The Toxic Avenger (1985) basically proves that the first film was completely random, happy coincidence, to combine the right mix of bad taste comedy, outrageous violence and such bad "This is a good film", "The venomous avenger", part II, compared to this - a bunch of shit. The script of Kaufman, Phil Rivio and Gay Partington Terry with many credits of “additional material” does not contain a single funny moment throughout its entire length of 102 (director's cut). Visual jokes are horrible, for example, Toxie walks around Tokyo with a wig and glasses to mix, for example, or a scene in which he heats a bath with a bad guy in her, and while he cooks, Toxie adds a bunch of vegetables and spaghetti, a scene where he sticks electrical wires into a woman’s nose, sticks an antenna into her head and a microphone in her mouth with which a Japanese radio host is talking, a little when the Japanese bad guy burns his nose in the shape of a fish, a little where Toksi grabs the swordfish's head and uses it as a weapon or embarrassingly bad expressing f idiotic facial expressions, the guy who has literary fish for the head and turns literary into sushi, terrible comedy music and sound effects and the whole movie is a pale imitation of what made the original slightly fun and memorable. This time there is a lack of bad taste, and the silly youthful juvenile humor of the first is also missing, it’s just a real step back from the original, and let's not forget that this is Troma, so this is definitely a bad thing. There are several bloody battles and some serious bloodshed and violence, at least in the supposedly uncut 102-minute version that I saw, shattered heads with blood-splashing bodies, broken faces, intestines, someone's pink pumpkins, someone's eyes and spikes wrapped around their throats with severed ears, severed hands and a very visual and bloody scene of a man chopped into pieces. Unfortunately, the special effects of Pericles Lunes are not particularly convincing and appear mostly in the first twenty minutes. The game has embarrassing proportions, as I mentioned. Wise action - at the end of a very cheap car chase and several uninteresting, dull fights using cardboard ninja throwing stars at one point. Horror wise, there is nothing that a few bloody pieces were set apart. Wise comedy, it's very funny. In fact, Toxic Avenger, Part II, actually sucks at all levels, and to top it all off, it is also terribly made, most of the actors seem to be cut off from the nearest street corner, there is no continuity, cinematography is the main point to shoot and special effects are completely different. One or two bloody scenes are complete nonsense, simple and clear, do yourself a favor, look instead at the original again.
