The film begins with a parody of Spiderman, which is an introduction to Rick Riker (played by Drake Bell from Drake & Josh, I personally would give Josh the film, which is much funnier), and the joke Rick Pancers raised right from the Airplane, thus, the authors, obviously, had already cleared the barrel for the ideas for this film. Rick's class is on a science trip to the Amalgamated Genetics laboratory, and it is here that we meet the name of the first star in the film, Brent Spiner ("Data in Star Trek TNG"), playing Dr. Strom. Rick is bitten by a genetically modified dragonfly, from which his powers originate. <br /> <br /> We meet our next big star names in Rick’s house, his aunt Lucille (Marion Ross’s fame on happy days) and Uncle Albert (Leslie Nilson from Plane, Police Squad and Naked Gun). we met Carlson on the Board of Unification (Dan Castellaneta of the Simpsons), who were killed very quickly. We were told that Rick had slept for 5 days and got some cheap, crappy sex-oriented scenes designed to attract the attention of a male audience . On the stage double Stephen Ho Inga looks painful, and this is a really bad idea that doesn't work and is not funny at a distance. We get another parody of Spider-Man (Rick catches the girl and all the planets) but the film should end right there when Jill was hit on the head with a falling bowling ball that would break her skull and kill her with a dead stone.You see how Rick’s first abilities (gripping power and speed) appear, and then his first escape that goes completely wrong. We also get a link to incest, which is really a very bad taste. We get memories and a parody of Batman in which we discover that Rick is solely responsible for the death of his parents. Spoofing Spiderman Again. Rick-uncle shot Jeffrey Tambor (from Hellboy) playing the Doctor of the Hospital. Then we get a parody of the X-Men (made very badly, since Patrick Stewart is about as white as they are), Barry Bonds plays another double. <br /> <br /> We meet Invisible (played by Pamela Anderson). Looks awesome in your costume!). Ricks 1st out in his costume (as soon as he fixes his ability to see and breathe through him) is another Batman travesty. The video for the interview with Tom Cruise on Youtube is reproduced by another counterpart (and not very good). There are many modern links, such as Youtube, Facebook and Wikipedia, which show that the film is happening today. There is a very weak fun joke (and this is also never a good idea) when Jill helps Aunt Lucille prepare Thanksgiving dinner, and the writing scene is not very funny, just infantile. <br /> <br /> Scene farting aunt is not particularly funny, just incredibly childish. Anyone who finds it funny should have a mental age of about 12 years. She is killed, and then we have a really bad joke with necrophilia (really there is no such topic that these people will not try to use to make fun of cheap?) At her funeral, and even worse joke about cremation. <br /> <br /> At the awards ceremony we get 2 of the worst doubles in the entire film (Prince Charles and Nelson Mandela), and if you didn’t know how stupid or stupid the film Landers won the "Douchebag Of The Year" award. Landers is revealed as “Hourglass” (in a really bad scene, when the same girl manages to walk twice past Jill in the same direction). <br /> <br /> Obviously, the hourglass is broken, Jill saved from certain death, and the only funny scene in the entire film is the final one.
