I liked this movie, not very good, but not the worst ever made. While everyone else says that this is one of the worst films ever made, I thought everything was in order. There are a lot of immature jokes. Sometimes you want to be funny, but it does not work. <br /> <br /> History is fine. For a young audience it can be a bit difficult to follow. <br /> <br /> The game is pretty bad. Jamie Kennedy is a terrible actor in most cases. Sometimes it is even funny. Alan Cumming is probably the best actor here. He is funny when he should be, but some of his lines are terrible. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the main bad thing about this movie that I hated was Tim Avery’s voice when he was obsessed with a mask. The voice is terrible. In addition, the scenes in which he is located are so unfamiliar that they are almost unbearable. I’m sure they could cut it out and it wouldn’t affect the film at all. <br /> <br /> In general, you can live without seeing it. This is a good movie, if you watch nothing more. They could definitely leave without continuing, but it is worth the effort. 4/10
