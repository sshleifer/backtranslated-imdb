I just watched this movie last night. Within 30 minutes of the start, I hoped it would end. <br /> <br /> He had a promising start; first 10 minutes. The premise of this film (a friendship that does not go anywhere after spending days (and years) together on “separate” beds in hotel rooms) is simply unbelievable. He kisses her somewhere along the way, and she feels terrible. <br /> <br /> Very few substances to interest. Acting simply does not stand. He is very passive. No matter what part of the movie is shown, the viewer never has any caring connection with the characters on the screen. You will learn that her next statement will be as boring as her previous one. (“Do you have a cigarette?”, He doesn’t smoke, he wants her to quit smoking, doesn’t she know that now?) <br /> <br /> She calls him in the middle of the night to visit him after a year's absence, she enters through the door, they do not even embrace, kiss, express no emotional connection. He doesn't even lean forward to pick up her suitcase to help her in. This is not how real people behave. This is not how the best buddies behave. <br /> <br /> When he gets her phone call in the middle of the night (she’s in the city for one day), he doesn’t show much interest in her face, acting as if she’ll become a burden for the night. At that moment they had known each other for two years, and he had not seen her for a year. Not believable, not real. <br /> <br /> Supposedly, he wrote a book about entropy and enthalpy, but we never see him writing, reading or discussing with him any of his interests in physics, not that she could cope with this discussion. We learn that a watermelon in Los Angeles costs $ 50 (this is not the Silicon type), he has no problem getting this Fruit. We also learn that the airport is closing when several really fake snow flakes are falling from the sky. I'm sorry, but was it in Los Angeles too? <br /> <br /> We never see how these two characters survive, we never see them at work. We never see their struggle, they are always on vacation. They have endless time, they have no worries. <br /> <br /> Good life. Unreal life Unreal characters. Bad name. Bad movie.
