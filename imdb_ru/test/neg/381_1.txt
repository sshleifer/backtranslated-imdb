Mr. Bean is just a bunch of unfunny humor. This is the most superficial comic series in history. Scenes are often disgusting, and terrible canned laughter causes chills through the spine. Mr. Bean is a selfish and rude character, and one can only sympathize with how pitiful he is. It is incredible that such a low-quality series can be held for 5 years. Watching even one episode is a waste of time, and one cannot help expressing disgust and pity for why Rowan portrayed himself as such a two-dimensional, unfunny and funny character. Or pity yourself why you even bothered to watch the episode. Observing this is an aggravating circumstance.
