ATTENTION: This review contains the main SPOILERS. Do not read further if you plan to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Judging by the number of votes received (my vote was fifth), very few know or care who Mimi Lessos is. Well, back in the late 1980s, professional wrestling was pretty decent. A women's federation has opened called the Women's Professional Wrestling Association. It was a great league, and Mimi Lesseau was one of the names on the list. I always thought she was one of the best people in LPWA in terms of ring skills and acting skills. Unfortunately, LPWA closed in the early 90s, so for a person with the same talent as Mimi, it was quite natural to start an acting career, right? But surely there was an alternative to such things? This movie is really bad. Along the way, I continued to compare it with an underestimated film called “Survivor Quest”, but this film lacks everything that made Survivor Quest enjoyable. <br /> <br /> When I started the recording, I went to fast forward through the preview to get to the tape meat. At first I didn’t pay much attention, but then I realized that the preview was for the movie with Mimi Lesseo in the lead role. “Oh,” I thought, “here’s another movie with Mimi to look for.” But when the show continued, I realized that it was a preview of “Beyond Fear!”. You know that you are in trouble when a single preview at the beginning shows the movie you are going to watch! The plot of this thing is pretty standard. Lesseos plays a former kickboxer who lives with a sense of guilt for injuring her opponent / friend, so she focuses on her second career, which she shares with her friend Sammy: to be a guide in the wild. On this particular occasion, she receives a detachment of three pairs. Two pairs are just there to take a seat. You think that one couple, a Caucasian husband and a Korean wife, will be investigated, since a problem appears between them in the middle of the film, but it is ignored in favor of repeated jokes about bears in the forest, which constantly scares the Korean wife. You hear her, but, of course, not the ninth time they do it. The third couple just hurts to look: it consists of Mr. and Mrs. Page. They exchange insults back and forth, and Mr. Page uses his video camera for the art of voyeurism when he is not busy playing cruel jokes on his magnificent wife - like your ordinary American couple! Before the campaign, Mr. Page spies for two stupid guys and their prostitute. One of them accidentally kills a prostitute and learns that Mr. Page has recorded it. So the danger begins, as the two guys track the group on their journey, and we wait ... and wait ... and wait ... and wait until they finally do something. When they do, it's a fiasco. <br /> <br /> Can't blame the actors. They try their best with the material they have to work with. The main culprit is director Robert F. Lyons, who needs to return to the occasional roles and stay away from the director's chair. Lyon starts and stops the scenes in such an inaccurate, sudden matter, that you start to think that he suffered from dyspepsia throughout the filming. There is even one incompetent moment when a wide daytime scene with thugs slips between night scenes. Then there is the sound section. Music and background noise completely suppress the dialogue, so you need to bring your ear directly to the speaker of the TV. Do not hit your head on the screen! Do not hear badly written lines. Speaking of bad writing, Lesseos gets some appreciation there as a coauthor. Several interesting events between the characters are often left for goons or bad jokes. First, Lesseos knocks out the thug with a knife with a blade, so you never thought that he was in danger from two stupid thugs. When the fraudsters finally hit their asss with Lesseos in a well-made and long fight, all our actors laughed together, despite the fact that one of them was shot and bleeds everywhere. Yes, everyone is happy at the end. All but the poor souls who witnessed the film desire the good old glorious days when Mimi performed at the wrestling ring. Zantara Score: 4 out of 10
