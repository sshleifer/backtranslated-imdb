Oh my God! The BBC is not going to be knocked off its pedestal in order to absorb historical dramas with it. I agree that this Jane Austen novel is hard to portray, especially for the modern audience, the heroine is hardly Elizabeth Bennet, even Edmund is not designed to make women’s hearts skip tact. However, I must say that I hoped for the improvement of the latter and was sadly disappointed. The main story was saved, but the dialogue was so changed that everything that was in tone, manner, feeling, wit, depth of Jane Austen was dissolved, if not lost. If some past adaptations can be considered as outdated, then this weakness should be that it is too modern (“his life is one long party” ?????) The choice was needed by someone more restrained, I did not feel the hidden depths under the submissive appearance, she was more like a frisky child. I see that I have to wait for the BBC to weave its magic again.
