Great music, but aren't these people pathetic?!? The real historical play The Trippy Sixties, and she left me depressed. The director draws the wrong side of the jetset life, and he stings like a nest of hornets. If the culture of that time prompted people to these things, it seems to me that this was a journey without discovery, only despair. I tried, really tried, to love this film, but these people are not found anywhere on my page. Yes, it would be nice to see the world, to leave for a while, but I always plan to return BACK. Drugs are not the cause of the downfalls of these characters, is it their lousy relationship ?? these guys are passionately drinking their bowl of poison. They reduce the cost of their lives and, in the end, reduce the price of a journey that is life. Has romance ever been so bleak? <br /> <br /> Greetings: Interesting scenery. Wonderful Pink Floyd Soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Warnings: from. Drugs. Depressing. Carefully unpleasant characters; they are not children of flowers. <br /> <br /> Only for the curious, since most packages lose touch with Pink Floyd. (Rare Floyd tracks, which many have never heard of, because FM is not what it was.) <br /> <br /> Rating: two stars.
