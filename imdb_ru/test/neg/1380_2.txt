I'm a big fan of comedy shows. Racial humor is always a little risky, but great people like George Lopez, Dave Chapelle, Lisa Lampanelli and others do a great job with it. <br /> <br /> They do not go overboard, do not cause discomfort in viewers or * cough * STYLE JESTS! But I will not talk about it. <br /> <br /> Carlos makes racial humor totally unacceptable. His jokes constantly scream about racial humor, in the sense that it is neither funny nor clever, but offensive. I am not one of those who are cold to racial humor. But his performance of these jokes is sloppy, which causes people to recoil in his comedy. <br /> <br /> His humor surpasses only his stage presence in exasperation. I feel as if he is constantly shouting at me! And he runs around the scene like a maniac. This is just annoying!
