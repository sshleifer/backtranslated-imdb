Mmm! is this the worst movie ever? well, for some of the actors it’s embarrassing to see them in such a movie, but hey, if he pays the bills, why not, as for the movie, well. OK, the effects are not so bad for such a cheap movie, the music is again suitable for a cheap movie, the final titles are in order. Lol <br /> <br /> BAD for many to list, but, actors, actors, scenery, scenarios, ending .. what the hell, Drac .......... the worst Drac ever!, many more, but can not be bothered to put them all down. <br /> <br /> The idea was fine, but needed Ten times more budget, more thoughts, much better lighting and style, and all the bad moments I say, however, to see this movie so you can say “What is the FU% $ that all this was "as loans became available. view should only see to see how bad it is.
