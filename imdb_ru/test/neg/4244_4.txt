During the 1950s and in the 60s, 70s and even in the 80s, many war films were shot in the former Yugoslavia, glorifying the heroism of the "partisans" ?? civilians who turned out to lead a partisan war against the invasion of German troops. Hayrudin Krvavats, who is usually known only in Eastern Europe, has shot many such "partisan stories"; unfortunately, only a few of them have ever been exported to the rest of Europe and the USA. The Battle of the Eagles is a rare, low-budget look at the formation and exploits of the partisan air force. <br /> <br /> Marshal Tito decides that the partisan air force must be formed to fight the German Luftwaffe into the sky over Yugoslavia. A group of former pilots joins forces with two small biplanes and begins to raid enemy bases and convoys; over the course of several months, more and more pilots and planes join the ranks, eventually forming formidable air forces. Maybe it's a story, or maybe it's a fable? Whatever it is, it’s certainly not convincing, but actors from great actors will most likely try to make it work. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a successful German air raid on defenseless partisans. Nuts and plot plots converge almost immediately, and for a short time, viewers perceive a rather patriotic series of scenes. Then the action begins, and this title quickly turns into another low-budget adventure with numbers. All the characters are familiar clichés: Major Dragan (played by the benevolent Bekim Fehmiu) is our typical patriotic, heroic leading man. He shoots machine guns and even conducts an air duel with the villainous Clauberg (Radko Polik), an absolutely predictable and trite climax with a no less predictable outcome. The rest of the guerrillas are familiar: Lyubisa Samardzhich (“Battle of Neretva”) - a dawn, desperate playboy; Bata Zhivozhinovich ("Infernal River") - Voss, a veteran pilot who is leaving woodwork now that his country needs him; Rados Bazic (“The Day That Shook the World”) - Dalibor, a young boy envoy, who rises through the ranks and eventually becomes an experienced combat pilot. Characters and their stories are familiar to any fan of war, and Krvavats does not attempt to rely on these stereotypes. Actors cope with their task, and, despite the two-dimensional scenario, each player is fascinating and interesting. Badjic, in particular, has some great moments ?? when he is going to make his first flight as a gunner, and then when he is forced to land on a plane after the pilot is killed. The plot consists only of a series of air raids on the Germans and subsequent retaliatory actions. <br /> <br /> Krvavats correctly processes the sequence of actions, combining real shots and miniature effects. Unfortunately, the miniatures are so cheap and look fake that the transitions between real aerial photography and toy airplanes are sharp and ridiculous. Some scenes of shooting and bombing look shockingly realistic, while air battles involving large-scale models in conjunction with the pilots of the figures are just pitiful. Sometimes the smoke from the "machine guns" is so large that the smoke covers the entire model of the aircraft. Worse, editors often put pictures of fighters on real shots. Although planes are usually in the right perspective, they are surrounded by a distracting light that prevents any attempt at realism. All this action is set by an incredibly familiar and annoying account of Boyan Adamich. <br /> <br /> “Battle of the Eagles” also suffers from a very badly edited English-language release. Let's start with the fact that 28 minutes of footage are missing? cutting the film from 130 minutes to only 102. The missing sections were carelessly cut, and the cutting looks very sloppy. The musical remarks are cut sharply, and the scenes are left before they are decided. In the last third of the film, the story falls apart, and only some of the much-needed fighters may try to save it from incomprehensibility. Then there is dubbing ?? All the scenes revolving around the partisans are duplicated in English (however, rather poorly), but several long scenes remain in German, without the use of subtitles. The film probably would have made much more sense if episodes were cut out in German instead of critical scenes revolving around the partisans. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Krvavac does a good job with shooting outside. It never happens that viewers feel on the sound stage. In particular, the German Luftwaffe bases are extensive, equipped with dozens of Messerschmitt fighters and additions, dressed in leather flying jackets. The landscape is fresh and green, and Krvavats is not afraid to shoot scenes with very wide angles or from afar just to convey the scale of the battle or the long journey. The German ambush of the partisan detachment at the beginning of the picture, as well as the sequence in which Zara and Dalibor escape from the enemy base, stand out. <br /> <br /> As it exists in the home video, “Battle of the Eagles” is just another one of many stories about the Yugoslav partisan movement. Nothing distinguishes it from the rest of the crop, and terrible special effects and radical editing put it at a level below acceptable. Try to avoid this if you cannot find a complete copy.
