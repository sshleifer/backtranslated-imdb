Disney Studios' Snowball Express is not as outdated as some of their works of this era. There are no hippies or hooligans here, just dismal, like dirty water, Dean Jones, who inherited a dilapidated hotel / ski resort from a deceased relative. When Jones and his family enter the sleepy city of Colorado, the people who give them instructions — look like extras from Liberation — have a curious vague attitude towards the hotel (we expect it to look like one-bedroom slums), but in fact the rooms very good. Jones's teenage daughter has a sour expression on her face (which doesn’t stop her from laughing at one of the local yahoos), and, of course, clumsy pop Dean Jones is a standing stone on the slopes, leading to many traps in the slush. Perhaps this square script could benefit from some kind of magical whim, because this script is frozen. * from ****
