One night at McCool's wants you to think that this is a trendy and clever black comedy. He pushes his “bizarre” characters and “outrageous” situations at the viewer, like a crack dealer doing overtime. It is assumed that a woman who mines gold, named Jewel, meets with men to make them steal and sometimes kill, so that she can have all the worldly powers she so desperately desires. You know, it would not be a bad strategy if it pursued the rich guys. This film really wants someone to believe that a scammer would lose time meeting bartenders and Andrew Clay. You are welcome. This major flaw in the Jewel scheme is truly the only entertainment that can be found in this bastard (and this is unintentional). Watching this, it is not difficult to believe that there could be a good film inside it. One night at McCool simply could not decide which direction he wanted to go, so he just sat in the middle of the road like a dead battleship. He tries to be sexy, but the clothes are not taken off the camera, and several scenes with the head of the body are terribly pedestrian. There is one recurring scene where an assassin asks the main character (played by Matt Dillon) about how sex occurs with Jewel. It seems that Matt does not know, just like the audience. Why did he even meet her? One night at Makkul wants to be cheerful too. Sorry, strange coincidences and misunderstandings did not even work in the company of the Three. Worst of all, this film really seemed like a dark atmosphere accompanying his comedy. It seems like the Coen brothers' second-year film, but his small script could not play subtlety, as well as a sledgehammer with a dull direction in no blows. The audience stayed behind the film, which seems to be busy trying to please everyone and just losing attraction along the way.
