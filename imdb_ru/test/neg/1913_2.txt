I shot this movie the other day because I love romantic stories, but this must be the worst thing I've ever seen in my life. I find it hard to believe that Sam will fall in love with Kelly after they have said almost more than two words to each other when she has a great old boy who is completely devoted to her. I thought Kelly was the main idiot throughout the whole movie, and he never changed. The only good thing about the movie was Josh Hartnett. I thought he did an excellent job of acting, and I'm going to start watching more of his films.
