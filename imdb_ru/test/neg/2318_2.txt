Although I'm sure the idea looked good on paper and I liked it when I first heard about it, this film often breaks and falls, and when I watch it, I just want it to end. The beginning and end of the film that Lou has to babysit a troublemaker is, at best, thought up, although I think the role of the high cop is ridiculous. However, I found a little laugh at the bottom of the trunk script, which was compiled for these two great comedians. I thought it was a mistake to put them in a musical, and it smells of “Wizard of Oz” plagiarism (with songs and black and white in color). I would not recommend this film to anyone except loyal A & C fans. Everyone else will be disappointed and they will have many better films.
