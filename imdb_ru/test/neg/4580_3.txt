Just watched the movie tonight in the preview, and this film is only for children. It doesn’t improve or add the original Disney movie. Everywhere there is a banal Scottish stylistic style, not supported by a weak letter (where motives are mixed with cunning) and an uneven and often unattractive act (despite the fact that it sounds like a decent cast). I have no problem with a tiny dog ​​- although there is a certain quality in the "Kangaroo Bush Bushie" in his pictures (see below). <br /> <br /> * For those who do not know, Skippy was an Australian children's series of the 1960s, where kangaroo would be an integral part of all the stories. They say that in order for poor old Skippy to "act", they attached a rubber band around his face, which he then tried to trim with his paws - sort of like talking to human actors !!! Bobby has the same range, and you just don’t buy him a series of heroic rescue. <br /> <br /> I advise you to take children aged 8 to 12 years. Below that, they may be scared. In addition, if they or you love it, good luck to you, but this is a strictly cut out of cardboard for making undemanding films. This is a missed opportunity, since in the history of Bobby there is real pathos and wit, and this film cannot show it.
