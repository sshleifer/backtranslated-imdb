Kidman and Law lack the chemistry to make this carelessly directed, poorly written melody / melodrama work at any level except grandeur. Kidman is fooling around and sucks sadly for his absent lover Lowe. She had just met him when he left to fight for the south in the Civil War, and they exchanged only about 5 sentences and one kiss, but they were completely amazed. It seems that the main activity of the law is "to look empty and shocked, but sensitive." Renee Zellweger is the only spark in this grim scenario, but she plays him too widely and excessively, as if she acted in an Annie Get a Gun. Yeah-hh, boy, hello! Something in her character was more like the sketch of Monty Python - the one from the “Holy Grail”, where the peasants spend time without any reason, lying in the mud, making dirty cakes. Kidman is smart enough actress not to interfere with her when she can. Their scenes are like comics hidden in a Victorian-era novel. <br /> <br /> Whenever the action gets bogged down in full boredom, which often happens, all the writers do are shouting: “Serve Simon’s legion-style villain!” its incredibly vile actions, such as killing and torturing innocent god-fearing citizens in the name of loyalty to the quickly disappearing confederation <br /> <br />. All the rest of the time he disappears in battle, which is ridiculous even in this scenario of cornball. There are many other talented actors who give decent performances in small roles. These characters meet Lo during his campaign of Johnny Apple seed from the front line, where he deserted, to the hopeful loving embrace of Kidman in Cold Mountain. Ultimately, none of these characters matter. The law has no time for them or for their life. Each of these small mini-films has the same weary theme: war is a damn cool war, and turns a generally decent Christian people into rabid animals. <br /> <br /> And the script is too predictable, too cruel, Moreover, the pace of history is terribly slow. You spend the whole movie waiting for the inevitable reunion of Romeo and Juliet, when Kidman wring his hands and sighs, Law overcomes incredible chances and dodges bullets. And when it finally comes, you don’t care. You will look at your watch, wondering how much more of this cotton you must endure. <br /> <br /> I give them one star out of five for battle scenes. There is a strong anti-war message here. The incredible lack of concern for the deaths of generals on both sides of the conflict is a powerful thing. But this is only about 15 minutes of this 150-minute dog.
