The first twenty-five minutes stand out as perhaps the worst in a modern British film. Director / adapter William Kartlidj willed the original Wilde with such respect that, it seems, he completely ignored the needs of the cinematic audience. Fortunately, the quality of direction and editing improves significantly in the first half hour, but by then the damage has already been done. Of the actors, Prunella Scales and Robert Hardy wipe the floor with the rest of the actors every time they are on the screen. The other exceptions are Arthur Jonathan Firth and Mabel Karen Haley, who are given enough breadth to convey their lines with a true comic meaning that Wilde intended. Ostensibly the presenters, James Wilby and Trevine McDowell, are dull and wooden in comparison. In an obvious attempt to lure every penny out of a tight budget, the performance was nominally updated until the 1990s, but in combination with the original script, the effect is more like a bad television drama script from the 1970s. Real comedic episodes are rare, but when they appear, they are very funny - perhaps a sign that more intelligent trimming of the rest of the piece could lead to a more dynamic, more even film.
