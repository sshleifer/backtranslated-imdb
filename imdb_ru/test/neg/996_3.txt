The black and white satire of Madison Avenue advertising agency turned to black. They are headed by Putney Swap (Arnold Johnson), who is determined to change something. However, he is even Worse than his white predecessors. It is as original as possible. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m sure that it was considered courageous and shocking in 1969, but today it seems silly. The jokes are either unfunny (the president is a dwarf. How is it funny?), Cruel or obvious, and the film is full of unattractive characters. This is done in a very experimental way, which makes it even harder to take ... or understand. The film is becoming more bizarre and surreal. The ending comes from nowhere. Worse, with the only exception of Johnson, ALL the acting is bad. Antonio Fargas (standing in these types of films) is especially annoying as an Arab. It gets three stars because commercial parodies (made in bright color) are fun, and there is a rare good line here and there. I heard that this is a cult classic, but it's more interesting than good. Skip this ... if you are not in the experimental films of the 1960s.
