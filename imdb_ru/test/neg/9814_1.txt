I saw this film about 8 years ago, when it just came out, and I only have memories: 1. It was awful. 2. That in one of the scenes of Linnei Quigley he applies tanning lotion on his hands and feet several times in a row for 15 minutes in a row (in any case, it seemed like a long time) 3. One scene where the character is driven into a sledgehammer in his head. In this scene, when the hammer connects, the head breaks like glass. This is pretty bad.
