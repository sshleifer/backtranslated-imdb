I do not know what happened to director Abel Ferrara. After the remake of "Body Snatchers," he seems to have lost it. "The King of New York" and "Bad Lieutenant" remain the two best films of the 90s: the burning indictments of the decade went wrong. With films like “R Xmas” (whatever that means) and “New Rose Hotel,” he seems determined to be disgusted and weary for his former supporters. In this film, no life. While he gets great performances from his actors in all his projects, the result of this confusion of ideas is simply not jealous. Whatever the point — that the new generation of drug dealers is more or less the same as any other New Yawkuh upper middle class — is lost in a daze and boring direction. <br /> <br /> I saw this premiere in 4-plex in downtown Los Angeles. In the lobby, when I bought tickets, I was surprised and delighted to see it filled with a large, racially mixed group of men and women. their twenties and thirties. Then they started to the theater, but it was a theater that showed “8 miles”, not “R Xmas”! The theater, which showed “R Xmas” (keep in mind, it was the premiere!), It was watched by a total of 4 people, myself, my wife and two more! <br /> <br /> Way, Abel! <br /> <br /> 2/10
