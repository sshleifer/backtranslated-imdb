This is 1 hour 24 minutes of pure boredom! <br /> <br /> In this action movie, even the gun that Baldwin uses (HK G3A3) sucks. It was sent for processing by armed forces around the world in the mid-eighties and is now used only by terrorists, bank robbers and military museums. <br /> <br /> If I knew that this film was bad, I would rather watch 10 episodes of MacGyver saving the planet. <br /> <br /> No groove, no drive and no sensation. Watch the channel Tupperware ?? it's more exciting than sorry for the movie. This film does not deserve 0 on the scale. Good luck next time, Baldwin. Until then, I will sit here to watch my toenails grow ?? is it much more exciting than the “goal” ??
