Have you ever tried some food that your friend cooked, and then said to yourself: “Wow, this is not a very good mixture”? Well, that's how I felt after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Many viewers will be very embarrassed by this strange mixture of crimes and a very, very banal comedy. It's almost like watching Mr. Rogers playing a ruthless gangster, very strange. Some things just don't mix, and this film clearly proves it. <br /> <br /> There are some very good performances here, as Dean Stockwell, Mercedes Ruhle and Alec Baldwin are all excellent, but this does not happen because of the lack of balance and symmetry in the film. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Demme did a great job on films like The Silence of the Lambs and Philadelphia, but he doesn't seem to be able to handle it.
