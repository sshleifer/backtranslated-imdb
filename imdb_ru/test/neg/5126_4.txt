When I first watched this film in the 80s, I really liked it. I was completely fascinated by music, dancing ... everything. However, I recently watched it all on DVD again, and I was completely amazed at how incredibly stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a lot of crap - and how awful the dances were. I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER fall into this ballet repertoire ... It was all pretty pathetic. The nature of the development also lacks depth. I think it was a product of the 80s: the film does not stand today!
