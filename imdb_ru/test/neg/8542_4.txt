Jess Franco makes films about exploitation, and he shot them in tons. Franco is responsible for some of the most shocking films in film history, and God bless him for that. Unfortunately, Kilominjaro's Diamonds is a truly horrible film that does not meet its usual standards. <br /> <br /> Films on exploitation should be judged by history, sex and blood. What else is there? This film does not match most of these landmarks. The plot is very thin, and in the jungle among the cannibals sits a young girl. We really do not get information about why she and her father were there in the first place. As expected, her father is the “Big White Leader,” and she becomes a goddess, sitting naked in the trees. Add luck hunters and precious stones, and you will have the main salvation for the girl because of the greedy intentions of the storyline. The characters are ordinary, without adding a single gram of likelihood to the process. <br /> <br /> Gore? No, or at least very little. This film is often mentioned in the same vein as classic Italian cannibal films. Those who seek this type of blood must go a different way. With the exception of one cheap movie, there is surprisingly little blood and courage in this movie. <br /> <br /> As far as I can tell, the only reason this film exists is that Katya Bienert, Alien Mess and Marie Carmen Nieto could run around naked. In fact, Lita ) performs full frontal weightlifting, while two ladies in the jungle are naked all over their body. Yes, there are love scenes ... probably the most barren Franco has ever watched. Women are beautiful, but there is nothing here that could make this movie a classic erotic. <br /> <br /> This movie just smells like a low-budget buffoonery. The sets are ridiculous. The game is terrible, and editing is confusing. There is no real story to tie it together, and not enough budget (or effort) to shock or shock. I think that fans of Franco are accustomed to expect more from the master of exploitation.
