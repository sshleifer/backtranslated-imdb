Tense and devoid of humor (especially in light of his rather dubious psychology), but well planned and comfortably sharp, this film of graceful body counting underlines the unusually hypnotic presence of Angharad Reese as a young woman periodically obsessed with Jack the Ripper, which allows unpleasant effects of blood among Edwardian relevance. These are all fairly standard things for Hummer, but they are processed with a large amount of visual approach, even if the central relationship between the psychoanalyst Porter and Rice triggers the narration, without being satisfactorily explained.
