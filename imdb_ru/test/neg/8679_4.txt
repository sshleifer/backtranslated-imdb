In this movie with great movies, it tells about secrets and how friends use each other. Henry May Long is a very well functioning, dimly lit, depressing piece of the turn of the century about friendship between a terminally ill person and a melancholic debtor addict. Conversations in the hospitable lounge are not my cup of tea, but all crying is getting thinner. It is recommended if you like the independent, ingenious intelligent slow functions of the ivory type merchant. <br /> <br /> I suspected that the main characters were in love, but their connection was so close that it really did not have an emotional impact on Brokeback Mountain. It has a good essay with a scene that discusses how to disappear in life, but this is really a dark and depressing film.
