Well, this film is really "RECYCLED", haha. This is kind of like the attitude of this movie. The plot is just a copy of “Pulp Fiction”, well, this is acceptable, but make this piece if “PLUMP” (ha-ha)! this is really incredible. The storyline is so pathetic, and all this gathered only a few laughter. He tried to make a few jokes from various other films, and in most cases it failed. I mean, I have a sense of humor, but really this is not the way to laugh. Most of the supposedly “funny” moments are completely ironic. The film is quite quiet and lasts about 75 minutes. They could have done a much more fun job; it would seem they made fun of the blockbuster, they gamble, and hey! I think they lost! <br /> <br /> By and large, “PLUMP Fiction” is “PLUMPABLE”, but you won’t collect anything at all! <br /> <br /> Worth watching again and again? In fact, it is more than enough! <br /> <br /> So is it worth renting? Hmmm ... As I said, this is "SWITCHING", but you only get a few "FLAME" out of it! <br /> <br /> Overall from 10: 4 out of 10!
