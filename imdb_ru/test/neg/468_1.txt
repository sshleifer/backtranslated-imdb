What a waste of the film: the film industry does not believe in creating a film that could be just a person’s ideas. There is practically nothing in his theories or evolution, instead the most boring story of family life and relationships with one daughter, the difficult scenario, the great freedoms taken with Darwin’s life, the dialogue given to his character, and I find it hard to believe that he would have voiced never renounced his belief in a higher power, he may not quite correctly believe in the well-established Christian idea of ​​God, but was not an atheist. which implies this film. what would be an exciting and much better film would be if they began with the publication On the Origin of Species and created the story of a great revolution that took place and an amazing set of characters involved from all sides. instead, we got a wacky, boring drama, mostly fictional, big injustice
