Stay away from this. The worst is a horrible story. It seems that there is an intention to convey some kind of subtle spiritual / love / friendly message, but it is so pathetically deprived of any substance that you cannot but eat. In addition, much of the screen time is far below the standard story of thieves, criminals, and our heroes dealing with some time travel artifacts. I know that you run into problems when faced with time, but the story is full of holes than usual. You also have: cheap sets, a bad game and some of the worst musical arrangements in the history of movies, incredible, cheap, sharp and scattered. All I can say is "Man is alive! This film is bad!"
