It's hard to write 10 lines of text about this average movie. There simply is not much to say about it. This is not memorable enough to add to your collection, and I have quite a few noirs. <br /> <br /> Paul Henrade plays a tough guy here. I think he is not the one who plays such a role, but he is fine. In any case, he is a good actor. <br /> <br /> Everything, including cinematography, is good, but not remembered. One thing that stood out: a sudden ending. This was a surprise. It was also unexpected to see this under the heading "Hollow Triumph." I have never seen a movie with that name. He was always called the "scar". <br /> <br /> If you read about “tense film noir”, etc., do not believe this. "Stressful" is not the exact adjective for this film.
