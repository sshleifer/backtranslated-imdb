Advertising this film suggests that it is shocking and sensational. Well, we, lovers of opera, see some strange sights in opera houses, so we are not shocked by the fact that Duke Mantua urinates during his reprise “La Donna è Mobile”, and it’s not sensational to see Gilda singing Caro Nome in the bathroom. It's just rude and boring. What stands out in this film is the lack of imagination. Director Corina Van Eyck sets the palace of the duke in a dirty pool. In fact, he is not a duke, he is just a character named Duca, so it’s hard to understand why he has many henchmen and his own jester, Rigoletto. Rigoletto lives in a municipal apartment, which is equipped with an orange sofa and decorated with speckled wallpaper, which is a de-riger among avant-garde directors. Dukes, I'm sorry, heavy dukes ride scooters (Yawn). <br /> <br /> Concepts imposed on such an opera can lead to unexpected and unintended humor. What can we do from the fact that Gilda has a maid, although she lives in the council apartment? When the bell rings that Monterone is imprisoned, we see two ministers in pink shorts being dragged from the pool. Someone thinks that he will be charged with urinating in a public pool. <br /> <br /> Opera films were common for lips 20 years ago, but today there is simply no excuse for this. Duplicated opera as soft porn. You do not believe in what is happening, because the performers do not make enough effort. The actress in the role of Gilda does not seem to have learned her lines properly. She barely moves her lips when she has to sing. When she sings Caro Nome in the bathroom, she lay on her back with her legs slightly apart. It is hard to say from which hole the sound should come. Duke, later restricts it, singing, participating in cunnilingus with Maddalena, giving a new meaning to the phrase iodization in the canyon. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere of sound never seems to be right when the orchestra sometimes sounds like it is being played through a transistor radio. A rather slow pace of bumps and darkness is preferred, so the overall effect of karaoke is in your local pub. <br /> <br /> This is a movie made by Opera Spanga. Spanga is a village in Friesland in the Netherlands. They usually perform in a tent in the field. If I watched this performance in a tent on a field in Friesland, I would be quite indulgent. By removing this production and giving it to a global audience, villagers are also open to ridicule throughout the world.
