Dear readers, <br /> <br /> I discovered in my research films that when Michael Bay shoots the film, people pan around him and hate him, but they still watch him, and he earns about 100 million dollars. , What for? Because Michael Bay is one of the top five directors of all time. Standing next to Ridley Scott, Spielberg, Kubrick and Miyazaki, Michael Bay has established himself as the best Hollywood director of action and adventure. This moment is confirmed by his most pan-motioned film, Armageddon. <br /> <br /> An asteroid the size of Texas is racing towards the planet, and the only way NASA can come up with it is to put a group of people on an asteroid, drill it to the depth, and put the nuclear warhead inside, then blow up the asteroid. Only one person is qualified enough to do this: Bruce Willis. Willis portrays Harry Stamper, a gray-haired hardened-oil driller trying to preserve what is left of his family. Not helping this fact is his daughter Grace (Liv Tyler), having an affair with his best driller AJ (Ben Affleck). Hired by Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton), head of NASA, Stamper and his team of drillers, training to become astronauts and save the world. <br /> <br /> Armageddon is a two-part film. First there are funny parts where we meet with a gang and wacky teems with. Then they get into space, and the whole comedy is sucked out of the window and replaced with breathtaking special effects, cool music and a great serious game. In the second part, Murphy's law goes crazy, meaning that everything that can go wrong is actually wrong, increasing the tension of the film to outstanding levels. <br /> <br /> With a cool actor and a team (Michael Bay as a director, Jerry Bruckheimer and Gail Ann Hurd as producers, and JJ Abrams as one of the writers.), tons of special effects, great humor, amazing music , plus an introduction made by Mr. Ben-Hur himself, Charlton Heston, Armageddon is a frenzied time. <br /> <br /> Signature, regular DVD collector, Matt MacLeod <br /> <br /> Warnings for parents: this is not a film for children. The F-bomb is used several times, many other curses are also used, plus there is a strip bar scene, and the extremely intense second part may be too complicated for a child.
