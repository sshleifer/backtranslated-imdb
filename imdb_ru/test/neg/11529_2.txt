Well, I went with a few friends to watch this movie, we went an hour before the show started getting good spots. So, as you can imagine, we looked forward to seeing this movie :). But this excitement soon turned into horror, this film is a complete failure, he just tries to be funny, that he is sad, the script is poorly written and relies on actors to make up for it ... <br /> <br /> The only good role in everything The film was by Stefan S. Schaefer, who was great, the plot was weak, and even the “funny” scenes seemed forced and unnatural, given that the main actors are some of Iceland’s best comedians. this is very special ... <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this film to anyone, because it is very complex and never brings results.
