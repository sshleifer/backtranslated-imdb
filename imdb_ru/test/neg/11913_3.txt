True, I'm not a fan of films with Chan's monogram. The plot associated with the theft of radium from a bank vault is a bit far-fetched and far from the atmospheric mysteries Fox created. Mantan Morland and Benson Fong (like Tommy's No. 3 son) laugh as usual. But otherwise there is not much. A great name that is wasted.
