In another unsuccessful attempt to make a quick Hollywood contribution to one of the greatest masterpieces of television, Peter Seagal created the monster. Out of context, if someone didn’t know Brooks’s work before watching, the film would be a brave big budget film that isn’t sure if he wants to be a fat joke and stupid comedy, or just an ordinary fighter who has nothing to move on. However, as the younger generation of Y'er, which recently spent two months obsessed with the five seasons of the 60s TV show “Get Smart,” this film tormented me from the very moment I entered and saw how Steve Carell was stunned. Background: Agent 99 receives plastic surgery, and 86 - the analyst, who was previously obese, is ashamed of the complexity of the original duo and draws their boring reassessment. It seems that the writers, who cannot be really funny either in dialogue or in a situation, have resorted to the unfortunate settings of Don Adams' famous lines, memories of a thick camp, references to the role of Carell in the office in the views they have, and female chauvinism that falls right on his face. <br /> <br /> For those who saw the original, the authors of this film thought that they would have some memories. They mention Herbie, Fang (now the useless tiny fluffy dog ​​that Carell craves), the shoe phone, the cone of silence, his classic red car and doors, and the phone that introduced the show. Classical music has returned, but now everything is updated, as a rule, for the worse. The cone of silence is now some kind of strange blue telekinetic force field, the headquarters of the headquarters is located directly under the museum that stores the past of the Control. The film lacks any creative random technology, and it replaces the crossbows in Swiss army knives. A lot of “humor” in the film is that Carrell hurts herself, or another character who is hurt, whether Carrell spends two minutes to accidentally shoot himself with a crossbow, or punch guards, or toss at airplanes. In the original, Smart insulted a big enemy, unsuccessfully attacked him and tried to make friends with him before crushing. In this, he attacks without success and gets hit. It seems that the writers did not understand that humor was based on dialogue, and not on senseless violence. As if they took the names from the show and cut out everything that made him good in the first place. <br /> <br /> The poster hides Karella’s face, not Hathaway’s face. The film also avoids anything that can make it good. They intertwine classical music with overly dramatic action and romantic music in high budget films. Whereas the original, fueled by an obscene feeling, this one replaces the quality with huge doses of cgi explosions and sound effects pow. I was really looking forward to it, since I finished the original series just two months ago, and she entered my top five shows of all time. However, it was a huge disappointment. The authors say that they collaborated with Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, but in everything I read on the Internet, they were largely excluded from the writing process. In conclusion, if you want to spend your money on a refund with a small cost and without respect for its namesake, do it. But be prepared that the trip is not how you remember it. <br /> <br /> PS: I almost forgot George Bush's humor. They mention “Nuculor”, fall asleep in the visual arts, the president works for their vice president, and highly value solutions to solve real problems. If you like the same jokes that you heard 3-4 years ago in the form of a movie with a large budget, leave your money here.
