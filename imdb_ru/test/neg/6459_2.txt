This film was recommended to me by one of my friends who shot the film, and therefore was expecting something good. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with the first half - oh, a movie about a weakling taking revenge on their ** boss, as originally - and watching the second half on fast-forwarding in hopes of finding something that would justify 45 . But all I got was the ending of “shock” ... <br /> <br /> The main problem is that this is a film that seems unable to decide what he wants to say and says what he is saying (difficult say what it is) bad. A great acting game doesn’t save a bad script full of characters I don’t care about. <br /> <br /> Now, maybe, if I were not the moonlight in the film industry, I would be shocked to find a silly policy and exploitation going on behind the screen, but my feelings are also summarized above: “Ho Hum” <br /> <br /> 2/10 ... it would have been 1/10 if it were not for acting skills and cutting from the stage.
