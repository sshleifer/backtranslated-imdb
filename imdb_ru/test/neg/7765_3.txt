All my friends and other colleagues think that this show is very cool. At first I hate this show !!!!!!! I think I can be the only woman alive !!! I only watched him because my best friend loves him and considers herself the heroine of Charlotte! <br /> <br /> Firstly, the whole plot (if you can call it that) is four women - Samantha Super Slut (Kim Cattrall), who most likely has all STDs and mossy, brown and green genitals, given that she has three sex (she will try something). <br /> <br /> Samantha is not like most 40 women even in New York, but there would be no entertainment with the show, since Samantha (along with some nice New York landscapes) is the only reason to watch and this is not enough reason. <br /> <br /> Charlotte (Kristen Davis) is a well-dressed high-class idiot from New York who still believes in the Pinsa myth! No matter how cute and sweet she is, do not let this fool you, it spreads quite often. <br /> <br /> Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is now this stereotypically evil woman, feminist bucha. I think that in one episode she is considered a lesbian, but apparently not ... What a shame that she is almost interesting. <br /> <br /> Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is the most annoying character. I swear it seemed to me that I was watching the frontman of Twisted Sister, a more courageous-looking, disguised boy, brother! This girl is looking for, can not live without your love .... I heard about a puppy? <br /> <br /> This show is stupid, and I love to laugh at it, because I hear about how it is some kind of new awakening for women. It's just sad if you want to watch how depraved, pathetic, addictive people value clothes too much, drink cosmopolitans and sound like an annoying 15-year-old teenager on cocaine, what a show for you .......... . Just use protection.
