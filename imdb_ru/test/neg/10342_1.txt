Far from combining the best bits of Pontipul and 28 days, it was possible to ignore them. While shamelessly copying them. (if that makes sense?) Pontipool was different and was becoming more tense, it just stinks. Radio DJ, "we must stay on the air," actually does not spend time on the air. He sits at the bottom and watches TV for news. This is by far the worst excuse for a zombie movie. Is there one person in the US or in the world who doesn't know what a zombie is? Or ever heard of the word "zombie"? Well, by the 50th minute this bunch of losers still call zombies "infected" or those with "rabies". The word "zombie" may appear at a party later, I do not care where you have to pay to use certain words? As Bluetooth headphones are called "ear piece", I'm not kidding! performed robbery.
