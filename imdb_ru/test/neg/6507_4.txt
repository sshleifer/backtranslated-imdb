This (presumably) plot-based television film based on real events tells about a woman who escaped from the FBI, and about * seriously * stupid guy. <br /> <br /> First, we have Roger Paulson (Tim Matheson), the type of “regular guy” with a mind-blowing job, an ex-wife, a child whom he is unlikely to ever see, and several cats. <br /> <br /> Next, there is “Elaine-Lisa,” call her "(Tracy Pollan), an intelligent, sexy, beautiful woman whose language will break out if she ever tells the truth. <br /> <br / > Roger and Lisa meet when she responds to the announcement of lonely hearts. Roger is one of these poor things who can't seem to cope with life alone, so after his wife left him, he places his ad. <Br /> <br /> Roger doesn’t take long to realize that Lisa is not a good person, but he doesn’t know how to get rid of her. t sufficient reason to change the locks on the door of his apartment after he expel her. <br /> <br /> Go ahead and look at it, if you have nothing else to do. <br /> <br />
