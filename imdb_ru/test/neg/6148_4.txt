My general opinion about this film is that it was a slow, protracted, unstructured wandering around some of the really unfortunate situations with a small amount of redemption and an obvious message. The film consists mainly of rather uninteresting videos of the countries that he visits with poor reconstructions, all slowly to the cochlea and imposed by depressing music. Of course, some materials and interviews contain some convincing stories, but unlike what the description on the back suggests, it’s not so much the story of the victim that is told as the director Mr. Ripper’s story, and he doesn’t tell it well. This film could include longer, better interviews with the people themselves, allowing them to tell their stories. Instead, Mr. Ripper indulgently pulls the story to himself, making it a kind of personal journey, and, unfortunately, in the end he is not one of them. I have never had the sensation of any growth when he examines a subject, and he never indicates what attracted his attention in the first place. He just drags us from one place to another, slightly combing the situation and characters, hangs around, revealing too many imperceptible slow-motion shots of people just walking the streets, and then moves on to the next destination. He does it again and again and again without any real development. I felt that this film could be reduced to 45 minutes, but it dragged on to 2 devastatingly slow hours. We feel morally obligated to take care of this topic, but a self-satisfied, tortuous, not inspired director’s delivery makes you numb after a while.
