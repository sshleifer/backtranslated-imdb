One of the worst films I saw in 2009: The story hovered between a stupid thriller or a dumb comedy. <br /> <br /> As nothing happens, the void is filled with long, boring dialogs that don't make sense! <br /> <br /> The cast is famous, but causes no emotion except to rewind the game forward! <br /> <br /> And it happens in a posh seaside hotel that looks very gloomy. For comparison, one of the "Shining" is a fair! <br /> <br /> Note: many people believe that it is located on the French Riviera! They are wrong! This is not the south of France (Nice, Cannes), but quite the opposite: Cabourg and Normandy, to be simple D-Day beaches! That is why the sea is gray as the sky and there is no sun!
