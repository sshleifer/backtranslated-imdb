Six students of the monastery are doing an incredible thing - they kill a nun who was imperious. Now, eighteen years later, the spirit of the nun returns and avenges her murder. <br /> <br /> Yes, basically it is not. That's not all, but I still have no idea what it is. The only really cool thing is the influence on the spiritual nun, since I was very impressed with the fact that it was a more budget film. I am also confused as to whether it is in English or not. Most of the actors are Italians, and even the name is in Italian, but they spoke English in the film (I think, or it could be duplicated, I still can't say). <br /> <br /> In any case, the real premise of the film is rather idiotic, and the final not only does not make sense, but ... well ... it does not make sense.
