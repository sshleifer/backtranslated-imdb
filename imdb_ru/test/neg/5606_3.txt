This film was really bad. I mean really very bad. The scenes were as if from a parody, and the special effect sucked a lot. And it was filmed in 2003 !!! I think it was a waste of time and money, and Michael Shanks with his image of “Shaggy from Scooby Doo” just made me laugh. Never waste your time on this picture ... I really do not know what the director was thinking about when he saw the final version of this film, but the fights were so unreal that it was painful for me to look at them. The fighters of the "latex female cats" looked like sheep, who simply rode around the scenes and looked around fearfully, as if they had no idea what to do on the stage ... I think this is a great example of Bottom 100.
