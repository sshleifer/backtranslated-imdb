“The Duke” is a film based in the heart of the British aristocracy, where the old Duke (John Neville) dies to avoid his big property and tremendous wealth to be taken from him after his death by two insidious aristocrats (Oliver Myurhead and Sophie Heiman); he passes his duchy to his dog. The Dog's Best Friend, an American girl named Charlotte (played by Courtney Draper), whose parents die, becomes an orphan from the former duke because he is her great uncle. A young chef comes by the name Florian, with him and Charlotte, instantly connecting, creating a romantic plot that in its own way acts as the main tone of the main storyline, which is the work of Hubert, "Duke" and his many actions and love interests others dogs This is followed by James Douhan, who plays Butler, who is determined to try to serve his old duke, doing his best to serve his new owner, Hubert. Doohan acts like an old character there to calm and advise the younger ones, while he scans and performs various ridiculous tasks under his new master. A wonderful comedy performance, mixed with elements of drama, completes the career of a beautiful and influential actor. <br /> <br /> Although from a technical point of view I don’t like this film, I only watched it after I learned about the role of James Dohan. Although the plot is good, the elements of writing and directing should be hidden. Ignoring the absurdity of the “Duke the Doggie”, I personally do not like the excessive use of comedic and outrageous jokes about the “bad” characters because of their absurdity. Dependence on hygiene related to humor, as you like, is too obvious, and the general nonsense of many characters I do not like. Directed by Phillip Spink too often uses medium-long shots with superimposed voice or influence on the overall sound quality. In addition, the acting of Myrhead and Heiman, although good in dramatic and romantic episodes, does not sharply meet the general requirements for the role. <br /> <br /> But being a mature movie fan, it's easy for me to be too critical of a simple family movie to make you laugh. I can admit that I found some pieces funny, and other pieces relate to the plot, which may be contrived, but has certain connections. I do not recommend this movie to mature movie lovers, but I highly recommend it to dog lovers, families who want to enjoy a funny movie for their child, and James Dohan fans who want to see Scotty in his last role.
