I found the movie in my local video store, and I was surprised to see it on DVD. I heard about sexually explicit scenes, horrible violence and notorious debauchery. I sat and watched, and I began to laugh! The set decorations and art direction were cheap and fake; nudity was sardonic and incredibly nonsexual; the story was poorly written, and it was just a parade of incredibly beautiful and talented actors taken hostage to quote the worst dialogue ever written! The incestuous relationship between Kaligola (Malcolm McDowell) and his serenely beautiful sister Drusilla (Teresa Anne Savoy, a vulnerable beauty) cannot be taken seriously ... it does not even shock and repel! Peter O'Toole and John Galegood, obviously, were hostages during the creation of this film, fortunately, they die in the first thirty minutes of the film. Cinematography was a joke, and I was even more surprised when they used a quote from the Bible! Book Mark is not less. If you are looking for shock value, this movie will disappoint you. If you are looking for the value of a camp cult, you will be even more disappointed. I know that was. I have seen shock, and these are two hours of your life that you will never return.
