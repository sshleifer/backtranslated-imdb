Woody Allen (to whom I must admit from the very beginning, to whom I have never been a big fan) made this quasi-documentary film about the life of Emmett Ray (Shawn Penn), a jazz guitarist of the 1930s, whose star seems to have been lost for some time . Penn does a credible job in this role, portraying a complex and somewhat neurotic person (not like Allen himself, which may explain why Woody will be involved in this project) who cannot maintain relationships and whose close passions (except playing guitar)) they shot at rats at the dump and watched the trains. <br /> <br /> There is no big sequence in this story. In a sense, he is told by a number of modern jazz "experts" (one of whom is Allen himself), who talk about their various theories and interpretations of various events in Ray's life. The end result is a highly controversial account of the life of a fictional person, to whom, it seems, his creators gave a rather interesting life story, which probably should have done better. <br /> <br /> Jazz fans and Woody Allen fans will surely enjoy this. As for me? The best I can give is 3/10.
