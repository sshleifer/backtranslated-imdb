Since “8 heads in a duffel bag” and a “How high” preview <br /> <br /> I have so little laughed at something that the filmmakers considered <br /> <br /> hysterical. <br /> Jerry Lewis is the richest person in the world. The army rejects it as 4-F <br /> <br /> and decides to use its money to raise its own army - <br /> <br /> about half a dozen. Then he pretends to be the Nazi commander in Italy and eventually tries to kill Hitler. Here is a description of the plot <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> This movie is as funny as a heart attack. This movie makes Hogan's Heroes look like Shakespeare. If people from "Producers <br /> <br />" really wanted to lose their money, they should have shown this movie <br /> <br />. I can not stress how bad it is. <br /> <br /> Lewis’s referral consists of two different cameras that shoot <br /> <br /> action from two different angles and then edited together. This comedy series <br /> <br /> works on television, but here it is a clear attempt to deceive the audience. He finishes most of his scenes with a fixed frame <br /> <br />, as if giving the viewer a chance to double the stitches before going to the next tired setting. I spent most of the movie <br /> <br /> twice in abdominal agony, followed by <br /> <br /> strong flatulence due to this thing. <br /> <br /> Lewis, director and producer makes the film in 1943, but makes no attempt to use costumes or decorations. Everyone wears the latest style <br /> <br /> and has the most modern interior design ... of the 1970s. The supporting cast is lost when Lewis moves away from his patented tangents, <br /> <br />, which last as long as a serious operation, and just as painful for <br /> <br /> observation. When Lewis becomes a Nazi commander, he spends the last half of the film screaming at the top of his lungs in a performance <br /> <br /> that is odious enough that it suppresses any goodwill you are trying to enter <br /> <br /> at the beginning. <br /> <br /> In the latest embarrassing shot, Lewis and his henchmen are trying to <br /> <br /> strike at the Japanese. They wear their teeth, squint their eyes <br /> <br /> and talk with a “funny” accent. This may be one of the most egregious racist events since the days of internment camps. I was <br /> <br /> weakened by the jaw of what Lewis did through all this, but it confused me. Look at the very tasteless scene of Kay Ballard, in which <br /> <br /> she tries again and again to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> George Takei has two small scenes in Star Trek and then wisely <br /> falls out of the picture. This causes less laughter than the last three Mel Brooks films put together. There is nothing more sad than watching a <br /> <br /> earlier respected comedian spoil a project so badly that you <br /> <br /> are really ashamed of them. Jim Carrey found out about it with “Majestic <br /> <br />,” but Jerry Lewis still appears on television once in <br /> <br /> while simultaneously filming the same unfunny knock. I feel sorry for him. <br /> <br /> "What is the way to the front?" it's cheap, unfriendly, insulting and stupid. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for everyone who is involved in this, and for all who should tolerate it. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this. <br /> <br /> Despite the rating (G), it contains physical abuse, some weapons <br /> <br /> and some situations for adults. If your child is interested in seeing this, seek professional help. <br /> <br />
