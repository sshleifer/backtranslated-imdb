Lisa Grant (Adrienne Barbo) is a real estate agent who risks being killed by an abnormal maniac who kills people in her profession who, in his opinion, make housing prices too high. As for the motives, it's damn backward. Liza's boyfriend, it turns out, the talk show host, whom the killer continues to call on the air. At first I was sure that it was supposed to be a comedy or satire, but as the endless buzz continued and continued, I realized that it was not, and the film was simply extremely incompetent in all respects, forms and forms. I'm just surprised that something so terrible was not directed by Jeff Lieberman. caught fire and it all started here. <br /> <br /> My rating: F <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Movie channel
