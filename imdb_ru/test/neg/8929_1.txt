3 months have passed, and you know what it means ... A new film about Seagal. Seagal really starred in a horrible movie after a horrible movie. Every time every movie gets worse and worse, it's really awesome! I really don’t know what to say about TYD, firstly, it’s a piece of shit, the story makes no sense, secondly, it uses stuntmen in all its battle scenes, and last but not least, the footage is filmed from other movies! It's amazing how this guy continues to look for work, he is late for the film set and leaves early, and because of this his films are full of holes in the plots and stuntmen. Why do we continue to buy his films, why do we still have hope that maybe, just he, maybe, will make an excellent film?
