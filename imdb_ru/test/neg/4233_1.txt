I saw this film at the Edinburgh Film Festival and would not recommend it. It lasts two and a half hours, during which nothing special happens in stray porridge. <br /> <br /> The main characters are ugly and completely devoid of charisma and individuality. Nobody smiles at all during the movie (as I did, if I had their life), and although Domino seems to have a healthy sexual appetite, she doesn't seem to like sex at all. <br /> <br /> The whole experience is depressing and burdensome, the director lingers over every scene in a way that drives me crazy, and does not amaze me with the beauty of his technique. <br /> <br /> There are too many questions left in my head: why does he sniff the head of an Algerian man? Why is he levitating? What is he looking at through the fence? Why does he kiss Joseph? Why did we go and see this garbage, but did not order another bottle of wine in Bouzy Rouge?
