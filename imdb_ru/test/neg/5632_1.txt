This film was pure rubbish. Not the worst movie. If you break it, the game was good enough to do the work, but the script was SO and so stupid that it remained to think: â€œWhere has my life gone? Even Vanessa Redgrave, whom I love (and for this reason I watched it), was wasted. Totally wasted. She did not even leave the impression. The direction was so far away that none of the characters left me anything but to see Redgrave nothing left. Her part was nothing. She was good as a mean boss, but that was all. Make a depth, and she gave depth to small roles ~ see Venus and the Atonement. I would not waste my time and was upset about spending $ 5 on this film ... I wanted to get it back. No refund. Skip the movie. It will bring you only grief ... and boredom.
