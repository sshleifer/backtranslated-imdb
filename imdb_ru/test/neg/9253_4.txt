Lord David Cecil wrote an interesting book in The Early Victorian Beginners in the 1930s, where he looked at the work of Dickens, Thackeray, Eliot, Trollope, Mrs. Gaskell, Charlotte Bronte and Emily Bronte. He chose these authors as popular favorites of the first half of the Victorian period, and he explained their strengths and weaknesses (as he saw them) to the reading public. Some of his comments are very relevant to this day, but, like any criticism, they give an idea of ​​the spirit of the critic's lifetime. <br /> <br /> Cecil highly appreciated George Eliot (Mary Ann Cross), who wrote about seven or eight books (including sketches and poems). But for most modern readers, they are usually familiar with her shortest book, SILAS MARNER, which is still read in the school curriculum. Other books, Felix Holt RADICAL, DANIEL DERONDA, MEDIUM MARSH, Mill on a Flower, Adam Bede, ROMOLA, SCENES OF CLERICAL LIFE, are still in print (for example, Penguin has most of them in print), but mostly unread Her latest novel Derond, in which she talks about Jews in English society, and the nascent Zionist type that preceded Herzl, is of the greatest interest today. ROMOLA is her only attempt at a historical novel (about the Savanarola experiment with a religiously pure republic in Florence in the 1490s). Her most difficult novel is “MEDIUM MARK”, dedicated to English society in the provinces in 1832, the year of the great bill on the reform of Lord Gray. I had to read MIDDLEMARCH in college for the literature course. This is certainly a thoughtful book (Virginia Woolf called her the most adult book in English). But she suffers (like all the novels of Eliot) from one drawback - she cannot write live, exciting prose. While Dickens is at times overly tumultuous, and Thackeray may become pompous and dismissed, and Trollop may become (as Lord Cecil says) very common in his discussion, and Charlotte Bronte may not be able to explain some relationships well, and Mrs. Gaskell seems , best dealt with female characters, they all (and Emily Bronte in her one and only novel) arouse the interest of the reader. Reading most of Eliot's novels is like trying to carve a toothpick from pieces of marble with a toothpick! <br /> <br /> To date, I have read about fifty pages of Elk Mills. I notice that one of the other reviewers never finished the novel. But I read a brief overview of what it is about. Tullivers (Maggie and her brother Tom) - the main figures - they own the mill in the name. Although close to the beginning of the story, Maggie falls in love with a neighbor's son, whose father faces legal difficulties with Mr. Tulliver Sr. Tom looks at this relationship vaguely, and the tragedy of history concerns the separation between brothers and sisters, culminating in their death at the end (Maggie runs back to the mill to save Tom during a severe flood, and they die together). He was probably a success with Victorian readers, but he is very gloomy and depressing for the modern audience. <br /> <br /> The film slightly changed the ending - Maggie (Geraldine Fitzgerald) dies at the end with her lover and Tom (James Mason) marks their deaths in prison in his book of records. The story is completely rewritten, with the exception of double death in a flood at the end. This is not very helpful. Although Fitzgerald and Mason cope well with their roles, they cannot really pull up the film with their work. The end result is a rather minor film that, fortunately, did not hurt the leader’s career. The only thing that should be noted is that Frank Lawton, who played David Copperfield two years earlier as an adult against W.K., played the guy. Fields, Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O'Sullivan. But then, Lawton never had a big film career - he was just next to the pictures, something good, some kind of mediocre.
