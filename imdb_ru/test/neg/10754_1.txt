I went to watch this movie last night at the National Cinema in London, as a festive treat. It was the first time I saw it, and I think that now the awful Twister has hit on like the worst movie I've ever seen. Disappointed for no reason, self-deprecating and full of images that ranges from the rough and obvious to the dark and illegible, not particularly beautiful or darkly shot, I really do not understand why this is considered classic, funny or otherwise. I usually like films that push the boundaries or even films that are difficult to watch because of their length or unusual cinema. But it was really, really awful.
