The 4th Floor is clearly a mediocre film with Juliet Lewis as a young interior designer with a damnable problem neighbor. Jane (Lewis) recently inherited a fabulous apartment on the 5th floor from her grandmother, and in agreement with the landlord gets a ridiculously low rental rate. Her boyfriend (William Hurt as a creepy meteorologist) wants her to move in with him, but she wants her own place. So it comes nearer, and strange things start to happen, and since this is a class B horror film, there is a stupid reason that cannot be found in reality. Since not too intriguing, Jane tries to tell others — her boyfriend, the police, colleagues — what's going on, everyone thinks she is losing it. So, of course, she has to face a problem — a madman living right under her — alone. Neither scary nor interesting, the only saving grace of the film - Lewis. She is a very good actress, but she is poorly used here, which does not mean that she is not the best thing in this film - because she is. She has a wild charisma, and she holds the screen better than a dozen silicone toys that usually fill this type of film. This type of film, however, is not worthy of her - irony, given that she is probably the only reason anyone sees her.
