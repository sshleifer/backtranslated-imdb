It is difficult to spoil this story. A BIG book / A GOOD version of the film from Fred Zinneman, but this film is HORRIBLE! At first the casting was terrible. Richard Gere had to play the Jackal himself, since Edward Fox was a similar cipher, and they did not need to bother with the original script, adding so much useless (expensive) fluff. This film reminded me of many Bruce Willis films, as you see the enormous costs associated with NOTHING cinematic. (This is his "conspiracy theory"). Making the movie so bad of such a beautiful original script takes real effort. EVERY person from Michael Caton Jones down should be banned from making films for 10 years; This is an insult to this film for real cinematographers. If Hollywood would stand trial because he had no idea what they were doing, this film would have been a show of A. Shame on EVERYTHING!
