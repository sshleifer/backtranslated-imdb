Story: Alain, a French policeman, is shocked to find that he has a twin brother when his body is found in Nice. Investigating the murder, he learns that he had a list in which the affairs of the Russian mafia are described in detail. With the help of her brother's friend, Alain evades Russian gangsters and corrupt FBI agents, trying to find a list. <br /> <br /> “Maximum risk” is another one of a long list of militants with Jean-Claude Van Damme. As for things, this is strictly formal. The script follows a cliché, and the action is mediocre. There are several well-made sequences of actions, with an inventive car chase, fighting in a burning building, escaping through rooftops, fierce fighting in an elevator, and JCVD, fleeing from their enemies through an overground train line. Directed by Ringo Lam keeps everything at a reasonable pace.
