In a world where people can live forever, you spend the whole movie, wanting them to die. First, if you insist on watching this movie, do two things, turn it on first, do not worry, you miss the plot, damn it, they don’t even talk during the first 70 minutes of the 87-minute movie after you turned off the sound Now you need to quickly move forward until the main chick dies, do not worry, even if, having paid attention, you will not know why or how she died. As soon as you get to the “good part”, accept it without sound. Oh, how do you know the good part, wait for the elevator scene with two morons in space suits with weapons of World War II. This weapon will not be so big until you realize that the first hero had a laser pistol and a cartridge with CO2 cartridges. The only remnants of the plot occur between the glowing ball and the semi-dry chick, which looks like it was attacked by Wolverine. After hearing the "plot", you want them to stop talking again. Of the four people who are present in this film, none of them can act remotely, even a little, you are lucky if you become an actor in kindergarten. <br /> <br /> To comment a special offer on special effects, let me just say “Wow”, no, in fact, you won’t spend the whole movie saying to yourself: “Where did the budget of this film go to 1.8 million dollars! “Seriously, it will leave you terrified of incompetence. The best "sets" are mostly desktop wallpapers. The ships are mostly flying spanners, wait, some barges that look like whales. I have never heard so many fictional words in my entire life. On the wrist, they have buttons (large pedometers) that can translate them into “battle mode” and super running mode (makes them very blurry). This seriously depletes their energy reserves, but they find pieces of wire to chew on to regain their strength. The explosions were less impressive than my fourth of July, I only had Bengal lights. <br /> <br /> So, as I understand it, the plot looks like this: “mother” is the captain of a spacecraft and goes to the desert. rocket dies for a while. Then her daughter, after 6,000 years (no, I am not exaggerating), recalls the memories of her mother through some kind of capsule. In any case, they continue to play for another 10 minutes, and then cause a big bang. Yes. That same “Big Bang” that launched our solar system. This explains how it comes back in time or something like that, no matter what happens, I think. Roll Credits Seriously, the whole scenario was, fortunately, on one sheet of paper, if in fact it did not detail any of the horrific fight scenes. <br /> <br /> After watching the credits, I now laughed more than the entire movie, I work on creating the catering supervisor "galactius sarcophagus", and then special thanks to George Lucas was simply the best. <br /> <br /> I really didn’t expect so much for the film for which I paid 99 cents, but seriously The body owes me for it. The most frequent comment heard after the movie "I want my life back." You have to admire it, but spend time and energy on this film, but seriously, why?
