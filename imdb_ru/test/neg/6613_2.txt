This film probably seemed like a great idea in preparation for production. “Let's make a film about one of the greatest and most controversial sports trainers of the modern era! And let's play Brian Dennehy as Bobby Knight as coach! ”This is where this movie went terribly wrong. Why shoot an actor who has no resemblance to the person he portrays? And then, why does this actor turn his hero not into coach Knight, but into Brian Dennehy in a red sweater? When I sat and watched this movie on ESPN, I could not believe that this man was actually the coach of Knight. He was not like him, spoke like him, behaved like him, or even walked like him. I could not get past this fact, and therefore I could not enjoy the film. When Paul Newman and Robert Redford outlawed Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, it didn’t matter if they were accurate historical examples of their real characters, because most of us didn’t even hear about these people until we watched the movie. But with someone as prominent in today's media as the Coach Knight, you have to do more. When Anthony Hopkins was played as Nixon, it was the same situation. But Anthony Hopkins made us believe that he really was Nixon. Dennehy did not even try. What could have been a great movie burned out of it. In addition to the fact that this film was trying to do for a four-letter word that “Salvation of Private Ryan” did for dismemberment, it smelled. Too little of the real Knight-trainer and too much profanity for the sake of shock value turned this film into a "season to turn off the halfway broadcast." The only good thing about this is that it was a television movie. I did not have to spend my hard earned money on this piece of garbage.
