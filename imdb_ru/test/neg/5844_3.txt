A good example of the differences between American and foreign cinema can be seen in the film, which I recently watched on TV: "Indecent Proposal." <br /> <br /> The two main characters of the Indecent Proposal, David and Diane Murphy, played Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore. I’m not sure if this was due to their complete lack of chemistry or that they behaved badly, but why should we care if these two stayed with me. Love, affection, playfulness, desire ?? none of them materialized on the screen in their interaction with each other. <br /> <br /> Since I knew that in the end Robert Redford would appear, from the very beginning it was clear that the good part, the essence of the film, would be the scenes between him and Demi Moore. Poor Woody Harrelson simply could not gather any emotion for the film. He seemed to be holding back, preoccupied with his balding colors. <br /> <br /> Good, so fast. That these two idiots (Diana and David) think they can get back the $ 50,000 they owe by playing gambling. There is no acting nonsense, just terribly bad, lazy, inexcusable letter. Of course, they lose all their money. Surprised? I know I was not. Enter Robert Redford (John Gage in the film) ?? a romantic, perhaps emotionally cold person, updated Gatsby. Very good role and, although not great, a great actor, next to these two Redford looks like Olivier. He immediately falls in love and craves Diana, and we, the audience, this time FEEL this. It's like loving a woman! Not like David, trading mouth-to-mouth cud with Diana on a slippery pier. (Did I understand correctly?) In the role of Gage, Redford wears a suit and tie in every scene. Yes, it is intended to instruct the seemingly mentally retarded audience that it is rich, but it also looks damn good, and by this point the mentally retarded audience appreciates it! Another symbolism of the wardrobe includes David’s now smoothed shirts at the end of the film, which indicates determination to come together after a long pause in a worn-out wrinkled shirt. <br /> <br /> And what is it with Californian garden parties, as pictured in Hollywood movies? Suddenly, everyone seems British, complete with lace dresses, three-piece suits for men, hats (hats!) And, of course, an umbrella. Yes, Diana, her transformation into Richman's bride is now complete, an umbrella is gracefully twisted at auction. Although she insisted that she could not be bought, she finally succumbed to sexual tension. This is where the film forks into pure Americana. I mean, of course, that David and Diana will be together, my question is: WHY? Diana was bored with David, why not let her ride the wave of Robert Redford? And I mean for a long time? How can she so easily pull herself out of the sexually romantic captivity of this sexy old man just because Woody Harrelson brings her hairline to a garden party, sits down and looks Demi Moore in the eye. This is simply not the case. He was so weak. <br /> <br /> But we must have a happy ending. We must swallow a moral lesson. We are not yet tempted enough to have it otherwise. Directed by Lin tried to make a "death attraction" for the shooting for minors, boys. <br /> <br /> In addition to garden parties, where there is no SUV, no T-shirts, no baseball caps, such films also have a reliable public transport system that connects the vast Californian cities and municipalities. How else to symbolize the return to life of the middle class or working class?
