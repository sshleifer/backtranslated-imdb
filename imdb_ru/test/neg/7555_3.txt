I never watched a movie that upset me more than Lord Of The Dance. Disappointed because it could be fantastic. Disappointed because dancing could be amazing. Disappointed because women could be great. How do I know, though ?! By the time your eyes moved to the area of ​​interest on the screen and focused in place to admire, the mad editor has moved the picture! I totally agree with the other comments here about the shit coverage and the awful camera / editor work. I feel sick when I watch ten minutes of this exciting movie. <br /> <br /> Give me the opportunity to get the front seat in a live concert, and I will be in the frame! <br /> <br /> Nicholas T
