This one was really terrible. Watching with enchanted horror, I continued to ask: “Why did they do it?” That is, they took all the scripts from “The Day After Tomorrow”, “The Ideal Storm” and “Twister” and remixed them in a three-hour mini-series filmed by old-time director Dick Lowry , with every movie about Cliché's catastrophes, known to man, not an ounce of real expectation. Many of the actors were unknown Canadians, and the filming in Canada took place in Canada, the Vinnepheg doubled for Chicago, so no doubt the tax breaks are somehow related to this. Although some ambitious special effects were undertaken, the performance was so poor that it was not possible to achieve a decent spectacle. Actors can be a competent party; The script is so bad that no one had the opportunity to show it, except perhaps Randy Quaid in the role of Tommy Tornado hunter, who went upstairs and was quite funny. <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, since then, producers have made another of these Canadian natural disaster turkeys called Category 7 - The End of the World, which was very tastefully shown on CBS in the US a few weeks after Hurricane Katrina. How could the network of Ed Marrow and Walter Cronkite do this? Prime time? PT Barnum "no one ever went broke, underestimating public taste," again proved to be right.
