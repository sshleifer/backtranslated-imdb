Do not pay attention to the extreme voices about the "House of Wax", in any case it is not "1" or "10". I will try to help anyone who is thinking about seeing the “House of Wax” or those who saw it based on the trailer and feels deceived. The trailer makes this movie look very promising, and this is what trailers should do. There is certainly only one thing with trailers: if producers cannot put together a minute of interesting elements to make a trailer, then it is almost certain that the film is a major lame festival. But a good trailer only tells you that some things about the film are good, but it doesn’t give you much of the overall package. Here a little research can be valuable. <br /> <br /> The House of Wax was filmed as Elisha Cuthbert (whose acting skills are closer to Cathy Ireland than her Canadian counterpart Sarah Polley or her counterpart Rose McGowan), and the director was a music video, formerly known as Jaume, in his artistic debut. These are not very good signs, but if you are like me, you ignore them and go to look at the work of designer Grace Walken, who was responsible for the appearance of the “ghost ship”. Once again, it’s worth looking at the work of Wawken, so much so that it looks like 90% of the film’s budget of $ 30 million was spent on serial design. The rest went to Cuthbert to compensate for the abuses she had to endure throughout the film (cut off a finger, glue up lips, tie, and talk a lot about various sticky things). By the way, Cuthbert looks much harder than in the "Girl next door", about one big pig from the main problem with weight. <br /> <br /> This means that they have little to pay the rest of the lineup and the crew. And judging by what was on the screen, this may be true. It seems that everyone else donated their time to get their first act or team credit. Unfortunately, regardless of whether it was inexperience or jealousy because of pay inequality, the contributions of all these inexperienced / incompetent volunteers are less than zero. <br /> <br /> The work of DP by inexperienced Stephen Windows was as terrible as you probably looked and worked in the league with an incompetent editor such as Joel Negran (insert Pearl Harbor here), they manage to take away most of value added by the design team. Instead of lingering and showing scenery, Window filmed this material with poor lighting and jerking-zooming cameras. Negran aggravated the problem with an insane amount of disorienting cuts. Poor lighting, an ADD-like camera and a sharp squall are what you use to hide a cheap and crappy production design; not what is needed when the only strength of the film is its expensive and detailed sets. <br /> <br /> Chen Hayes did the script, and Charles Belden (who wrote the original story) is credited as the author, although with the exception of the title and There are absolutely no similarities to the use of wax figures. One of the beneficial sides is that the film is not taken seriously as a horror film and is basically a parody (insert Van Helsing here). Murders are played out for a laugh, too harsh to be scary or even creepy for someone over six years old. The audience especially went berserk when a certain famous hotel heiress forced her homely face to break through the steel bar, although her early unfinished striptease was the only really creepy thing in the film. Another comedic event was that Cuthbert stuck his finger through the bars and cut him off to the bad guy. <br /> <br /> Good scenes take place in Trudy's wax house, a wax factory that has something to do with the closed sugar factory, Siamese twins, and a lot of road kills (in which Cuthbert bathes). It is assumed that all this is happening somewhere in the countryside of Florida, although from many hills it looks like the country of Paul Hogan (the attention of the location's scouts - the Gulf Coast is not known because of its hilly terrain). The script obviously intended to reproduce the connection (bad pun) between the two sets of twins, but somewhere during production or postproduction, most of the dialogue on this issue was cut off. Since what remains of the double connection does not make sense and leads to nothing, you wonder why it was not reduced to reduce the boredom factor. <br /> <br /> What is particularly sad is that the manufacturers did not have in the middle of the production the brains admit that they have the ingredients for the first-class horror classics - even with the existing composition. What looked them in the face was a chance to go somewhere with the illusion of the city of wax figures. Since this is a photographic medium, a modern film is naturally naturalistic in its nature, and is almost inclined to create the illusion of reality. Here they had a ready opportunity to give a photographic medium theatrical element of extreme stylization. Like the painting of the Impressionists, the city creates the illusion of reality from a distance, but it shows itself as a very stylized wax making up close. Of course, they would have to find a visionary director and DP in order to successfully implement it, but everything else was ready for this to happen.
