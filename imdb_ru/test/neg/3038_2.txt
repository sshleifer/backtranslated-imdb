The original WASC does not necessarily have to watch a movie in the genre. In fact, if it were not for the cold first 25 minutes, there would be no logical reason to watch. The remake takes these 25 minutes and turns them into a mediocre 85-minute teen horror movie. <br /> <br /> Now I have nothing against PG-13 horror films, but the trend surrounding them becomes slop. When you see the PG-13 rating, you are expecting a movie filled with fake fears, teenager tv. or musical stars, and a plot that has been used several times. Don't even ask for blood or violence. <br /> <br /> I know that comparing the original WASC and the remake is wrong, but I think it needs to be done, because the whole idea of ​​the new is based on the beginning of the original. The tension that is felt in the first film is in no way present in the remake. Even with amazing settings or great lightning use. No tension, tension, thrills ... nothing. The film goes too slowly before it gets a bit “interesting,” and here a stranger appears. The chase sequence is probably the best part of the film, because at least there is a feeling of “what will happen next?”. But that's all. The situations that set for a climax are predictable, boring and lacking in expectation. The original has its merit in that it is in suspense in the most important scenes, as well as in the frightening climax of the most important scene of the film. <br /> <br /> Now I understand that this is a horror movie PG-13, but if you respect the original. Why change this is the most important situation? Children should not survive! After the finale, I felt that this film was meaningless. So, the nanny played cat and mouse with the freak ... like this? Then the sequence in the hospital was just stupid. And worst of all, it means that the sequel may be on the way. <br /> <br /> Camila Belle is the best thing in the film. It provides a pretty, believable presentation. She needs to choose the best projects, although this role will get her thousands of teenage fans. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie. Some people say that to support the horror genre we have to support any film that comes out. I do not necessarily agree. If we ignore films such as WASC, horror film producers will realize that we will not accept CRAP. We want good horror films, not lame films filled with false scares. <br /> <br /> Instead, see the original “When a Stranger Calls,” because his first 25 minutes is MUCH BETTER than the entire (meaningless) remake.
