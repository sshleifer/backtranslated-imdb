The filmmakers are trying to portray the influence of Mondovis and Robert Parker as a parody on a par with the German occupation of France and fascism. But they never find a sacrifice in this film. We hear winemakers, critics and distributors complain that as the wine industry grows, it becomes more homogeneous. But the film never says that it led to the loss of any good wine or the exploitation of any person or culture, except for the naive readers of the Wine Spectator with a lot of money. If they want to pay hundreds of dollars for a dull wine, so be it. <br /> <br /> If it was a diamond trade film where the dominance of DeBeers corporation in the market leads to human suffering, the style of hooliganism might be appropriate. But so it is as anti-American, anti-modernizing and anti-capitalist. If filmmakers were in the 1870s, they would most likely have protested against grafting American vines in an attempt to save French wine.
