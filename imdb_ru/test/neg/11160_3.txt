Fans of Arnold will scream with joy, fans of brainless actions will scream with surprise, and Catholics will just scream. <br /> <br /> Andrew W. Marlow was written in an illogical way and without the help of director Peter Hyams, * The end of days * gets the Terminator out of his hospital gown with an open back (Arnold Schwarzenegger’s return to the big screen after a heart operation), while while blowing up things in the Mysterious Ways and blaspheming the biblical verse to give the Catholics something else to whine about. <br /> <br /> this is 1999 and doom-siers all over the world live in the thrill of their computers Fritz is going on and losing them downloaded porn. Even though the technological stench of Y2K grumbles on the streets of New York, the ex-policeman turned alcoholic security guard Jericho Kane (Schwarzenegger, with a careless prehistory of the “dead wife and child” for the “Free Gun” effect), must be a brave theologian. water to save the 20-year-old maiden Christine (Robin Tunni) from being drafted into the army? wait for him ?? Satan's bride. Dun daaaaaaa! Stupidity comes. <br /> <br /> Every anti-hero has his own antichrist. Gabriel Byrne, is the devil here? and he is going to have a party, like in 1999, with a mission to infuse Christine with the Antichrist between 11:00 pm and 12:00 pm, December 31, 1999 ?? oddly enough, at the hour when all the porn will be lost ?? thereby leading the end of the day. Being able to read minds, cause hallucinations and use limitless magic, it does not occur to Satan to speed up the fertilization process, appearing several months in advance and grooming Christina as a teenage model, and then easily closing the panties raid at the appointed time; instead, he appears on December 28th as the Terminator Keyser Soze and wonders why she does not greet him with open hips ?? (See. Comment above: stupidity.) Here is a film in which nothing makes sense at the moment when it is uttered, not to mention contemplating its veracity or mythology. The priest (Rod Steiger) tells Jericho that “666” is really “999” upside down with “1” in front of him. So wait - * Prince * - is the Antichrist? <br /> <br /> Satan Soz pursues Jericho and Christina (Ji and C? Understand?) Throughout the city, by no means doing anything that could speed up their capture, In one scene Satan recreates his wife and child Jericho to seduce him to reveal where he hid Christina. But if he can so deeply penetrate into Jericho’s thoughts, recreating his family with enough nuances to cause nostalgia, then why can't he see where Jericho hid Christina ten minutes ago? <br /> <br /> Satan can make a killer speak without a tongue, but he cannot force this killer to destroy a semi-automatic weapon. And when Jericho shoots Satan at close range, Satan is polite enough to open his shirt to show closing wounds, so Jericho will not worry too much about Satan's health - not about acting with open bullet wounds ?? In fact, instead of simply owning Jericho himself to get close to Christine and rape her, Satan spends so much unnecessary energy on side projects (crucifies a foul guy, blows up Jericho's partner (Kevin Pollack) and then rescues him, and then again blow him up, ridiculously fighting Jericho when he could kill him with an effort of thought), that we are wondering if we should don’t put on a more effective killer / lover? let's say Antonio Banderas. <br /> <br /> What I like most about “The End of Days” is Arnold’s valiant attempts to use the Method: “sad” means squinting your eyes and not blurting out anything with a foreign accent; "Depressed" means raising the bottle to your lips and not blurring anything with someone else's accent; “Mortally frightened” means widening his eyes and not having any problems with a foreign accent. There is definitely a pattern here if we could only decipher it. <br /> <br /> In the end, the devil does not go to holy men, whom Catholics pray for deliverance from such apocalypses, but from an atheist. Jericho. While timid people of an impotent god admonish “faith” and thrill in their cells, doing nothing with Satan, actually walking among them, the Prince of Darkness is ripped off by a nulyfidian with a big weapon and a foreign accent. This clearly indicates that Catholics blindly refuse to hear: even if the devil existed, those who instilled in him an unconditional and irrational fear would not have been able to evoke faith in his fall, let alone act in that direction. . Moreover, they cannot truly WANT to defeat him, because only thanks to his opposite polarity the existence of their god will become steady. <br /> <br /> For in the Book of Revelation it is written: “And the Prince of Darkness will descend to Earth without any solid playing plan and soak the virgin on a date that will not matter until the Gregorian calendar of the 1500s the numbering of days, which synchronizes it with the equinoxes and the syntax of Anno Domine, which will be annoyed by sensible people for millennia, by then Christians will forget the actual date of birth of Christ and assign the pagan festival of Saturnalia instead. And the Prince will make a Revolution through tight-fitting purple pants and ambiguous lesbian band members? "I can believe that people were drained and crucified, and an alcoholic was built like Mr. Universe; I can believe that a giant supernatural monster cannot kill a guy armed only with a foreign accent; I can even believe that the devil needs to Celtic Druid hockey ritual as a prelude, but I can't believe this is a 20-year-old virgin in New York in 1999. <br /> <br /> Especially around Prince ...
