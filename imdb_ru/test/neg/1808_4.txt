After reading the book "Heart of Darkness" the film did not become fair. The film puts the book to shame, and anyone who has not experienced it frowned at the story and plot, because the film was so poorly portrayed. In the film, the characters and scenery were just some of the disappointments that occurred in the film. The director did not take into account so many important and interesting aspects of the book, which made it one of the best literary works ever created. <br /> <br /> Of course, any book is better than a film, but they were not even comparable. Joseph Conrad, as a writer, was brilliant in the vocabulary and acumen of the written word. The film doesn't even begin to show any of this. Some of the very important and influential scenes from the book were completely omitted, for example, as Kurtz was not in the boat when he died. In addition, when Marlow went to deliver news to the alleged Kurtz, she reacted differently in the film, not in the book. Another significant difference was that Marlowe saw the image of a woman blindfolded at the end of the film, and not at the beginning, as in the book. This influenced the way the audience perceived Marlowe, and the film completely spoiled it. <br /> <br /> The book was so well tuned to what each place looked like, but the scenery in the film was disappointed. There was a bunch of stupid fake backgrounds and compliments, a bunch of bad actors to go along with that. There was one exception for terrible actors, and it was Isaah de Bankole who played Mfum. His character was depicted the best. Although the film was not so good, I would recommend it ONLY if you read and understood the book very well. So you can see the differences in the film and the book and see them. If you have not read the book, I do not recommend the film because it is a boring, lifeless mess. I really liked the book, so you should definitely read it and enjoy it.
