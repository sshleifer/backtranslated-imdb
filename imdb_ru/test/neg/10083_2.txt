I would like to comment on how girls are chosen. why they are always chosen by more white women than blacks. in each episode there are always more white women than black ones. how to say that white women look better than black women. I would like to see more black women than whites this time. and it's not just your show, itâ€™s so that in many shows there are always more whites. but I would think that since you become the main representative of the show, you will see it yourself and there will be more black women on your show. but you, like everyone else, are trying to act as if you are so honest and sweet. You are just a big deceiver hypocrite.
