I've been a horror fan all my life. Many nights stretched to the early morning and watched the universal films "Horror" and "Creature Feature Night". Unfortunately, I watched this movie in the early evening, and yet it almost put me to sleep. <br /> <br /> I don’t think I’ve ever seen the “terrible” picture where everything was in fact, Dr. Edelmann doesn’t seem to believe in the supernatural, but soon he treats Dracula medically and watches as Larry Talbot turns into a Wolf, almost without blinking an eye. He and Talbot discover the monster of Frankenstein as if it were normal. Edelmann is all lit to bring the monster back to life, but after Talbot, Miliza and Nina protest, he says: “Oh, you're right. Nothing wrong". Realizing the betrayal of Dracula, he opens the coffin of the count to the sunlight and POOF !, he left, like this. <br /> <br /> The only person who seemed to be more than just making a phone call was Jane Adams Nina. Her reward is to bounce off the hump in her back into a hole from the monster Frankenstein at the end of the film ... and no one even tries to save her! She, Dr. Edelmann and the Monster died, while Talbot and Miliza accidentally leave the castle. <br /> <br /> Definitely the lowest point for Universal during its classic horror years.
