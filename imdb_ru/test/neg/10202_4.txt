... in search of the funniest film “so bad, it's good,” I repeatedly laughed at the first fifteen minutes of various films, only to remain disappointed and bored at the end. Not this time!!! My eyes flashed, my stomach and cheeks ached with laughter throughout the entire film. Undoubtedly, Hulk Hogan is a low-level actor, and the plot is perfectly predictable, but everyone plunges into this film, knowing all this — all that someone wants to see when shooting this is Hogan, breaking the can with tear, with a bunch of “BROTHER YES "s and" WHATCHUGONNADO "fly from his infamous bearded mouth. And although the “Hulkster” on the screen pales a bit compared to the “Hulkster” in the ring, seekers of excellent cheese will certainly not be disappointed with this unceremonious flick stone. A riot of laughter.
