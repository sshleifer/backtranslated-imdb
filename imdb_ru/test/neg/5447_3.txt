I'm really not very sure why people greet this strange movie so much. Having said this, I really spent 2 hours and I can not say that it was not at all uninteresting. <br /> <br /> I think the key problem is that Frank Marshall is not a real director and this is clear in the film - he is an experienced producer, so he saw the film, shot many times, and will understand what is happening in the process. But I think that this is not something that you can really control the film - the direction was competent, but somehow flat and without direction. Marshall has more experience as a unit or second director, and, I think, it happened in the finished product - it was a group of scenery that could not really be successive either in its feeling or in its character. <br /> <br /> Fun, watchable, but good? Not.
