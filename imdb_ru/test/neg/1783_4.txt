I thought it would be a funny comedy without sex or nudity. Well, there is no sexual content, but as for the “funny comedy”, I remember how I laughed only three times during the “Green Butchers. The fun is centered around cannibalism and mental retardation, which is simply sick of humor, in a bad sense. <br /> <br /> I had to get out of this film, and I shave myself because I did not do that. In fact, I should not have watched this movie from the beginning. The only advantage of this film was that Bjarne and his brother finally made up and left their ugly past behind. I advise any benevolent person to avoid this coarse click.
