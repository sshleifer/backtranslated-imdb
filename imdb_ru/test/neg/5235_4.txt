After a lush, inspiring air throw in fast motion at the opening of the film, he slipped into boredom and a monophonic note to the very end. <br /> <br /> Where to start, well, I'll start with the characters. I really enjoyed them in the book, here they were all typical and one-dimensional idiots, who either had “Sacrifice” or “Asshole” written on their forehead from the very beginning. What nobody saw through the owner of the store Lealand Gaunt (in a quiet and inappropriate performance of Sidrow) is beyond my power. <br /> <br /> This film lacks the thrill, the expectations and, in a sense, the entertainment values. It stretches too long without paying off. Why introduce too many annoying “must die” characters, and then forget about half of them halfway through? In the book, almost everyone who went to the store, met a terrible fate. Here, apart from one of the only decent scenes that responded well from the novel (the struggle between Wilma and Nettie), it was a disappointment and there were not many balls. Sorry, but after one death behind the scenes, a boring firefight and some quarrels, and then a couple of explosions just did not do it for me. Cruelty and meanness of spirit from the book, unfortunately, were absent. The explosion on the church scene was so terrible and executed that all of a sudden the whole city was in a quarrel? It did not make any sense, and characters who were not introduced through, suddenly ask the question: who are these people and why do I care? <br /> <br /> History is everywhere, and none of the scenes gained momentum, I thought Ed Harris and Bonnie Bedale were good actors in this, but the film gives them not enough material for me to give a damn. Amanda Plummer inspired confidence, but too pretentious to actually be sympathetic (in the novel she was a sad and depressing character), here it was too remarkable. J.T. Walsh was interesting, but the role was far from interesting or multi-layered. Too predictable. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was too cool for the material he supported. He stood out like a sore finger. Easy there, buddy, easy. Something a little less theatrical, I would imagine, would work. <br /> <br /> I recognize that some of the blood he managed to have was good enough, I think, the director seemed to hold back many times though. If you are going to make a film that reaches 2-hour point, then surely much more will happen than this adaptation disaster of one of the best Kings novels. <br /> <br /> I often laughed at the scenes that were supposed to be taken seriously (Ed Harris speech at the end or the character Hugh Priest in general), and most of the time he was bored and uninterested. Personally, the director had to do much more with this story, his approach is too tame and hides too much clear cinema to ever turn out to be a worthy film. The film looks good, but does not look, I think this story deserves. I mean, this dude behind the wheel of Alaska is not a good sign. <br /> <br /> I would rather just read the book, just like you, as if it were a much more fascinating, multi-level character development, terrible violence and chaos, an unpleasant sense of humor and much more attractive. This is a stabbed version that cannot offer much. <br /> <br /> ** out ****
