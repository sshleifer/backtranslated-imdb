I saw this film as a child (before World War II) and was surprised that there is a copy in the local library. After sixty years, I saw it again and forgot how bad it was. This is an example of a movie that was not a “A” movie. No editing, a bad script, a weak game and not a lot of direction. Should not be even higher than the letter "B". I laughed at how I was exhausted over the years. It seems to me that I thought it was good when I first saw it.
