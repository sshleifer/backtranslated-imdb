This movie was a bad movie. The plot was bad, and the comedy they “tried” to put on came out badly. Accidents seem far-fetched and predictable. I thought the actors tried to some extent, but with this film he was so lame that he could only go so far. One of the worst films I've ever seen, and I don't recommend to anyone. The only accident with Mr. DTP is his release.
