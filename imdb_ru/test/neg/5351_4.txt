I did not read John Grisham's Time to Kill, and perhaps this would help to better understand the film. But maybe not. I heard that this is the most correct adaptation of Grisham, and if this is true, I understand why so many publishers abandoned the novel when Grisham presented him as his first work. <br /> <br /> “Time to kill” “This is one of those films that is seriously confused and wants to do too many things at once. He wants to be an exciting crowd and thriller, and at the same time a film dedicated to the study of certain social and moral issues. Let's face it, these two types of films don't go together in Hollywood, so the Walking Dead had to be made independently of each other. <br /> <br /> A young lawyer named Jake (Matthew McConkey) is involved in the plot to protect a black man named Karl (Samuel L. Jackson) from killing two knolls who brutally raped his young daughter. The day before the trial of the rapists, Karl hid in a closet in the courthouse, and when the rapists were carried through the building, he broke free and shot them both. To help with the defense, Jack takes the help of a former law student (Sandra Bullock), who proves that her role in this film was completely unnecessary, and was placed in the film for marketing purposes only. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, one of the rapist's younger brothers (Kiefer Sutherland) was outraged that a black man killed his brother and decided to take revenge. All this leads to shooting in front of the courthouse, kidnapping, cruel beatings and races. I admit that all this attracted my attention throughout the entire film, in addition to the scenes in the courtroom. Later, I objected to the film solving ethical issues and using formulas in the plot. <br /> <br /> The main question that the film constantly and again asks is whether a black person gets a fair trial from a white jury. Of course, they can, but this does not mean that a man should be justified in order for the court to be fair. This film, however, does not seem to think so. In addition, the site has several gaping holes used for convenience. For example, there is an unknown character named Mickey Mouse, who is a member of the Clan and, for unknown reasons, helps defense team members avoid the serious dangers of other Clan members. After Bullock was abducted by Sutherland and company, and left dead in the desert, this unknown person comes and rescues her - and we will NEVER find out who he is or why he helps the people he has to terrorize. /> <br /> Speaking of the reign of Sutherland’s terror, it’s just amazing how reckless the police and the character of Bullock are who stop him throughout the film. There is a scene where Sutherland becomes a sniper from a building across the street from the courthouse and tries to shoot Jake as he steps out, instead shooting one of the guards. Now you might think, since around dozens of policemen, it will be easy to surround and catch the sniper. There is no such luck. Judging by what we saw, no one cared that the sniper was still at large. Even after Bullock was rescued by Mickey Mouse, she never mentioned who was her captor, and was not even questioned. Why was this? Simply. Sutherland's character was necessary throughout the film to add constant anxiety, although logically he should have been behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> In addition to the character of Bullock, there is another ungrateful character. He is Jake's assistant, played by Oliver Platt. It seems that there is one reason why his character is shot in the film - to provide the audience with several lines. In my opinion, when using "one-liners" demonstrate a serious weakness in the "serious" films. This shows that the filmmakers are not sure that one story and dialogue is enough to keep the attention of the audience, and therefore use them to make the audience laugh, to convince everyone that they are watching an entertainment movie. <br /> <br /> But there are enough minor issues in the film. How about a movie message here? It is clear that Karl is really guilty of murder. We saw how he planned for hours to kill people who raped his daughter. Lawyers argue that this was a temporary insanity, etc., which forced him to kill. In desperation, Jake asks the jury to close his eyes when he talks about rape in detail as part of his final argument. After describing everything that happened, he adds to the final line ... "The girl is white." Then we see the jury members with tears in their eyes. <br /> <br /> In the next scene a girl comes out shouting “He is free! He's free!". Wait a minute! Does the jury base its decisions on its emotions or on facts? First of all, why were there no scenes in which the jury was pondering and what they really thought after their emotions had subsided. I'll tell you why. They could not show a dispute, because ANY JURY could not justify a person of such a crime, no matter how much the last defense arguments touched their hearts. What is this message? Is someone acquitted of murder if this is a form of revenge for the previous crime he committed? <br /> <br /> In this film, there was enough courage to say that the murder in this situation does not suit, because in reality there will be no acquittal. But since dollars were at stake, the filmmakers were more concerned with how to spare the feelings of the audience than they presented a responsible message. If people begin to kill as a form of revenge, the creators of this film should be responsible. What a socially irresponsible film!
