The Emperor's New Paz was a big turn for Disney. It was not a musical! He had clean, fresh jokes and no political twists. It was just a damn funny movie. <br /> <br /> Kronk's new groove, on the other hand, is tired and weak. My 3-year-old boy still loves the Emperor's New Paz, but fell asleep during Kronk. There really is no conflict there (this, in the first film, leads to all foolish adventures). Due to the absence of conflict, it seems that the animators kicked out the writers and simply pushed the storyline as they advanced. <br /> <br /> I kept waiting for something to happen that made the movie fun. , and still.
