An unforgettable pilot who never explains why Nostradamus is really important to the plot of this film, but Rob Estes plays an abnormal cop who for some reason turns out to be Nostradamus and who fights with time-traveling medieval monks who run around with weapons and make people fire to start the apocalypse. Oh yes, there is also an FBI sex agent who turns out to be crazy and trying to make Rob believe everything before itâ€™s too late. It is a pity that they could not predict the best plot. Yawn. <br /> <br />
