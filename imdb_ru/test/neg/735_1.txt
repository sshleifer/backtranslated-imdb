Awful, terrible, terrible. The actors are bad, the music is funny, and the shots are pathetic. I rented a DVD and had to watch it to the end. <br /> <br /> My advice: read the book, it is much better, and you do not have to put up with all these silly images and Catherine's Funny Dreams <br /> <br /> I think I never watched such a bad movie.
