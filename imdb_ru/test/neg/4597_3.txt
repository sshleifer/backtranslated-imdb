After Matt Dillon’s phenomenal performance on CRASH, most of them are likely to rush to pick up a copy of FACTOTUM to find out if Dillon is real or just a lucky bounce from a great script. <br /> <br /> Well, Factotum is certainly his moments, but simplicity ... everything will most likely turn off viewers. However, nothing should be taken away from Dillon. His play is gorgeous and full of excellent deadpan humor, proving that he is a solid actor with significant roles; It's just a shame because of the direction and the script. <br /> <br /> The story of Henry "Hank" Chinaski (Dillon) and his refusal to conform to something resembling normality. He quits or resigns from work in a matter of minutes, only to find himself in a dreary pub, where even darker women meet, trying to write a non-conformist novel. We never really know what this novel is about, except that “everything” is in it (cancer, movies, you, me). <br /> <br /> Passing from the workplace to the workplace and the constant return to Jan (Lily Taylor, THE HAUNTING Hank, an unlucky girlfriend, as depressing as he himself, tries in vain to figure out what his life should hold for him. Does he ever know that this is for interpretation? Someone may say that he does not do this, and someone may argue that his life is just a path to obscurity. <br /> <br / > Despite this, Factotum doesn’t make much sense, even though Matt Dillon’s beautiful game. The story wanders through Hank’s life without thinking about e take the audience. And that's a shame. Play Dillon would shine even brighter, if he got a decent script.
