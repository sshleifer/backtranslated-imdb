Is this a terrible action ?? Sci-fi movie is shit. I just spent 90 minutes of my life watching one of the worst films I've ever seen. The story makes no sense, there are many flaws in the script, the characters are poorly developed, the unknown cast is terrible, the lead actor seems to be too old for his role. I had to buy this VHS, which has a great cover, and see this shit because of the illogical IMDb user rating and some of the ten-star reviews. I have just checked the authors, and each of them had only one brief review (“L.I.N.X.”) released in IMDb, and nothing more. Why do they promote such garbage? My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "L.I.N.X. Conexão Letal" ("L.I.N.X.Lethal Connection")
