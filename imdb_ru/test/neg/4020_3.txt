This film gets 3 for lousy writing, poor technical relevance and continuity issues. Some people gave this movie 10 - and maybe it's ok if you just beat it for its funny factor. However, technically this is an inept movie series from start to finish, created by 3 authors, actors and film crew. It really was true for almost all TV shows, because they were intended as an entertainment program, especially for children. And there is nothing bad in it, but it is not “high art” !! Spy Smasher earns less than the average, compared to other TV shows, because it has even lower quality and has serious problems with continuity - even for the series. It was common for the series to have a “coat hanger” - that is, a moment at the end of the episode, which looked as if a good guy was dying, but miraculously survives when the next episode begins. BUT, in this film, everything is much funnier and funnier. You literally SEE that the hero dies in the last episode, but next they shot the scene again and showed that he really DIED (although they clearly showed that he bought the farm in the last one)! Time and again in SPY SMASHER he seems to die, but in the next episode they show it from a different angle, and he somehow escaped death - even if he fell 1500 feet into the river, fell into a buzz or something something like that. <Br /> <br /> Watch this movie not for its quality, but in order to laugh or find out what it is like to go to the movies on a Saturday morning a decade ago.
