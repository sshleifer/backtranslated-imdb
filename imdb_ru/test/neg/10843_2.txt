Ben Affleck, who is about to marry, is shaken up in a plane crash and contacts one of the other passengers (Sandra Bullock, forcing himself to act crazy). Who is to blame for this inept, ugly swamp? It was so badly edited when I looked in the credits, it was not to read the name of the editor - it was to see if the person really took out a loan! Replete with clichés, fabrications and Sandra Bullock in the mask of a raccoon, the film is not even engaged in the creation of chemistry between the two main characters. There is no laughter: a scene in a gay bar with Affleck could have laughed a lot if it weren’t so stupid (bar regulars are a big noisy bunch! They are in cash). It shouldn't matter, except to make Ben relax a little, but the direction of the whole scene is wrong, and the result is not visible, because the idiot editor cuts off ... or was it the whole movie he had? This is a small moment, but it is typical of this film, an amateur pop art that wants to be a sharp modern comedy, but does not have the courage. This is especially for the bottom shelf in your video store. * from ****
