Very short: a bad movie. If you are looking for pure action, not a brain (or “illusion” of the brain) or you are less than 15 years old and you like Bruce Willis, this is a movie. Also, don’t expect the script to be consistent or even believable if you think a little, so don’t do it if you just want to have some fun.
