This overly simplistic scenario, consisting mainly of one character, should in no way be interpreted as an entertainment program. In fact, the material for eighteen minutes is enough, and even this will seriously undermine your attention. Zero characters outside of Noble Willingham are designed. Endless closeups of lips and phones cause sleep, and the script is so underdeveloped that chimpanzees could write it. In fact, this whole sad thing should not even be filmed. A tape recording would be more than enough to put you to sleep. Definitely not recommended. - MERK
