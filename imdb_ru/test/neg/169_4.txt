I think I looked at the heavily edited version, because it was not as visual as I expected - based on other feedback I heard. <br /> <br /> In addition to 1. writing the same person who wrote “Emmanuel” (1974), Emmanuel Arsan, 2. the main character, who is a sexually free spirit, and 3. located in the exotic region of Asia, “Lor” does not have the same talent as his predecessor. br /> <br /> I just found this film too talkative about philosophical topics that really don’t interest me, for example, the voyeurous, open relationship between Lor and Nick: “I’m just pleased with what brings her pleasure” ... something like that. I cannot relate to this mentality, and the film / characters really do not shed light. <br /> <br /> The second half of the search for the Mara tribe just seemed like a completely separate film. The one that was indifferent. By that time, I just hoped that she would turn into porn, so that oh at least he will keep my interest. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just don’t understand. <br /> <br /> I'll leave it at that.
