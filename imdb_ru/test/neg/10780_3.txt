If you go home for the weekend, you are very bored and have no desire to move, and for the next few hours you have absolutely nothing to do with your life, you might laugh at this movie. Acting skills, screenplay and the overall creation of a film from this film are actually not so bad, so they really allow you to relive it. This is a film they showed in their high school health lessons to talk about the dangers of premarital sex. Or they could also show it to teach the dangers of very lame music - that “rock” band in which Brian Austin Green plays is really terrible, I think that this is a much greater threat to society than unmarried parents.
