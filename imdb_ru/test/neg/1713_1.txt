Do the following: Get a copy of this movie and a friend. Put a friend 10 dollars on the fact that they can not sit out this whole movie. They can neither distract their gaze nor distract. Now watch your friend. Winning or losing, you get 10 dollars for entertainment. <br /> <br /> Infuriates me endlessly when people watch a movie and rush to give it 1 out of 10 or to sum up their thoughts, “it is sucked out”, (And when they are asked “Why?”, They answer: “ that ". Ahhh). That is why this film exists. For me, the only goal is to say: “Here! This is a terrible movie! THIS is 1 out of 10! <br /> <br /> This movie is just awful. <br /> <br /> The recent trend of movie parodies has made them become more formal, this film fails in all aspects. It's not funny. It is not interesting. And for some parodies it is completely inaccurate! Horrible game Unfriendly dialogue. Crazy story Scary "special effects". One inane gag after another. And what's even worse, there is not even useless nudity to somehow make it fleetingly worthwhile. <br /> <br /> This film jumps over idiocy, stumbles from stupidity and finds itself face to face with a moron. Even I, who loves a good movie “test your brain behind the door,” found himself physically excited watching this. This film is not even "Hard Ticket To Hawaii", so terrible, this is good, bad ... THIS IS JUST BAD. <br /> <br /> NOTE. I really challenged a friend to watch this as described above. Not only was he unable to get through all this, he had a headache and it took him a couple of minutes because he felt a little ill. True story. <br /> <br /> I could not emphasize this rating anymore ... loud 1 out of 10!
