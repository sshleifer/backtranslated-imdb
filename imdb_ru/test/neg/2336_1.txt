How does David Lynch do it? Unlike legions of people with thick black-rimmed glasses and pretentious film critics who praise his name, I just don’t understand how this guy is paid for such a prank. How can Lynch casually merge the remaining footage from a failed television pilot into a senseless, badly acting mess and make critics enthusiastic about this and really include it in the best years? <br /> <br /> I am puzzled. If you're looking for a good noir film, rent a Bound. If you are looking for a good puzzle movie, try Memento. But be careful with this overly ubiquitous smelly, unless your idea of ​​a fun night spends 2.5 hours of your life and $ 3.50 of your hard-earned money.
