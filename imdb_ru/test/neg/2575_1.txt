Forget the fact that most people expect a thriller from Seagal. This film simply had no meaning. Very long, stretched and boring. The scenes were much longer than they should have been - the camera often focused on something for long periods of time when absolutely nothing happened. A cure for insomnia. Seagal's worst movie to date (I like some of his other films). 1/10
