It is a pity that a film with such good cinematography as this one had no plot that was supported by the works of Sarah Cowley (cinematography) and Adam Lichtenstein (editing the film), and, above all, there is no point in what is happening in Mexico. City. The film tries to be a very realistic depiction of life in the city, but it cannot do this. It's a shame, a lot of the film wasted. An American woman is trying to find her brother who has been abducted. The first narration of the story is powerful and interesting, very realistic, but there seems to have been no attempt to compile a more detailed account of this challenge, especially when it comes to the attitude of the staff of the US Embassy in Mexico City. when dealing with a problem like this. Compare, for example, with Frantic (1988), which deals with a similar problem. Something similar can be said about the role of local authorities. Compare, for example, with Todo el Poder (1999). The film is worth seeing if you want to feel the look of the City itself, paying little attention or not paying attention to a rather weak “plot” and numerous turns that require a rather extensive suspension of disbelief. Who will believe that the Mexican patrol from Mexico City is going to go all the way to catch the main characters to the Mexican-American border? And that this policeman can use his radio from the border to Mexico! Only the producers of this film. It is worth noting that, unlike Frida and other films about Mexico, at least these Mexicans speak Spanish.
