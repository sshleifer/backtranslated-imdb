A young woman, Jodie Foster, is a witness to the killing of the mafia, reports the killing to the local police and herself is a victim of militants. Professional killer Dennis Hopper, hired by the mafia, pursues her to prepare for a strike, but in the end he falls in love with her. Then, as a parody of the Stockholm syndrome, which determines the case when the kidnapped hostage begins to like and cooperate with the kidnapper, Jodie Foster, too, falls in love with his kidnapper, makes love, and both prepare to escape. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hopper, an actor, is trying to join the creative ambitions of director Dennis Hopper. The result is disappointing and does not keep up with the artistic level of a great performer, like Dennis Hopper. There are no thrills here, and the script is sometimes naive and predictable. The film is to some extent saved from the performance of Jodie Foster, who is not at his best, but still shines with his talent, beauty and gift. Of historical interest is the short appearance of Vincent Price and, in a small act, Charlie Soane, known for his big role in Wall Street. <br /> <br /> If you decide to spend 116 minutes to see a movie, this is not a total loss; This film offers light entertainment, but we expect much more from the director of The Light Horseman and the actress who gave us the character of Sarah Tobias in Defendants.
