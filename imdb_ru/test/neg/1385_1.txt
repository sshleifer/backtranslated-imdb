That's right, I can't watch Comedy Central anymore just because I can't watch repeated commercials for this show. I will tell you the truth, this is a terrible show, not because I am offended by it, but because Carlos Mencia is one of the worst comedians I have ever seen. I rather watch Carrot Top giving the impression of George W. Bush than watching this hack without skills. And believe he calls himself the greatest. Even if he didn’t steal jokes, he still didn’t tell them well, he was too inappropriate and unoriginal. I remember, in a joke, he said: “Why do white people go camping? To pretend to be poor there for a week? ”Now, what does this mean? That all white people are rich? Another one I didn’t understand was when he was doing a parody of “The Price is True,” and he told the fat guy, “You have to know how much a refrigerator costs, you're fat,” and the fat guy had the saddest expression on his face. , But what does it mean? What are "fat people" always looking for refrigerators? These are the only two that I saw in his advertising. God knows what his show looks like. <br /> <br /> This show looks like Epic Movie and Date Movie ..
