After watching this movie on a boring Saturday, I could not understand why so many people liked it. It was not "warming" or "smart"; it was just a mixture of all the other "dissenting people who come together during the holiday and, despite their ideological differences, learn something about each other" ever filmed. <br /> <br /> Characters are stereotypical buyabes. Blacks, Hispanics, Jews, Asians, and Homosexuals — and they never do anything except what everyone expects from the characters in such a film. The black mother states that “everything is in order” when it is mentioned that another black character in the church instead of helping to prepare dinner (because all black people love the church), Hispanics can only speak Spanish when they greet each other or do exclamations, lesbians do only hug and kiss (and one of them is wearing a bandana. Because all lesbians dress like Ani DiFranko), and the Vietnamese family owns a video store. In Los Angeles Imagine this. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the film is called “What Prepares,” because each ethnic family prepares its version of what they think should be at Thanksgiving dinner! Black mother wants corn bread, macaroni and cheese, Latin Americans are shown cakes, Vietnamese family - fried spring pancakes; I am surprised that there was no bottle of Manishevets on the Jewish table. All this is manifested in the time-tested tradition of “musical editing”, where they play “Wipeout” Surfari, quickly switching instruments used in the melody to reflect the respective cultures. Isn't that cute? In any case, as soon as the director finishes, figuring out how different everyone is, he tries to show the inner humanity that we, like all people of all races, religions and cultures, share, inventing improbable and overly dramatic conflicts for each of the families with whom have to deal, It would be nice to mention each of these conflicts, but be sure that these are really surprises, that is, if you slept in the first half of the film. The theme of “family shame” is quite strong. <br /> <br /> In general, if you're the kind of person who likes these newfangled films that revolve around stories about the intertwining of unlikely characters, well, you still won't like this movie. If you like advanced food installations around the table, then you need to put this in turn to Netflix. But if you like stereotypes and clichés, then be sure to ask for it at Christmas. Or Hanukkah. Or Kwanzaa.
