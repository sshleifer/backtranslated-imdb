Carmen is a prostitute who lives seducing and stealing soldiers of the Spanish army; she is without doubt the best femme fatale at the moment. When a man resists her charming attention, she decides to do everything to destroy him. In the end, he gets into her network, and he will have to do everything he ever hated, just for being with Carmen. Despite the fact that Paz Vega is very beautiful, she does not seem to be a gypsy woman (like Carmen), and neither her game nor Sbaraglia are good. The story turns out to be very boring, and, in most cases, it is very absurd, and intends to seem true. in the same way, scenarios and special effects, despite the fact that they are not, but they are not acceptable, and too artificial for a historical film as it is. To summarize, dull and bad, with a very absurd development, there is much better to watch.
