Wicked Little Things has an excellent overview: an empty house next to an abandoned mine in a forest with a tragic past; the family moves into the house and strange things start to happen; little creepy kids start to appear here and there, making creepy little kids. But this is where the mind and the potential fun end. This group of children was sealed in the mine many decades ago, and now they roam the woods (with poor makeup) with weapons in search of meat. Oh, I get it, this is a film about zombie ghosts. Hmmm .... although I can appreciate someone who is trying something new in this genre, it just didnâ€™t work. What was the motivation of children in their quest to devour the flesh? Why do they need weapons? Has anyone else imagined that all the filmmakers gathered around the giggling daily shots, because they felt it would be a cool / scary movie? I found that in thirty minutes I felt a familiar retirement, that I just wasted my time on the next modern holiday of shit. While the acting was good, and the production / cinema was of good quality, the script itself suffered from a lack of knowledge about the genre of supernatural horror. A bunch of children walking through the mall, worse than this pack of poorly disguised rodents. <br /> <br /> This film is not scary, and although I can appreciate this story, maybe I even liked it if I read it instead of watching it, I still have to say that Evil Little Things more accurately called Evil Little Turd.
