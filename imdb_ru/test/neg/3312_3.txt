OK. Well, I think it was worth my time to view it * once *, but I will not watch it again. There are a few things in this movie that annoyed me. <br /> <br /> First, dude ... I really hated characters. I had the same problem with Sid and Nancy. I find it difficult to rationalize that I spend a lot of time on characters that I really don’t care about and cannot communicate with. The point is not that the actors or the script were technically bad; it was that the characters were written in such a way that I just despised them, and when the film went on, I almost wanted to see the sky fall on them. And that brings me to the second problem, and the question that, I think, lies at the heart of this film: was it the intention to simply document this generation and these types of Bohemians who (I suppose) roamed Europe in the 60s? Was it intended to criticize and beat them? Or was this movie a kind of warning? My final assessment of the film (that is, when determining whether there was anything suitable for salvation here) depends on this issue. <br /> <br /> Despite this, these characters are really unlikely, and, as a result, it is difficult to really give a crap about the plot or what happens to them. If it was a kind of statement about this generation, then the film becomes a little more tolerant. Clearly, Schroeder is not a kind of square of the geriatric establishment, so the way he is moving here has more weight than, say, countless stupid AIP films made in the counterculture of the 60s or related to it. <br /> <br /> In a bare minimum, there are two things in this film: first, the soundtrack (obviously). I like the way Cymbaline is used here, and others have mentioned it as well, since it occupies a leading position in the film. I assume that if you are a fan of Pink Floyd and want to see him for this reason, what you read here will most likely not prevent you from seeing it (this also will not stop me). The curiosity of listening to Pink Floyd in a movie may be enough to barely make it out. <br /> <br /> Secondly, there are some beautiful landscapes. Ibiza looks like a good place to visit. Maybe I just got tired of watching Los Angeles, New York and Chicago in films, but European films that are not in a hurry to show us Europe (beautiful or ugly - mostly beautiful here) are always welcome. <Br /> <br /> But I really don’t see a special genius here. No revolutionary camera work, even morality, tone, message, sensitivity or plot, which could say something new. Perhaps what was revolutionary about this was that it came from a guy like Schroeder, a film that criticizes thinking, which at least partially made his films competitive. In this sense, this is an honest film; there is no glorification of the extreme excesses of the 60s, which perhaps you can expect. In fact, the image of the characters in this film closely reflects (in my opinion, somewhat distorted) the modern cultural memory of that generation. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah, a bunch (yawn) of nudity and sex here; nothing new if you watch movies of this period. I guess it was considered new or provocative or something at the time. I do not find it offensive or exciting (I doubt that you too); rather, it only prolongs the work of an already tedious film. In its own way, this particular use of sexuality in the films of that time (especially European) became something of a cliché. But I think with hindsight you cannot blame them; just at that decade they were able to “get away with it,” and I suppose (I suppose here) that the very presence of this kind of graphic sexuality was in itself a political or social statement (in the sense that sexuality was a part of life, which this generation was not going to be as strange as their parents). <br /> <br /> Should I watch this? If you're a Pink Floyd fan, of course ... I think it's worth a look. In any case, The Valley is the best movie. I entered this film, waiting mainly for what I received. If you don’t usually watch these fictional, avant-garde films and don’t know what to expect, it will be damn unpleasant. This is a normal, healthy reaction :) <br /> <br /> If you are not a Pink Floyd fan, I’m not sure why you are spending time here. I noticed that one guy who left a comment really enjoyed this movie, so maybe I just missed something. I don't need guys running in slow motion from fireballs, special effects, explosions or something similar to enjoy the movie. But I need some kind of pen - I need to find something that I like in the film, and, as a rule, I need to sympathize with some aspects of the difficult situation of the characters (except that some new movie will work; cinematography and etc). d). There is simply nothing to hold here, except for the magnificence of Pink Floyd. Which * is * enough to make it bearable. At a minimum, if you're a Pink Floyd fan, you'll love it a bit with Cymbaline, I promise.
