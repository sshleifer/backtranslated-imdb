Oh my God. Why is it so difficult for Nickelodeon to make a decent movie? I mean, this film could have been good, but it was: <br /> <br /> A. Too short B. Quite superficial, stereotypical and offensive for some C. Ultimately, pointless <br /> < br /> First of all, the thing “wear a nerd to look cool” was VERY consumer, VERY superficial, VERY meaningless, and VERY insulting. He has stereotypical nerds - stupid faces, glasses, never kissing, holidays with mom, etc. Well, maybe the reason is that the guy never kissed the girl, because he is gay! Does this mean that all gay - nerds? And what's wrong with being friends with your mother? <br /> <br /> Of course, the final was the worst. The whole drama of the film revolved around Zoe, who recognized that Chase loved her, and blah blah blah, and then when Chase finally decided to tell her <br /> <br /> A. he did not tell her about it personally, because that right before he was going, a typical distraction came along with B., he tried to send her a text message, but her PDA fell into a fountain and died before she received a message. <br /> <br /> End. <br /> <br /> HOW IS IT GOOD ????? I mean, why caricaturists just can not change anything in the series? Many of us would like these two to come together. Why can't we see it? I mean, are producers really so non-creative that they can't come up with new problems to go with the changes in the series? So they should stick to the same plot and shape and make as many episodes as possible just by using them? After a while, it becomes dull and frustrating. <br /> <br /> I WANTED TO SEE SOME ACTUAL ROMANT HERE, DRAW IT! <br /> <br /> Good. I ended up with my pompous information.
