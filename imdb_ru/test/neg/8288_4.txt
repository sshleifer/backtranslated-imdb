I have to say that I'm not a big fan of Troma films. Of course, I saw only three of them (or four, including this one), but two (Bloodsucking Freaks and Mother's Day) are widely known as the best, which makes me believe that everyone else is not worth seeing. This, of course, may seem in the case of Prom Day, which is a catchy blow to the popular eighties slasher. Although the film is never particularly bad (considering the type of film), it is never particularly good; and by the end all I could think about was: “why did I bother to watch it?”. Anyway, the conspiracy sees that some girl dies on the racetrack, and soon after; more people are starting to die. Naturally, there are several possible suspects; but it's hard to really take care of everything that happens. Of course, in the cut; this is the blood that is the most important, and considering the background list of the Vime in red things, I expected them to stop. There are some decent murder scenes, and some of them are terrible; but it is never shocking that this dull slasher actually does based on a festive event in the American calendar. It is worth noting that in this film there is a small role for the mean-spirited queen Linnie Quigley, but the rest of the actors deserve no mention. The direction, plot and its execution are all very mundane; and I will say this if you are not a big Troma fan or someone who wants to hunt down every slasher ever made; don't bother with this movie
