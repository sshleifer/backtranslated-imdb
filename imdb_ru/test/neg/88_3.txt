Wow, what an overrated film it turned out to be! It was supposed to be "an extremely disturbing story about a crazy killer holding a woman hostage and horrified in her house." Well, I doubt that this terrorized the audience in the early 50s, and I know that it will make today's audience sleep. <br /> <br /> “It sends a shiver through the back,” the New York Times said. No, the only shiver I get is that there is someone on the planet who believes in something, that the New York Times is typing something. <br /> <br /> Well, it was about an abnormal man who briefly held a woman hostage in her house except for a man. "Howard Wilton" (Robert Ryan) was actually harmless and friendly. In fact, it was one of the nicest roles that Ryan has ever played! Yes, Wilton was crazy, but he never hurt a woman and wanted to be trusted only by a friend. <br /> <br /> Even after some time, the film became boring and lasted very little, except for a large number of yaks. <br /> <br /> Beware, my reader ... it sucks.
