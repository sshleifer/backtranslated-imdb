First of all, let me say this ... Ghost Story .... hello!?! <br /> <br /> If any of the other people who broke this film from beginning to end, realized this fact, their feedback would be completely different. The fact that the characters disappeared whenever the main character turned around to watch had to be a dead hand. This film was not declared a ghost story when you went to rent it at the video store, not even a hint that this is the BIGGEST mistake that the studio that sold it made. Their intention was not to advertise it as a ghost story, to confuse you, as if the main character was confused when you tried to figure it out. The problem is that they lost too many viewers; the ghosts seemed “too human and real” without any conventional control signs, images or special effects that Hollywood normally uses to let you know that you are seeing a ghost now ... and this is what they were trying to do. The main character does not know that she sees ghosts, and the viewer, too. Now do you understand? If you understand that the main character sees ghosts, you will understand the film and you will not be so annoyed by what is perceived as a serious omission in the continuity or shortcomings of the plot. <br /> <br /> I admit it. It is said that it was still not a good movie, just not as bad as everyone else did it. Just understand, if you plan to watch this movie, all you see is “not always” what you think. 4 out of 10 for acting, 3 for originality, 5 for the plot and 5 for the frightening factor, although there were some bloody and creepy moments. Still not a good movie, just misunderstood.
