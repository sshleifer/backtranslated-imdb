What a disgusting movie. This is, without a doubt, a low-class B film. The German elite stormtroopers massively attack Russian bunkers like the old battle of the First World War. The game is mediocre, the plot is thin and threadlike. Sometimes it's hard to know where it goes. The action sequences are rather useless (if they exist), except for the fact that they use genuine equipment / vehicles of World War II. This is by no means the same level as “Salvation Pvt. Ryan or Platoon. Many useless character development attempts that lead nowhere. The old topic is a good officer / bad officer, this is very predictable. Even the action sequences look like they are set up by a 12-year-old child. I could direct better. It’s a pity that this is the same guy who starred in “Das Boot (The Boat)” because it was a damn good movie. He must have enjoyed himself too much after this success, because he had lost his connection with the film. I bought it on DVD, better to rent it.
