The biggest problem with “In Search of the Historical Jesus” is that the search is quite small. Shik-Sunn made these “documentary” films in the 1970s and only in the 1980s, where they presented interviews with “experts” and discussions about “science” and “facts” to substantiate what the title of the film was counting on. cash in on. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the “Historical Jesus” is just the third stage of the dramatization of the life of Christ. Unlike the more prominent Shik-Sunnah “In Search of Noah's Ark,” who spends most of his time discussing the possibility that the ark rests on earth today, and where this may be, this film is mostly a story of Jesus without effort, to prove or disprove its existence. The famous Shroud of Turrin is mentioned, but few other detective works are devoted to a lot of time on the screen. <br /> <br /> For fans of such quasi-documentary films as The Threat of Jupiter, In Search of the Bigfoot, etc., this film does not offer much.
