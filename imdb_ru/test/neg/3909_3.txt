If you are one of those people who really do not like fiction because of their sometimes contrived ideas and surrealistic worldviews, you'd better stay away from the space truckers of Stuart Gordon! This is really an absurd space adventure, filled with eccentric characters, colorful kitsch and funny plot twists. Frankly, I probably would never have taken care of this film if it were not for the name of Gordon on the credits. This guy is pretty close to being a genius in the horror genre, with undeniable milestones such as From Beyond and Re-Animator in his resume. Apparently, Stuart Gordon likes his humor as perverted as possible! Once he had completely gone through the comedy top (with Re-Animator), but with a slight difference that quirky humor was effective there. What is really wrong for space truckers is that most of the gags do not lead anywhere, and the completely exaggerated atmosphere only works in small doses. In the end, all that remains is sometimes a funny, but completely unnecessary mess. Dennis Hopper and Charles Dance (or at least half Charles Dance) are always a joy to watch, and the still amazing Barbara Crampton plays a small part at the end of the film. Crampton was the usual heroine of Stuart Gordon in previous horror films. The history of space truckers is as stupid as they are. Dennis Hopper plays a self-made loner who is sick of his work. Who would not be when you are transporting pigs across the galaxy for a company called Interpork? He sees him running, bringing his muse to the ground. They swim in space pirates and find out that their cargo is intended to destroy half of the universe! Stuart Gordon wisely returned to horror after this little escapade. Since Space Truckers, he has already made the exalted "King of Ants" and the absolutely brilliant "Dagon"
