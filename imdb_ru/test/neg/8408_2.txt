I really liked the first film, I enjoyed it mostly, but I thought that there was nothing special about it. However, compared to this mess, it looks much better. Why they felt the need to make a film was beyond my powers, but they had to know that it could not be compared with the first film when they could return Ruth Gordon to repeat her role. This story follows Rosemary's baby and things like that, but in fact it’s a kind of mess, it’s not helping that the film is a television film, and the television look shines very well. It also has a more comedic tone, and this greatly hinders him if they really felt the need to make a sequel, they had to make this movie with an R rating, which had some nakedness and bloodyness. I’m sure it would still be pretty bad, but at least it would be more watchable and fun than this film, despite its attempt to be funny. I saw it on Monstervision, and Joe Bob could not say anything good about this in the introduction, and I have nothing much to say. I must say that it was a sequel that the light should never have seen.
