What a shame that some good talent was wasted. This is a tedious and overly shy movie that can tell its story in half the time. Does this Derek Jacobi perform two roles under this beard? Damn it, who would have thought. <br /> <br /> Emotional reward at the end was weak and unsatisfactory. Of course, you should not tolerate the soft length of the film for. I felt completely depressed. <br /> <br /> The sound was terrible. At first they used stock music. Secondly, during the dialogue it was so loud that it was difficult to make out the words. Only three sound engineers and an intern? More people were listed in the lists for accounting or lawyer. <br /> <br /> Some operators worked well, and the actors coped well with a mediocre scenario. <br /> <br /> Not a good viewing time, at least for me.
