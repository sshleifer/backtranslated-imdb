Diane Lane, Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson and Thomas Jane ..... In my opinion, a good cast, but they were completely wasted in this film. <br /> <br /> There was no real direction, there was no unusual. It turns out that in fact the whole film was very predictable from start to finish. Mickey Rourke had a really annoying assistant who just annoyed you from the very beginning. Rosario Dawson was completely wasted, and there was not even point in including her character in the film. <br /> <br /> I really believe that this is one of those DVD movies that everyone will very quickly forget about. shame, because the film could be much better.
