BAND HANDS <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: mono <br /> <br /> Edwardian physician (Eric Porter) uses a modern-fashioned Freudian analysis of a young girl (Angharad Rhys), who turns out to be Jack the Ripper's daughter and just as deadly ... <br /> <br /> Hammer’s incredible horror, in which a decent social figure takes responsibility for a beautiful young girl. , even when she tries to kill everyone and everything with the help of various deadly guns (broken mirrors, hairpins nn and t. e.)! L.W. Davidson’s script wanders aimlessly from one murder to another, sacrificing the inner undercurrent of the material (Porter’s obvious attraction to Rhys) in favor of a commercial melodrama, and the tone remains subdued throughout. Some of the blood scenes are surprisingly bright, even for Hammer, and they were cut from the original American release (despite the MPAA’s R rating), although the full version is now available on home video. Porter and Rees give excellent presentations, and the climax in St. Paul’s Cathedral is a definite highlight, but the rest of the film is strangely empty and does not affect. Directed by Peter Sasdi.
