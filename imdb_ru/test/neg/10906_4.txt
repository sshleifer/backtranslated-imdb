The cookie cutter begins working overtime in this obvious and unoriginal love story. The plot, as it is, was composed a trillion times, so there is no need to talk about it. Suffice it to say that all 12-year-old girls will love this film, while the rest of us will be forced to make a face. Even the soundtrack is terrible! Not that I didn’t like figure skating, although I don’t like it, this is what I don’t like clichés, bad movies.
