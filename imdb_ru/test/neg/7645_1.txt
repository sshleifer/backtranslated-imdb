This film was terrible, and the only reason for which it was shot, was the fact that the story liked the extreme left. I consider myself moderate, so I was able to see this film as a bunch of garbage. Although I am not a fan of Bush, your dislike of GW is not reason enough to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> For a start, the film was shot on such a low quality film that it was shot as cheap, not fancy. In addition, the characters do not have enough depth. Chris Cooper's character was a bad parody of George W. Bush; better suited to saturday evening than to drama film. The remaining characters are walking clich√©s and bad facsimiles of other characters from much better films. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs!
