Not the best of WIP, but not the worst. To be honest, I feel guilty about laughing at this film, considering that it should have been a career minimum for all participants. Nevertheless, acting, dialogue, ridiculous scenarios and the boom microphone that is constantly present penetrate my life every time and, of course, reinforce its poor movie charm. As I am a fan of Linda Blair, the highest (or topless) awards go to Sybil Dunning. In addition, special thanks to Henry Silva, the only one in the cast that does not play his role too seriously. When watching a movie now makes me look at Stella Stevens character more intently. She plays the chief officer, and I wonder where Hillary Clinton decided to adopt her current appearance and behavior. In the end, I'm sure she needed to look no further than her husband's video collection to find this movie. Not that I judged. I myself have seen it several times, and all this makes me think about what would happen if Mr. Clinton was allowed to install a hot tub in the Oval Office. Hmmm
