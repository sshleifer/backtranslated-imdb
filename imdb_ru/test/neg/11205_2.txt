Listen, this film is terrible ... "in the plot" there are twins who are left unattended by their selfless parents and left in the care of a series of nannies and nannies, all of which the children drive away, being completely nasty. In the end, a children's engineer, a former convict of Beverly D'Angelo, will become their new nanny, you care, why? And D'Angelo watches a televised talk show about selling children and decides that she will try to sell the twins ... and, oh, you don't want to know. This is all very unpleasant and not at all funny. In fact, the announcer outlined this film even before he appeared on the TV channel, which I watched! Just do not waste a minute of your life on this pile of garbage, right?
