I will never understand why when a studio like Universal buys a musical, it then kills it when it displays it. My first thought, when I saw Eva Gardner and Robert Walker in the title role, I saw something from MGM, which at that time featured the best musicals. Boy, I was wrong and disappointed. <br /> <br /> One Touch Of Venus, starring Mary Martin, Kenny Baker and John Boles on Broadway, took part in 567 performances in the 1943-1945 season, and Gardner, Walker and Tom Conway play the roles that Martin , Baker and Boles played on stage. The musical "Kurt Weil-Ogden Nash" with a book by Nash and S.J. Perelman was the return car for Mary Martin, who re-established herself as the Queen of Broadway after a disappointing venture in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Look at the names that went into this show. Considering who was in charge of the book, I expected to see a sparkling mind in this performance. Instead, I got a pretty pedestrian scenario, as if all the wit had been drained. Eva Arden is trying to catch up by playing her usual Friday role for a girl with Tom Conway, but this is too much for Eve. <br /> <br /> The story concerns the window of Robert Walker's department store, which kisses the very valuable statue of Venus, which comes alive in the face of Ava Gardner. Of course, when the statue goes missing, Conway shouts at the law and is suspicious of Walker, the last person to be with the statue. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is Walker, dealing with Gardner, and what will happen to both of them. For reasons I don’t understand, Eilu Wilson, of course, was christened Ava, and Walker sings only a couple of lines. Singing is carried by Dick Haymes and Olga San Juan, who play Walker's friends and colleagues. Of course, the singers Mary Martin and Kenny Baker performed the songs on Broadway. You would think that Haymes would play the role of Walker, at least. At least it was awkward. <br /> <br /> Only three songs survived from the score: “Do not look now, but my heart shows it is he” and the incomparable “Speak Low”. Heims Silky Baritone showed the greatest advantage in “Speak Low”, which Martin and Baker sang in a duet on Broadway. For some reason, the words of one of the greatest men of the last century, Ogden Nash, were written by Ann Ronnell. I suspect that the infamous Codex worked here. <br /> <br /> In Lee Server’s biography of Ava Gardner, he mentions the brief commotion that Ava had with Robert Walker when she quarreled with her current man, Howard Duff. When Duff and Gardner reunited, Walker took it badly and did not talk at all to Gardner behind the camera. I am sure that the fact that they both were not in better work did not help either. <br /> <br /> We hope that some repertoire company will do One Touch Of Venus, and you will see, by the way, Weil, Nash and Perelman wrote it.
