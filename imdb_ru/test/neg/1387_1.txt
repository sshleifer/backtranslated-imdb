Did you find the name funny? Oh you didn't? Well, that's because you are alarmed. Learn to laugh, because if you do not laugh, you do not live. So please lower your standards regarding what you think is funny with the standard of a simple baby. Now do you find it funny? Still no?! Well, that's because you are full of yourself and too easily offended. If you do not laugh, you do not live. And if you don’t like me, then send me a letter with hatred so that I can write another review and indicate how much I get letters with hatred, and try to turn it into what I think I’m a bad ass. Are you already laughing at my funny name? Still no?!?! OK, that's all! You are racist! You have to laugh, otherwise you are racist. Why don't you laugh? Oh, it's not funny!?! No, this can not be. I want it to be fun, so for this it is !! Laugh, damn it !!!! You are welcome!!! Deedeedee !! Durdurdur !! You are welcome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Good, that's it. Where is my notebook and pen? Where are my DVDs of Richard Pryor? I need to write some jokes for my show. <br /> <br /> And ...... scene. Thanks. <br /> <br /> This is basically what you get from Mencia in about 23 minutes. Please do yourself a favor and change the channel when the hobo show starts. Even basic cable channels are 100 times better than this. I don't even say that because I hate it. I actually. This show is like watching grass grow. Not sure, though, at least the grass does not steal the joke. I honestly try to save your time. I even tried to watch his show. I said to myself: "Maybe he is not so bad." But no, he is. I completely disconnected when I watched his show. I tried to get together during the commercial break and focus on the show, but I could not. I disconnected again, I think, I was thinking about something more interesting, for example, remodel a bed, vacuuming or folding socks. Before I knew it, the show was over. Yes, this is so bad. <br /> <br /> Here is my last thought: in 30 minutes you can do so many things, except that this guy screams for half an hour. Do not watch the show, which is trying to spread the face in vain. I can support shows that try to ease the tension of racing wars, but this guy just shows more racism, and does not stop him.
