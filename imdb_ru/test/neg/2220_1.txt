There I sit at home in the morning, suddenly my brother switches to what seems to be the stupidest film I've ever seen. Given that it was the 70s, and the special effects were not supposed to escalate, this film roughly corresponded to the definition of shit. Stupid monsters, a stupid storyline and wacky scenery made this movie the worst I've ever seen. So bad in fact, that I didnâ€™t even finish it, I got to a certain point, then I continued to see how long I could walk without putting a rope around my neck and not hanging myself. (I'm just kidding, ha ha) HORRIBLE MOVIE
