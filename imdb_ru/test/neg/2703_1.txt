As a cartoon, Spytroops Movie was pretty bad. It lasts only 44 minutes, and yet several battles take place, culminating in the destruction of the COBRA headquarters. One depressor was the very beginning of the movie. The animation battle, which was better than the rest of the film, turned out to be a kind of battle simulator. This right was a serious cut and made the rest of the film untrustworthy. Then there was the problem of a shipwreck associated with his parrot, and rushed into some room where no one had checked for several days. What happened to the surveillance cameras? <br /> <br /> At COBRA, there were only a few characters, and the rest were BAT robots. Apart from the many corridors, there seemed to be no weapons, tanks, trucks or other equipment at the base of COBRA. Then there was the stupid opinion that 100 complex androids can be created overnight. The plot was stupid, even if it was intended for small children. Spongebob, Powerpuff Girls and even Barney Dinosaur pay more attention to their stories. <br /> <br /> The characters were quite good, except that I could never understand anything Destro said, and Cobra Commander was stupid and not a very big part of a villain. In fact, with the exception of Storm Shadow and Xartan, the rest of the COBRA characters were funny and hardly impressive. Joe Joe's characters were pretty good. Scarlett, agent faces, road block and snake eyes were my favorites here. Shipwrecked and Beach Head were the worst. Shipwreck is written as stupid, and Beach Beach sounds like a surfer dude of the 1990s. I guess writer Larry Hama was trying to make a character that teens liked, but he wasn’t at ease for a decade. Just listening to Spicoli on Beach Head (Fast Times in Ridgemont High), I was wondering if the new Joe Joe was going to smoke a club before a big mission. <br /> <br /> The CGI was pretty good, except that the Cobra Commander had a sharp, spastic walk, and the cars didn’t look realistic. The flying tank and the explosions were not very impressive. Old-style animation would be much better than this. Since Hasbro is said to like to do things cheaply, they got what they paid for. I had problems viewing all of this, it was just boring, and I lacked neither soul nor spirit of Joe. Even old Joe Joe commercials would be better. In fact, the DVD had additions like four or five commercials for Joe Spying Joe, and these videos were much more interesting than the movie. The commercials were more child-oriented fun and spirit. The commercials were live and the film was boring.
