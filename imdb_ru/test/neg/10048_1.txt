The English translation of the title on the DVD version of this film is The Cemetery of Horrors, but I think this should be a mistake. It was supposed to be called the Graveyard of Horrors. The terrible game, terrible editing, terrible history and terrible music - all this makes this terrible film best in a terrible cemetery. <br /> <br /> Awful.
