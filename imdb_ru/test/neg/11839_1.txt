Well, let's do one thing right, I like dinosaur movies, even bad ones. So, with that in mind, let's continue. “Raptor” is really a terrible film, in fact it is not even a film in itself, since it is assembled from pieces of “Carnosaur”, “Carnosaur 2” and “Primary Species - Carnosaur 3”. There are new shots with Eric Roberts as a sheriff and his busty girlfriend running around looking confused, scared or something else she is trying to convey (badly) on an emotional scale, but then how can they react to what was shot by several years earlier? , Producers (yes, Roger Korman, I'm talking about you!) Even went on to hire 2 people from Carnosaur to play episodic roles, so that horrible death scenes can be reused! So this film is the cheapest of the cheapest. Watch 3 original films, there are no Oscar winners, but they have some value and entertainment value, but avoid the “Raptor”. Oh, it also has the most pointless sex scene that runs for almost 10 minutes! Do you think they tried to reduce the work time?
