I accidentally watched this movie on TV, and it was so incredibly awful that I could not turn it off. Every piece of wit and intelligence has been removed from the story of Oscar Wilde by an incompetent screenwriter. It hardly matters, because the terrible acting, the clich√© of camera work and the closed music would still spoil something like a decent script. The worst performance comes from Patrick Stewart, who is considered a ghostly, arrogant, incompetent, secondary Shakespeare's Ninompocom. "Get out of here!" he shouts at one stage, waving his arms like a pantomime fiend. A truly horrible film, and why it is surprising why Stewart, who can act when he is approached, has ruined his reputation by creating useless pieces of shit like this and XMen.
