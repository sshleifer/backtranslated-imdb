On the threshold to be unbearable. Somehow I remained a little interested, but was it because I really wanted to know what the “secret” was (which, I must say, is pretty damn obvious) or because I hoped that Scarlett Johansson would put on more outfit? This film is bad, and moreover, it is a shame to all the lonely, alcoholic southern professors of literature. Travolta wants his Oscar so much that he cries drunk in the bathroom after urinating. Sorry, mate. You were more likely to "Stay Alive." Not everyone can pull Peter Fonda in “Gold Uli”. If you need a brave anti-hero against Oscar, you must act. do not just puff up the screen. Stop this director before he / she (the name is vague on the floor) directs again!
