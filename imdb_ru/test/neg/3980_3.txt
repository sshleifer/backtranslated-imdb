Like most other people, I saw this film on Mystery Science Theater 3000. Despite the fact that he received several well-deserved "beard", this is one of the best films that will be shown on this show. <br /> <br /> The idea is better than even your usual Hollywood blockbuster these days; This poses some interesting moral dilemmas. Although the score is sometimes intrusive, it also gives some wonderful moments when Richard walks along the river. After watching the film, you can see where many plot developments probably looked very good on paper. Richardâ€™s discomfort in modern society is an interesting problem to think about, and the end would probably be a good 70s mind if previous cases weren't so stupid. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film is noticeably cheap, which makes the flaws even more obvious. The Clone Farm is obviously a college campus, and a beer can serves as the main plot point. Lena and Richard have no chemistry - we must assume that this is a meeting of kindred minds, but between them, it seems, there are no brain cells. Joke "old crazy couple" also becomes very old, very fast. There are also some mistakes that can be blamed for the wrong choice of director, for example, the decision to have a climate conversation beyond the reach of any audio equipment. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a noble effort, but nevertheless it is best to look at MST3K.
