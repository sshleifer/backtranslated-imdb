Oh my God! What can I say about Half Past Dead? I was really disappointed in this. I was thinking ... a movie about Steven Seagal! Great! We will see how he kicks people, throws them up and breaks bones. We might even see him fight with someone on sticks! Fine! <br /> <br /> However, a rude awakening awaited me. This film can be summarized as follows: <br /> <br /> Take the episode of team A, remove the attractive and fraudulent characters such as Murdoch, Hannibal, Mr. T and Face. Then ask the writer / director to write a story, even Ed Wood will be embarrassed, and he is too big a fan of the films The Matrix and John Woo for his own good. Add to this a group of people with really bad acting skills who do not have real names. And finally, add the main star, which hangs around the abdomen and seems to be no longer able to perform its own tricks. <br /> <br /> Result? Half past dead. Action so funny that at least made me smile. The holes in the plot are colossal, obviously large - for example, prisoners who during the invasion of the prison fight the invaders rather than try to escape. Or what about the prison itself, in which there is a warehouse of weapons, in which there are heavy machine guns and grenade launchers? You also have a helicopter (strikingly similar to Huey) with some kind of video game machine set in your nose. <br /> <br /> Then there is Sigal himself. I like the guy. He CAN fight. He is even witty, like Jean-Claude Van Damme, never will be. But throughout the film, I continued to hope for this great, defining battle scene. It never happened. Instead, we have a lot of people who shoot weapons and don't hit hell. I mean, when someone runs along a narrow corridor and you shoot him with a machine gun, there are not so many places where bullets can get, except along the corridor and at the target. And yet somehow they miss? Even the A-team will cringe from this nonsense. And then, when it comes to any kind of physical things one on one, we turn to the battered robbery of the Matrix, without the benefit of bullet time. People are beaten twenty feet in the air and all other ridiculous acrobatic nonsense. <br /> <br /> C'mon, Stephen, you're better than that. Your career could not be over. Say it is not so! <br /> <br /> This is instantly forgotten (except for the fact that I force myself to remember for the purposes of this review), and if you are watching it, try to find it funny in the Team-like way. But I doubt that this will be the first on someone else’s “rewritable” list. For justice, it is not. More like lunch.
