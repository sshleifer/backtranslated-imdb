In fact, there was nothing funny about this monster !! This film was an abomination. The absurdities in this film almost made me want to vomit !! I think the people responsible for this film took advantage of their audience. They took a relatively decent series of films (I said, decent, NOT GOOD !!) and completely defeated him, trying to put money in their pockets. Creating an Airplane! Hollywood was a way to make up this crappy movie. The worst thing about this is that no one in 1979 realized the silly events of the film (for example, a Concorde door exploding at some godless high altitude, or Patroni firing a cold pistol at the window on Mach 2 to avoid the NUCLEAR WAR !? !?!? .... what were they thinking about ???) were completely unreal or they just didn't care! I think this is the last of the two. The writers and directors of this “film”, if you want to call it that, really tried to suck up the Airport dynasty with this shit!
