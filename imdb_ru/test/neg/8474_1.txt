The satirical site Dateline Hollywood joked that Son of the Mask was the star of the joke that Jamie Kennedy had played in the New Line cinema for his show The Experiment of Jamie Kennedy. If only. And if only the film was half as ridiculous as this satirical film. <br /> <br /> “Mask” was the perfect way to pull up Jim Carrey’s face, which is so popular with many viewers; It also delighted men over 12, introducing Cameron Diaz. So, having a subsequent minus for both of them was not a good idea, plus you would think that New Line would learn their lesson after Dumb and Damberrer: When Harry Met Lloyd. But no ... although, to be fair, the presence of a completely new cast corresponds to the original comic (in which Mask passed from owner to owner). However, according to Lance Hazei and director Lawrence Guterman, there is nothing in return except for a steady stream of admittedly decent effects from the usual squadron of houses (Industrial light and magic that improves the dancing child "Ellie McBeel" and their own Baby's Day Out with Tippett Studio, Giant Killer Robots, Digital Dimension and so on in support) and even more indulge fans of cartoons when our hero works in an animation company (responsible for such gems as "Siamese Dad"), calling his character after Tex Avery and slave not only on links to classic cartoons, but also on real clips. <br /> <br /> The trouble is that the latter approach doesn’t really work, partly because most attempts to bring animated attributes to the live action fail (especially cars that are in a party mood), and mainly because that the tribute to the Flintstones, Woody Woodpecker, Duck Duck and especially the One Froggy Evening show how weak this film is in comparison. In addition, the film fits into the Chambolic farce along with intense feelings (the main theme of this story is family; our hero is not ready to have a son, and his sworn enemy - Alan Cumming as Norwegian god Loki - is far from Odin’s apple. Eyes ... and what Bob Hoskins is doing here as One, even after “Super Mario Bros.” is beyond my comprehension), and Kennedy is simply not in the same league as Kerry in the madman's stakes - although this is not true how he gets any help from the script. Also note that, unlike Diaz, very cute Treylor Howard (as the mother of Muskie’s son) does not have much to do; give her a mask might have helped the film. <br /> <br /> Further points are lost for throwing out Cumming, Hoskins, Stephen Wright and Magda Shubansky; for a suspiciously shorter execution time (which might explain some gaping holes in the plot and scenes that seem to be missing); and for the incredibly unsuccessful attempt to make a joke from the inside, when our hero failed to sell the concept of the "green guy" as an animated series - "Mask" really became an animated series in real life and it became much better to follow this continuation. The fact that it really opened in Britain before the US should tell you everything ... what's wrong with Blade: Trinity, New Line, seems to intend to drive the market into horrible sequels with the participation of the actors from Two Guys And A Girl. “What's next,“ Butterfly Effect 2 ”with Nathan Fillion? <br /> <br /> Someone will stop this.
