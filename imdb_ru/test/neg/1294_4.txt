After America had disaster budget films with a huge budget, such as Day After Tomorrow and Deep Strike, it was nice to see something on a smaller scale, like Flood. <br /> <br /> The use of mostly unknown actors and actresses and targeting England was a welcome change in pace when the Empire State Building was demolished. <br /> <br /> However, this is not a strong film for any reason. Being rather shocking to see that all your favorite London sights have been torn down by a very fake CGI storm surge, the Flood actually does nothing. <br /> <br /> The performances are boring, rescued from the pit of hell by David Suchet and his refreshingly calm performance as deputy prime minister. Perhaps he is too calm because of what is happening in the film, and all this fake water flowing around London must have made him angry. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the consequences will not be as good as TDAT and DI, but the CGI was at best moderate. <br /> <br /> Gentle, disappointing, and sometimes even tedious. See it if necessary, but see something else right after it.
