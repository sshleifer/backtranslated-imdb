Her embalmed look was completely unsuitable for this role. Her face remained too white, her hair was too combed, clothes, etc. They were too clean (and well fitting, especially her father’s old hat and coat in the scene where Inman returns home) for any sense of accuracy. It would be one if the production allowed all the other actors to remain clean and flawless, but it was the only one who did not become erratic. There was never a stain on her powdered cheek. Should we believe that she was the only person in the civil war with a bathroom and a mirror? She certainly looked like the only one who used them. Tweezers too; I mean, what's with these eyebrows? She looked absolutely angry! <br /> <br /> The love story was incredible. She approached the guy just because she was told that he said she was cute. So, she comes up to tease him, then flirts with him a couple more times, and suddenly this love is on a par with Odysseus and Penelope? You are welcome. <br /> <br /> I should have known better than to expect something better from the person who brought us the “English Patient”. My reaction to this was the same as that of Elaine on Seinfeld: "It sucks."
