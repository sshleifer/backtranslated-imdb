“Take the Glory” and “You Received the Ministry” and roughly squeeze them together, and what do you have? This God is an awesome custom film for boring normal teens. The plot follows very closely, "You have received the ministry." Three afro teenagers, this time living in Baltimore by John Water, not far from the Peckers, spend time getting poor grades in high school and dancing in dilapidated 100-year-old buildings with complacent mothers. To finance their expensive hip-hop baggy tastes, they steal cars and take them to a local butcher shop - unlike John (Tony Manaro) Travolta, who worked at the Brooklyn paint store so that he could buy his polyester discos. /> <br /> Tyler Gage, one of the three black musketeers, got into a crush at a local high school of fame and was forced to do the cleaning work. He meets Nora Clark, a 26-year-old white schoolboy, and discovers that he is Irish-American, much to the chagrin of his black buddies Mack and Skinny. <br /> <br /> Similar to “You Got Served” “Crime does not pay off, and Skinny, the youngest member of the trio, was shot like“ Bad Bad Leroy Brown ”, but this doesn’t stop the music and heartbreaking finale.
