We were thrilled to rent this one, after reading a few reviews and seeing that he scored such a high rating here. Well, we got to the house and could not believe what we saw. In fact, it sounds as if it was written by some very perverted old man who could not help but insert his sexual dysfunctions and fantasies into an anime film that really lacked plot and humor. The main character is everywhere ... at one moment he looks like an immature little child, the next moment he becomes mature and clever, then heroic, then a perverted stalker. <br /> <br /> The worst part is all inappropriate sexual content. I have no problems with sex, I’m digging a movie that has good sexual energy, but it’s just that it’s creepy. The nipple slips off, close-up crotch of a girl (many times) in white panties or swimsuit. It was completely inappropriate, and it seemed that the person who wrote it was trying to embody some fantasy through his cartoon characters. <br /> <br /> We were expecting something mature, but we just continued to look at each other and ask what the heck is the point ... except that we played cartoon tits and didn’t communicate well. If you want to see the splitting of some cartoon characters and crotch ... this is for you. If you are looking for something beyond this, this film was empty. Characters and dialogues are just annoying. <br /> <br />
