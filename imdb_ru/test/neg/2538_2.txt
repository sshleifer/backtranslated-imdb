Anyone who pays to watch Troma movies knows and appreciates what they are going to get. Having said that, I did not think that it was possible to make the film so bad, and yet be convincing. I found myself looking, just to see how much worse it can get to the end. First of all, this is an Indonesian action movie with an American protagonist who looks and acts like the bastard of the son of Taxi, Christopher Lloyd and Rambo. Everywhere he places his posters dressed as Sly's Cobra, and even has a purpose-built shooting range (with cutouts for his greatest enemies) in Jakarta, although he was at the CIA and had just arrived a few days earlier. There are many actions that include pistol shooting (without muzzle flashes on these M-16s, only sound effects), motorcycles (which make their way through walls), karate (where no one makes physical contact), and even sex (where all the actors ugly). The main plot of such an epic, at least, should be plausible enough, but not here. It involves the most dangerous drug cartel in the world, who is struggling to find "a device for detecting drugs." Why do they need it? It is never revealed, why not kill dogs that sniff drugs? It does not make sense, but it is taken seriously. The actors deserve praise because they really seemed to think that this film would make them all famous and tried their best to “act”. Best line? "Now dance to the grave, you filthy whore!" Best scene? Rambo jumps on a flying helicopter, pulls a machine gun from the hands of the villain, let's go, falls, shoots at the helicopter, when he falls, the helicopter explodes, the mannequin is thrown into the water. F ** king of genius! If you can not appreciate the garbage, do not watch it. If you can, that's cool. And lastly, did I mention that they were led by three Punjabi brothers?
