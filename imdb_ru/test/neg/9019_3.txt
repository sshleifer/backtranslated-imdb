This bit heavy science fiction slok of the late 50s is not exactly a loser. This is a manned space rocket, which falls in remote areas. A bunch of scientists are sent to investigate and discover that the astronaut is in a coma; it is supported by live embryos that have been mysteriously implanted in it. Be that as it may, the title "Alien Monster" soon lifts its head, causing general chaos, including partial removal of the head. <br /> <br /> The main problem of the film is its tempo. It takes a long time for the Blood Beast to appear, and it really comes to life only in the last 20 minutes or so. He is undoubtedly a completely ridiculous creation, but in fact it is not a problem, as it provides a lot of humorous relief. At the end of the film, where we have a final standoff, and this ridiculous creature begins to speak in the voice of the doctor he killed earlier, you will be fine if you do not giggle. The same can be said about the brilliant X-ray scene, where we see alien embryos floating in the astronaut's body - just too funny for words. <br /> <br /> But, unfortunately, in the Night of the Blood Beast come fun moments too small and far from each other. If you are a science fiction fool of the 50s, then you should try this one. Just don't expect too much.
