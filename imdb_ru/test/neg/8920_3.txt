Steven Seagal is a thief who specializes in robbing other drug dealers, handing out to the poor and miserable ... heh, Harlan, Robin Hood. Anyway, Harlan wants to go straight to his girlfriend, Jade (Marie Morrow), so he takes on the job as an armored car driver for Max Stevens (Kevin Taiga, wasted in a signed role). Max intends to have millions for himself and his unscrupulous partners, intending to use his loader Bruno (Robert Miano) to bring him money, but Harlan has other plans. Fleeing from the police, hiding money and throwing Bruno (whose loaded gun was aimed at Harlan’s head, threatening to shoot him if he wasn’t driven), after evading capture, ramming a huge dump truck, Harlan fainted. Charged with killing the police, among other things, as a result of the damage caused by the speed chase, Harlan is imprisoned, and many want to know where the money is. Harlan joins forces with a prisoner, Ledom (Treychem), the leader of one of the many gangs in prison, breaking plans to find Max and destroy all the members of his corrupt environment. Soon, DEA agent Rachel Knowles (Sarah Buxton) becomes part of this scenario thanks to her boss Saunders (Nick Mancuso), who claims that drugs are involved. The plot also laid Harlan's desire to save the children's hospital, which is about to close, and Jada has mysterious dreams about Max. <br /> <br /> Seagal and Treych quarrel with each other, talking in a gangster, and Buxton spends time trying to help Harlan, finding that her boss is in collusion with Max. Mancuso's character is a strange duck, allowing Rachel to have more leeway despite the threat she poses to his career. Tighe appears in five minutes or so, it's a shame. Harlan Segal escapes from prison and finds every rich partner of Max, who inevitably discovers his whereabouts after having broken several skulls, snapped a few wrists and broke several bones. Treach speaks to the rapper in his speech, and Seagal tries to respond to him in the same way, giving some unintended laughter. As was to be expected, many people are shot and wounded, and Seagal does not sweat. Interestingly, Seagal in prison, among the prisoners, helps Treych, when the Eses group plans to take him out.
