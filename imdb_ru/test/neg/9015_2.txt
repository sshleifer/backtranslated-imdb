Another winner from that era of the 50s, 60s, which I love so much for the comedic value that they give to each viewing these days. Korman never lets you down with these movies, they take themselves seriously and they have a very low budget, the recipe for good viewing is for sure. Ed Nelson, a very competent actor, started with Corman, as well as with many other favorites that appear in Superman and many of the westerns of the day. The suit is pretty bad and the sound of a talking alien, well, the reverb was a bit off, but that's the beauty. A film created for the love of him, not looking for perfection, simply digging the action, does it, it comes through. These movies have fun! Even better is the MST3K version!
