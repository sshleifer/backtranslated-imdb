This is by far the worst version of the tragic masterpiece of William Shakespeare I have ever seen. It seems that the filmmakers did not actually read the text of Shakespeare. No, they just took what they wanted from Lavence's Olivier movie. The plot is not in order and reduced to its extreme necessity, but there is time for the necanon created by Olivier, a hint of incest between Hamlet and Queen Gertrude. Could we have a “Something rotten in the state of Denmark” instead? Casting is another problem. I understand that Branna's film is much better (weak spots) (Robin Williams and Charlton Heston come to mind), but there are very few good moments in this film. I like Laertes and Polonius, but the rest of the cast is outdated. Mel Gibson's terrible stubble is annoying, and you often ask yourself if he knows what he is saying. Many of the actors seem to have just remembered this role — they know less about what they say than second-year students in high school. <br /> <br /> If you want a version of Hamlet, check out Kenneth Brande or Lavence Olivier. Honestly, even Disney's Hamlet is better.
