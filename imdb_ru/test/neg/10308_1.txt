Wow, no words to describe how really this film is really bad. I am usually proud to be able to enjoy any film, no matter how bad it is, but it was too much. I would just suggest watching this movie as a torture device. If you can overcome the terrible story and dialogue, watching it without a sound, even more awful camera work and crappy special effects make this film a real horror. If you think about watching this because you are a Sandra Bullock fan, don't even worry, because she has less than ten minutes of screen time and her game is absolutely terrible. Not to mention the other actors who could be replaced by baboons who could do their job better, at least, then we would not have to listen to the terrible dialogue.
