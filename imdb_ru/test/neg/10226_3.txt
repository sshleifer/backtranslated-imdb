This film, nothing more than the Mighty Ducks football game, was annoying in many ways. It was one of those times when your parents asked you to take your younger brothers and sisters so that they would not have to deal with them for several hours. At the very least, my younger sisters liked it, but it turned out that it was too much like the far-superior Mighty Ducks. Oh well, at least Olivia D'Abo was hot, and Steve Guttenberg still had a job at that time.
