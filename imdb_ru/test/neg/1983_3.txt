I really like Kinski, he's a great actor. I saw this film because I heard that there are autobiographical aspects in this film. <br /> <br /> The film has many characters, such as a piano sinking in a river, or strange shadows on the walls. Then the narrator always says abstract sentences like: "The child sells good luck, but her box is now empty." This is really disturbing and was not necessary, because everyone understands what this film is about. The film shows how the Kinsky character treated the woman and how he kept them under control. If there are indeed some aspects of Kinski’s life in this story, then he really was a pig. So there is no need to watch this movie, unless you want to see Kinski’s naked or love hooligan movies.
