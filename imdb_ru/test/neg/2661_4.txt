An unusually cold and silly drama from director Sydney Pollack. The soapy plot revolves around a married couple who died in a plane crash, leaving their spouses to find each other and connect at their own intimate level. Writing a novel is perceived as sluggish, although I thought that the speeches of the main characters Harrison Ford and Kristen Scott-Thomas were fine. Smooth staging is of interest, even though the plot remains in the same place and never creates any emotional impulse. As a result, the climax at the airport was a big “So what?”
