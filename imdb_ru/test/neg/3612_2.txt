A group of tourists were stuck on Snake Island after an accident with their boat. They are forced to spend the night, and, as you probably suspected, it is not called Snake Island, because itâ€™s just sooooo funny to say - it has a history of people disappearing one by one because of a large snake population, which is what happens with these poor dumb souls. This is a very boring and typical film with a lot of offscreen snake attacks and lousy performances by ANY actors. The only entertainment scene was absolutely unnecessary and forced strip scene, which no one could see in the movie with a rating of PG13, guys. If you like movies with snakes, take a look at SSSSSSS, but don't torture yourself with this shit.
