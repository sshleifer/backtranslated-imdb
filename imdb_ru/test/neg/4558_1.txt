I am delighted with the number of people who consider this film worthy ... much less magnificent! Do most people even have basic standards for the film that they watch? I just don't know anymore. <br /> <br /> This “commercial film product” does not deserve respect when they call me a film. Calling Dina Kane talented is a gross injustice to anyone who has talent. I had a lot of respect for Lori Petty, but most of it went straight through the pipes. At least her role was very small. She probably had an account that was desperate for payment. <br /> <br /> The ignorance I saw while browsing Firetrap was awesome. Let me start by taking it off my chest: if you can't really show the fire, then don't show it at all. Good?!! This makes it difficult for all participants to work when you demonstrate inconclusive effects that do not even come close to imitating a real burning building. <br /> <br /> Some interesting tidbits: 1. The janitor opens the door to the large storage closet and finds the entire room on fire. What does he do? He is trying to put out the fire with his broom! 2. The same cleaner (who knows the building is burning) later collides with a door that says DANGEROUS MATERIALS. His brilliant mind tells him that it would be a good idea to open the indicated door. Big mistake! 3. A woman makes a fantastically generous donation of $ 100,000 to the greyhound rescue fund, but ... she wears a fur coat at a charity event they are hosting! (Do not people who care about animals frown on such things?) 4. Several people in the film find themselves in some kind of storage with massive steel walls that even an electromagnetic pulse (!!) can't penetrate. However, they have a spacious vent that leads right into the back of what anyone could crawl through. This, of course, is like a security lapse. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but I became tiresome to think about this unfortunate film. Our “hero”, whom we must salute, is a professional criminal who tries to kill some policemen early. What a cool guy! If the general public wants to spend their minds on this nonsense, then they need more power. I just wanted to erase it from my memory. 1/10
