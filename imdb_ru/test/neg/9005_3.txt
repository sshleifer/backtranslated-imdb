“The Thomas Crown Affair” is a terrible remake of a not very good film that can be exchanged only for the filming of topless former supermodel Rene Russo. <br /> <br /> That's it. The plot is insignificant, Pierce Brosnan called him, and Dennis Leary (as usual) plays an annoying Irish policeman, but I could not take my eyes off beautiful Miss Russo. There is a beautiful love scene on the stairs, a stunningly sexy ballroom dance, a topless beach scene and a package bag. Yes, and the picture was stolen from the museum, and the catamaran sank. <br /> <br /> But let us hope that other directors recognize Ms. Rousseau’s perky attributes and play more prominent roles.
