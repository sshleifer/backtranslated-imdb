If you are going to make a movie from any book, make sure that the characters are consistent with this book. This film not only challenged the biblical story told to children over thousands of years, one way or another, but it clearly took on the courage that the adaptation would probably never try. At least, the Lord of the Rings is so close to the books that people understand the story more if they read books than this “Noah's Ark” tried.
