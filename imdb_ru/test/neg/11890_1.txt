I had to watch this movie for my World Reigonal Geography class. This film is what is wrong with America today, instead of finding the best way out of difficult times or situations, we would rather complain that it is someone else's fault. This film is experiencing the fall of Flint, Michigan, and blames it 100% on General Motors. In the process, Moore is doing everything possible to make General Motors leaders evil-minded just because they do their work in capitalist society. Moore shoots several evictions throughout the film and never even asks if a person is being evicted because of his dismissal. In addition, he never interviews tenants of rented tenants. Moore goes to great lengths to distort historical events to fit his political program in this film of pure propaganda.
