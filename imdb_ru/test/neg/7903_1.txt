Well, for starters, I'm as black as black, and I can say that it's very sad when black people think that “black film” sucks. I can't say that I have ever seen a movie with such a bad form or with a worse plot line. <br /> <br /> Snoop is my posture and that’s all, but he didn’t feel this film at all, I don’t that is enough to wash away the smell. <br /> <br /> I fully support the film, which is disturbing, but this one was bad, really very bad. It blew everything in every aspect, no real plot, the plot sucks, the cast could not play, and the best of them was a white guy! <br /> <br /> I almost demanded a refund at the exit from the theater door, half the crowd gathered and left before everything was over, I still want me too. Rid yourself of the pain and see something else, something else ...
