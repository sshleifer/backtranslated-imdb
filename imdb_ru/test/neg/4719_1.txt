This film is what happens when people see Blair Watch in this particular project, and they say that fucking people run around with cameras, shooting a documentary slash without a problem, I can do it and start with a bad idea, create a horrible script and a bunch of mediocre actors and beginners to make a film. The bottom line is that in Africa there are half a box of people like animals who hunt and kill people, the locals think it is a demon or an evil spirit, but our wild bunch in Africa to get some proof of this. I donâ€™t need more words about the plot, this film gets 1 out of 10, and I try to find something good to say about this film, but after a long reflection nothing has zero zero zero.
