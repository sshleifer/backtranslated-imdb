The movie is fine. This means that I do not regret watching this! I found the acting game pure and most of the dialogue was stupid (“oh no, it was my grandmother’s bible!”). This is a kind of a bad remake of a reversal. A man comes to a deserted city to nowhere, meets the wrong people and falls in love with the wrong woman. And because he got involved in something, he thought he could leave behind him. The film is quite predictable, and there really is nothing new. When it's over, you don't care. Most characters are stereotypes, especially Brian Austin Green! All in all, just another movie from the states, but well, boring on a boring Wednesday night. IMDb vote: 4/10
