I fully understand the historic significance of the Rocketship X-M, but that does not make it a good movie. To begin with, the plot (or whatever it is) is boring and lifeless. Five astronauts go to the moon? they stray from the course and find themselves on Mars (eh?) Cave-looking people Martians throw stones at them ?? they return to Earth and meet a fiery death ?? The end. Believe it or not, this informative description of the plot makes it sound much more interesting than it actually is. Worse, the character of John Emery, Dr. Carl Ekström, considers it necessary to make long protracted speeches throughout, from human nature to the dangers of nuclear weapons. This is just a thrill in a minute (intended sarcasm). <br /> <br /> Looking back at the Rocketship X-M almost 60 years later, I would call the image of a woman ridiculous if everything were not so sad and erroneous. I can give a few examples, but there is one dialogue immediately after takeoff between the male chauvinist pilot Floyd (played by annoying plastic hair Lloyd Bridges) and Dr. Lisa Van Horn (the only female member of the crew) and a permanent object who often attracts the attention of Floyd), which quite well illustrates the attitude of the film to women: <br /> <br /> ?? Floyd: “I was wondering how a girl like you was generally confused about such things.” <br /> <br /> ?? Dr. Van Horne: “I think you think that women should only cook, sew and have children.” <br /> <br /> ?? Floyd: "Isn't that enough?" <br /> <br /> I think that Floyd should have stayed with the cavemen!
