Red Sonya is a career move in the wrong direction for Arnold Schwarzenegger. Having made a couple of films about sword and magic (as Conan), he moved to slightly more serious acting roles in films such as The Terminator and Commando, only to mysteriously return to the genre of sword and magic for this debacle of 1985 of the year. It's hard to understand why he was worried, because it is weaker than both Conan's films in every conceivable department. Presumably, this was supposed to be the third film about Conan, but for one reason or another, the focus was shifted to the main female character, the title redhead, leaving poor old Arnold to play an incredibly boring support role. Think also about director Richard Fleischer, who presented the world with classic works such as “20,000 leagues under water”, “Fantastic Journey”, “Boston Strangler” and 10 Rillington Place. In this - his last but one movie - Fleisher also took a giant career step back. <br /> <br /> The evil queen Gedren (Sandal Bergman) wants to rule the world, and for this she needs a priceless and powerful talisman. She and her brutal army storm the fortress inhabited by the priestesses, and steal the talisman mentioned, killing helpless priestesses as they advance. One of the dead priestesses has a sister named Sonya (Bridget Nielsen), a fiery red-haired warrior who, upon hearing of his sister's death, swears revenge on the evil Gedren. Sonya rides the land in search of Gedren's lair. Along the way, she collects fellow travelers in the form of the boy-Prince Tarne (Ernie Reyes, Jr.) and his bodyguard Falcon (Paul Smith). She also meets the muscular warrior Conan - sorry, I mean Kalidor (!) - who offers to join her in her quest. Initially, Sonya does not want to help Calidor (Arnold Schwarzenegger), preferring instead to prove that she can resist and defeat her enemies alone, but in the end she warms him and accepts his help. <br /> <br /> Red Sonya is a terribly bad movie, especially when someone remembers that it was filmed in 1985, when the genre Sword 'N' The magic was near the end. It seems so simplistic and amateurish that you can easily take it as an early example of this kind. The performances are generally unsatisfactory: from the embarrassing villain Bergman from OTT to the incredibly annoying spoiled guy Reyes and the wooden hero Schwarzenegger. Nielsen is a little better as a heroine - apparently full of enthusiasm for thinking that she will play her first main role - but she is very much disappointed by the folly of the script of Clive Exon and George Macdonald Fraser. The film is full of stupid things, including a scene in which Schwarzenegger is seen in close-up, tracking down the bad guys, but ultimately there is no corpse in sight in the same sequence. Technically, this is also very inept, with non-standard special effects and terrible mechanical monsters. There are several compensations, such as the pleasant music of Ennio Morricone (Morricone spent most of the 80s providing good music for horrible films, for example, “The Island”, “The Treasure of Four Crowns” and “Hunra”). Another compensation is that Giuseppe Rotunno looks after the places - in fact, most of the time it is much more pleasant to look at the beautiful landscapes than the actors in the foreground! After Red Sonja there were very few movies about swords and witchcraft, so in some ways he can go down in history as a film that has destroyed its own genre.
