Damn awful! There is simply no other way to express it. ** Actually, ** SO ** is bad that the only reason I spend my words on this is to warn other intelligent viewers who want to be entertained sensibly. You lose I.Q. Points are watching this. If you think about it, it is not even suitable for meaningless viewing due to the annoying factor. There is nothing guilty about watching something so incompetent. <br /> <br /> Reasons to avoid this: <br /> <br /> 1) Terribly scientifically inaccurate, to such an extent that it is no longer scientific, it is simply stunningly sloppy, lazy fantasy. <br /> <br /> 2) These are FX sports that are stupid outside of faith. Not even a stupid kitsch who winks and nods like an old Doctor Who, but is simply cheap and trashy to the point of being insulted. FX is so bad that they are not even funny. They spent about fifty dollars, and not more. <br /> <br /> 3) The director's work is so weak and thoughtless that the only way actors could get to the end of filming without experiencing final depression was to mock their roles, although Catherine McCormack still made some efforts, perhaps in principle and despite the director. Moreover, this is not the only bad film by Peter Hyams: his whipping far outnumber those that could hardly be saved, of which the Timecop was the last, and that was 15 years before writing. since then he hasnâ€™t had anything decent (End of Days was the same kind of nonsense, Arnold was the only one to draw, and he needed a much tougher direction than provided by Hyams). Hyams is making more and more meaningless the fact that someone might think about giving him more work. <br /> <br /> Finally, <br /> <br /> 4) Ray Bradbury's stories deserve much better treatment than this. Refusing to watch this movie sends this message, and not what Hollywood especially listens to. <br /> <br /> Watch at your own risk. If you do, and it turns you off altogether, you will only be guilty of yourself (and at Hyams), because you have been more than warned enough.
