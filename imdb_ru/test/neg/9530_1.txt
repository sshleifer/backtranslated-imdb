A reviewer in Variety said that it was “overwritten too long,” and I agree with that. There are some events that seem forced and unlikely, for example, when Cal (Krudup is again in the role of "lost, vacant and boring" men) and Julianne Moore find a map of the USA in an incredible place. This story is one of those stories from the 1970s, “the guy must find meaning in his life,” and I found myself representing Jack Nicholson in his lead role as Cal. However, the whole topic of “walking the path to find meaning in life” is still quite interesting. Does all this really lead to a family? I was not so sure. With the acting, everything is fine, I especially liked Karen Allen and James LeGross, who, unfortunately, have only minor roles. I would give him five.
