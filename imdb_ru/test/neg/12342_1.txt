This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my whole life. If you are not fond of masochism, you will never see it. It was an unbearably long, meaningless, harmful to the eyes, depressive film that will forever lead my list of bad films. Whoever wrote this film is a sadist. I almost cried at the end, that's how it was all bad. I would like to give him zero stars, but since this is not an option, I give him one.
