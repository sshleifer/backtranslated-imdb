This is a parody. This means that there are no characters as such, all of them are mere stereotypes, and the film completely depends on the quality of the jokes. <br /> <br /> There are pretty good jokes in this movie. Unfortunately, they are hidden in the mass of these stupid. If you expect all dialogues to be absurd, the fun will pass. <br /> <br /> You see, there is American Pie 2, my favorite movie for teens. It contains many true original characters. Maybe the jokes are tasteless, but all people have some kind of life. For example, they feel embarrassed if something embarrassing happens. This is what makes the jokes themselves really funny! <br /> <br /> Not this film: each scene is clearly arranged as a pure parody, therefore there are no characters in it, therefore there is no place for any sympathies. In addition, if you know the original films, you know the whole scene in advance. Add the fact that many jokes are not funny, and you have this film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saved me from being completely bored was that there were actually comments from some teenagers at the cinema where I was watching a movie. <br /> <br /> Ah, and my personal highlight of the film was Melissa Joan Hartâ€™s very short appearance in one scene. Sigh. She is too cool, she can not be real. Hmm, is it worth the whole movie?
