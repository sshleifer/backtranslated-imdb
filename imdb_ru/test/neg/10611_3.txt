I must preface this comment with a sort of confession: I suppose I have just a weak point for the original series from the 60s-70s. I think the filmmakers blew it up right from the start, right down to the casting: in the supposed remake, viewers would look for reflections on the hip, sports Link (Clarence Williams III) or cool, with this Michael Cole, and so on. Instead, we see Giovanni Ribisi in the role of a poor little white rich boy who looks just pathetic, as if he were in all his roles (in the office I worked in, I once had fun creating a fake movie poster, Casting various actors as employees office; guess who I'll take in the role of the stupid son of the president of the company?). Danes is all right, like the new Julia, but none of the characters has anything in common, because the story just sits there, mired in convention. In addition, it is quite easy to forget. What did I talk about?
