I watched this movie after I watched the original Spoorloos several times, awaiting a terrible ending. <br /> <br /> I can't even explain the anger and frustration I experienced, the end came and went, and the film continued to have a happy ending. What a waste of time - watch this remake in the USA ... <br /> <br /> If you have a choice, skip "The Vanishing" and see the Dutch original "Spoorloos". The wait is very well built up. You feel Rexâ€™s frustration in finding any signs of what might have happened to his girlfriend Saskia after she went to the gas station and never returned to his car. The search takes him three years, and when he finally contacts a man who knows the truth about what happened to Saskia, he must agree to undergo the same thing as Saskia. The end makes you speechless in the chair ....
