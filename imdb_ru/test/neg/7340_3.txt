I lived in Barstow Ca. in 1968, when the film The Three Killers arrived at the local theater. The trailer was enough for me to pay my hard earned money to watch this movie. I was really expecting a Bonnie and Clyde movie, and Dick Clark was playing a shy know-all, while Robert Walker and Diane Warsie played an unsuccessful attempt to reproduce Bonny and Clyde. Needless to say, this never went well. Maybe that's why he never did it on video. Even when I was a kid, I had something left off when I left the theater. After all, the best parts where in the movie trailer. The film was boring and meaningless. By the way, Dick Clark is killed, so it was not a complete disappointment.
