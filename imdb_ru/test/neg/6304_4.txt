I like all the main actors involved in this rather strange film. Terrence Stamp, Guy Pierce and Hugo Weaving have established themselves as some of the best and most capable actors in the world, but I couldn't get into that. I do not know, because I do not understand the way of life or what, but I could not understand this film. Worst of all, the actors made some of the ugliest transvestites I’ve ever seen. I think that was part of the question, I don't know. I understand that this is probably an insult, but I do not know how else to call them. I have to say that I bought guys as performers (correct term?), But the story just wasn't very good or very interesting. I’ll say that I usually don’t really appreciate costume designers, although I notice them when they are wrong or inappropriate, but they really impressed me. Very creative, to put it mildly, just not attractive, but I do not think they should be. I don’t know that I’m definitely not a target audience and will never go to a performance performed by such performers, but I wouldn’t go to see ballet or opera, so I don’t know. If this is your film, then you will probably like it, but if it is not missed, because it is ... well, not for most of us. I just checked if he won an Oscar for the costume design, and I’ll say it correctly. I must say that Ebert did not really like this film, although I liked it more than I did.
