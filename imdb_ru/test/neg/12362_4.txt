Eight Legged Freaks is a modern film about monsters, similar to a remake of any of the old "Attacks on the giant [GET ANIMALS HERE]" - films of the 50s, 60s and 70s. Or rather, it should have been more like a remake than what it was. So, how is a movie made with monsters in 2002? Well, starting with a typical debut with chemicals, spiders grow to enormous sizes, they mix films such as Gremlins, Jurassic Park, Star Troopers, and mix them with some kind of parody, such as " Scary Movie". Gremlins are probably the best comparison, but “Eight strange freaks” was so full of parodies and silly jokes that sometimes it was more like “Dreadful movie”. It was too much, at least if you were looking for a monster film, and not just another parody film filled with jokes. <br /> <br /> For such a movie, you don’t expect much from the game, and so it was. Although the story was extremely subtle, it’s just a bunch of loosely related events that demonstrate some kind of action mixed with all the jokes, leading to an easily noticeable and banal ending. <br /> <br /> I rate eight weird 4/10 freaks, and this includes the fact that the special effects are pretty good, and that the noises that the spiders made are fun.
