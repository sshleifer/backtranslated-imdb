Sorry, guys, but all of you who say this is a great documentary ... and this award that he received at Sundance ... well, you were all deceived. For several years, I heard how I should have seen this documentary, and I finally watched it. Perhaps in 1999, when it appeared, and the reality show did not have such a dominant presence in the industry, this film would have seemed interesting. But Mike and Mark are so obviously playing themselves, Mike and Mark. Sometimes they are funny, and some lines seem out of place, but for the most part they do not sound believable. They are the reality version of Jay and Silent Bob. Yes, people are real, they are not actors, but it’s put on, it’s an exaggeration of themselves, and it’s so obvious that it’s hard to believe that many people think this is a real deal. I was not deceived, so it was a bit boring. Gently fun, but don't miss a lot if you miss him.
