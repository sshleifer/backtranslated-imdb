Dazzlingly stupid chatter from the previously talented John Hughes, who will soon make a film with sperm from the movie "Look who's talking," if his stars are younger. He again uses the formula "Home Alone", creating this idiotic comedy in which the child sneaks around Chicago, while the inept kidnappers Joe Mantegna, Joe Pantoliano and Brian Haley try to catch him, overcoming a lot of tiresome farce. If Mantegna and Pantollano cannot find laughter anywhere in your film, then you have problems, but the laziness of the film is most pronounced in scenes where crowds of people do not notice the child crawling along the sidewalk. Nonsense.
