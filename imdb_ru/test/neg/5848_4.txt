SPOILERS BY MEANS: <br /> <br /> Not good. The film was completely different from the book (not that the book was exactly classical, but it was really very good). <br /> <br /> I guess Demi Moore was fine. In fact, I don’t remember much about her performance anyway. However, Miss Moore didn’t have much disappointment. <br /> <br /> WHY the one who rewrote decided to suddenly make a millionaire have a heart? (I call him a "millionaire" because in the film he also had another name, different from the book version - just another change.) <br /> <br /> People who did not read the book obviously won I don’t know other, but in the version of the book this guy is much more ruthless and difficult in general. He is also fascinating. The fact that there have been such big changes in the film changes the whole plot. It was almost like watching a completely different movie. <br /> <br /> I know that MANY films are different from books. But I also thought that the Redford character was a bit of a weakling. This is not Redford's fault (he is a great actor and could play mercilessly well), but without these qualities he becomes just another blinded man in love, so the story becomes just another love story of a cliche involving 1 woman and 2 men. That was not the purpose of the book. <br /> <br /> This could be much better. Even if I hadn’t read the book version, I wouldn’t like it all, but such a big change certainly takes a few points from me.
