What was it, the film Zucker brothers? I don’t mind a little humor in my Holmes (I'm a big fan of Billy Wilder’s “SH Private Life”), but this version of The Sign of Four reminds me of an episode in Gran-Guignol’s “Murder, She Wrote” (directly from the opening credits that are worst possible: montage scenes from the movie) as directed by Mel Brooks. Ian Richardson is a wonderful actor, and, of course, he plays a certain role (he is ruthless in the drawings from the movie “Strand!”), But his interpretation of the character is incorrect and overly ridiculous, because of the stupid smile that he often does (I thought that the drug that was used by Holmes was cocaine and not weed, which expressed his comic harshness in carnival episodes, not to mention that when he disguises himself as an old man he is so excited that We immediately recognize him. David Healey is unforgettable, but, we learn The circumstances are acceptable, Watson is acceptable, and he is not too big a jester ... at least no more than the other characters. Chery Lungi (Excalibur) plays Mary Morstan in an exaggerated fashionable style right from the 1930s vaudeville. <br /> <br /> In the plot plan there are some meaningless additions (for example, giving Tonga teeth to vampires, carnival pit appetite for raw meat as a place to live, turning it off from Dr. Moreau’s island), and we are even denied the pleasure to discover Holmes because we are good about vedomleny everything before Holmes learns. And it's full of tired cliches: we not only get the infamous phrase “Elementary, my dear Watson” (about which, as every Sherlock knows, Conan Doyle, never wrote), but we are exposed to such glaring ordinary things like Hindi music. jump out of nowhere when Holmes goes to see a white guy in Hindi clothes. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: in Britain in the eighties, two competing broadcasters tried to create a series of adaptations of Sherlock Holmes. and produced the first television films as potential pilots. One of them starred in the role of Ian Richardson, and the other in the role of Jeremy Brett. Fortunately, the one that went through several episodes was good! <br /> <br /> 3/10. Travesty.
