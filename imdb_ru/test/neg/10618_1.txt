I made this film because it sounded like a pretty decent movie, and I was always a fan of foreign films. However, for those who love movies, I was surprised at how much I hate, hate, HATE this movie. <br /> <br /> Although he really aims to expose the lives of young people from lower classes in Lima and to some extent this is possible, the characters are hopelessly superficial, and the audience has absolutely no feelings for them. <br /> <br /> Although the story mostly revolves around M, he rarely speaks and his dialogue is better, surprisingly dry and boring. <br /> <br /> *** Warning: some small spoilers *** <br /> <br /> Basically the story revolves around a young man named M, who was looking for jobs, but without success (he gets a job twice but leaves because they are “not for him” when you are poor, the last option you have is to be picky). He spends some time with his friends, and the idea of ​​"fun" is to rape a small 14-year-old child, steal trashy tires from a piece of shit machine for a small bag of weeds and perform several other slightly backward actions. /> <br /> Friend M. comes with a plan to earn $ 25,000 apiece and move to the United States, sending cocaine to Miami. When the drug lord gives them a job, we find ourselves in an extremely lame scene, when three friends buy clothes at the mall, and in the background music plays. We see them trying on different clothes, like little girls who are given $ 200 to shop, cut their hair and then sit back, looking like slippery gangsters (one character, Carlos, from now on will wear sunglasses ALWAYS ... even at night). The day before departure, the leader of the group leaves to talk to the drug lord, leaving M and his friend stupid. They have parties, they take several samples of drugs that they assume are using, and rush into their old school, behave like animals and smash everything in sight. <br /> <br /> The movie ends when M tries to call his girlfriend. who hangs on him. Then the friends set about setting fire to a payphone, as a result of which a group of children and some old man with a gun appear. M and Carlos's friend in charge of the drug appear on his motorcycle and want them to leave with him now. Then he takes off alone, and that old man shoots him. The police discover and arrest M. and his friends (but not the man who shot the guy) and covers their dead friend with newspapers when the music is playing, and this disappears because of the credits. <br /> <br /> **** End Spoiler **** <br /> <br /> I even watched this movie a second time, hoping to see some subtle, redemptive factor for him, but I did did not. Total waste of 102 minutes. Although I must pay tribute to the fact that I was direct and did not shy away from interfering elements, the composition, the action and the general direction still leave to wish for many, many, many things. <br /> <br /> IMHO, if you are interested in a film that explores the problems that this one was supposed to think about, hire a City of God (Cidade de Deus) instead. Avoid this trash at all costs! You were warned !!
