According to this description, the Chupacabra is a mysterious <br /> <br /> creature that has killed and fed on Spanish goats in Latin for years. <br /> <br /> America and Mexico. One crossed the border into <br /> <br /> South Texas, and the cute, fearless cryptozoologist (no, I didn’t think of the word) went to an isolated ranch to find Her uncle <br /> <br /> was killed by this creature, and there are several grainy monster <br /> <br /> videos. She takes a cool black guy with a gun and two <br /> <br /> operators (for easy editing of lighting), and they hunt for <br /> <br /> chupacabras. Ten minutes later, the film shows up. <br /> <br /> In the rest of the film, the documentary team is attacked by a bloodthirsty monster, and its dialogues swell. One day, <br /> <br /> the team encounters a pair of witch beauties who lead them <br /> <br /> to the Chupacabra's nest ... for $ 100. If only the FBI knew about how cheap witches Tex-Mex could be bought as informants. Decades of <br /> <br /> mythical beasts can be cleared using the <br /> <br /> blank check. <br /> <br /> In the end, after the bloody death of the characters, you don’t provide a goat dressing, the chupacabra is captured, killed and <br /> <br /> opened. The sole purpose of the autopsy scene is to highlight the efforts of the makeup department <br /> <br /> in such a cheap film. <br /> <br /> The film was shot on video, just like BWP, but as long as the operator <br /> <br /> the characters never reload their tapes and charge their batteries <br /> <br />. The main actress is terrible here. The beauty of the BWP medium <br /> <br /> was that he used improvisation during the production. <br /> <br /> Here all the lines are written and shipped as bad. > <br /> Rehearsal of the Christmas dramatized performance. <br /> <br /> The film is also colored by racism. The only African American <br /> <br /> is a toughie. At some point, when the crew bursts in <br /> <br /> into an abandoned house, they discover a trio of illegal immigrants who <br /> <br /> comically ask them if they are from INS. Chortle, chortle. <br /> <br /> The monster itself is a guy in a rubber suit, and nothing more. For <br /> <br /> such a clumsy and clumsy beast, he can sneak up on <br /> <br /> quite quietly, regardless of whether they themselves are idiotically blocked <br /> <br /> in a giant cage as bait, or it seems, can not run them only <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> Blood is terrible, but when surrounded by such a sight <br /> Stupidity, it loses all its effectiveness. I don’t know if this was <br /> <br /> taken before or after BWP, but I can honestly say that this is the worst <br /> <br /> film made in southern Texas about the mythical beast. Pray <br /> <br /> there will be no sequels, I will start a letter writing campaign in <br /> <br /> Trome. <br /> <br /> This is the rating (R) for strong physical abuse, gun abuse, strong blood and profanity. <br /> <br />
