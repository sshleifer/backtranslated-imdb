This film stinks. IMDb needs negative numbers in its rating system in order to properly evaluate this turkey. Operable or wooden or on top; the film was clearly NOT written by anyone; and the monster scenes were mediocre at best. Even though only monster scenes were filmed in the film, these shots were so disappointing that they couldnâ€™t evoke sympathy for the rest of the film. I want to return the 80 minutes of my life that this film stole.
