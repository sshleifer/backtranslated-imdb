Thanks to this film, I was officially vomited in my mouth. <br /> <br /> I expected the absolute worst in this film, but expected a warming and pleasant absolute worst. That's just terrible. Absolutely awful. Scary as the Nazis spread the black plague. Let me explain: Ewoks speak English. It's horrible. <br /> <br /> The villain girl looks like she was traveling from the future set of Mighty Rangers. I really really want her to rise from the ground and say: “Finally! Ten thousand years later I am free! It's time to conquer the Earth! ”Putty ... uh, I mean, they are bad, damn it ... they growl a lot. Many of them look like an even lamer version of Cryptkeeper. The crypt keeper was pretty cool, but these guys weren't. <br /> <br /> The only advantage of this film was Paul Gleason. This film could be better if he went to the bad guys and said: "If I have to come here again, I break the skull." It would be even better if Judd Nelson played one of the Ewoks, who spoke his words when he said it. <br /> <br /> In addition, this fast little creature is pretty cool. A word about it. <br /> <br /> Although there are no words in the film. I want to give this film two. I want so much. I remember one passage: the path of this film is surrounded on all sides by the injustice of horror and the tyranny of incidental horror. Blessed is nothing, because this film is blowing.
