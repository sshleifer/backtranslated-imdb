ok my question; Who is the idiot who wrote this movie, calling it the same name as Dean Kunzâ€™s terrific book? it's terrible, nothing like a book ... you have a dog and an observer, but this is where the similarities end ... maybe it's good if you haven't read the book yet ... but it disappointed me, really. <br /> <br /> they have to make a new one, and let koontz write it ... now it will be a good film ... I will say it again, this film is disgusted with me ... absolutely disgusting to me. it was terrible, it was absolutely not like a book. I would never watch this again.
