This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Not only is it a comedy that is not funny, but it is also very poorly done with excessive direction, full of unnecessary split screens and other effects. <br /> <br /> Two “heroes” with their fantasy language are just annoying, and I was very embarrassed that they were constantly touching each other’s genitals. But the worst of all this nonsense is a cheap attempt to give this film some appeal, referring to the history of Germany and to show the delicate aspects of the “heroes”, the culmination of which is to show how Ercan and Stefan cure a mentally ill woman their “joyful” lifestyle (! ). But I did not expect anything better from the director Michael “The Hooligan” Herbig, who also shot two not funny TV shows, not a funny western film and almost not a funny SF comedy film. But Erkan and Stefan were - slightly - better in some of their regular programs. For me, the only good thing about the film is Alexandra Neldel, who is very beautiful to me.
