Recently, I watched several Wixel Pixel and Sub Rosa Extreme films and found a lot of interesting things in them. <br /> <br /> This film about SRE seemed to me much weaker than all the others that I saw. Perhaps this is because it is rather a comedic horror film, rather than direct horror, and perhaps this is also because humor did not register me very well. <br /> <br /> This is a little less than seventy minutes, and loans start from the beginning of the last ten minutes. While these captions occur, some trivia, nonsense, and backstage events occur. <br /> <br /> SRE films are usually short and, despite this, they feel exhausted. This is no exception, with some scenes that tend to last too long. <br /> <br /> The story tells about a poor child in Christmas, California, who was chosen by all his classmates. One shoe was stolen from him and he could not replace it, he was christened “Oneshoe McGroo”. Because of his obsession with pirates, his parents gave him a blindfold for Christmas with a Christmas tree decorated with an eye patch. <br /> <br /> Many classmates are killed, and those who stayed get together to decide what to do. do. McGrew shoots them one by one, and they hear the sounds of bells on the sleigh. <br /> <br /> Characters are fairly broad stereotypes, such as a nerd named Dorkus, etc. A scene in which a strange couple has sex; The woman is handcuffed and blindfolded, the man wears a large piece of watermelon paper over his head. It reminded me of some weird sex scenes from director Rinz Dream. <br /> <br /> The image quality is good and there are a lot of extras. But mostly pretty stupid movie. <br /> <br /> Oh well, I think you will never have too many Christmas horror films. However, there are many other holidays in need.
