Like 'Singin' in the Rain, 'Cover Girl' has a trio of two guys and a girl. In the "Cover", Phil Silvers (Genius) is a comic relief. It fits the funny role of Donald O'Connor in Singin in the Rain. In The Cover Girl, Gina Kelly's love interest is Rita Hayworth, and in The Rain, Debbie Reynolds. This comparison ends. <br /> <br /> Bearing in mind that Singin 'in the Rain is a classic American musical, Cover Girl is the epitome of mediocrity. The story is not very complicated. Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth)) dances at the Danny McGuire Low Rental Nightclub in Brooklyn. Rusty decides to take part in the "Cover Girl" competition sponsored by rich publisher John Kadeir, who played an unsuccessful play for Grandma Rusty a few years ago. which turns her into a star. Danny feels slighted when Rusty begins to be late for rehearsals at a nightclub and decides to close the club and hit the road, entertaining the troops with his partner Genius. At the last minute with Rusty On the altar with Noel, she realizes her mistake and runs back to Danny. They live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly plays the least developed role in the film. All we learn about him is that he owns a nightclub and is madly in love with Rusty and I. Coudair and Wheaton behave like stupefied teens towards Rusty, and Phil Silvers makes some totally stupid but unfunny jokes. The most interesting aspect of Rita Hayworth's performance is the stage in which she gets drunk. This foreshadows what happened to her in real life. Anyone who has read her biography finds out that she does not like Hollywood, pines for ordinary family life, which she could never achieve, but eventually began to drink and ended up with full-blown Alzheimer's disease in the last years of her life. <br /> Almost all the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very melodic. Gene Kelly has only one really excellent dance number, and this is the scene where he dances with his “alter ego”. Earlier, the trio had another number, which is the pale predecessor of “Make them laugh” from Singin in the rain. <br /> <br /> The most annoying thing in Cover Girl is how Rita Hayworth is put on a pedestal. A couple of decades later, Raquel Welch had the same problem. Both actresses later in their careers have always tried to find scripts that demonstrate their acting skills. They wanted to be called "actresses" and not "girls." Unfortunately, the “Cover Girl” is an example of how Hollywood used women for financial gain.
