Not a balanced point of view. The director should not express his opinion as truth. There is some criticism of Fujimori in the film, but he always gives him and his family the last words. So few critics of Fujimori have been granted that, it seems, the only reason they were included was to say that the film gives both views. But this is not the case. <br /> <br /> The film hardly shows one of the massacres that Fujimori is accused of. And this gives him the honor for leading the killing of the rebels of the MRTA, who seized the Japanese embassy. It is well documented what the CIA planned. On the site, published by Caretas magazine and other newspapers, there are even photos of the famous CIA strategist. <br /> <br /> The fact that the director did not use such well-known information gives us several possible conclusions: the director stands for Fujimori and deliberately and falsely decides to give him his due; the director does not want viewers to notice that the CIA and Fujimori worked together; or it was simply unknowing, since the director is not Peruvian and was not present in Peru during the events. <br /> <br /> The explanation provided by other commentators that Fujimori is still quite popular in Peru does not justify the lack of accuracy and weighted explanations. <br /> <br /> In addition, the actual support statistics for Fujimori in the film was the highest I've ever heard of. Most of the statistics of large election agencies are much lower. <br /> <br /> Another point to be mentioned is that intelligence, which played a key role in seizing the leader of Sendero and finding a secret network, was carried out by police forces led by Ketin Vidal and his complete autonomy. from Fujimori and Montesinos. <br /> <br /> The first Fujimori government did experience an improvement in general economic trends (GDP), but this improvement was financed by the privatization of several national industries with contracts. it was not beneficial for the country in the long run. In addition, the gap between rich and poor continued to widen during the Fujimori regime. During his second term, the economy suffered, and there was nothing more to privatize, and by the end of Fuchimoriâ€™s second term, the economy would collapse. <br /> <br /> With regard to investments in the infrastructure of the Fujimori regime, they do not work. paternalistic pattern. They were created to raise support for Fujimori, but should not have lasted a long time. These structures needed constant maintenance, but Fujimori did not provide political power to civilians to demand further investments. In fact, the Fujimori regime was able to destroy most forms of political organization, such as unions and grassroots groups, and the increase in informal informal work was enormous. <br /> <br /> Finally, the director decided to spend most of the film talking to Fujimori instead of referring to incidents of massive corruption in favor of Fujimori (media, business owners, military, etc.) that were so widespread that it was impossible for Fujimori not to know about it.
