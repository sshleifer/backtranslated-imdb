The idea of ​​the film was not too bad: a horror film, shot in a corn maze on Halloween. The bad part was bad camera work, ten million shots of puddles and corn, and a one and a half hour walk that this guy spent in the maze. Oh, I'm sorry, "corn". I took this film because it reminded me of a corn maze near the place where I live, and I thought it was a great idea for a movie. But considering everything, it seems that your average Joe could take the same idea and go on with her. Bill Cowell's game was not too bad, in fact, I would say that it was pretty good. But the lack of talent from his colleagues did not help his efforts. I hope his next movie will be easier to swallow.
