I am really disappointed with this job. It is quiet, shallow, constantly repeated, mostly not accurate, and sometimes on the verge of error. I think this is done for elementary school, especially because it repeats over and over again, leaving large gaps. A young child can really enjoy it and learn from it, but the best way to make a child appreciate theoretical physics is with books like “A Brief History of Time” or “Tao Physics”. If you are familiar with this topic at the most basic level, you will not receive any new information or opinions from this series. Do not waste your time on this. Good eye candy though.
