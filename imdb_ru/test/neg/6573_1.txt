... Once. "Manos, Hands of Fate". It was worse than a little, but a little worse: but he had one thing: beautiful women in negligee struggled with each other - about 20 minutes. This fat 45-year-old girl with 3 boobs and a tail in a cantina scene, cloned straight from Star Wars. Not to mention the fat, blue seductress Uhura, her fat legs and ass hanging from some crazy bird costume, in this "Method of Acting Disorder." She always wanted to speak to a "captive audience"? She must have been referring to the poor drool that set aside 8 bucks in the hope of seeing another “Wrath of the Khan” or at least the Voyage House. The captive is “right. I wonder how many people in cinemas tried to cut their wrists, shouting“ Mom, stop it. ”<br /> <br /> There is no doubt that“ The Last Frontier ”is not just an unrestrained disaster, it is a cruel and an unusual punishment. This is a Star Trek from hell. This is Shatner about mushrooms - or maybe peyote. This is a place where no one has visited before and didn’t want him to never come first. Or paraphrase the review on "Heaven's Gate : “As if Gene Roddenberry sold his soul to the Devil for the success of the series, and the Devil is now going to army of money ". <br /> <br /> And do not even make me start a drunken Kirk and grinning McCoy, singing together" Row, Row, Row, Your Boat, "as if they were lovers in some insane gay dream a fever. Then we have the “Daring Dynamic Duet" from Sulu and Chekhov, who travel together through the forest ... probably on the way to Barry Manilow's concert. Then there is Lawrence Lackinbill as Spock's brother ??? !!! Yes that's right! Surprisingly as these relationships, which we have never heard of, suddenly creep out of the tree when we need a new storyline. And do not forget that Spock is flying through the air after Kirk when he falls off a cliff in Yosemite. Of course. He catches up with Kirk and saves him ONE LEG from the ground. Where did you get these cool rackets, Spock ?!
