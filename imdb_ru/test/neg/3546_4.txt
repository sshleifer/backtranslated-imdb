Matthew Aldrich. This is a name worthy of memory. This is a man who took his fingers on the keyboard and came up with one of the worst scenarios of all time. Cliche. Predictability. Insulting the public. <br /> <br /> Is he the only culprit? Of course not. Renny Harlin took this horrible excuse for the script and turned it into a film. Sam Jackson and Ed Harris actually read it (or not) and decided to act in it. Guilt is abundant. <br /> <br /> This is Denise Richards from the movie scripts. In the universe, there is not enough for Razzy to properly realize how terrible this letter really is. <br /> <br /> To be honest, Samuel Jackson's profession is incredibly new, and its presentation is very creative. , but in the end, it's just a decoration. Cute decorations. <br /> <br /> Pack everything you want - trash entry still writes trash.
