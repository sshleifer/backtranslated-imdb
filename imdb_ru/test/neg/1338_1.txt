Not! no no no! My whole being revolts against this horrible remake of a classic film. I knew that trouble awaited us from the moment Meg Ryan appeared on the screen with her ridiculous hair and clothes — literally scarecrow in the garden that she was digging. Meg Ryan plays Meg Ryan - how tiring is that ?! And it got worse ... much worse. The terrible clichés, the characteristic characters, the growing feeling that I watched the release of the “First Wives Club” and the serene trifle in the delivery room. How many times have I seen this movie? Only once, but it looks like a dozen times - there is nothing original or fresh about it. Shame on you
