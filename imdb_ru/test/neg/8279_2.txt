“Graduation” - <br /> <br /> I bought this film last week and waited some time when I could relax and watch some of the “good” pearls of the 80s, I received this and “Xtro” to watch, never have not seen any of them. I just watched it and realized that my outdoor speakers are also on. I can only imagine what my neighbors thought when “Felonia” sang their 10-minute hit? I'm sure it was loud, and I'm sure they think I'm odd, with that and the sound of a chainsaw and a cry from other films. <br /> <br /> It was a pretty bad movie, not expecting any history, some cool deaths, it seemed almost on the amateur side, I usually like these movies, but it just did not suit me, now I will watch " Xtro "for the first time and have a margarita! <br /> DJ Eric Austin TX
