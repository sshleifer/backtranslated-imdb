No matter how much I hate the movie that this series is following, I can at least say that Zangif was funny. The animated series is perhaps one of the worst things ever created. Animation is often controversial, although it always remains bad. The shape of the character's face can even change dramatically in one frame. The script and voice also leave much to be desired, since most of the actors seem to be as talented as the third-class drama actors. Characters like Cammy and DJ are so compelled by stereotypes of their nationality that the episodes containing them are almost physically painful to watch, although the series is not painful anyway. The plots of the episodes seem to be striving to reach new levels of lameness with each turn and are so full of holes in the plots that they amaze me that they had time to show commercials. In truth, it surprises me who pays for advertising during the show. Besides the fact that this is a bad show, it is even worse adaptation of Street Fighter. Many of the characters support the unfortunate adaptation of the film. For example, Ken and Ryu are idiots-crooks (although Ken should be rich), Blanca is a friend of Gilles, Charlie, and Chun Li is a reporter. It takes talent to take something as bad as a movie and make it worse.
