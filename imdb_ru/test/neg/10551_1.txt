This series and Elon Gold were HYPED as the “next big thing” in sitcoms for NBC. Well, they were not. Denis Farina was terribly wrong as a test. He just seemed so uncomfortable and inappropriate here. The term "private time"! was supposed to be a "dyno-mite!" catch the phrase of the 21st century. Well, it is not. Then people asked, as today (when his name pops up): “Who the hell is Elon Gold?” I saw him in the episode “The Mentalist” that evening. I mentioned his name, and my girlfriend asked, "Who?" Not funny. Total waste of airtime. NBC had high hopes for this show, but it just collapsed.
