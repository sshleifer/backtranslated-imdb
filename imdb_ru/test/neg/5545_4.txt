Rewarding the actor Sydney Poitier in the film “Lilies of the Field” repeats his role as Lieutenant Virgil Tibbs from “The Best Picture”, won an Oscar in 1967, for veteran director Gordon Douglas “Tired, boring sequel” “They call me Mr MR Tibbs” “Not with there was no equivalent of Rod Staiger with whom one could exchange dialogues. Obviously, both Bullitt screenwriters Alan R. Trastman and Robert D. Webb from Cape Fear did not participate in the game when they wrote this predictable police procedural bowler. The dialogue is boring, and none of the characters is interesting, not even the main suspect. Absolutely nothing surprising, alarming or surprising in this manual detective does not occur. In the meantime, everything has changed significantly since Virgil was last seen in The Heat of the Night. He worked as a homicide detective at the Philadelphia police station, Pennsylvania. In the film “They Call Me Mr. Tibbs”, our hero works in the San Francisco Police Department. In addition, he has a wife, Valerie (Barbara McNair from Change of Habit) and a family, Andy's young naughty son (George Spell from Naked Kiss) and a younger daughter, Ginger (Wanda Spell) Hickey and Boggs). Tibbs rides on an average blue mustang, and his wife keeps the house and hovers over their two children, since he doesn't have much time to spend with them. Literally, there are no surprises in this mystery of killing a pedestrian. Indeed, the best thing about “They Call Me Mister Tibbs” is the stunning orchestral soundtrack of Quincey Jones with an unforgettable introductory theme, more memorable than this well-deserved forgotten crime thriller. <br /> <br /> It all starts quite sensationally with a difficult struggle. Prostitute Joy Sturges (Linda Town of The Adventurers) was killed by an unknown person in the bedroom of her apartment in the city center. Housing foreman Miles Williamson (Juano Hernandez from “The Intruder in the Dust”) enters Joy’s apartment and finds it scattered across the carpet with a dead, bloody forehead. He briefly picks up the statue, and then puts it back on the floor and reports Joey to the apartment manager's death, Rice Uedonu (Anthony Zerbe from The Murder License), and Weedon gives Miles and a handful of dollars and sends him packing. , Whedon then anonymously informs SFPD that popular minister Logan Sharp (Martin Landau from Nevada Smith) beat Joy to death and seemed to leave Joy’s apartment. Captain Marden (Jeff Corey of True Grit) appoints Tibbs to conduct the case; it seems that Tibbs and Sharpe have known each other for 18 years. Naturally, Tibbs’s wife Valerie cannot believe that a well-known politically active evangelist could have committed such a crime. Just to give the context of the film, it should be noted that when Tibbs and the police inspect the crime scene, they mention the word "sperm", no doubt the controversial term to be mentioned in the film of the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> Tibbs asks Widon, whom he suspects is either a drug addict or a pimp. Widon explains that he has no records of Joy Sturges because she rented an apartment from another real estate company. Tibbs visits a real estate company, and realtor Woody Garfield (Ed Anser from "JFK") runs away and leaves, essentially making O.J. Simpson, until he crashed his car after a long but manual pursuit. When Tibbs proves that Woody did not kill Joy, he allows him to leave with his disgruntled wife Marge (Norma Crane from Penelope), who is ready to file for divorce after he finds out that he paid the prostitute to stay in the apartment. . <br /> <br /> Tibbs tracks down the handyman Mili and clears him of the crime, and then he walks over to Widon. Fortunately, for Tibbs, our hero catches the evil Wade in the middle of a drug deal. One of Widon's minions attacks Tibbs, but Tibbs doesn’t do without him for a short while before setting off in pursuit of Widon. In the end, he drives Wade into the underground garage, and they shoot him. Guess who wins. <br /> <br /> Scenes in the house of Tibbs are more interesting than his investigation. Andy runs relentlessly, beats his sister and smokes in the garden. Our hero wants him to clean his room. When Andy refuses, Tibbs slams him three times in the jaw. These scenes of parenting probably could never have been handled today, as they were in 1970. At the end of the film, as if to reinforce the family consistency, Tibbs, apparently, leaves with his wife and children. Between Valerie and Virgil there is a dispute about the well-being of their children and how their long hours at work have affected them. <br /> <br /> Directed by Gordon Douglas competently directs. Surprisingly, for the film, released in 1970, the filmmakers never play a racing card. In one of the scenes, when Tibbs searches the billiard room belonging to an African American, we see a mixed breed of races, scowling at the hero when he finds Miles and goes in tow with him. <br /> <br /> In general, "They call me MR. Tibbs" is a bad sequel to "In the heat of the night." Keep in mind, Poitiers provides another excellent performance with nuances, but everything looks ready. All the scenery looks fake, and there is not much physical violence: one skirmish in the underground parking, which does not last long, and a fight. In addition to Jones' original jazz score, the only surprise, and he really is not considered the main surprise, more like a convenient trick, is the final. The “organization” of Donald Medford followed “They call me MISTER Tibbs” as the second, more action packed continuation.
