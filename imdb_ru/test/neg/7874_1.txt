Ugh. Stephen Baldwin. I never noticed until I got the DVD home and saw his name in the credits. Double ugh What is even worse, he is the NAME in this low-budget, meaningless, wandering, imitating, shooting at them. I mean, where did they find a guy to write this failure? Are you driving a caterpillar in LA City Dump and hoping to break into a movie? The whole plot of a funny situation is built on a ridiculous background. Baldwin is as convincing as a poster boy on American Gothic without a fork. His entire acting repertoire looks like he needs a pot, and then looks like he found it. <br /> <br /> So you have everything: a bad script, a bad game of actors without names, a low-budget setting and a hero who is about as convincing as a scout girl who is looking for a client cookie as an action hero. It is already too late for me to return my money to a DVD, but you can save yourself - unless you are one of those who like to look at dogs for a laugh ... to be honest, this one is too boring to be funny.
