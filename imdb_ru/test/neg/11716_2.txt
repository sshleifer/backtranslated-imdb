It must be one of the greatest horror movies of all time. Charles Band has made the best film of 96 'in this little-known pearl. Very realistic and incredibly stylized - with visual grace that David Fincher would envy, it is easy to understand why the group continued to do such classic works as “Killjoy 2: Deliverance From Evil”, “The Regina Pierce Affair”, “Virgins of Sherwood” Les And Timegate: Tales of the Saddle Tramp. <br /> <br /> With a very complex story - a tiny body with a big head controls a family of eccentrics who experiment on naked women, this film may be too big for young viewers and only for the most educated viewer, but for those who The band sees it, it can transmit subtle messages about the state of a person through his masterpiece. The head symbolizes lost love and longing for its inner essence, which we all must face at one time or another, and for this reason I was able to do this film on a deeply personal level. Although many earlier critics compared the Bend film with The Resuscitator and other less significant works, it is a cut above the rest. It is better, but not meaningless. The blood in this film is well thought out and is used to enhance the storyline, and not just to shout out a cheap wail from the audience. In addition, the special effects in this film are absolutely top notch, easily the best work done in a horror film since ... well ... ever! The work in this film makes Savini's effects look like the work of a blind, ruthless tramp. <br /> <br /> The only problem I encountered in this film is the abundance of frontal nudity, which ultimately was unnecessary to achieve the composer’s goal - to create an eternal epic that will forever go down in history as perhaps the greatest film of all time. If it were not for this small problem, I would have given this film ideally 10.
