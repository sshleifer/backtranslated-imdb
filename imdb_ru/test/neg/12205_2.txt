This film introduced a completely new meaning to this worn phrase “how to watch the paint dry”, because it was “how to watch the paint dry in the middle of the monsoon.” <br /> <br /> I was attracted by the film on its location on the west coast of Portugal, which I visited. This is a harshly beautiful place, and black and white has brought a new dimension to beauty. It was the only good thing. The story was terribly banal, and, frankly, you should have some kind of story. <br /> <br /> The film crew ends the film, and the whole team has to wait. Well, waiting is waiting. I can wait for bus number 15 on Princes Street in Edinburgh, I can spend hours walking at a remote train station in the middle of the desert on a cold winter Sunday afternoon. However, waiting is boring, and yes, this waiting was also boring. <br /> <br /> So the leader is leaving for America to protest with a film supplier who scolds him for not having done it all in color. After a series of arguments, two blessed bullets are distributed from anywhere, and finally the long-awaited end comes, and not before its time. <br /> <br /> Yes, I’ll watch this movie again if someone equips me with a pair of cans of colored film so that I can throw them on the screen.
