This film tells about a depressed and emotionally limited person who has a relative living in his apartment in Istanbul. Over time, their relationships become more and more strained, until finally he starts screaming at a guest in his house — who does not have a job and doesn’t show a particular desire to find work. This is a big part of the film really. The problem is that, although emotionally constrained and depressed people are VERY closed and do not communicate, they do not create a very satisfactory film. This is because most of the time he (and his neighbor) just look into space and say nothing. I think all these flat moments could be cut to make a 30-minute film — I certainly wouldn't mind.
