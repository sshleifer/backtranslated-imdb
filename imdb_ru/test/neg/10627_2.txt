Trying to be a positive story, Dolph Lundgren forces a group of mercenaries to seize a tropical island, which is very similar to a paradise, so that the people who hired his team can get it for ... bird droppings. In fact, the nitrogen released from the dirt on this island is what they need. <br /> <br /> In this film there was only one good thing - the place on the island where it was shot was beautiful. Otherwise, the story sinks itself, leaving the actors nothing to work with. The result: a lot of violence, a lot of language, a lot of blood and a few topless shots. If you want pointless violence (sorry, the storyline can't even give a point of view about the violence, even though it tries), then this film is for you. <br /> <br /> Parents: we warn that this film is full of violence and blood, leading the R. rating.
