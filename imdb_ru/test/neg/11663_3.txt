“Fallacy” is what you experience when you watch this movie, and then believe that you have seen something worthwhile. This click, which tells about a trio of semi-psycho-travelers who have nowhere to go somewhere in the desert of Central Asia, is amateurish and simply stupid. The film suffers from a horrible story, a lousy script and some horrible direction, and these are just some of the flaws. If there is something in the film for this, then this is the smooth performance of the diva In-Cinema Rubin. Do not waste your time on this turkey. (D)
