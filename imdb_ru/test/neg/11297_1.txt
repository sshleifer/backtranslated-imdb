* Hannibal Spoilers * Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is back ... for a parody of the film! Now he is in Italy, appreciates our food (including people like Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini)), but returns to the States for Clarice (Julianne Moore) and level the score with the former victim, Mason Verger (Gary Oldman). <br /> <br /> Let me tell you that this film does not deserve to be talked about with Silence Of The Lambs and Manhunter, because it is really, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely BAD. <br /> <br /> I mean, the scene at the end with the opening of Ray Liotta's skull and his forcing to eat some of his brain, sauteed in oil? WTF? Then why was BP so annoying (including Clarice)? And why did the story keep going nowhere? I believe this is the “teenage” chapter of the Hannibal series; terrible, stupid, terrible for the sake of blood and completely embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Don't watch it, especially if you like other Hannibal films (SOTL, Manhunter, Red Dragon, Hannibal Rising). <br /> <br /> Hannibal: 1/10.
