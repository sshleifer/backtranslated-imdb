Once again, Mr. Costner pulled the film out much longer than necessary. In addition to the amazing sequences of sea rescue, which are very few, I just did not care about any characters. Most of us have ghosts in the closet, and Costner's character is realized early, and then forgotten, and much later, by the time I didn’t care. The character we really need is a very bold, self-confident Ashton Kutcher. The problem is that he is going crazy, thinking that he is better than anyone else, and does not show any signs of a cluttered wardrobe. His only obstacle is the victory over Costner. Finally, when we’ve gone halfway through this abomination, Costner tells us all about Kutcher's ghosts. We are told why Kutcher seeks to be the best, not knowing and not foreseeing. No magic here, that was all I could do to turn it off after an hour.
