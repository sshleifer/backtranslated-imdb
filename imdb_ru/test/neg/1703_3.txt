MacBeth, I always thought, was the most accessible of Shakespeare's plays, The Great Period. Compact, focused, with a lot of violence, it was supposed to be the game most open to adapt the screen. However, I don’t know how well the story was reflected - the best that could be in the energetic and lean version of Orson Welles. We must add Connery / Baxendale to the list of MacBotches. <br /> <br /> (It seems that this was not a film adaptation at all, but a television version that was released in cinemas after Lourman’s novel Romeo). + Juliet and Branh Hamlet. This may explain some of its shortcomings, but it does not justify them.) <br /> <br /> It all starts well, with a vicious sequence of battles that the awful, awesome witches look at. Poor old Gray Malkin and Paddock are cut off from the opening scene, but they are not alone for long. In quick order, they are joined by the bloody Sargent and his story about the battle, the betrayal of Thane Kaudor, the hapless Tiger master, even Macbeth's meeting with Duncan, when he invested in him like Kaudor. All of them had virtues, which, like the trumpet of angels, plead against their dark curse to send them, but they are sent. These are not the only abbreviations. This is Macbeth in a hurry. <br /> <br /> From the first battle we get directly into the collision of Macbeth with the witches, which is well done. Brian Blessed, oddly enough, took witchcraft episodes, and he has fun with special effects, as MacBet and Banquo tell about their fates. Jason Connery as Macbeth is awkward, clearly not knowing what to do with the verse. Graham McTavish as Banquo, on the other hand, is capable of making his lines natural and light. Within a few minutes after Connery's muttering, the viewer was struck by the desire to switch roles, and McTavish was in the lead role. No wonder MacBeth felt he needed to kill him. <br /> <br /> These first few minutes mark the high point of the movie. From there we move to Helen Baksendale, hearing from her husband. She is as lost as Connery, and denied the beard, behind which he hides. Her call "Unsex me here" to evil is embarrassing, not disturbing. There are some smart enough touches - “We will talk further” MacBeth is not a sign of his indecision in the face of his wife’s evil ambitions, but his attempt to silence her when he throws her on the bed. <br /> Lead Casting is the biggest disappointment. Connery's method is to stare at the screen as he mumbles his monologues through voice-overs. Buckendale looks squeezed and neurotic. Attempting to do something interesting with "Is it a dagger" - a fantastic dagger - a shadow cast by a cross on the altar - fails due to the poor delivery of Connery and the careless direction that spoils production in everything. We escort Lady Macbeth back to the murder chamber, where she gets the opportunity to strike resurgent Duncan, but the effect is comic, not dramatic. <br /> <br /> Big scenes failed — Banco’s appearance at the feast was inconceivable in an attempt to blend the subjective interpretation of Macbeth’s illusion with what people see or don’t see. The second encounter with the witches is even less consistent, and the prophetic visions are confusing. Timing seems to be a problem here - Banco's banquet is the central point of the play, but the film quickly moves to completion after it, giving him an unbalanced feeling and no opportunity for the intricacies of riddles that Macbeth caught to appreciate, or to make his descent into madness convincing. Another important episode is the scene in which Malcolm checks McDuff, and MacDuff finds out about the murder of his family. This deprives his revenge of most of his emotional power - and the character has a lot of screen time. He is a virtual stranger when he appears to kill MacBet. <br /> <br /> Point for try. BanTo MacTavish earns another. The first few minutes is another. But that's all. Since then, this sounds and rage blah blah blah.
