My blurry childhood memories preserved an echo of the Belphégor cult series in the French 60s ... so I could not wait to see the adaptation on the big screen. I had to save my money and go for a walk in the Louvre. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the script is still very successful and interesting (the fantasy of the Louvre), but the adaptation is ridiculous. Dialogues constantly hesitate between French irony and serious "American business", without achieving either one or the other, not knowing how silly. <br /> <br /> I want to act somehow, but the special effects are more meager than one would expect (small budget?). <br /> <br /> What remains of all this. Not so much, except for a few good shots of Paris ... which is rarely disappointing. <br /> <br /> Belphegor was worth more than that. <br /> <br />
