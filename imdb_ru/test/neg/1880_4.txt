In addition to D.A. (James Eckhaus) and a short-lived woman who convincingly sympathizes with the plight of Ellen Gulden (Renee Zellweger), Ellen herself is the only persuasive character - and the cutest character in the film. It is she, not her dying mother who must be and is the only true thing. not only in the role, in the Zellweger action, but also in the plot itself ... As long as the plot does not turn against itself - and makes the mother "the only true thing" in the eyes of her weak-willed, petty husband who can do nothing right for your wife or daughter. The daughter perceives what the viewer perceives, but such rational ideas must give way to the superficial feeling of the husband, who is hidden from the reality of both his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the only powerful scene in this entire film, when Ellen confronts her fatherâ€™s cruelty, gets a lie at the end. Ellen is another young strong woman who must be tamed according to her tearful father. A very vicious film - so vicious that it is called boring and not worth the time.
