This is my first movie Almodavar. I admit, we chose him mainly because we knew that this had the tempting perspective of Antonio Banderas in gay sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is all that this film recommends. I consider myself quite a sophisticated audience, I like European films, feature films, and I can generally recognize a quality film, even if I don’t like it. <br /> <br /> But this film was a complete form for me. The plot was ridiculous, the characters are lifeless, the box called it “funny comedy”, but I never laughed. Heard and awkwardly built, with many meaningless dialogues. I do not understand at all - it looks like an amateur effort. Can anyone enlighten me?
