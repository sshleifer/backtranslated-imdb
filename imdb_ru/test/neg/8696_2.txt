For a truly wonderful film, you can also try to watch a film about Saint Francis of Assisi - suitable for any audience. The best thing I liked about this film was the Mexican landscape, and the film rises to 2. I was surprised that these actors did not have a terrible tan, they were not desert inhabitants. They say that Moses has obstacles for the speaker, but, of course, he is not here. Even the “miracle” scenes were contrived and incredible. And what's the point if you can believe in the television story? Speaking of how I had muted myself, I thought that this film, created in “Hallmark”, is pathetic, and I understand why others hate Hollywood. I don't know, just some of these corporate grabbers. You do not need to be a religious person to benefit from Jesus of Nazareth, but for this waste of celluloid you need to be bored, do nothing, dull and religious. And for a real movie experience, try The Short Cut to Nirvana, a very highly rated movie.
