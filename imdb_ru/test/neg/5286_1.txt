This film is definitely one of the worst B-films I've ever seen. No plot twists at all. Although the game is decent, the plot is terrible. The film also has a lot of mistakes, and it was tiresome to watch. For any of you who love horror movies, slasher or even B-movies, I do not recommend it to anyone at all. Most of the film focuses on meaningless killings in ways that are not even worth discussing. This film can be compared with a crap remake of Jeepers Creepers, which was also not such a good movie. For those who want to spend the day at home, watching poorly made films, this one takes the cake.
