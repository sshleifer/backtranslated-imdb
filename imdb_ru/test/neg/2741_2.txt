I’m a pretty tolerant guy when it comes to movies, even B movies. I regularly watch some B movies for fun, and they can range from amazingly good to terrible. I used to set my expectations very low before watching movies of this type, and even after that Descent was just awful. I really did not mind that they to some extent tore the core, but they did absolutely nothing interesting with the material. Some scientists are concerned about the seismic activity of the Earth, and they have to travel deep into the earth to stabilize the fireplace. Thus, we get a monotonously long installation, in which two dueling scientists, played by Luke Perry and Rick Roberts, have to work together on a top-secret mission called Project DEEP. The responsible person, General Fielding, played by Michael Dorn, is secretly hiding important information from Marsha Crawford's assistant, played by Mimi Kuzyk. The cast is completed by Natalie Brown, who plays Jen, a mission specialist, who created the Mole exercise, which is used to dive into the depths of the Earth. <br /> <br /> In addition to some pretty good special effects, and install the design, nothing about the descent is not worth it. The film begins quite fascinatingly, but quickly gets stuck in a tedious story of uncontrolled seismic activity, which was filmed to death in other films, such as “The Core”. Descent also has a bad scenario, with a useless, forgotten dialogue between the characters. Worse, literally there is no action, no real threat or danger. Attempts to alleviate comics are painfully unfunny. There are holes in the plot, and some of the sections at the end remain untied, leaving an unpleasant taste in the mouth. <br /> <br /> Closing this movie was just a cheap way for everyone who got paid. There were no thoughts behind this film, no innovations, it just is. In addition to some pleasant-looking special effects and scenery, this film fails on any other level. The story is from the bin of Hollywood, and the characters are uninteresting to boot. The descent will just bore you in boredom and frustration. Avoid at all costs.
