Perhaps this is the only worst film I've ever seen - it has no good features at all. <br /> <br /> It looked like it was taken off after about 20 minutes, and another time was filled with the header graphics. <Br /> <br /> The protagonist has turned from the door of death to superman - and what are you <br /> <br /> In addition to this absolutely predictable and not at all interesting. <br /> <br /> I left the cinema I feel deceived. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I can't recommend this movie to anyone.
