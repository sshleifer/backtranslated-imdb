This film was terribly awful. Most of the film consisted of people running through the woods, walking through the woods or dancing in the woods. More than half, at least. Then two children, who discover two "horribly mutilated bodies" in the forest, return to the forest the next night for a romantic walk. ????? There is no time duration. his day, his night, his day, his really real night, his twilight, his black tar, his day. All the forest scenes continue until you think you are crazy. really bad. The sheriff discovers a five-foot claw imprint embedded in the mud of the forest, and theorizes that the super-large alligator may have learned to walk upright. A really stupid movie with no real motivation written for characters. It may be interesting for young children, as an alternative to really graphic things.
