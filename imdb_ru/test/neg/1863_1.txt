Ghoulies IV begins at the museum’s vault, where a blonde of PVC and leather, clad in leather, Alexandra (Stacy Randall) is looking for an ancient gem, after protecting various guards, she calls on the demon Faust, with whom she worships and wants to have sex, to Unfortunately, she lost the jewel so he is not very happy and orders her to get the last one left ... Which belongs to Jonathan Graves (returning from the original Ghoul (Peter Liapis, 1985)), who has an experience of being obsessed with demons and the like after the events of Nala Ghoulies. Alexandra is starting to search for the precious stone so that she can permanently transfer Faust to Earth from the “other side”, well, in fact, I do not know. Hmm, that's all it really is ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Jim Vinorsky, whose very name shakes my back when it is attached to a film that I'm going to spend 90 minutes of my life on Goulies IV as I expected, complete, complete and complete nonsense from beginning to end, and it is so simple and straight forward. Hmm, the “script”, Mark Sevi’s cough practically has nothing to do with Guli’s other film, except for its name and the fact that they managed to convince Leapis to repeat his role, which also has an additional bonus - the ability to use the footage. from the original, although it has nothing to do at all. There are almost no stories, the whole film is a real routine, it is incredibly boring and retarded, slowly, predictably, impeccably clean, like blood or blood, and there are two comic reliefs that, I suppose, should have filled the Guli quota, even if they do not look at all like in previous films, and it’s actually just a shame to watch, in fact, I think they practiced ventriloquism for most of the film, like when they say they don’t say don't move ... you know , I no longer want to talk or think about Ghoulies IV, so please trust me, when I say that this is one big piece of shit, the size of an Elephant, do not waste your time or money. <br /> Dirctor Wynorski turns into a completely rotten film on almost every level, special effects are terrible, like the whole movie. Obviously, Ghoulies IV is a kind of horror comedy, but it does not hit any target, as in the saying, and this is not funny and not scary. The best thing about this movie is actress Randall in her PVC clothes and leather that runs around trying to find a jewel, and it’s hardly worth looking through this garbage. There is a half of a decent car scene with several accidents, but it looks like it was edited from a completely different film and given Vinoorsky's track record, I'm sure it was. Forget about any blood because there is none. <br /> <br /> Technically Ghoulies IV sucks, it’s obvious that he had a low budget, but that’s just no excuse for making things so bad, isn’t it? Lapis returned to the cast, although he probably would like him to stay aside, Randall, dressed in PVC, could easily be the best in this film, which says a lot. <br /> <br /> Ghoulies IV is shit, say nothing more really. I honestly do not see anyone who loves movies that get something from this, I just can not. I can't believe I'm going to recommend the original Ghoulies around, but this will happen now, because although it's shit too, it's damn better than Ghoulies IV, one to avoid people, and you can thank me later. Things I look through so you don’t have to, honestly ...
