This is one of those movies made for TV B that are so terrible that they love it. <br /> <br /> Bad behavior, a predictable scenario and funny special effects, which were pretty much one of the cheapest tattoos, make you need to keep looking to see if it will get any better. <br /> <br /> This is not true!
