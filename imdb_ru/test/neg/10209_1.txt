No Holds Barred is a film that should never be taken seriously. This is a terrible hardcore as a serious movie. Look at it the way you should plan the 9 from space. They are one in that both are so bad that they are ridiculous. The funny moments in No Holds Barred are those that should not be. When Reap (who is played by Hulk Hogan just for being able to play them) captures the driver of a limousine in the front after his first meeting with Brel (Kurt Fuller), after which the gaiety begins, and this is one part of the movie every person should see. I swear this could be the funniest scene in history. <br /> <br /> In any case, as someone thought that this film will bring money, I will never know, and this person should probably be beaten to betrayal. I hope they at least have been fired. This film earns 1 out of 5 points on my scale, and this is only for unintentionally funny roles.
