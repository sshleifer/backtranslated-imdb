It was one of the slowest films I've ever experienced. After the entry, in which we are told about how “something” killed a couple of people in a farmhouse, we become acquainted with a white, freer family that moves to a farm - AND DOESN'T HAPPEN ANYTHING. Then they meet this bum who helps on the farm. And nothing happens again for a very long time. Then, finally, the girl from the family has something that happens to slander. Then something else happens, the vagrant guy goes crazy and the film ends. Meanwhile, everything was about how this family had to leave due to the fact that the girl had some problems at home and had no money, and it was so awful that I didn't give a damn about these pathetic people. I can't believe that I really went to the theaters to see it! Not only did this movie suck, but some kind of hole in $$ answered his cell phone, stupid idiots rustled And the movie sucked. That's why theaters are sucking - bad movies, crazy food with high prices and idiots in the theater, now I stay at home and watch a DVD, at least I could smoke if I was at home when I watched this stupid movie. Stay at home and bake some cake, and don’t go to the theater to see this typical piece of shit. Stupid stupid crap.
