Don't get me wrong: I like movies, low-budget films, character studies, and foreign films. Unfortunately, I could not enjoy it - the glacial rhythm, the complete lack of plot and characters that you do not like enough to hate, but you can not tolerate enough to please. <br /> <br /> For Me, Distant, it was like watching episodic reality shows on the indoor floor — all the scenes that were considered too uninteresting and that usually didn’t make the final version were the only scenes involved. The camera in my apartment, in which my two friends are sitting for hours, does not make an interesting film. <br /> <br /> Distant, of course, makes the viewer feel like this - long segments without dialogue (almost 10 minutes before the first word is borrowed from the credits) can be made to work (2001 is remembered), but something must happen for me still convincing to attract me. <br /> <br /> If you are one of those who is an observer who can watch a movie and be content with analyzing the film, it may be suitable for you. However, if you prefer to watch movies in order to relax, broaden your horizons or have fun, you should probably look for something else.
