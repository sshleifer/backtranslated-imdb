I caught it on HBO under its “Guilty Pleasures” category, and I would agree that I felt guilty (and joyful) watching it. First, it is garbage, and really dirty garbage. Secondly, the plot is slow and predictable, and when you find out who made it, you think, “So what?”. However, I have to admit that the chauvinistic pig male is enough to want to see what is clearly a bad film, if only for some other reason, except that Peta Wilson was completely naked several times -for seeing it? Yes. I'm sorry I watched it? Not. So, there is a contradiction between the lover of good films and the lover of female anatomy, even in a bad film. Sigh!
