So I'm not a big fan of Ball's work, but again, not so much. I liked his movie Post (maybe I'm the only one). Obviously, Ball bought the rights to use Far Cry even before the game itself was over. <br /> <br /> People who like to kill mercenaries and penetrate secret research laboratories located on a tropical island should be warned that this is not Far Cry ... This is what Mr. Ball planned with his Legion schmuck ... Feeling lonely on the set, Mr. Ball invites his three compatriots to play. These players are named Til Schweiger, Udo Kier and Ralph Moller. <br /> <br /> Three names that actually made them big enough in the cinema business. So the story goes like this: Jack Carver plays Tyla Schweiger (yes, Carver is German, everyone welcomes guys who eat guys !!) However, I think Tils, who plays this film, is pretty cool .. People complained that he really does not remain true for Carver’s entire agenda, but we only saw Carver from a first-person perspective, so we don’t know what he looked like when he kicked **. <br /> <br /> However, the plot The line in this movie is insane. We see the evil mad scientist Dr. Krieger, played by Udo Kier, making Genetically-mutated soldiers or GMS, as they are called. Performing my top-secret research on the island, which for some reason reminds me of Spoiler Vancouver. That's right, no palms here. Instead, we got some good woodcutters. We didn’t even go FAR before I started screaming (Mehehe), I can’t continue anymore .. If you want to stay true to Ball’s machinations, then go and watch this movie, you will not be disappointed, it will give you a true impression of Boll, there are most of them suck. <br /> <br /> There are some things worth mentioning that would mean that Ball did a good job on some areas of the film, such as a good boat and fighting scenes. Until the whole GMS Cromed / Albino team takes the stage, and everything just makes me laugh ... Far Cry smells like a Scheiss (this is a poo for you, simple) from Faire, if you want to get a wifi, go on .. BTW Carver gets a very annoying bosom friend who forces you to shoot him for the first three minutes while he is on the screen.
