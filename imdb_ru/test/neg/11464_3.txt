This film is called "Solomon Kane." It is not so. The main character wears a hat, but that’s all he has in common with Robert Howard’s character Solomon Kane, as we know from early pulp magazines and numerous publications since then. This is a fantastic film, not so bad, and it could easily pass with a fairly good overview - if it weren't called Solomon Kane. The hero is a newly invented character who is definitely not SK. This is not Robert Howard. <br /> <br /> As a science fiction film, this is another film that follows the traditions of the genre: a simple story, bad computer graphics, bad actors, bad direction. However, it can be fun, you know: "the cheaper they are, the better." But since it is called Solomon Kane, I cannot accept it. Imagine the movie "The Lord of the Rings" with the hero Bilbo, who fights with the black sorcerer Saugalf with the help of his friend, the dwarf Aragorn and the beautiful heroine Shadowfax. And in the final battle, where the three use the magic ring to kill the evil sorcerer who turned into the dragon Gondoriana. Submit it. This is exactly what this movie did with Robert Howard’s character Solomon Kane. <br /> <br /> I would give it a 4-star review if it was just another horror movie, but since it's called Solomon Kane, I can rate only 3 stars.
