A cryptozoologist captures a mythical chupacabra on a Caribbean island. To bring her back to civilization, he bribes his way into the cargo bay of a large luxury cruise ship with a funny one, and I think the script had disastrous results. <br /> <br /> To begin with, what I really didnâ€™t like in this movie ... Monster really looked like a guy in a rubber suit. CGI scenes looked like another movie. Well, now I have on my chest all the pleasant memories of this movie "B". <br /> <br /> The best was John Rees-Davies (his daughter is very curious). John was at times amusing, courteous and Regardless of what the writers made him say, he said it well. Good job, considering what he had to work with. The zyptozoologist had too much strength, and it was also interesting to watch him, he had some funny moments. The marines were fine and well cannon fodder for the monster, like some of the crew and guests. There are some pretty funny lines in this movie and a rather funny story involving a thief. <br /> <br /> Special effects are usually meant for and I swear they used the same blood spatter on the stage in about four different parts of the film. I really liked the blood of a legless person. Indeed, since this film was not at all scary, I feel that a little more blood would go towards improving the ability to watch this film. <br /> <br /> In general, if you like monsters B, it is worth a visit.
