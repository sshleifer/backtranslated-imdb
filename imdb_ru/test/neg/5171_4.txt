First, I will give this film a low score of 4 out of 10! It was nothing more than a film about imitation. I felt very disappointed when I watched this movie. I led to people, it would be more drama and more facts about the real story on which it is based. Instead, I spent over an hour looking at middle-aged people breaking the law and taking drugs. <br /> <br /> It's a bit like a football factory, but without a real storyline and a bad ending. After watching the movie, I wondered "What is this movie about?" If you like movies without a real storyline, with a lot of addicts and curses, then this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> I am a BIG fan of mobs and gangster films, but this film did not live up to deception. I can see where the writer was trying to go with the film, but he never reached the destination. One of the worst British films I've ever watched. If the film had more plot, it would be nice.
