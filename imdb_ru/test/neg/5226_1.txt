Wow, this is anti-Christian bias! This is based on Stephen King's novel, and he wrote this type of bias before, and then Hollywood exaggerates it even more. In this film, we see how a Protestant priest and a Catholic priest BOTH behave like fools and at the same time are unclean. Of course, the devil captured the city, so maybe his influence on these guys, too, but they are typical Hollywood images. They never show a minister who speaks and acts like Billy Graham, or your local minister or priest. And - one more “given” - they make the character of Satan the most interesting in the film. <br /> <br /> Max Von Sydow plays the Devil and makes him a nice guy. Ironically, Von Sydow played several of these roles after portraying Jesus in the 1964 film The Greatest Story of All. You wonder why the actors are so screwed up? They do not know whether they are God, Satan, or anyone else between them. <br /> <br /> Ed Harris, who has played many incredible roles right up until the last few years, has played this story accordingly. He and the other vile characters of this film are NOT funny to watch. <br /> <br /> Judging by what I heard, King’s book is even darker and more painful than this film, filled with hatred. but better built. Honestly, who cares. King and Hollywood deserve each other.
