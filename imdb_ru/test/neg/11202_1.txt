Gordon Scott, with his well-combed hair, an hourglass shape, and a strange English pidgin, should be the worst of all Tarzans. As for the other actors in this mess, they are on par with any elementary grade drama class of the 4th grade. I have seen used car dealers in television advertising who can act better. They make Clayton Moore look like Lawrence Olivier! And where is Jane (boring Eva Brent) taking her lipstick and eyebrow pencils in the jungle? I understand that they were made for children, but wow! The plot line seemed normal, but the director had to demand more from his actors. I understand that even the Weissmuller films have several drawbacks, but this one seemed so “low-budget”.
