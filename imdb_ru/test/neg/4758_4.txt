This frothy romantic comedy is based on a story I loved as a teenager, but now I find it rather unpleasant. In the case of May-September attachments, undoubtedly, what the older party thinks is either a passion, or an inability to withstand the reality of aging, or both. And the younger one is most likely looking for a kind parent who she (or he) lacked in childhood. These foundational plans now seem pathetic rather than romantic to me; they also have something rather predatory. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell looked a little embarrassed - as he should) play the older lover in this stupid story. At fifty, he played the role of a thirty-five-year-old man marrying a teenager. But young Debbie Reynolds was a knockout - beautiful, bold, and full of vinegar - how bad a 17-year-old lead was, presented as a kind of “gift” to a morally honest and honest screenwriter, as a subject for study. Her energetic performance took away my best grade than this film would otherwise deserve. Ann Frances was named the beautiful but fragile bride of Powell, and deftly coped with her small role. <br /> <br /> Some of the dialogs were pretty funny too, so this is not a complete flush. <br /> <br /> 5/10
