The only way I can feel good by giving up these precious moments of my life is to tell someone every day how terrible it was. And even if I say it once a day, every day until the end of my life, I will not fully understand my point of view. Just dumb. <br /> <br /> In such films there is a difference, and in such films as “The Elephant” or “The Fat Man Goes Mad”, two of my other least favorite films. The last two were terrible, yes, but it was. Evan Almighty takes a strong cast and tries to kill them all. Wanda Sykes, Jonah Hill, John Goodman and Steve Carrell ... WHY GOD, WHY? All these people have much better talents, and now every time I see any of them, I remember this terrible film. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave him 2 instead of 1 was when I watched the movie was an elderly woman with a mental disorder who thought that a storm of bird rind and jokes when they were beaten on instruments construction, were so funny that she did not stop laughing all the time, almost stroking several times.
