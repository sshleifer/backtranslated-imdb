It may be unfair to dislike the film for not being like that and not because it is, but I approached this, hoping that the director would finally make a film about rural gays and women from a small town. Instead, the focus is on outrageous fanaticism (big news!) Of the Locals (and residents of the neighborhood) and the truly awful torture / murder of a young gay. <br /> <br /> So much time is devoted to stupid people screaming about AIDS, sin, hellfire and perverts. So much time has been devoted to the disgusting preacher, who speaks about the Bible, and that gays get what they deserve. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see more people who came to the "little gay bar", and not those who are against it. In addition, the dead young man is not even from this city. <br /> <br /> The whole movie works as a warning rather than as a holiday, and it is very suspicious.
