I watched “Deadly Journey” because David Suchet participated in it, after enjoying it in the TV series “Poirot”. And Joss Ackland is always worth seeing, so I entered the film, expecting it to be a potentially useful film. Alas, this should not be. <br /> <br /> I will not bother criticizing performances, tempo, cinematography or any other structural aspect of the film; others here have already given their opinion on these elements. The only thing I want to address is the message of the film, since the introduction says that it is based on real events, and this is the supposed importance of the film. <br /> <br /> “Deadly Journey” is primarily devoted to an impoverished African American named Kingsley, who wants to move to the United States because he believes he can make money there. No more, no less - his motivation is completely selfish. (Of course, some people will perk up, saying that he did this for his family, but in fact he decided to have children for the income he could do in Ghana, so he really just created his own problem.) To this end, Kingsley decides to put on board a Russian cargo ship bound for New York. In the process, he faces harsh conditions, racist crew members and other problems. <br /> <br /> But it is here that the film leaves me without sympathy. Why should the public care about Kingsley? Just because he has a goal? Goals are not such a rare commodity, such as, for example, its privilege, the goal of the captain of the ship or the woman he left at home with his newborn child. Kingsley’s goal is illegal in the eyes of the US government. This is also illegal, as it steals from a Russian shipping company. If he gets to the US, it will be due to the withdrawal of the system into which he has not implemented. And if he is caught, the shipping company will be fined $ 45,000. I very much doubt that one of the free-riders cares about how much their chosen course of action is worth; they are clearly just for their own benefit. He could spend the $ 1,000 he won in the lottery at the beginning of the film on legal entry into the United States and apply for a residence and work permit. Instead, it follows an illegal (and dangerous) path. <br /> <br /> Since Kingsley’s journey is illegal, selfish, and cannot be ethically justified, why should we take care of him or his ordeal? Just because he faces problems? Why should his calls be preferred to the call of a Russian shipping company to get to New York without shelters? Because he is black, and the transport company is white? It seems that the reason is that Danny Glover (the executive producer of the film) and other participants want us to support Kingsley, as if he were a hero on some kind of noble journey. But as soon as you acknowledge that illegal immigration, theft and the mission of a fool are not noble at all, you cannot really take care of him. <br /> <br /> Before anyone draws a race card, I assure you that I will do it. I felt the same, no matter what ethnicity or nationality were the parties involved. Imagine that a Briton decided to get on a train heading for Bhutan, to cross the border and collect "undesirable" Buddhist antiquities to return to Britain for sale. How much sympathy can cause problems he has encountered? Very little betting. So why should we feel different for Kingley? Because he is black? Because he is poor by American standards? The filmmakers expect that we share their views on the fact that the goals justify the means, and that the shipping company, fined $ 45,000, is insignificant compared to the unlikely possibility of an unskilled worker to earn a little more in the US than he could if I would just stay in my native country. I haven't bought it for a minute.
