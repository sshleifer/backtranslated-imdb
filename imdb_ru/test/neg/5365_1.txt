I was very excited when Paranormal State first appeared on A & E. I thought this could bring more interesting ghostly evidence. The production value looked good and I really love the logo. Then, after several episodes, I began to feel that this show might not be looking for evidence, but it had a strong religious program. <br /> <br /> It seems that in every case under investigation there is some big powerful evil demon who cannot even make the cup move to the camera, but everything is terrified. Then comes the ritual of the power of Christ, which saves everyone. <br /> <br /> In addition, very little attention is paid to other team members. The entire series is dedicated to Ryan, and he feels like one of those people who give you brochures about his church on the street. <br /> <br /> Paranormal phenomena and demons are becoming new missionaries of Christianity, scaring people converting to Christianity? Indeed, it must be in the Christian network. I was very disappointed.
