It was on Scifi last weekend and I had to check it out. In the end ... it was science fiction with vampires and Erica Eleniak. What can go wrong with this B-film? <br /> <br /> A lot. <br /> <br /> For a start: it can't even be classified as a “B-film” because it would put him in the same league as Roger Corman ... and this film does not even meet his expectations. Most of the money they spent on contact lenses for vampires. <br /> <br /> Secondly: the casting was terrible. Yes, it was a smart move to appoint Udo Kiera as captain of Demeter ... but the director obviously could not make Kiera remember his lines. Eleniak's acting in a vampire movie is also a smart move, because it means that a bunch of excited guys are going to buy / rent / record this movie to see how it is seduced by a vampire. But the director, screenwriter and producer also screwed up. Of course, they got some money from poor, miserable souls who like to watch vampire films with hot women in them ... but no one will remember this movie in two or three years. <br /> <br /> Thirdly: the little things that just underline the laziness in this film. For example, Van Helsing calls the cross a “crucifixion”, and when Mina is placed in a coffin, the viewer can clearly see the fact that her “chest” is nothing more than a pillow. <br /> <br /> Oh, and one more thing: why did they choose a Dracula such as George Hamilton instead of looking decently scary? Does George Hamilton have an overwhelming influence on our future? Why did everyone who saw Dracula just laugh at him because of his awakening? <br /> <br /> Loss of time. Even with a TiVo remote in hand.
