A few years ago, I remember reading an essay by a feminist filmmaker who briefly mentioned Rosalina Russell. This theorist wrote that the “strength” of “strong women” that Rozzy R. played was partly in their ability to support her man (even if he wasn’t worth it). <br /> <br /> I thought of this essay after watching "The Crimes of Passion." <br /> <br /> Kathleen Turner demonstrates the same strength and style as Russell in her portrayal of the prostitute China Blue. She is an object of affection for two men: a crazy priest, played by Anthony Perkins, and a soft white bread boy, whose marriage is gradually fading away. And she will not allow any of them to get a piece of it, until ... <br /> <br /> I will not give up the final, but I will say that this is the ultimate Bland White Boy fantasy. No matter how hard Ken Russell tries, he cannot hide the fact that this film is essentially a 1940s melodrama for the MTV generation. With the exception of their regressive class and gender policy, these old black and white films look revolutionary in comparison.
