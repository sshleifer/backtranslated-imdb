Concorde: Airport'79, currently the latest from the Airport in Camp series, at first glance in a TV guide or DVD cover, you might just think that the movie you are going to watch is as exciting as the previous airport think again ! What you are referring to is 2 hours and 3 minutes of unintentional laughter, kindly provided by the worst script ever written by him, who even wrote Eric Roth, who brought the world "Forrest Gump"! Well, for sure, the script is not worthy of Oscar, he is worthy of Razzi! The executives of Universal in 1979 did the right thing advertising it as a “comedy”, except Charo! the film has a really impressive list of actors, which is, of course, watchable at least
