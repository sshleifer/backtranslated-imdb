I never intended to write a review of this film. In fact, I was just looking for the name of a movie star, and then I started reading reviews ... I guess I will never learn. This movie is terrible! I am not going to justify my comments with specific reasons, because itâ€™s really hard for me to believe that someone with any taste really likes it. Guilty pleasure? Ok, probably. But such a bad film that wasted so much talent (Kane, Gelbarth and Donen) is the cause of grief, not enjoyable entertainment. A low point for all participants, with the possible exception of Bologna, which should sit at night trying to figure out which bomb was the bomb that destroyed his career.
