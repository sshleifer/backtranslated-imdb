I like movies about vampires, I love bi-movies, I love movies about vampires. But this one does almost nothing for this. Some acting games are terrible, especially from 3 male leads. The story is not particularly interesting. On a relatively short 88 minutes, it still seems too long, and you will find yourself a little ahead. There are a lot of kung fu vampire attacks. Sounds cool? This is not when it is done with a low budget. It repeats very quickly. There is a little blood and blood, nothing to worry about. There are good wires where you can see the wires. It has some nice landscapes shot in Puerto Rico. <br /> <br /> Do not rent
