Seriously, I can not imagine how someone can find something flattering to say about this film, much less find it in itself, to write luminous compliments contained in this comment section. How many methamphetamines did Bogdonovich have during the shooting of this film? He gave the award to the actor who spat out his lines with the greatest speed and least exaggeration or thought? The dialogue is bad, the plot is terrible even for the comedy of the “madman,” and he claims that the film is a tribute to the classic comedy about the most senseless thing I have ever heard. Cinematography is lower quality and innovation, which show the worst films for television, acting is terrible (although I feel that the blame for this lies right on the director’s lap), and, saying, Did I mention that the direction is so unpredictable and incomprehensible that Is it beyond the definition of a word? All this is terribly unfunny (even in such a besieged world of so bad, ridiculous talkers), exhaustion of the soul, a waste of two hours of your life that you will never return. Be afraid, very afraid ...
