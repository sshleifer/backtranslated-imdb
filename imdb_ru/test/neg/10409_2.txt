This is a small film that is worth your time to find and watch. <br /> <br /> He really talks about all the worldly decisions that we all make every day and (like HG Wells's story, which I can't remember) can live to want back. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that this is a SHORT (very short). It starts slowly, but as soon as you start thinking that it became boring = bang = it's over. And believe me, the "highlight" is what you remember. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure that the producers will make it available for purchase - or available on the Internet, but in any case you would be happy that you took the time to get a copy - of that I am sure.
