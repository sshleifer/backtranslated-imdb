I hope this was done before Half Past Dead and Exit Wounds, because it was rubbish, Seagal was not to blame for the fact that it was a crappy guide when several action scenes took place. The plot was also confusing, and basically it was just confusing, maybe it was postponed and released to benefit from the new Seagals films ?? <br /> <br /> 3/10 <br /> <br /> He has not finished bringing Under Siege 3 and losing weight!
