I paid $ 2.00 for this piece of shit, I want my money back. This is an ad-level horror movie that is not so good. <br /> <br /> There are many MANY floors in this film, including acting, no horror, no nude (that besides the beginning nurse (porn outfit) the nude flash still breathed, <br /> <br /> The sound track may be the best because it has some kind of rhythmic Guitar Riffs / tracks. <br /> <br /> There are your usual typical characters, an athlete, an athlete, a nerd (who is more looks like an athlete), policeman / ranger novice (who has the biggest gap in his teeth, I wanted to stick in go a few dollar coins) go to the abyss ... or go to the field goal) a mysterious guy and a pure girl <br /> <br /> The make-up was pathetic, the side view of Dr. Chopper with a clear “make-up line” and natural skin tones, the cover on the DVD clearly photoshop / improved to make the cover more attractive, as Dr. Chopper looks old naughty. " The scruffy women who moan around Dr. Chopper are not explained and / or Oh, convincingly, like this whole movie. <br /> <br /> The plot of the story was VERY predictable, and the abundance of bad-looking FALSE limbs was funny, what they thought ... uh, scatter some limbs, and some fake blood, and you have a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Dr. Chopper himself is the stupidest person I have ever seen, although he is original, I believe that the creator of this film was tense for ideas and might have tried to use the rhyming doctor and the helicopter ( bike) and thought that bingo would make a bad shit about this movie. <br /> <br /> I have seen worse ... but this is just bad. ... everything is bad ... no expectation ... no real horror or character development ... no decent storyline ... the only good thing about this film was when it ended. This film does not fall into the category of “so bad is good” for me / <br /> <br /> In general, 2/10 the director / writer / editor should know better.
