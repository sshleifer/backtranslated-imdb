This is one terrible movie! Some people told me that it wasn't really that bad, but I disagree! The monster looks amazingly cheap (and funny), but that's what we all knew, I think. In addition to this, the dialogues are terrible, and the writing is just awful. <br /> <br /> No matter how bad it is, this film is a quality of entertainment. Not always for good reasons, but this is a good film "so bad it is fun." <br /> <br /> By the way, “Castan” does not exist. According to a minor character in a film called Pierre (described in the film as a French Canadian), there is a legend among French Canadians about a giant bird known as “Castan” As a French Canadian, I can assure you that I have never heard of such a legend. It certainly made me laugh though ... :))
