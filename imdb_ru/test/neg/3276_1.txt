I saw it on sale - NEW - at my local store for $ 6 and said: “Hey! An action movie with this guy from Bloodsport and Enter the Dragon, filmed by the guy who shot Enter the Dragon - and it's cheap! ”So, I bought it. Unfortunately! This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a few fools. <br /> <br /> Do you know how films that are deliberately polite, such as Evil Dead II and Dead-Alive, are AMAZING? Do you know how films that are supposed to be serious, but turned out to be so terrible that you have to laugh out loud and watch them again, for example, “The Lion Heart” (an old film about Van Damme) or “The Vampires” by John Carpenter are pretty cool? This film, Ironheart, cannot be one of them. I don’t know what the filmmakers thought about, but it looks like this film was made without shooting time, without a budget for anything, and without a script to talk about. (While I am writing the script, I have to note that in this film, Bolo Jung has NO LINES - the only reason he gets the first bill on the box is the fact that he is the only actor in the film that you will ever know ( if you are not a Jackie Chan fan, in this case you will recognize the bad guy - and you will want to call him Giancarlo!). <br /> <br /> What else is sad is that this film is from 92 years old. By then T2: Judgment Day has come, so you know that the era of the hostility of the 80s is over ... but not quite. After that you will think that the films are H aka Norris 80s, school comedies and Jason / Freddie sequels were works of pure genius. <br /> <br /> What you need to know: <br /> <br /> 1) No one in this movie can play the role of beans. The closest thing you get is Richard Norton, who looks accordingly rich and defiant, and Bolo Jung, who looks accordingly shabby ... and defiant. Everything else is terrible. <br /> <br /> 2) Scenes of martial arts are forgotten - just a lot of cases when white guys with lots of muscles take off their shirts, shout, run to Britton Lee, they are beaten by Britton Lee, gets hit by Britton Lee, and then falls. Even the final fight with Bolo is disappointingly short and about as creative as the design of my running socks (and equally smelly). <br /> <br /> 3) The rest of the action is also miserable: the weapon looks as if they came from the toy department at K-Mart, and really shoot with the sound of a kapgun. When someone is shot, they jump a little, and then lie motionless with patches of brownish-red liquid on their clothes. Britton Lee, obviously, got hit in the side, but you don’t see him at all, then that day you see a wound ... I had cuts on paper that were worse than that! <br /> <br /> 4) Of course, then the girl dresses the wound, then they kiss, and then you know that they are lying in bed and talking after sex. BUT? What kind? This film completely ignores the plausible development of love interest, as well as the development of any character's character. Remember how the characters of Bruce Lee did not need to have sex with someone to be cool? <br /> <br /> 5) Chasing the car is definitely the worst I've ever seen. It seems that the director was sitting on the curb with a hand-held camera when two cars woven along the road did, oh, I don't know, about 30 miles per hour? Do not try to do it at home, children, these people are professionals! Ha! <br /> <br /> 6) Bad letter. Here is the scene for you: Lee is being watched, so the girl follows the followers to “warn” Lee, but her car is too slow. So by the time she catches up with Lee and the bad guys are no longer in the cars, and a shootout will begin. Lee killed two bad guys, but a third shoots Lee when the girl nearly knocks Lee, so the bad guy runs away. (Eh?) Then the girl's car stalls and she can't start it. She tells Lee that she is participating now, and she goes with him. He indicates to her that they cannot leave her car there, because the bad guys will follow her behind her. She somehow convinces him that he must decide how to deal with this problem - so he shoots the gas tank and blows up her car. (And remember, later that night they have sex.) <br /> <br /> 7) If you take a closer look, in more than half of the pictures of the nightclub the dancers are not very much in sync with the music. Dancers are also too coordinated with each other (obviously, in the 80s, all people in dance clubs took dance lessons). In the DJ booth there is a girl with a microphone, but she does nothing except dancing. The bouncers tell people who are struggling to “pull it out” - without moving their lips. In one scene, only bouncers Lee and Stevo pass by the entrance, but with their backs to it! In addition, apparently, if you are the main character in the film, you can go straight to the beginning of the line. <br /> <br /> 8) Lee notices that he is being watched for the first time, but he doesn’t notice the second time - although this is the same guy in the same car. The girl, however, notices. The bad guys are watched twice, but they never notice. <br /> <br /> 9) Lee is concerned that the bad guys will track the girl's car to her, even if they have already seen him appear where she works twice. The girl continues to leave her child at work, under the supervision of a friend, until she has sex with Lee. DO NOT LEARN to raising children from this film! <br /> <br /> I can’t remember more complaints now ... You understand ... Ironheart is so bad that it’s not even funny, it is an AAD.
