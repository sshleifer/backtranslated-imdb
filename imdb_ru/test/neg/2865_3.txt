I really enjoyed several films of Gerard Depardieu and expected that I would enjoy this film much more than I did. The main reason was that I simply did not find the film very interesting or ridiculous, so it did not interest me. In addition, although he does not sleep with his stubborn daughter, the thought that she is lying, telling everyone that he is her much older lover, is just disgusting! Yes, I know that there is no incest, and I know that none of them know that he is actually her father, but I found that any child who gave his father as a sexual lover is too rude and prevents the film from being - really funny. In addition, I really did not like this little guy. Besides her lies, she seemed very cheeky and self-absorbed. I would have preferred if she somehow got her “rebirth” and somehow was punished, because I just didn’t like her.
