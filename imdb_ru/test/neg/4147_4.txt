I really wanted this film to be liked, because I love Trom, I love the trailer, and I love Ghouls, another film by Ferrin. He had some almost good moments, for example, an old people's love song playing on a car crash scene, and a scene at the end where the main character gets some closure. But overall, it was just boring and slightly unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The “unimaginable” shocks that Ferrin invented were truly predictable and worn out. Poop, killing prostitutes, incest. Maybe still good, but poorly done. Not sure if he tried to offend, entertain, or both. Ultimately, did nothing. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, we watch movies Troma, because we want movies with a heart. This film did not always feel that he had a heart. There were some good scenes, but in the end it was boring and unpleasant.
