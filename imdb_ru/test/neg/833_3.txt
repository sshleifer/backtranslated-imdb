This is a classic example of what happens when the sitcom on television is too long. Everything gets tired, and the jokes start to repeat again and again. Well, right from the start, the first couple of episodes were pretty good. You had an entertainment manager (Simon Cadel) who was pursued by his deputy, played by Ruth Madoc, a cleaning lady who wants to become a yellow fur coat, an alcoholic who hates children Punch and Judy, a bent jockey and a comedian. As mentioned earlier, it all started well, but it lasted too long. As soon as Simon Cadel left, everything quickly went down, you had terrible storylines, and the new entertainment manager that Ruth Madoc (again) rushed to. When all comedies are filmed in one place, the number of jokes that can be cracked is limited. Unfortunately, it lasted so long that every joke was cracked 3 or 4 times. If this comedy was stopped after 2 episodes, it would become a classic of all times. Like this, it will be largely remembered for the terrible last few episodes.
