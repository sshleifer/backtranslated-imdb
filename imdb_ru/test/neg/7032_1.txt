I'm a big fan of Shirley Temple. When I watched this movie, he made me appreciate what a talented child really was, Shirley. Ashley Rose Orr did possibly the worst on Shirley's screen. Imagine an 11-year-old who has been playing Shirley Temple since he was 5 years old. That in itself is wrong. But make her “imitate” Shirley's voice? And her singing is awful. The dance was good, I will say it. As previous users said, there were few dramatic scenes, nothing interesting could be done. Even Amelia Earhart ... I would like to see more of the global phenomenon created by Shirley Temple. Too much attention was paid to the Wizard of Oz, when in fact Shirley was considered just Dorothy. The film portrays it as if it were the end of the world when it does not get the role. Shirley herself said she was glad that Judy Garland had played with her. For me, the star of the show was the lady who played Gertrude Temple. Otherwise, stay away! For the big Shirley Temple movies, see Heidi, Poor Little Rich Girl and Little Miss Broadway.
