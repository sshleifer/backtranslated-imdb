This is another Bollywood remake of a Hollywood movie. Hitchhiking ... If I'm right. <br /> <br /> In the film there are some great moments that will make you laugh out loud, to be honest, only from Govinda, who has become a legend in Indian cinema and will always bring his play in terms of comedies. Another bonus is Rajpal Yadav; who is cheerful as a gangster who imitates Don, an Indian icon of cinema. Lara Datta is a plus ... I know that I sound superficial, but mainly because I have a weakness for her, she tries to be funny, but it seems forced. Her play is weak ... but she still shines. Salman Khan is brutal, he tries to bring cool, charming depths, but fails miserably, he is behind the actions and continues to scream for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> "This is not a valid friend, this is called a mental disorder." <br /> <br /> Katrina Kaif is just bad ... not very good at anything. No charisma, no talent ... and I do not understand why people consider her pretty ... The plot was contrived, and it was difficult for me to believe that Katrina’s character was remotely attracted to Govinda. The only good thing is music ... “You are my love” was the best on the soundtrack.
