Hellraiser: Bloodline is where the continuation of the mediocrity of the Hellraiser series is good and really begins. Gone are the imagination and invention of the first two films. The spirit of Pinhead and his minions is gone. Gone are the sick desires of people. In fact, everything that once made Hellraiser so original was destroyed by this mess of paintings. <br /> <br /> All that remains is the basic premise of Christian mythology that there is a hell with evil demons. What happened to the evil that people do? This relaxed excuse for the movie “Hellraiser” is complemented by the endless “Psycho-chatter”, so that Pinhead becomes a meaningless philosopher, and not a harbinger of death, as it should be. <br /> <br /> The film uses the most basic formulas of the film, in which the characters are separated and killed separately. Pinhead is not a stranger. The connection between the box and the "demons" or "hell" is never established, it just brings a sacrifice and sits on the sideboard. <br /> <br /> The main character is called Rimmer, and the producers obviously think this is really funny, because everyone continues to pronounce her name. In fact, the film must be renamed to give it the name of this character. <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Kevin Yager and Alan Smith.
