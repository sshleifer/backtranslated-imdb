I assume that the previous film "House" was a hit, prompting Universal to squeeze a few more drops from the monster-dairy cow. The creative team must have been in a disposition mood, starting with the initial theme from the film “Son of Frankenstein”, and some personnel materials scattered throughout the film, like one unintentionally funny episode where Glenn Strange shots as a monster mixed with Karloff's clips from the Bride of 1935, and compared to the way the robot wanderer moved, Karloff seems to be moving like a cheetah compared to him. <br /> <br /> The continuity of the previous film is thrown into the background with regard to the wonderful death. The deceptive abilities of the Wolfman and Dracula, but when Dr. Edelmann and Larry Talbot discover a Frankenstein monster with a skeleton representing Boris Karloff, Edward Low at least recognizes some of the past film history, although Talbot never curiously mentions a meeting with Karloff . Dr. Niemann. <br /> <br /> Since this was supposed to be the last of Universal’s horrors, the supernatural elements of Wolf Man and Dragon (unconvincingly) turned into medical illnesses. Drake is told that he suffers from a blood disease, a very rare disease that allows him to turn into a bat or evaporate if sunlight touches him. >: -] And Larry Talbot just puts a little pressure on the brain. Of course, all this is painstakingly explained by the fact that in many scenes “many” medical jargon is mentioned. This turns out to be the biggest obstacle, because somewhere along the way, the filmmakers seem to forget about real horror or entertainment in favor of giving the monsters conditions that seem as treatable as the flu. <br /> <br /> Being a huge fan of Universal's old horrors, it's rarely so boring when I watch one of them. It all looks like a movie that was shot only because it could have been, but if this mess hadn’t been brought together, the monsters might never have met Abbott and Costello, so I think it turned out that something good
