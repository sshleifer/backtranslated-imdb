According to this masterpiece of the filmmaking scenario (the purpose of the pun), Charles Darwin was full of nonsense when he presented his theory of evolution, because he absolutely did not mention any alien interference. You see, the aliens sent Chupacabras to the ground, and they form the missing link in evolutionary theory. However, the rest of the film clearly emphasizes that chupacabras are a typical Puerto Rican phenomenon, so I don’t know what this refers to. They say all Puerto Ricans are aliens? Anyway, all this doesn't matter anyway. The only thing you need to remember is that “El Chupacabre” is a very cheap and useless amateur B-film that lacks tension, character development and any form of style. Several duets of people are chasing this creepy goat monster (vaguely resembling the subcompact version of the Pumpkinhead demon) through the streets and ghettos of an ugly city. We have a talentless dog lover and a grumpy writer, a pair of disgusting policemen and a supposedly evil scientist with his stupid accomplice. Since they are all extremely incompetent in what they do, the monster can casually devour all Latin American immigrants in the neighborhood. The monster itself looks good, and the effects of the cosmetics on the remains of its victims are acceptably rough and bloody. Actor's performances are terribly awful and cause headaches. In particular, Eric Alegria is pitiful in his first and only leading role of the overly ambitious Animal Control employee. Yes, this is an incredibly stupid movie, but you must have struggled with the worst and less funny low-budget trash.
