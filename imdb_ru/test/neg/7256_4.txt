So, you are a giant mantis, and you have been hanging out in the Arctic for a while, and you are tired of the fact that the Eskimos are beating you with snowballs. What do the giant mutant do? Of course, in a big city! See the sights, maybe catch a show on Broadway. But wait! As soon as you find a nice cozy tunnel that can be called your own, some nasty people start attacking you !! Argh! Time to break! <br /> <br /> In any case, this film is one step ahead of most other films about giant mistakes, because in 1957 it has a pretty decent FX. But that's all. Avoid if you really don't need to see another serious mistake crashing, or you won't see another actor Perry Mason in the movie B. <br /> <br /> 4/10
