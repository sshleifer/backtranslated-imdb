This film was terrible ... As someone might think that this film was similar to those that were in the "good old days" when Tim Thierson was not even in it. And even worse, they used clips from old trance films. That's just terrible. NO Trancer film is complete without Tim Thomrson. I love films Fullmoon, and I watch them from 4 years. I went through everything they did, and this movie almost made me lose it. Now I have a few lines to fill out, so I will continue. Their way of breeding new trances is completely stupid, as is the way to send Jack back in time. What happened to TCL Chamber. And finally! What happened at the end of the trancers 5, where Lina says, and I quote "Jack gave me something special" And she, and some others, look at her belly widely. I don't know ... maybe the baby is there. There were so many other places to go, but at the full moon S'd The Bed
