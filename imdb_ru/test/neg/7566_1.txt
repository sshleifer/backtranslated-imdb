There have been many films about the life of the American dream. And this is one of them. <br /> <br /> First, from a technical point of view, there is a lot of wrong. The sound is bad, I had problems understanding the dialogue here and there, and the position of the camera could be better. <br /> <br /> They really tried to come up with a good movie, but, for example, the part where they show how Jonathan loses himself in a dream, with girls, drugs and alcohol, done very badly. Acting is very bad, like all characters in the film. <br /> <br /> It was hard for me to watch it from beginning to end, and I could not wait for the end of the film. <Br /> <br /> If your expectations are low, and on Sunday you are bored because of bad weather, watch for it. If you need a deep story with action, then this is not your movie. <br /> <br /> Normally I would not give 1 point, but 4.5 for this film. But the reason I put 1 is the poor sound and camera use, not to mention the bad scenes with cheese effects.
