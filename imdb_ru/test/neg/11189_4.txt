I'm a big fan of surrealistic art, but this Bunuel film (with some ideas from Dali) left me cold. All his life, Buñuel took offense at the Catholic Church and admired attempts to offend Catholics in rather stupid ways. This is one of the most stupid; almost like what you expect from a smart 18-year-old in a movie class. The last few minutes of the film, which have nothing to do with something else, are the last blinding of religion. <br /> <br /> If you read “scientists” about this slow, sometimes funny movie, the thing is that the church and society are guilty of sexual repression. If this is true, then Bunuel expresses this in the most devious way. The main male character is disgusting cattle who love to kick dogs and knock down blind people on the street and mentally turn billboards into strange sexual fantasies. Is this behavior a mistake of the church (in that it interrupted his lovemaking), or is it just a jerk? I vote for the last. I think that Buñuel must have had many personal failures, and he chose the Catholics guilty. <br /> <br /> There are several moments when you can cry: “Aha! Surrealism! “ black and white). The rest is forgettable indulgence. Unfortunately, Bunuel still pursued the same pugalok to the end of his career (Viridiana, Discreet Charm ...). If you are interested in seeing surrealism on the screen, check out Jean Cocteau’s early work.
