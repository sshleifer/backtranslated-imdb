However, all the time I thought to myself, "Oh, God, why!" At the very beginning, I thought “Yes, it may be average,” but the action and plot in most parts were terrible. <br /> <br /> Each part in it was so predictable, even though the first film seemed to reveal a lot like a ring, it was a half decent movie, but it seemed to take all the good things in the first and made them terrible. Some bits made everyone in the audience wet themselves, for example. The part where Geller falls off the building made me sew up. My girlfriend had to constantly tell me to calm down. I kept commenting on what was going to happen next, and I was right more often than not. <br /> <br /> Why the entrance to the house makes her come for you It does not make sense. It was a bad excuse for many murders, and no depth was visible at all. <br /> <br /> You can see everything that happens, which just leaves you feeling that it was pointless to watch. Oh, she is behind her ... did not see someone approaching * yawning *. <br /> <br /> Surely these people must have thought ... oh, I don’t know, carry a knife with you or at least try to fight back instead of being eaten, but someone hair? At best, during the movie, I was very slightly scared (and I mean, to put it mildly), I just called out for loans when they rolled, I breathed out a short “Oh, thank God.” If you have not already done so, do not waste time and money; meaningless, the plot is less, sorry for the sequel!
