Leatherheads is a good name, but a leather strap would be more useful for self-flagellation after buying a ticket to watch this evil attempt at entertainment. Clooney's attempt at self-deprecating humor runs into a quiet thump, because his behavior implies that he does not look like him at all. Perhaps with another actor playing the role of Clooney, the film might be a bit acceptable. Sorry, George, I doubt that this time there will be an Oscar nod. George Clooney is definitely a fish out of water when it comes to comedy (unless you refer to his politics). In any case, looking at Leatherheads will appeal only to Clooneyâ€™s most ardent fans, and everyone else will have to miss the silent picture days.
