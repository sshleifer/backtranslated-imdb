I feel very generous, giving this film 2 out of 10. Well, I noted that the special effects are “good,” and Renny Harlin made one of my favorite films, “Genetically Modified Sharks Attack Research Station,” a film about which you may know how deep blue ocean. In addition, the opening credits are made quite well with the remix of “A Man More Humane Than A Man”, and he combines quite well with what is in the context of this “film”. But enough praise, let's look at the reason why this film is so much sucks. <br /> <br /> Never after the “Secluded in the Dark” by Uwe Boll, I did not feel that the special effects in the film were completely spent. Well, our story begins with four guys who are descendants of four different families. , each of which has never fully explained the power of the never fully explained family origin, which never fully explained the art of witchcraft. Yes, and for some reason these descendants are 17 years old, everyone goes to the same school, everyone learns the swimming team and everyone, for one reason or another, is sitting in bed with shirts, sweating and talking to each other on the phone. I have nothing against gay, gothic or thirteen-year-olds, but this film is aimed at that at ... 13-year-old goth, which questions their sexuality. Yes, there are girls in it who are sitting on a bed in shorts or something else, but why don't they take off their shirts? hey, that's fair. <br /> <br /> In any case, the characters in this film are told that when they turn 18, they will ascend and gain new deep, almost god-like abilities. But before going further, I forgot to mention that when they use their strength, they slowly grow old and become more dependent on it. This explains why they force people over the age of 20 to play at the age of 17. Yes, and if something requires an explanation, do not worry, someone will explain it all in one big dialogue. God, this movie sucks ... where have I been? Oh yes, part of the ascension. <br /> <br /> Well, obviously, there was a super secret alpha — one family that others had forgotten about, or some such, I don't know, I was dozing at that moment. But they recorded something, and the new student, who made friends with the group, "secretly" is one of these descendants from the fifth family. And I say “secretly,” because anyone who has seen any previews of this film knows that this new guy is a bad guy. I think he has more power than others because he is older. In any case, Bob Loblo (say it out loud) happens, and we begin the final battle in the film. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I fought for the witch. You know, like Saurmon versus Gandalf or something like a magical battle, because you know that these are witches and all that. Now that these two witches are dropping, it's more like ... how to put it ... a very, very crappy version of a Dragonball Z type battle. They throw things at each other, talk, throw things, talk, throw things, talk and so on. D. When I say “throwing things”, I say this only because I have no idea that F #% k throws them at each other. It looks like big chunks of mucous water. God, this film sucks, in any case, when our main witch “rises”, he does not at all become very powerful. He just throws big chunks of mucous water. Things happen, and it ends in such a way that you, as a viewer, know that it will end. The good witch wins, and the bad witch loses. <br /> <br /> You know what a shitty movie when a bad guy says something incredibly stupid, for example: "I will make you my Wiotch." That's where I wanted to hit. my face is sitting behind all this ... things. <br /> <br /> Yes, I admit, the thought of witches fighting, using strength in our day, sounds cool, but when the execution is bad, I really would like them not to make this film. Perhaps if he were R-rated, had tits and threw more deaths with blood, it could work ... it could work. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in viewing this, don't buy it or even rent it. Wait until it appears on TV, or borrow it from the sucker from a friend who bought it. Just do not waste your time on this film. If you spend any money on this, there is a high probability that you will make efforts to continue Uwe Boll called “Precept 2: Alone in the Dark with the House of the Dead”.
