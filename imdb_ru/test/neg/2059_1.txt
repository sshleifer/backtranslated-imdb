This film is a disaster from start to finish. 75 percent of the film is made from scenes taken from the film “HERCULAS AND THE GHOSTLY WORLD” and “HERCULAS AND CAPTURED WOMEN”, badly edited along with the original scenes that make up nothing but complete plagiarism. I'm a big fan of these two films, and from the fact that I shot the scenes, edited and rewritten with meaningless dialogue, I was dizzy. Such cheap tactics of producers to earn more money, deceiving an unsuspecting audience, basically killed the genre of Sword & Sandal back in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> In the new frame there is one memorable scene, and it is in it Hercules fights. with bad Hercules. The fight, though tough, and Giovanni Chianfrilla, who plays Antaius, definitely stands out. He makes an unforgettable sworn enemy of Hercuse. But the rest is an embarrassing situation on the border, which was probably lifted in one day. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs!
