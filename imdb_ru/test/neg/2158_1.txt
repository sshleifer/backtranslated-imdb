I do not understand how someone can say that it was a really good entertaining film. With a few famous actors, it was hard for me to believe that this was done only in 2005. This shit! Acting is equivalent to amateur drama, poor amateur drama. If you don’t want to laugh out loud at the amazing 100 minutes of pure corn, don’t worry about downloading or renting it, the worst I've seen in recent years. This is from the past days of acting, when cowboys shoot 8 bullets out of six shooters. The more famous the actor, the worse they were, Drury was just sad. I was utterly disappointed in Lee Major, did he actually sink into that kind of garbage? It was bad enough when he played a man for six million dollars.
