First of all, I want to say that I tend to be liberal on a political scale, and I found the film offensive. I managed to watch the whole shameful movie shame. This film brings few original ideas. Yes, it was original, so my 2 stars instead of 1. Don't our filmmakers think that they can only come up with this? It was terrible to act, and the characters were for the most part incredible. The main lady in history did not have good qualities at all. They turned her boyfriend into some kind of bad guy, but I didn't notice. Maybe I missed something, I do not know. He was the most mundane, the corresponding character in the film. I did not lay out money for this garbage. I would almost like PETA to come to the rescue of this horrible, abusive film and make a protest. Disgusting, that's all I want to say!
