No matter what other people say, you cannot watch this film without comparing it with the original, if it existed by itself, it would be a film of 2-3 out of 5, but this is a remake of 4-5 out of 5 film and so has standards to fit, and we need to see if he has reached those standards. If the film were a remake or, as in the Planet of the Apes, a rethinking of the original, you could watch the film yourself, just referring to the original. Imagine it this way, if someone took the model in Mona Lisa, portrayed it differently and drew it, you can only compare the frame, the concept, etc. With the original, but if someone just repaint it in the position of the original, you would need to compare it completely. <br /> <br /> However, this film is not just not as good as the original, but effectively falls through, whether we like it or not, but this original was one of the best films in history. Made, the scene in the soul will never be forgotten, the remake was supposed to be Hitchcock's holiday, but in the end it actually humiliated him and his masterful work. <br /> <br /> The detracting aspects of this painting were Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche. This has nothing to do with whether they acted better or not, the fact is that the relationship between Norman and Marion in the original was really quite innocent, Norman didn’t understand sex very well, he had almost no contact with the outside world, and when he meets the beautiful Marion and watching how she changes, you feel that he partially does it because of charm, because he doesn’t quite understand sex and his attraction to her, it makes Norman sympathetic and almost anti-hero, you are on his side, because that he does not fully understand the world and constantly shouts with himself and his "mother". In the remake, the whole dynamic was gone, I have to admit that Janet Lee was not my type, but she is very attractive, and you can see that Anne Heche is really unattractive, and therefore Norman, finding “her” Marion attractive, is incredible if you add that Norman Vince Vaughn, a masturbator looking at her, and you get Norman, who is just waiting to give a chance to expose any naked woman, whatever she looks like, which you absolutely do not sympathize with, they even more destroy Norman’s innocent nature putting then MAGS about in his room. He destroys the character that we like, and we feel sorry for him, it's like rewriting "This is a wonderful life" and having the main character of a pimp who is completely degrading. <br /> <br /> The only other character that I had problems with Rita Wilson as Caroline, partner Marion. In the original, when Pat Hitchcock says, “He must have noticed my wedding ring,” it causes a laughter reaction, because she absolutely jokes when Rita says it seems plausible, because in reality there is no other reason why will flirt with Anne Heche above her. <br /> <br /> I admit that I am very biased, the original "Psycho" is my favorite movie of all time, if the movie was remade, with another angle, then you could turn these characters on their heads, and that would be perfectly acceptable. <br /> <br /> The hitchhiker knows that the film will be too bloody in color and made in black and white to reduce it. It also made the film more atmospheric and frightening in its own way, and it gave him a beauty that could never be captured in color, and this sad statement about how films de-sensitize the public that people said that the scene was more frightening in color. (Note: before people think “he cannot write,” remember that I am from England, and we write this in color) copy and very bad at it. I could continue to compare, but this makes no sense, almost everything is excellent in the original. The only thing that is better is the performance of Viggo Mortensen as Sam Loomis, John Gavin was very flat in the original (Hitch called him “Hard” behind his back), and Mortensen gives a more believable, though less pleasant performance. William H. Macy and Julianne Moore are the only other actors holding onto the originals. <br /> <br /> In general, the film, which should be called "Dear embarrassing failed experiment." View only in comparison with the original or if the original is unknown to you. But also look at the original: “The film would get 3 out of 5 if it were original or reworked, but also 0.5 out of 5 (for Macy, Moore and Mortensen)
