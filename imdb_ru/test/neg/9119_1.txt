If not for the fact that it was a set of two DVDs paired with the original American graffiti; if it were not for the fact that I was here in Iraq for a few months and now I’ll watch almost everything, I would throw this film in the trash after the first ten minutes. This film was terribly bad on many levels, I just don’t know where to start. He acted badly, shot, sent, wrote, scored, edited. The first forays of my 9-year-old daughter to the film industry surpass this - and she rented a sleeping dog. (If you think about it, I give this piece of cinematography 9 stars. But I am biased.) If you value at least something like quality filmmaking, then avoid this garbage at all costs. Not a single character in this film has a single quality, except for an Icelandic girl who does not have a single line in English. I will not spend more time describing a bad movie.
