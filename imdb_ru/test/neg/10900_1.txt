But it is not. The plot is not so bad, the actors are not so terrible, so everything must be worthy. Instead, despite a good starting point, the plot just drags on and suffers from many of those “I can't believe he / she is so stupid” moments that are so often used in horror films to go on. Sometimes I would get upset about some decisions the protagonist made. It also took too long to get to the good part of the film. The wait is great, but you can’t spend more than half the film on making it. It's a shame, because he got a decent fame after the release and hit right before the big Halloween season. Despite this, I feel that it will receive at least one sequel, if not more, maybe they can develop a strong overall story in order to eventually release something decent.
