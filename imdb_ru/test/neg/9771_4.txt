Such a pain! The pain in the form that he promised in his central idea, but he did not fully recognize it and continues to let a lot of sand in his face. I would not say that this terrible South African / Canadian / British horror film is terrible, but it is too soft, predictable, and there is very little memorable in it. It is a guarantee that you will forget about it, not too long after viewing. I tried to watch it last night, but had to finish it in the morning, as I could not keep my eyes open. Even then, I could not remember where I stood up, which made me look at it from the beginning again. The only thing that struck a chord was the sharp cinematography of Andreas Poulson's vast, harsh and eerie desert places. Pleasant glossy chic creates a striking visual sense that cannot save the film from this general feeling of emptiness. Everything else is below par and almost breaks. Like the dizzying revelation of the beast. Yes. Computer-generated special effects of an ominous monster are tolerable, and there are several terrible flashes of torn flesh and bones. But there are too few of them, since it is impossible to hide the fact that the encrypted script wants to think about a conflict of a generic nature in order to create tension and uncertainty. It would be good if the withered script was more than just a shallow fluff, because it never caused a strong and long wait, but made it work uninteresting. The main characters are superficial, and the support for tokens falls into the basket. This is your stereotypical heap. The performances of Scott Barstow and Warrick Greer are colorless, and the beautiful Rachel Shelley tries, but looks rather weary.
