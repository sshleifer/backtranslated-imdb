What annoys me in the so-called "scientific" programs, such as these, is the fact that they are presented as if it were a FACT, that dinosaurs live "millions" years ago. First, no one can even conduct a scientific experiment to prove that the earth is millions / billions of years old. This is a superficial theory based on inaccurate radiometric dating methods with huge assumptions thrown into an evolutionary cauldron. <br /> <br /> Secondly, no one can prove that evolution has ever taken place. All of Darwin's missing links still disappear! If you look at all the fossils anywhere on earth or on earth, they are full animals of a certain kind, such as a dog or a cat. No one ever found the skeleton of a dog turning into a cat, or in the example presented in this series a dinosaur turning into a bird. <br /> <br /> This is complete bullshit. There is more evidence that Santa Claus exists than any animal that turns into another animal. <br /> <br /> All the ideas presented in this series are an attempt to eliminate the idea that the universe and everything in it is created. . <br /> <br /> This series is NOT SCIENCE. This is a religious worldview, which is hidden under the banner of science. Science is what we can observe and repeat. What you see here is SCIENTIFIC Fiction. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a science fiction program that decently recognizes that this is a science fiction program, then you should better watch Star Trek or Star Wars.
