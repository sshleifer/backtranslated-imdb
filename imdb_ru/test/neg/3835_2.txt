I admit it now. This is one of the loudest films in history. But, in defense of Mr. Shegrens, the scene “Not at all” was not at all bad! <br /> <br /> And you will surely enjoy trying to go to Sweden to find a lovely Swedish 15-year-old blonde to speak Swedish, posing as Jewish mother Henry (Dennis Hopper). <br /> <br /> What makes this scene so perfect is that Father Henry responds to Russian-speaking blonde who speaks Swedish (Hebrew?), German ... <br /> <br The best actor / actress of all the film should be a nun who cares about his mother Henry, a woman who has no experience in acting, but still puts the most convincing of all performances! <br /> <br /> Everything and everyone, this Flick for me personally is nostalgia, this is what gave me the opportunity to publish in the IMDb database: s. : D <br /> <br /> // Feel like a movie star *
