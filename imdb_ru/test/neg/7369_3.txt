Despite decades of tax breaks, in terms of international visibility, the Canadian film industry still lags behind most Central African and Islamic states (surprisingly few Canadian films are released outside their native shores), and The New Battle for the Brave are another example of why. Canadian commercial cinema, more than any other country, seems unable to develop its own identity and is stuck in a pale imitation of other countries' failures. On paper, this historical drama may look vaguely promising. There is certainly a rich share of unused material in Canadian history, as the French and the British struggled, bought and sold the colony, although not one of them got here, except for the strange “blink and miss” scene of characters saying “Wolf is dead” or “New France is gone” before returning to the soap opera. But although this is not a history lesson, this is not a drama or an epic adventure that promises a new headline: there will be no battle in the film, except for 10 seconds of shelling half a dozen reenactors and one shed collapsed. The city square, which is everything we ever see in Quebec, is a rather obvious, brightly lit studio interior, giving many scenes an old television miniseries, as well as the reluctance of director Jean Boden to offer a lot of shots in the form of long shots or even exteriors . What you get for your money is a simple, but protracted Harlequin novel about doomed lovers, constantly separated by events beyond their control, where the biggest surprise is that Fabio does not appear in the cast. This is the film where, when two characters are going to make a beast with two backs, the camera turns to a comfortable raging fireplace or waterfall. <br /> <br /> A joint Anglo-Canadian-French co-production, which is not 'To unite the once belligerent countries and quit any country with decent tax breaks, this huge cash catastrophe was clearly intended for the Canadian Titanic I forgot to tell the producers that they mean the film, not the ship - but it turns out more like a revolution done cheaply without battle scenes, crowds or those few moments that threaten to work for a short time in the face of irresistible chances of Montreal Mirror described it as "so bad that one can not even find the strength to make fun of him." This is rather unfair because, for most of its film, the movie looks like a mini-series from the 1980s, the last half hour suddenly becomes very funny when the characters accidentally put their feet in bearish traps, and vile husbands say: "You'll never see you again, handsome, the honor of a cuckold!" You both pay for it! and our heroine is accused of murder and - suffocating! - witchcraft in the test, funny enough to be in the version of "Scarlet Letter" Demi Moore. Add at the end of the Cadilla British governors, cunning slaves and Celine Dion singing, and you’ll have something that is almost like the movie that Timbo Hines sought to (and still managed to miss out on) with his legendaryly inept period version War of the Worlds ”, although without amazing technical incompetence. <br /> <br /> The versatility of lead man David La Haye seems to be limited to the number of other actors he can look at throughout the film: he begins to look like Andy Garcia, for a short time he takes on the guise of a revolution, Al Pacino, flirts with Cheky Karyo’s clean-shaven style and transformed into younger Ted Danson as his character ages. While his opening scene, where he reacts to the news of his father’s death with an expression that looks like he is waiting for the director to tell him that he can go home, now promises a holiday of bad play, in fact he makes an impression a more mediocre support actor, who was lucky in the lead role at the last minute, when the one who was originally thrown, finally read the script and threw bail. He shows desire and gives him a chance, but the grace and charisma that this role needs is simply not there. Billie Piper, similar to Billie Piper, the leading lady Noemie Godin-Vigno, does not exactly set fire to the screen, despite the fact that she occupies a central place in the role of the peasant who is the prey of the depraved and perverted intellectual Vincent Perez Le Bigo (this is really the name of the character) two-faced goat drunk lackey Sebastien Guberdo and, what is the saddest, bedridden revolutionary dirty old priest Gerard Depardieu in a lousy gray wig. This is really a pitiful sight - to see the once great actor at the very bottom of his game, when he goes through movements that look like he not only lost the desire to act, but the desire to live with him. He clearly did not bother to stay in the English dubbing sessions (or even for a couple of long shots, where he very much doubled). No wonder he talked about retirement during the short release of the film. <br /> <br /> Jason Isaacs offers a small comic relief in his standard Patriot mode, which is superimposed on a Wolf from Quebec, like asthmatic Alf Garnett / Archie. Bunker plays Timothy Dalton at speed, while William Pitt Tim Roth stands on the sidelines with an astonished smile of someone who is staying in a pretty good hotel with excellent room service and plenty of weekends, although, like Benjamin Franklin from Colm Meaney, they are both in the film less than three minutes. (Voltaire and Madame Pompadour also throw their heads at the door for a couple of minutes, but they do not make any impression, comic or otherwise.) Secondary actresses are usually better: Juliette Gosselin and Bianca Gervais are real and adoptive daughters of the heroine and Strikingly beautiful Irene Jacob, who is looking for the whole world, like young Fanny Ardant - all this is beautiful and deserves much better.
