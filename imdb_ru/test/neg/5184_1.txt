I can't remember a single good moment in this film. The story is absolutely terrible. The game is stupid, like a carrot, and the script is so bad that I want to kill myself. Well, well, if you love (and you should like to understand him) snowboarding, you could enjoy it microscopically better, since it has big mountains and some steep motions, but other than that it is terrible. He has some totally stupid ideas, and he’s racist when black and white people insult each other’s races. The only time you will laugh is when you laugh at stupidity or you are ashamed of the movie. I have seen a lot of films, and I must say that this is the worst film I have ever seen. If you have this film, I would advise you to return it to where you bought it, and to refund you.
