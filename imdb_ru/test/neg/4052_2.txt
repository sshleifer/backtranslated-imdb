My friends and I just finished watching this new Australian film. Everyone who was in the movie, agreed, what's the point in this film? There was no good story to follow, the characters were undeveloped, and the plot seemed unmotivated. I find it strange that this film, which is probably worth millions, was funded and made. It makes no difference to the theater community, it adds nothing to the palette of Australian cinema. In fact, the creation of this stupid, unemotional work was a waste of time, and in fact, you need to devote more time to work scenarios, shopping and creating good stories, rather than creating such a mess. Hugo Weaving and Rose Byrne were fine, but they were hampered by a bad script. Pira Mirandaâ€™s character was unnecessary and abstract from the plot, and her lines were, at best, average. A real waste of talent. The saving grace was the cinematography of Jeffrey Simpson, which, like most Australian films, was excellent. <br /> <br /> Come on guys, think about it next time, please. <br /> <br /> 4/10
