“This Life” is really as bad as possible. His set of hired, lustful, ruthless, double-faced, shallow characters is conceived as a reflection of the situation after the eighties, and I must admit that this is an exact creation. Unfortunately, I have nothing to sympathize with or worry about, and I regard this as one more step towards fraud with a television pay phone; amazingly poor, cheap, saturated with reality and "celebrity" television; and other unpredictable views that destroyed this environment and, indeed, most of British society. Sounds exaggerated? I don't think so. In this regard, programs like “This Life” have really had the same effect as they are often called.
