There may be spoilers ahead, but I doubt it. I have no idea how the script for this made it past the shredder. It's horrible. Totally unsightly. I stayed there for 45 minutes (about half) and just could not bear it anymore. I was a fan of Elijah Wood in the 90s (see War) and learned to enjoy Mandy Moore’s transition from sparkling to serious this year (see Chasing Freedom, which is surprisingly interesting). I saw the bits "Run, Lola, run." So I liked it with three leads, it should have been good. There was No one was in good performance. Woods Jones was flat. For a novice writer, he had almost no imagination (his cruel fantasies looked as if they had been torn from the “Christmas story”, and his lustful ones were - yes, something between a boring and anxious). From the first second Potente absolutely did not like it, and I find out that she had to be a "girl" after reading the box. Speaking of synopsis - whoever they hired for this job, the film seemed funny, unusual, romantic and quite enjoyable. Whoever this person was, he or she had to be hired to rewrite this script. Halfway through, I no longer cared for ANY characters. Lisa Moore is an aspiring actress, playful and a bit tricky (for no apparent reason), but her funny historical play (which should be fun in presentation) is on a par with the rest of the script. Supposedly, this turkey ends in a happy, romantic comedy - given the material of the characters with whom they had to work, I simply cannot imagine it. Save your money. Warn your friends. Do not watch this movie.
