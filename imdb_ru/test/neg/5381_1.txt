The director has no idea. I know ... This is an obvious comment. Maybe we should delve into the story ... the relationship ... how about the quality of the actors? <br /> <br /> History ... well, idiocy is a simple but honest answer br / <br /> Actors ... they tried very hard. Can they be blamed for choosing a director? <br /> <br /> All I can say is ... <br /> <br /> Why was this done? <br /> <br /> Well, doesnâ€™t that embarrass the Korean-American film industry? <br /> <br /> Should we be selective about who we support? <br /> <br /> Am I too harsh? See for yourself.
