We have already seen this story before: a wife with family problems (performed by Nastasya Kinski) has sex with a stranger (William Baldwin), and then wants to return to her life with her husband and girl. When she returns home, she learns that her husband has finally found a job. Everything seems bright. However, Kinski finds out that her husband’s new boss is actually a stranger who still shows interest in her and seems to be doing everything to get what he wants. What to do? Say nothing? <br /> <br /> I didn’t really like the movie. Although it was not just bad, he clearly lacked "this something." Perhaps he should focus on what was going on inside Kinski's head. You can’t say anything about the actors themselves (I think Baldwin was a good choice for being an obsessed boss), but the characters seemed somewhat stereotypical, behaving as you would see the characters playing your daily television films. Finally, the final completely spoiled what could be an interesting plot. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the film tried to look cool, it was a bit shaky camera work, in some places shots, fast shots and glamor, but in the end, I think it is much better suited for spelling. The same goes for music. Otherwise it would not look so bad. <br /> <br /> Some might like it, but this is definitely not my cup of tea. Honestly, I don’t really watch this type of thriller. This one seemed too long, even if it lasted only an hour and a half, I think it could work better than a one-hour episode on some TV shows. There was no need for some scenes, especially in the shower. <br /> <br /> My advice: try before you buy!
