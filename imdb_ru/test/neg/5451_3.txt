I wish it was The Last Dumb Thriller. But thrillers are like that. They are like children: numerous, illogical and often annoying. They so desperately want to be taken seriously, but what can be taken seriously about the behavior of the child or the plot of the thriller? Seeing this particular child - I mean ... thriller - I understand why reviewers call it the "Hitchcock Thriller"; they might as well call it “idiotic,” because it means “hitchcockian” in the movie dictionary (see if you don't believe me). Even the soundtrack is a Hollywood school of old school, which is a mistake: it does not fit the film of the late 70s and makes it fake. Besides, how dare they steal De Palma's idea of ​​stealing from Hitchcock ?! The story is absurd. Scheider's wife is murdered, and her killers are never a problem. Instead, his former employers first follow him, and then decide to kill him. Why did they decide to kill him? No explanation. Perhaps because the FBI is a dismal, dismal organization ("The X-Files"), which is very pleased that it dismissed its former employees for reasons related to pension funds. Or, perhaps because it is fashionable to want to kill Scheider in this film; everyone seems to follow him. And while the poor unsuspecting viewer is trying to unravel the mystery, logically suggesting that there is a major conspiracy, there is actually a killer ... Janet Margolin! Yes, the woman who occupies the living quarters of the Shader; the one who briefly hinted that she was "spoiled." Why does she pursue Scheider precisely at the time when his wife was killed, and he feels paranoid - and his former employers are pursuing him - and not several years earlier or several years after his wife was killed? Pure hitchhiker (look again in the dictionary, if you forgot what that means) a coincidence. What about her brilliant motive ...! Her grandmother was forced into prostitution when she was a 15-year-old virgin in New York, and then a syphilized group of agitated Jewish men, one of whom is so great! - This is Scheider's grandfather. As a result, Margolin in her spare time (among other things) played a prostitute to kill all the descendants of men who so violently syphilized her once virgin grandmother. How Hitchcokian (look) is it? The finale then shamelessly disrupts the scene from Mount Rushmore from the film North of the North-West, except for the fact that love interests are killing and she is not saved. <br /> <br /> The film also has some doubts - filter-dialogue and some not so great to play. Check out the stupid and obvious way Napier follows the Shader in the graveyard. Let's also not forget about the Napier conspiracy, which reaches for his jacket and very suspiciously holds his hand - but it was not a gun! How great! Napier in the tower: now there is another series of illogical behavioral patterns. J. Demme was, is and always will be a director without style, without instinct, and the man who directed Philadelphia. Let's give it another Oscar!
