It was not a good movie. Poorly written and acted - the concept was not new, the effect is bad and not a showcase for Arnold Voslu, who is really a half decent actor. I looked at it under some kind of protest and only remembered that I had seen it before the very end - it is so easy to forget. The game seemed to consist of many highlights and views, devoid of any sincerity. I kept expecting it to really start, and soon I was just hoping that it would end. As for the medical bits - well, I did not expect the true version of ER events, but it was just ridiculous - I was a doctor, so I know what I am talking about - and the operational bits were just stupid. <br /> <Do not waste your precious time - if you have nothing else to do - go out, call a long-lost friend, watch the paint dry, disassemble your sock, do your homework. AVOID at your own risk.
