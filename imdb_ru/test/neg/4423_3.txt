This film is a waste of time. Although there are actors in it who have the potential to do something decent, the acting in the film does not meet the requirements and has a cliche. "You never know what will happen tomorrow, so live your life to the fullest and do what makes you happy." This offer saves you from having to spend hours of your life on this film. People who like this movie are the same people who would like to sit for two hours before they find out that the whole movie is a dream. If the most important part of the film does not even happen, at least make it enjoyable and fun to watch. There is a reason why this project was not released in cinemas, and although indie films can turn out very good, this film doesnâ€™t even come close.
