I was wondering what motivated the organizers of the film festival in Victoria to include this film in their program. I guess they must have agreed with others who saw this film. I, on the other hand, consider this the worst movie I have ever seen. It starts with a bad script, a leaky dialogue, so this is hardly embarrassing. Ideas are introduced and then discarded without development. The action left me completely cold and not involved. Decorating decorations corresponded to that time, but the decoratorâ€™s nightmare. The only way heroes can love this house is if their former homes were horrible. The attic looked as if objects were thrown onto the stage without trying to create the look of a real attic that was filled with trash over the years. The photo was lead and not having diversity. Save your money for something worthwhile.
