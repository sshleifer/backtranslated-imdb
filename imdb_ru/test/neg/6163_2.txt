An American boy goes to Paris after his mother commits suicide, becomes an artist, and then finds himself and returns to the States so that he can fix it with his former friends. <br /> <br /> I have to think that people who appreciate this film are fans of the X-Files, although there are no aliens or serial killers in it. Do not be fooled, this film blows up the pieces. <br /> <br /> History is inconsistent, with almost no explanation of what people are doing and why. When you get an explanation, it does not match the story that came before it. What he does is bore you. For all the acting talent in the film, it's just not interesting. I spent the entire movie, thinking when Duchovny's sex addict is going to fuck someone. Maybe he did it behind the scenes; instead, they should remove it. <br /> <br /> What is happening is a story about how a possessed artist worries about minor incidents in his life and wants to fix them somehow, even if it does not seem to them. wrong start with. There are no particularly interesting or shocking revelations, despite the mention of a big secret in the first few minutes. Just a guy thinks his life is as interesting for you as it is for him. This is not true. <br /> <br /> I saw in trivia that the Spiritual claims that he wrote the script a week later, it is quite plausible. The guy can act, there is no doubt about it, but the writing and direction is clearly beyond the scope of his talents. <br /> <br /> Why Hollywood continues to cover these stories of self-knowledge, I can not do it. I find myself in the shower every morning, but I am not trying to make a film about it. Mine will probably be better than this; at least there would be some nudity.
