When I was 8 years old, and passing through the Marx Brothers stage, my father read in the TV Guide that they were showing the Marx Brothers film The Big Store late Friday night and put a VCR to record it for me . When I woke up on Saturday - no doubt because of a typo in the television guide - my father and I found out that “History of Humanity” was recorded instead. <br /> <br /> The Big Shop was probably one of the least funny of all the Marx Brothers films, yet it is considered one of the best cinematographic works of the century compared to The History of Humanity. I can almost justify the TV Guide mistake in which the Marx brothers — Groucho, Chico, and Harpo — appear in both films. Although in the History of Mankind they are divided into a series of unrelated scenes: Groucho plays Peter Minuita, Chico plays some guy talking to Christopher Columbus, and Harpo plays Isaac Newton ????? The scene of Harpo lasts about half an hour; Chico has only two or three lines; The scene of Groucho is at least amusing, but terribly racially insensitive by today's standards. The rest of the film is not mentioned. They pulled out some of the best actors of the day, and made them read all the garbage. What a disappointment. <br /> <br /> TV Guide, I sent you a pleasant letter, I am still waiting for an apology. <br /> <br /> For the record: “The Big Shop” has a great comedy with Marx Brothers on roller skates and a couple of Virginia O'Brien songs. I was really looking forward to seeing this.
