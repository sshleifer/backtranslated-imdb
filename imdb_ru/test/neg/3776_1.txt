After reading two other comments, I wondered if I had seen the same movie! <br /> <br /> It’s possible that life in Australia is completely different, but wow, call it fiction or fantasy, but people just don’t understand, don't behave like that. <br /> <br /> I could not refuse this review without commenting on it myself ... it improves after the first half hour, but I doubt that most can make it so far ... <br / > Yikes.
