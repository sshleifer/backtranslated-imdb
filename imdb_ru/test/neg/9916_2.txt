I hope that Matt Dorff’s original script for this was much better (there are signs of this - a dialogue that should take place long before the big f / x scenes (for character presentation), which would have made sense much earlier, slowed down later in time - the line the original script may have been for a longer time, but perhaps not — in any case, it smells. Each character is not interesting, and * each * speaks explanatory passages as if they speak the word of God, characters that are fully revealed - “Abbot - sec Dianne Wiest is terrible, explains things to her assistant (and, by the way, to us) with endless speeches that NO ONE will say to anyone, never, in real life (when she does not do that), explaining things to her assistant, which she already He knows, her assistant explains things to her that she already knows. There are characters who are completely one-dimensional - an evil guy from an energy company, a pilot who simply DOES NOT DECLARE about his personal life. life and focus on your work. A “friendly” hacker guy from a super company who can break up <br /> <br /> * everything * in Chicago (including phones), and then gives “oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-hh-” I finished my speech (but Did he leave the back door?). A crusader reporter who gives up his principles without delay? The head of the shift of the energy company, who REFUSES HIS POST during the worst crisis in Chicago after a fire - without consequences? Hospitals, abandoned by doctors and nurses during a crisis (I'm not kidding, it's in the film). <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, and this is filled with Hollywood moral cliches - as a rule, women are good, men are evil if it is not influenced by a woman (in the end, it’s punk with a weapon - without the influence of a woman, it literally disappears crazy); an evil stupid act (for example, what the reporter did to the hacker-boso) is all right, if you “mean well”. Evil people die, capitalist evil people die as badly as possible, everyone else lives (well, except Randy Quaid). And did I hear that someone said that the nuclear power plants were supposed to shut down, because there was no electricity to operate the safety systems (think about it)? <br /> <br /> There is one ray of sunshine (sorry for the expression) - Randy Quaid basically plays his character from “Independence Day” (you know - “Hi guys, I was a bit drunk!”) - this time as Storm Chaser with an infinite range of an SUV and a super-duper battery for his camcorders. However, they kill him - basically, it seems so that viewers will appreciate that tornadoes are pretty dangerous things (like small ones, this.) <br /> <br /> Give this one run.
