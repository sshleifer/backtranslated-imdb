Although this is not a classic comedy all the time, this is a good little movie that you can watch if you catch it on a rainy Saturday morning, when nothing else happens right now. <br /> <br /> Harold Lloyd plays Ezekiel Cobb, an American returning home after growing up in China, where his father was a missionary. He came home from China to find an American wife, and plans to return to China to continue his father’s work. Cobb involuntarily recruited as mayor of his corrupt hometown, when the existing political machine that runs the city realizes that he will make the perfect blow to run against the current mayor, who is also the head of the city’s underworld. They believe that the awkward, stumbling Cobb has no chance to win, so the current mayor continues to manage the city and manage his plans that make them all rich. <br /> <br /> Lloyd does not do a physical comedy here, as he did in his silent films. He portrays Cobb convincingly with understated understated dignity. It was good from all participants, and the script and the script were also pretty good. <br /> <br /> Filmed in 1934, the film has a rather racist language when it comes to Chinese people, and it also has a typical black character in this genre. era, but these stereotypes are not as evil as I have seen in other films of the time. <br /> <br /> Although this film is not Lloyd’s best film, it is entertaining and Lloyd is very good, as Cobb you won’t be amazed by this film, but this may be enough to arouse interest in Lloyd and make you want to see more of his work.
