Until now, I didn’t like all of the Gene Rollin films that I’ve seen, and it always bothered me because it is a recognized monument to Euro-junk and extremely popular with many regular reviewers on this great site; people whose opinion I always appreciate and with whom usually agree. Obviously, everyone always seems to point to some kind of dark and stylistic trademark shooting in their work, which are completely lost to me. Rollin's films are incredibly boring, they all have the same basic concept (lesbian vampires in different situations), the dialogues are incredibly absurd, the amazing Gothic environment is always undervalued, and the cost of production is cheaper than the price of a bus ticket. In fact, I was already disappointed in Rollin’s repertoire (especially after having survived Iron Rose), until I learned about The Night of Hunters. Presumably, this film does not contain any lame lesbian vampires and is a bona fide horror film with horrific murders and creepy plot twists. Is there a verdict ?? Yes and no! On the one hand, this is undoubtedly the most convincing and inventive Rollin film that I have ever had the pleasure of seeing (and also the only one that I watched without dozing off ??). On the other hand, it is still a moronic film with a meaningless plot and insensitive sexual sequences to compensate for the dullness. Jean Rollin struggles to create an atmosphere of secrecy and uncertainty, mainly due to the lack of information and vaguely represented characters, but he barely manages to hide the fact that he has no history to tell. The unearthly beautiful lead actress Brigitte Lahai and the beautifully sinister music guide are the only elements that keep you hooked. During a night trip home to Paris, the young man suddenly has to stop at the bewildered and barely dressed girl who runs out of the woods. Her name is Elizabeth, but, moreover, she can remember nothing about herself and about who or from whom she ran away. Her case of amnesia is so bad that she constantly forgets who picked her up. The next day, she was again kidnapped by an old guy and taken to a sinister apartment complex, where several people in the same strange mental state are held captive. Elizabeth knows nothing, but she feels that she needs to escape from here. Obviously, I will not reveal the denouement, but I can assure you that it is rather stupid, illogical and far-fetched. Obviously, Rollin also understood this, because the explanation is very short and quick. There are a large number of overly strange and meaningless episodes, sex shots are terrible and removed without passion, the nasty effects of makeup look cheap and randomly thrown away without a real goal. As said, the account is fascinating, and Bridget LaHay's beautiful body is addictive to the glaze.
