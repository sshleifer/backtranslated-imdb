I am sure that there is a documentary somewhere among the ruins of this festival of sheds, if the producers have enough time to find it. I do not associate with any of the characters. This is a problem for a documentary. This separation soon develops into complete hostility, bordering on hostility. Although due to a bad story, I'm not quite sure what happens to them and what the consequences of what they are trying to do. History and faces jump so fast that it is very difficult to fully understand what is happening. The third founder, who takes them for 700 thousand dollars, appeared in the film so late that Haleil and Tom are forced to retreat (fruitlessly) to explain: “Oh, this guy also created an idea” I understand who are all these tertiary characters, some kind of crazy woman who rant about getting a puppy? What's up with that? Besides, did Tom really have to give all these awkward speeches to the staff? I can only imagine the boredom that they felt when it really happened. Actually, I think I feel for them.
