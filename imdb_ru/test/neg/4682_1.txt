When I write this user comment, Tim Burton's interpretation of the fairy tale about Sweeney Todd brings a lot of money at the box office, and the film even earned a couple of Oscar nominations, if I'm not mistaken. I haven’t seen it yet, but sincerely hope that Burton didn’t look for inspiration and / or stylish trademarks in the “Voluntary Butchers” of the good old Andy Milligan. Yes, although the butchers are clearly mentioned in the title, the protagonists of the plot are the hairdresser (the notorious Sweeney Todd) and the woman baker. Together they form a vile alliance where he kills shoppers at his store, and she processes the bodies into his famous London meat pies. In other words, Andy Milligan's premise is at its most typical, derivative, delirium and amateurish. I think the IMDb rating for this film speaks for itself. Although the real story is definitely not the worst I have ever seen, the Milligan in some inexplicable way attracts sheer incompetence. Production is one gigantic mess, with an inconsistent narrative structure, a truly ugly photo, poor lighting, lousy actions and directing, ridiculous blood and tension or atmosphere. More than half of the footage is clean indents, and words cannot describe how boring a movie is, even for only 80 minutes. Ed Wood, Ted V. Michels and Bruno Mattei; do you guys need to be scared like no other than Andy Milligan ?? hands down ?? worst director ever, but I don't think he cared. Perhaps if you choose a really high level of tolerance, “Bloodthirsty Butchers” is worth a single viewing.
