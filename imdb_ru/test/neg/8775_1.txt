Whatever the producer wanted, he completely missed. The “lone ranger” is not a camp, but an “icon” for virtues all over the world. And this is a complete violation of the character’s spirit that the only true Lone Ranger, Mr. Clayton Moore, was forbidden to wear his mask in public speeches when this film was released. <br /> <br /> Dragon, a long story in short, the only saving grace of this crude (and poorly done) distortion was that this year I had the honor of meeting Mr. Clayton Moore in Columbus, Ohio, within tour, caused by bad press about the treatment of Mr. Moore, Needless to say, the nature, honesty and presence of Mr. Moore far eclipsed the film. <br /> <br /> Some things could not be done better. There is only one Lone Ranger.
