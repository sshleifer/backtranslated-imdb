The Retro Puppet Master begins in Colewidge in 1944, when puppet master Andre Toulon (Guy Rolfe) and his living puppets are planning to leave Germany, and in the puppet workshop of the Toulon Hotel he remembers his youth and the moment when he learned the secret of giving life to dead objects began back in 1902 in Paris, when his younger "I" (Greg Sestero) led Theate Magique. He describes the fateful night when he met a 3,000-year-old Egyptian sorcerer named Afzel (Jack Donner) and a possible love for the life of a young and beautiful Ilse (Brigitte Dow). He tells the story of how Afzel gave the gift of life to himself and gave life to his wooden puppets, which were part of the Theater Magique show. However, the gift of life was also a curse, since the ancient god Sutek, from whom Afzel first stole this secret, wants to return it and everyone who learned it ... <br /> <br /> Lately, I was a little fond of Puppet Master, being a big fan of the first three, I decided to watch the rest of the franchise, and so I saw Puppet Master 4 (1993), Puppet Master 5: The Final Chapter (1994), Curse of the Puppet Master (1998) and now Retro Puppet Master for a couple of weeks and it was hard for the boy to relive them all, especially this one, as this is the worst show at the moment. The Retro Puppet Master feels like a cross between the Puppet Master III: Revenge of Toulon (1991) with his period setting and the Puppet Master 4 and the Puppet Master 5: The last chapter in which Sutek tries to kill everyone who is connected to his stolen, secret-giving life. There is also no special continuity, again, there is not a single green serum shown in earlier films, and despite the fact that Andre Toulon committed suicide in 1939 at the start of the original Puppet Master (1989), he was seen alive and healthy in 1944. Most of the story is told as a memory and concentrates on Andrei Toulon himself, and not on puppets, the film tells about his relationship with Ilse and how he learns the secret of life, and all this is rather boring and tedious, to be honest. Even after more than 80 minutes, Retro Puppet Master feels long and soft, without a real pace and without a central concept, as the plot never calms down and, as a rule, jumps a lot. Then, of course, there is an incomprehensible decision to completely change the design of the puppets, which I find incredible, I mean, why did the creators take one main thing that made Puppet Master films so memorable and completely finished with that? Puppets are briefly visible at the beginning and at the end, but otherwise we get these dirty-looking wooden caricatures that are not nearly as steep as their modern alteration. It is never even explained why these puppets were used, and not those that all Puppet Master fans loved, although there is a suspicion that Full Moon is hoping to make another sequel dedicated to this very issue. <br /> <br /> If a bad story and the complete absence of our favorite puppets were not bad enough. Full Moon decided to go with a PG-13 rating to make Retro Puppet Master the only Puppet Master movie that did not receive an “R” rating in the US (obviously, in other countries they have their own movie ratings) and therefore there is not a drop in the whole movie blood, puppets do not kill anyone, there is no curse and naked people. This is more subduing than tamed children. Apart from the fact that the puppets themselves are rubbish, special effects are also the best of the series, there is no animation of motion stopping, no computer effects CGI (of course, in 1999 was CGI cheap enough?) And all the effects were harsh puppet effects. I mean, when you see a puppet "walk", the camera is always above its expectation, so its legs do not need to be shown, and, obviously, some production assistant simply pushes her forward, it is as difficult and modern as special effects are obtained. <br /> <br /> The only positive point is that Retro Puppet Master has the fact that it looks quite beautiful, the design of the production period, the costumes and props are really impressive, and this is a pretty beautiful film to watch from time to time. Apparently filmed in Bucharest in Romania, which doubles quite well at the turn of the last century in Paris. Acting here is terrible and perhaps the worst of the series. <br /> <br /> Retro Puppet Master is more or less the final Puppet Master movie, since the next Puppet Master: The Legacy (2004) basically shots footage from the previous seven films is a pretty stupid way to complete a series that started like this well with three distinct and distinctive little killer puppets. Don't worry about it, just watch one of the first three again and just remember the good times ... Puppet puppets will return in the horrible movie "Master of the Dolls" against "Demonic Toys" (2004).
