Apparently it was the award winner. Apparently, someone had a pistol against his / her head, and he was forced to appoint corn: the film. <br /> <br /> Or it must have been a mistake. <br /> <br /> This is the most unsightly film ever made. Showing and editing is the biggest horror of this movie. Two little girls get lost in a cornfield and are stalked by someone who hears laughter under his rubber mask. Little girls face their hero father and then run away from him, W.T.F. The daddy in the film continues to lose their tracks for several minutes, watching it. <br /> <br /> The girls were obviously not trained actors and had no common sense for them. They were so annoying and so infantile in the film that itâ€™s not even comedic. Hearing them scream again and again, like a broken record, was the reason I got up and left. You can't even listen to this movie without almost convulsing. <br /> <br /> I can get a better winner than this trash.
