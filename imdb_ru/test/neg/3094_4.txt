“Mad Six” by director Albert Pune in his uniquely terrible, but strangely hypnotic style is another jewel in the crown of this decade's high-profile Hugo Haas (Jess Franco?). The “stylish” redirection, inconsistent plots, timeouts in the middle of the Eurodisco torch performance sequence - all this seems to show features for our man Pyun. The most interesting thing is how he always gets top-notch movies in b-films compared to Vinorsky or some other directors. Ice-T, Rob Lowe, Mario Van Peebles and very weird Bert Reynolds are not a bad cast, although they often look a little embarrassed. Check out Postmortem, Mean Guns and Omega Doom for more top-notch Pyun chaos!
