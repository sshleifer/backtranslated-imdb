1995 Wes Craven Presents, starring Joe Clayton and Lance Henriksen. A group of scientists saves a dying person whom they find at their government outpost in the desert by injecting him with their experimental virus, of course, one of their colleagues goes overboard, and the virus turns the person into an almost unstoppable monster in which they are trapped inside. Lance Henriksen plays a morally offended researcher who, before all this, leaves the project, but returns after receiving a call for help to save a person (a mutation of a death machine that cannot be stopped). <br /> <br /> Deciding to merge two trips into one, he brings his family along with him (after that they go on vacation) and continues to give them access to a top-secret government facility, thereby placing them right in the center of chaos inside. In case you can't tell, it relies on the viewer to work a little with him and put aside some minor (see: basic and explicit) details. <br /> <br /> In general: you can watch with a soft little pleasure. Note: Outpost is widely known as "Mind Ripper"
