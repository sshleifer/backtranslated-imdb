A female ex-cop who was knocked out because of recklessness (and who probably could have defeated Chuck Norris in battle) hires herself as a personal bodyguard; her first client is a useless playboy. First, she needs half the film to be confused. There are many excellent combat choreography, but the plot is strictly by numbers, and the game is as wooden as dialogue. Give it a miss.
