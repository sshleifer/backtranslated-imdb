I was surprised to find that Michael Moore or Bill Maher were not associated with this “film.” The American left is the list of erasable axes, with the apparent rarity of the Democrats in hell. Mao Zedong and Karl Marx did not appear in hell, but is Ronald Reagan in the same room with Hitler? We may have to wait until these Californian PR people kill Paradiso to show all their favorite political leaders and ideologues. <br /> <br /> Cheap pictures of religion, right-wing politicians, corporations and their lobbyists Fox News, even SUVs. All radical leftist conversations were too fully covered - while clearly omitting references to offenses from the “other side of the aisle” - so that was not a conscious effort. The only exception I noticed for an hour and a half is that JFK should have sex with Marilyn Monroe for eternity: including a token in these propaganda works in a pathetic attempt to appear non-partisan.
