If it were not for the fun role of Christopher Guest, I would stop watching this movie after 20 minutes. The jokes were flat, the film was intermittent and slow, some characters were disgusting and painful to watch, but the Guest character made me laugh, so I stayed with that. <br /> <br /> I feel that there are much better options out there!
