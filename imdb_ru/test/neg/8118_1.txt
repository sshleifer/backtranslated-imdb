If there is no huge ironic conspiracy, my jaw dropped when I read positive reviews about this film; I can not believe that this film was even released, it is so bad. <br /> <br /> I admit that this is not my kind of film, but I still tried to watch it objectively, you know, so bad it was funny, and was still offended by its terrible horror. <br /> <br /> Acting is terrible, they could not watch the impulses, and I guess there was one take on the stage, it really is so terrible. This is the worst film that I have seen in many years, in fact, I would not even call it a film, it is a tragedy. A black, black friend whom no one actually calls “gay”, is this simply implied because he is so crazy? Homophobia This is not good, in fact, it just causes vomiting. The jokes die on their wretched asses, the music is so bad that it doesn't give in to faith. The man who composed the soundtrack, in fact, chose the most terrible, mutilated ears songs that they have ever heard, and put them in an empty film production. Oh, my good Christ, I can't believe that the 80s produced complete trash like this, I grew up through them, and I can't find one thing to notice here, it must have been a dark time to be a movie goer . /> <br /> If you even think about watching this film, go to an appointment with a psychiatrist, then it will hit you, the sick, the sick person, accordingly.
