It was not like a movie, and, fortunately, it was short (less than 90 minutes), it was more like computer graphics commercials: most special effects are great to be sure. But this, of course, is not the best or even a good film. Not to mention the fact that viewing is absolutely useless, because you can see what opportunities there are in CGI or GCI, or whatever they are called. <br /> <br /> As I read somewhere, â€œYou can't fix it in the cutting process. room, bad story and not directors, can't be fixed in the cutting room or even with the most magnificent special effects! Things can be improved in the cutting room if they have a real director and stuff to work with. <br /> <br /> However, they thought it could be sold in the USA, this is an idea for anyone, since the USA is a fraud. <Br /> <br /> And isn't it typical for low-budget stories, should they create a creative country south of Mexico ?? <br /> <br /> Well, I am ready to do it 2! Only because of the special effects, the rest is absolute rubbish!
