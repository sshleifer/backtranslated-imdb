So it's not even funny. Zombie infection spans a small college campus, and a government group of secret operatives supports several scientists sent to determine the origin of the outbreak. Collect zombie DNA, damn it, not easy. After the bite you are one of "them." The whole university was completely infected with immortal life. <br /> <br /> This sequel does not even buy back the awful original HOUSE OF THE DEAD (2003). Senseless entertainment is achieved though. A few glimpses of female nudity, complementing the blood stream and exploding heads, should please any zombie freak. Recruited actors: Emmanuel Vaugier, Victoria Pratt, Ed Quinn, Sid Haig and Nadine Velasquez. The word "F" combines an unimaginable scenario.
