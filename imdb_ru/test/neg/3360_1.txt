Jack Frost returns with an army of foam plastic balls that can only be ripped off by a shot in a super stretcher with margaritas. How's that for the plot? The film is based on such a ridiculous premise that it barely raises an eyebrow when the characters are killed by barbecue tongs and pierced by carrots. You might even say that the whole movie is skating on thin ice (b-boom-tish). <br /> <br /> Admittedly, there are some fantastic lines, including a note about the Killing Coconut Shark. <br /> <br /> Fair enough hard times, but this does not justify the desire of the actors to take part in such a complete hype. <br /> <br /> For those fans who are looking to see Jack Frost, be prepared to take it just a phallic carrot, crawling along the beach with trite offscreen comments.
