I would like to sit down and write an intelligent, well thought out review, however, I feel that I will spend more time on the writing process than directors. I live in Los Angeles, and Iâ€™m sorry to say that the characters seemed SO much like under-employed and overly selfish actors. There was not a single moment in the film when I could have avoided the feeling that I was watching the senseless conversation of unemployed actors in the hipster coffee shop in Los Angeles. One of the worst "indie" films I've ever shown, with so few recommendations, that hearing about how he won at Sundance effectively eliminated any of my previous interest that I might have had in participation I no longer believe that the Sundance's positivity review makes sense. Take a look at your own risk.
