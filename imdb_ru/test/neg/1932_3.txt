This film has more than a sumo wrestler, and the result for the viewer is an upset stomach. There are some good speeches, but plots are extraneous and largely unresolved. <br /> <br /> In addition, I found that all the characters are unlikely, and if you cannot identify yourself with at least one character, there is not much to be agitated. In general, this is a classic example of trying to do too much with too little.
