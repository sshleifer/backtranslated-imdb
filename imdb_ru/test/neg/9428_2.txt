This film smells production line scheduling. Looks like the filmmakers watched the latest hits and threw spaghetti at the screen - Jimmy Stewart! Jun Allison! Anthony Mann! Baseball! War! Kid! Aircraft! - scram! - The film is dedicated to the age of performers Stuart and Ellison; although I'm sure we still have to think that they are much younger. <br /> <br /> In Strategic Air Command there are messages that I find strangely shocking and offensive, but I will stay with one really pitiful Element: a happy couple is challenged when without consulting with his wife. In the most dramatic scene of the film, she calls him to it. It ends up completely unresolved - Allison cries with her heart on their bed, and Stewart goes to her. No discussion; he simply says that he is right, and goes to his devastated wife. As far as he knows, she could cut her wrists. <br /> <br /> Later, Allison apologizes for questioning her husbandâ€™s decision. <br /> <br /> Incredible! <br /> <br /> Stick to Stuart-Ellison in Stratton Story (1949). <br /> <br /> ** Strategic Air Command (3/25/55) Anthony Mann ~ James Stewart, June Allison, Frank Lovejoy
