“The death of a performer at a performance on Broadway unites theatrical critic and police detective as an unlikely duet that uncovers crimes. The dead performer's niece becomes not only an object of affection for our critic, but also the main suspect in this is death and some other murders that occur in the theater. "The Phantom Killer" aims at the young woman as his next victim, so our heroes are chasing time to catch the killer, "the DVD says a brief overview of the sleeve. <br /> <br /> Milton Ryson’s script sparkles a bit in this low-budget mysterious detective story. It is useful that Dave O'Brien (as Anthony "Tony" Woolrich) succeeds in the title role; his skills as an actor seem to be much more than productions using him. O'Brien and Taxi Assistant Frank Jenks (like Egbert "Romeo" Egglhoffer) would have been a great detective team in the 1950s. The leading lady Kay Aldridge (like Claudia Moore) and the supporting line-up are also good. Unfortunately, the story becomes winding and anti-climatic. <br /> <br /> **** The Ghost of 42nd Street (5/2/45) Albert Herman ~ Dave O'Brien, Kay Aldridge, Frank Jenks
