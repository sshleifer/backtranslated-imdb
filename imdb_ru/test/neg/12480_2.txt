Lucio Fulci was known for his Italian splash films, mainly for his films about the undead, such as Zombies or Beyond. Here he shot a black comedy, but there is only one problem: she is sick. I say this, knowing that I like the City of the Walking Dead (which is also rude, but not so). A compulsive player receives money for his habit, interrupting ugly and ugly rich women, then killing them and stealing their money. The film makes this plan so simple. I guess women were too ugly to go to the bank, so they always had their money on a man. After the eighteenth murder, I began to suspect that I had always heard of Fulci: he hated women. He must have. In any case, this film stinks, it's not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with hyallo and supernatural zombie films. Avoid this movie at all costs.
