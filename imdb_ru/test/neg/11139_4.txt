Judging by the images of Andy Warhol in the films “I shot Andy Warhol and Basquiat,” I can predict that Andy Warhol can make such a film - aerial, illogical, snobbish, amoral. The plot of the film (almost non-existent), which is sometimes incredibly incredible, is compensated by coarse, really-looking cinematography. The film has a way to be unreal, but dictate reality to the viewer. The only worthy part of the film is the development of the relationship between Joe and Holly, and everything in it should be considered as a device for characterization. There are a few funny scenes that I admit are funny, but Trash is just a study of the restless people’s characters who are a little pleasant if you don’t mind watching nude and i.v. drug use.
