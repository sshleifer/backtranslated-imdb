Nightscream is a television film, so it will certainly be terrible, especially considering that this is a supposed horror film. This young girl pursues dreams when she arrives in a small town where a woman was killed a year ago. She is amazed when everyone in the city thinks she looks like a dead girl. The townspeople are surprised when she continues to dream of trance, where she reveals the exact details of the murder and the murderer, because the police obviously misunderstood. Thinking that they are in danger of being discovered, the killers (two of them) begin to carry out a plan to get rid of her before she gets to the real truth. By this time, you are likely to fall asleep, and why the filmmakers have a car of "creating fog" at full throttle in dreams.
