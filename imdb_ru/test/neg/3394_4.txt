A friend invited me to watch it in cinemas. <br /> <br /> Half an hour later we went out and entered the next multiplex (yes, we broke the rules) in order to have time to start “Against”. All the odds. <br /> <br /> I remember too many monkeys dancing around and saying, “Y, y, y”. Very little about the characters or the introduction to the story captured one of us or even remembered. It went so far as to become painfully boring (and believe me, any excuse was good enough to spend time with this particular friend). <br /> <br /> The production performance was excellent, good photography and lighting, but it was a great studio release, and we came to see a movie, not an art gallery. It seemed that Ralph Richardson and Andy McDowell would be wasted in such a poorly written film. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if you make the second hour, there is something worth seeing. I don't have much patience with my time. 4 out of 10
