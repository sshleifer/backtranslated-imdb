This film was released in all major Australian cinemas. I watched the movie on the weekend of August 7th, and I thought it was absolute nonsense (and I use this word extremely literally). How it got into every major cinema, I have no idea. The plot seemed simple enough that the world is divided into subclasses, and people need identity cards, and actor Tim Robbins plays an investigator who goes to Shanghai to investigate how an employee steals identity cards, and this turns out to be actress Samantha Morton. > <br /> You think that from this summary the rest of the story should be intertwined, but it does not only confuse the audience with another storyline that is not relevant. <br /> <br /> If you think about Watching this movie, I will save you from trouble. DON'T GET THIS MOVIE.
