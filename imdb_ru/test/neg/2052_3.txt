What on earth? How to watch the “Neighbors” episode after drinking two bottles of cough medicine - a nightmare and having no meaning. I was waiting for the smart part, where everything fell into place and saved the film. Maybe it was there, and I just missed it, or was lost to me. <br /> <br /> I most strongly suspect that this is a slightly veiled attempt to sell a new drug that is about to appear on the streets. I wouldn’t say “don’t watch this,” but I’ll say that it’s pretty bad at every level - like I am in high definition. Whack. Unless you drink two cough bottles. Then it's just dandy.
