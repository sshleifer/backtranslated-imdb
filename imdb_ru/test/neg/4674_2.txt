I saw this movie last night. <br /> <br /> And I’m worried that I’m turning into one of those left-wing liberals whom they rightly laugh at in South Park. Because I found it very offensive. Am I ridiculously sensitive? First, there is an old foundation: America is the only country in the world that is physically capable of anything, ever. <br /> <br /> Secondly, and frighteningly, an early meteorite strike struck some (unnamed why do they need a name?) Asian country. The reaction to this is to look at it as a warning. As in "My God, imagine the tragedy that * can * happen." Because, you know, it happened to Asians. It can happen to white Americans, and * it * will be tragic. <br /> <br /> Then, in Paris, a stronger meteorite will appear. Our actors on earth are annoyed because it may mean that our boys have less time than they thought. Not much upset in America. Not to mention the fact that many people died. <br /> <br /> Then there is Michael Clark Duncan. Wonderful actor, wasted. Never before has a black man been so familiar. Among the team of hardcore drillers, his job seems to be to stand back, sometimes saying, “Hey, you, yes, dude.” Indeed. Why did they even bring him? Not that he was miniature - he weighed this shuttle for nothing! He never lifts the instrument, does not control the spacecraft, and does not even help repair the explosive device. <br /> <br /> Even if you ignore the Russian cosmonaut (Peter Stormare, another great actor who was wasted on a meaningless role), he seems to be drunk most of the time and hit the wrenches instead of fixing them, because “Dat is what we do in Russia,” that's pretty awful. <br /> <br /> All this, of course, is sealed by the site of the blonde, blue-eyed American children are all celebrating on the corn fields for salvation and everything is in order. Because all death and destruction for the rest of the world does not matter. <br /> <br /> You expect a bad script, a tricky game, an implausible plot (fat middle-aged men who study for 12 days will be astronauts "Including who seems to be retarded"). But I could not believe that the racism and xenophobia inherent in the film, and the ruthless neglect of the lives of people who are not Americans with corn. <br /> <br /> This is a scary accusation regarding the position of a part of the West. Society for the world. <br /> <br /> And this is also a shitty movie.
