Do not be fooled. This is NOT a zombie movie. Take it from a guy who loves movies about zombies, and who shoots them all: good and terrible. Yes, this film has an extended sequence of zombies, but this is basically an artsy exercise in existentialist fear, which is a long way to say that it is boring. If you worked a lot all day and want to spend a couple of hours on entertainment, rent something else. <br /> <br /> “Rise of the Undead” has cheap special effects, mediocre play and obscene dialogue. All this is understandable in an independent low-budget film, and I can forgive such flaws if the film has an interesting story. Unfortunately, the “Rise of the Undead” hardly has any history. Moreover, the acting is not so much ludicrous as it is completely absent. It seems that all the actors attended the Buster Keaton School of Wooden Faces. Would it kill them to show some emotions? (And no, shouting is not equal to emotions). One character who really had some pizaz was killed first. Of course, there was another character who briefly interested me. He looked and behaved like Kyle MacLachlan, who gave Norman Bates, but it was too little, too late. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers seem to have forgotten a tiny detail: the film is a VISIBLE remedy. This means that your scenes are lit well enough so that the viewer can actually see what is happening. And all those tricky jumps and close-ups at the time might have seemed cool, but all they did was make it terrible and strange to watch the movie. There is nothing wrong with telling a story in a simple and clear way - just look at George Romero's low-budget Night of the Living Dead to see how great it is. And I know that these people had a small budget, but if you can't hire the equipment and technicians needed to actually make the dialogue audible, then just make a silent movie (then these wooden faces of Buster Keaton can really work). <br /> <br /> I will say this for the film: the zombies were creepy. Unlike most zombie films, where the undead is shown in all its decaying beauty, the rougher the better, the zombies here are just shuffling people with bloody faces. It actually worked to make them look more like us, and therefore more terrible. That's why I gave this movie 2 stars instead of one. <br /> <br /> The sad part of all of this is that, despite all its flaws, “Rise of the Undead” does not offend your mind. The filmmakers seemed to really want to make a smart, scary, original film, and it is a shame that they failed so badly. If they could just give up too unusual editing, buy some extra light bulbs, start a dialogue and come up with a real story that really goes somewhere, then I think they have the talent to do something really good. <Br /> <br /> Believe me: do not waste your time on the “Rise of the Undead”.
