Ok, where do I start? I can't even imagine to understand this last but one sorry excuse for the show. Imagine: a boarding school, where children, whose parents roll on money, simply throw them there to make a world tour themselves. It could not be more diabolical than that. <br /> <br /> If you taught these children, don't even raise them to the term “teenagers”, because they hardly behave like sensible homosapiens, were selfish, think again, About 23 minutes were suffocated by their so-called problems, problems with boys and the like. <br /> <br /> The heroine of the series, of course, Mademoiselle Zoe, played by the British Polly Pocket little Miss. I’m still This sister, Jamie Lynn Spears, obviously learned a lot in acting. However, I will give her a little face, because her superficial, one-dimensional character does not give much room for depth. She plays the sun, the moon and the stars of the Pacific Academy, fighting for the fate of all women, for the equality of all sexes. <br /> <br /> Ideal in all respects, always with her two faithful friends, Nicole, Daffy Bimbo, who obviously has too much money from her dad, and cool chick Dana, who proves that she is hard to crack. Both left the show in seasons 2 and 1, respectively, but I'm not guilty. But the horror of horror comes Lola, who considers herself the greatest actress since the days of Natalie Wood, with green feathers in her hair and fake tan. She is even more rude than Zoe herself, if it is at all possible, and even dumber than Nicole, and, damn it, we know that this is impossible. <br /> <br /> This show, as well as all the excuses for TV programs that Nickelodeon has been releasing since the 2000s, are the main victim of stereotypes. Get the girl next door and close to her best friend's feelings for her Zoe, a great, albeit indistinct, sometimes best guy, Chase, a cool, arrogant ladies man, Logan, a crazy girl in clothes and clothes that are not very bright, Nicole is whom everyone considers strange, simply because she is very clever, a cretin, Quinn, overly dramatic, annoying, but very thin, perfect model with a picture of a Malibu, Lola, and a tough, but soft inside woman, Dana. Where have I heard these characters before? Sorry, but what's wrong with having a personality? Just because Quinn is passionate about science, and really cares about her future and succeeds in the academic aspect, which everyone else should take care of, is she “weird” and “nerd”? Lola at the beginning of the series, who showed herself as a potential great character with her daring ways and other views on life, Zoe just had to go, pull the pitchfork, burn her on the fire, she returns to Strange City and all this jazz is so much for women's rights. Unfortunately, Lola simply became nothing more than another OC clone, in all its anorexic glory. Probably not to overshadow her mistress. <br /> <br /> But hey, the 2000 MySpace whores seem to love this with a typical fairy tale novel by Chase / Zoe, the tension between the adamant, “hot” Logan and the “awesome” Zoe or Dan, as you like, and pretty people. Please, this show exists to remind us that people do not like realism, they prefer a pretentious, shallow and meaningless way of life. Sorry to share with you, dear ones, this will not happen if you do not have a large trust fund and parents who could soften you.
