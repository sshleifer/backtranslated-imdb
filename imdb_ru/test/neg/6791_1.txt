Walker Texas Ranger is one of the worst shows created in the last 10 years. The script for James “Jimmy” Trivette, Walker's sidekick, is about the same pathetically written as Wesley Crusher in Star Trek, and in it is played the same number of convictions. <br /> <br /> In this show, people don't respond the way people react to things in real life — everyone is polarized — everyone is either completely good or completely bad guys (unless Walker himself talks to them for 2 minutes, and then they instantly change). It is not like life, it is not like people. This show does not occur in this reality. <br /> <br /> Plots are about as realistic as “The Murder She Wrote,” a show where an arrogant old woman can just go to people's houses, not get angry, and she can demand that the police do what she wants and they leaned back for her. With Walker, everyone on the show, including the “bad guys,” behaves as if he were a hero from which myths and fairy tales are made, and time itself is subject to its whims. The lines that sometimes come from the mouths of people on this show are ridiculous. As if the screenwriter for Wesley Crusher (for “serious” parts) and the screenwriter for the funniest home videos of Bob Saghet (for “humorous” parts) got together and wrote all the scripts for this show. <Br /> <br /> This is a show for people who think that good always triumphs over evil. This is for older people. This is for willing thinkers. This is for people who want to always have a happy ending. This is for people who want to plunge into oblivion. This is for people whose favorite drug is their television. <br /> <br /> I cringe every time I see an advertisement for this show. My opinion is that this is the worst show on television over the past 10 years. <br /> <br /> I used to like Chuck Norris, but this show forever stained him in my memory. I can't even watch his old movies without thinking about this show.
