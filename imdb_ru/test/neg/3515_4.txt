I recently watched this movie on Sundance, and it has interested me from the very beginning. Nevertheless, it seems that it will take forever, and I felt deceived. In short, Noble Willingham (from Walker, famous for the Texas Ranger) plays a boat merchant who is being harassed by telephone from a man who claims he is his son. According to the mysterious caller, Willingham has a dark, dirty little secret that affects his son, and he (son) gladly reminds him of this. I will not spoil anything to anyone, but three things did not allow me to love this film very much. First, the film has more obscene language than Gudfell, Scarfayd, Casino, and Glengarry of Glen Ross combined. 99% of it erupts from Willingham himself. It did not take long to bore me with constant four-letter words. Secondly, I just could not believe that someone would answer the phone many times, especially when someone knows that the caller is on the other end of the line. No matter where Willingham is in the film, whether at work, at home, in a snack bar, etc., the phone rings and he always answers it, spewing poison to his son and then hanging up ONLY to answer him again when the caller calls for TEN SECONDS! How many of us do that? Now I understand that we probably don’t have a film if it doesn’t keep answering, but I just couldn’t suspend mistrust on this particular issue. Three, and this is the most insignificant criticism, why is the director so opposed to showing us the “Corndog Man” (for example, the caller / son)? Most of the time, it just sounds like a burning voice on the other end of the phone. I could live with that if other things fell into place, but since they did not, that was just another question. I pay tribute to the film for the fact that it was a somewhat original idea and for keeping me in suspense from the very beginning, but that’s all. See it at least once. However, if you are like me, you will say “Triple K Marine!” In a dream for a night or two after you finish watching it.
