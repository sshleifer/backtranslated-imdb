Have you seen all the great adventures of the past few decades? If you were not worried about this, since you have already seen most of the scenes already - and I can guarantee that these scenes were originally in much better films. <br /> <br /> History (I’m sure that true storytellers will never forgive me) is childish and stupid cliché and ... well, it's just cliché. And yes, again, all you need to be a hero is to be an American. <br /> <br /> At least in Finland they advertised it as the film for which the DVD was created. Maybe I should sell my player then ... <br /> <br /> 1/10
