I think that there is so little content in this film that you shouldn’t even discuss it. <br /> <br /> First, the package is really disgusting. Especially stereotypical shooting and photographing. Of course, Joe Dante's cinematic style was relevant and interesting in Gremlins and Little Soldiers, I mean a pretty figurative and visual story telling about Spielberg the Wunderkind (I really loved these films), but in Coming Home, this there was a complete failure. The attacks of toy soldiers and hairy creatures are simply not comparable to the invasions of zombies (dead, smelly, rotten creatures trying to kill the living — for no logical reason, simply because they hate them). <br /> <br /> Films about zombies are characteristic of simple, direct, unconventional and brutal cinematography. Nothing is visible in the debut of Joe Dante. Another point is annoying content: really stupid dialogues between the two main characters, the terrible exploitation of “the older brother dies and leaves the injured younger” and bad behavior. And, by the way, “Returning Home” is neither scary nor bloody - and even less interesting. You see, it's not even a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Zombie films for the decade of their birth - the late 60s / early 70s - were revolutionary, provocative (especially because of their terrible Spontaneous content) and subtle social criticism. The ORIGINAL zombie film was actually a midnight film called Night of the Living Dead (1968). It was a low-budget film that covered so many controversial topics that it’s hard to call them all: the Hitchcock / Raimi visual style, the 70s American lifestyle, political alienation, the upcoming breakthrough in the human rights of black people and even more racism resulting from conservative Americans (remember the shooting of the black main character at the end of the film). <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the work of midnight films and want to learn more about the most important of them, I recommend you “Midnight films: from margin to mainstream”. <br /> <br /> So stay away from "Returning Home" and even from "Land of Romero" Dead.
