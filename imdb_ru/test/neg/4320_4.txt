This movie can be watched but nothing special. Four girls on a car trip to Vegas foolishly decide to pick up a hitchhiker (because he is cute). They all end up staying overnight in a motel in the wilderness, and the hitchhiker's psychotic problems with women become apparent. <br /> <br /> Characters - cliché - there is a married, responsible woman; slutty party girl; uncertain future bride; and the hater who just left. The hitchhiker is really good until he goes crazy. <br /> <br /> There is not enough blood and too many rapes. I really like the slasher-horror / thriller, and this one did nothing for me. The ending was as lame as the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the actors did a great job with which they had to work. The dialogue is not terrible, and in general I was impressed by the actors, I had never seen or heard of them before. And the plot was not beyond the limits of possibility (although I really doubt that any woman on this day and age will choose a hitchhiker - no matter how attractive he is), so I didn’t moan that things didn’t make sense. <br /> <br /> Overall, “Hitchhiker” was well-functioning and made sense, but was not very interesting. There are a lot of the best films of the same genre that I would recommend over it (“Rest Stop”, “Devil Failures”, “Texas Chainsaw Massacre”, even the Hitcher remake). Do yourself a favor and skip it if you have no other options.
