As a fan of Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, and Lon Cheney, Jr., I had to see it. What is good about it, the only thing that is good about it is the clips of Lugosi, Karlof and Cheney Jr. with all the vintage clips that are not glued together with new black and white frames. Even close to Steve Martins, the dead do not wear rugs, it was well done. With all the technology that we have now, why it was not done better? If you plan to fork out 5 bucks and some changes, keep in mind that this is really bad. but if you like Lugoshi Karloff and Cheney Jr., then watch their films instead. Even Ed Wood did better than this. The new actor Mark Redfield is pretty good as an imitation of Bela Lugosi. Clips used by them; Monkey, Mr. Wong, the most dangerous game, the lost world, the indestructible man. and the devilish bat. This is the notorious classic of Bela Lugosi. I believe that this production was a very low budget, and it shows 1 out of 10.
