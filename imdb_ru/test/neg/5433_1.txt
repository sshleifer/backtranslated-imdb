If you cope with this without laughing out loud on the screen, you are a better film fan than me. <br /> <br /> Consider logical failures, leaps of common sense, and self-confidence ... more than two hands! <br /> <br /> PS: If another film uses a place, clearly UCLA, and claims that this is another university (in the case of this film: Berkeley), I will lose it.
