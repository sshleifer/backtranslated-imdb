... because this is another dead one. Lifeless dubbing, first-class animation, contrived and not funny songs (although the beat sung by the Devil would be worthy of Tim Curry), and a weaker plot than Land Before Time 99: Fossils On Parade. <br /> <br /> I must admit, I have not seen the first film. I'm not a big fan of films with paradise or dogs, especially not in combination. Nevertheless, I hope to see the first one in the near future, because there should have been a reason why someone would create such a horrible sequel. <br /> <br /> If I didn’t get this movie for free, I wouldn’t do that at all. For a “heavenly click,” the only good thing about this was the devil. 2/10.
