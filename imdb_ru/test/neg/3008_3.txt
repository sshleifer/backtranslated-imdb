There is nothing in the film that I hate more than pretentiousness, and this is one of the most pretentious films ever made. This self-awareness is obvious in every frame: “Look at what a deep, complex film we make,” the director and writers seem to tell us, and they themselves say: “Let's see how we can tire and confuse the audience even more. “I would prefer to watch Ed Wood’s film or Edgar Ulmer’s worst film than anything like that. At least they gave us honest trash, and at least their films were brutally interesting in their own way. This film is about as interesting as a root canal without anesthesia, and therefore tantamount to torture. Have these screenwriters ever heard the word “history"? It’s not like that. They have a concept, they can create an atmosphere, and they managed to put together a great cast and get good results from them. And for what? Did we have an hour and 45 minutes? Nothing really happens in this film. The only exciting part that lasts only about two minutes happens when one of those who will soon be evicted starts shooting at the civil servants who come to tell him that he should leave. But nothing happens. It is a pity that he did not continue to shoot until he got to the writers. The only distinguishing features of this film are the actors and beautifully photographed landscapes near the end. 3/10
