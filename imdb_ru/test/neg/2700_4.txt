The Amnesian women, who take off their clothes by a drop of a hat (or blouses?), Are the only outstanding moments in the film that are otherwise slow and aimless. Although the basic premise of the story offers many possibilities, they never develop to any satisfactory degree, and the exposure almost does not exist. Most of the film is just a journey through the corridors of a high-rise clinic / hospital. The overall effect is bleak and sterile, like THX-1138.
