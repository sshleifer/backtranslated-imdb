With the cheap pound store open, I thought it was worth seeing if there were cheap DVDs that looked good. And while the back cover made this sound like a movie like Jeepers Creepers, it’s actually an anthology of the movie! and thought that one or two stories feel very familiar. This is still a funny light horror / comedy. Plots: <br /> <br /> Story One: a classic. <br /> <br /> A young couple feels that the time has come to try to prove their financial life by raising a car for $ 1,500. But when a guy drives a car, a car starts talking to him. A car (called Bunns) says that in order to get everything he ever wanted in life, he must buy Baans for $ 5000. So, as long as the guys relationships are crumbling, Ba'anse is doing everything possible to show who is really responsible. <br /> <br /> History Two: Kitchen Culture. <br /> <br /> A guy his master can kick out, because of how dirty his apartment is, is finding that because of storing tuna paste in his fridge for six months, it has now turned and turned into green moldy version of yourself! Because of the large amount of attacks, the final battle takes place to see if the real guy or his clone of the refrigerator will survive. <br /> <br /> Third story: too good to be true. <br /> <br /> A girl signs a contract with a dating agency. This guy is perfect for her. But she is not sure that the guy is too perfect, and when she thinks she sees him "off", she starts to get scared. A look at the film: <br /> <br /> The first thing I have to mention is the film rating in England, where he was given an eighteen-year rating, even though there is no nudity, curse or blood in it. everything. And one more strange thing in all the stories is that they all have happy endings where dainties win !. And although the first story is too close to the classic of Stephen King, Christine, the second story easily becomes the highlight of the film. with director Tom Parkinson, who makes a crazy story like a low-budget episode of Muppets! <br /> <br /> The final look at the film <br /> <br /> Although it has something like a “remake; I feel their recklessness is enough to turn this horrible comedy into horror.
