How are people still stupid enough nowadays to think that other stupid things are smart? Maybe stupid people like to watch things that make them feel smart. For example, "War of the House." “Because it is even more stupid than the stupid people who watch it. There are no jokes, only half jokes and light jokes that barely guarantee a tiny inner smile. The action is your typical, awkward, idiotic, standard type of sitcom sitcom. And why did this shit replace arrested development? Well, you have to hand this to Fox. They know that they need stupid shows to attract all the stupid viewers. You see, the reason Arrested Development was not widely popular was because she was so smart. It was so clever that it made stupid people feel bad because they were so stupid. And, of course, if a stupid person meets an intelligent person, he will hate an intelligent person. Anyway, most of the time. Either that, or try to dissuade an intelligent person. If you like this show and you are one of the stupid people, I really can't understand what it is like not to have open eyes and open minds. I cannot understand what it is like to be a brainless laughing drone influenced by every little thing. In fact, people who laugh with a track of laughter are parrots. Trained, obedient, mindless parrots. Maybe I should not insult the parrots by comparing them with you. You know who you are. (If I look like a bastar * in this review, it’s because I’m so annoyed at AD cancellation.)
