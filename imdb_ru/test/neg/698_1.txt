I really like this genre, but “The Cell” was one of the worst films that I was not lucky enough to watch. While about 25 percent of my audience wandered while watching and left the theater (or left entirely), I was stupid enough to hang out. The main problems with this story (there were too many to list them all) is that with this type of film you have to do two things ... one, to ensure the killer’s fear (that they will catch him for twenty minutes in the film, who left), and you have to give the victim, whose life is at stake (the girl in the aquarium), a sufficiently developed character to really care about whether they will get to her on time or not. Not only did I lose track of the girl, I was shown her so little that she was only a blurry face, and when I remembered that she was part of the story, I really didn’t care what happened to her. Although the visual effects were interesting from the point of view of LSD memories, they often did not make sense, and this should be a lesson that cannot compensate for the lack of a good story (see the Example “Phantom Menace”). know or worried what happened to the women kneeling in this area and looking at the sky? Funny.
