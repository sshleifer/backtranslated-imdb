I saw an episode about living at a minimum wage. It went as far as the appearance of Oprah Winfrey for the specified episode. This is bad enough, people are struggling to make ends meet week after week. Then this hypocrite exploits the problem. I did not appreciate the constant complaints from him or his significant friend, everywhere. The question is, how can people pay their medical bills at the ER? Of course, he shows that the bill is high, but he paid the remaining balance (from his own pocket) after his “painful” experience. How many poor people have this privilege after 30 days to pay their bills? Instead, they go hungry and "rob Peter to pay Paul." Complaining throughout the episode is not humiliating for him. The scene of the movie and the restaurant is terrible. He has another privilege that the poor do not have.
