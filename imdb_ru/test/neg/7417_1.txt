It looks decisively like an "amateur" hour. The way this piece of garbage was ever released is unknown to me: acting, history, characters, presumably special effects, etc ... This is EVERYTHING wrong. Why Lance Henriksen accepted this will remain one of the great mysteries of the movie. Perhaps he was in dire need of money, or perhaps was under the influence of some kind of illegal drug. <br /> <br /> There is no point in trying to explain what this film is about. This concerns the legend of the big leg, but done in the worst possible way. Actually this smelly smell smells straight to the video. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs! 0 * out of 10 *
