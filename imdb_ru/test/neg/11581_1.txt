I can immediately recognize that this is one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. And it doesn't say a lot, because I consider myself to be something of a fan when it comes to shitty movie. But this is beyond the bad. This film is so terrible that there is no more fun in it, it’s just bad. <br /> <br /> It’s almost impossible to get acquainted with it. There are no strengths and nothing positive. I'll just talk about a few points that sucks. First of all, CGI should be one of the worst I've ever seen. I cannot believe that this film was made in 2005, CGI reminds me of something that I could see in Babylon 5, when CGI was new and fresh. This is bad beyond belief. Secondly, all the actors seem to belong to the worst kind of day soap. And, looking at their resume, I see that I am right ... Thirdly, the ability to breed huge reptiles does not correspond to another technology that they invented in this film: a gun without recoil with endless ammunition! Seriously, Michael Pari shoots 100-200 times without reloading in any other scene ... As if that were not enough, there are also shape-changing airplanes! First, they are the usual F-16 fighters, in the next scene they are completely different, and in the third - again the F-16! If you buy a video, please do not mix it like this! <br /> <br /> Honestly, there is a lot more to say, but I think I’ll stop. You all understand what I'm saying. Honestly, I did not think that this film was shot anymore. This is similar to what Ed Wood would do. Completely ignorant of quality, not caring about how something looks ... It's almost amazing in everything, it's terrible. If I could give him 0/10, I would, but 1/10 is the lowest score. So that's it.
