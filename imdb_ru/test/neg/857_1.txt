Even those of us who like cute pictures with animals — and I hate them — would find it difficult to find any merit in this terribly bad parody of the film. Perhaps inspired by “101 Dalmatians” with his clever and loyal dogs, his stupid and cunning people and his absurdly “happy” and predictable end, the alternative name “101 Turkey” comes to mind. This would roughly encompass everyone who participated in its unsuccessful production. I dismissed it as some sort of meaningless Hollywood perversion of British customs, before, to my horror, found out that this is actually a Canadian film, shot in Victoria BC. equally fake pit of Canadian mediocrity. Let me count how bad it is. Dizzy plot? Asininsky script? Dark performances and Sofomorsky direction? Awful smart animals? Endless cliches and predictable farce? If you think about it, neither I nor those who view IMDb have any time for a complete catalog of its errors. And yet, if I described in detail its merits, this space would remain empty. Believe me, this is bad; Signal monument in a huge pantheon of a truly terrible (Canadian) cinema. If you have already seen this, my condolences. If you do not do this, stay away from it, like from SARS or the bubonic plague. Or other films with cute animals. Do not even allow your children to see this, so that their tiny minds are not distorted even by the smallest minds of those who financed, made and shot this terrible nonsense. Perhaps tonight, when I retire, I will have a nightmare with scary fanged beasts jumping from the table on the bed when I run in a frantic flight. I hope so. It will be much better than me, than to watch this monstrous banal monster. But then I may dream that I had to watch it a second time, and from horror and cold sweat I want to stay awake all night, shaking from the very possibility of seeing him again, even as a bad dream. I might even find something worthwhile to look at instead. Maybe "Godzilla" or "Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes" Perhaps a video with instructions for my built-in vacuum cleaner.
