I saw this movie, and I still did not care about this movie. I would not have thought about going to Paris, because I do not like this country and its national capital. I do not like to learn French anyway, because I do not understand their language. Why should I go to France when I prefer to go to Germany or the UK? Germany and the United Kingdom are the countries that I tolerate. Apparently, the Olsen twins do not understand French as much as I do. Therefore, I will not disturb the trip to France, no matter what. I could also stay in the United Kingdom and meet single women and play video games if there is a video arcade game. It's all.
