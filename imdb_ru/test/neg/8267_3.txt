I found this terribly frustrating experience! But I added the best version of the same style at the bottom of this post. <br /> <br /> This “Felicia's Journey” is intriguing. This is a drama. But he is full of stereotypes! <br /> <br /> Thus, it serves ONLY for a judgmental character, without worrying about true justice, fairness and truth, with the exception of black and white judgments that correspond to the 30-second advertisement of “NEWS”, which daily illuminates our multimedia experience, especially news bulletins, truthful or misleading in such images! <br /> <br /> This is so exaggerated, it reminds me of the tale of the "Red Red Arrival"! Imagine an innocent young girl who does not have an identity card crossing the border, interrogated by a security guard, but released without any evidence to go looking for her “Romeo” who did not give her the address AGAINST miserable incompetence in the word in a hoarse voice “helping hand “Made friends with her with her incredible story created by a layer! <br /> <br /> It seems to the directors and the management team that no one believes or prays to God, even in times of despair! <br /> <br /> So in these early settings, he organizes and tells a lot of what needs to happen! A nightmare journey that betrays the essence of a substance without fabulous permission, without truth, integrity or believability! ... then one turn and it's over. What a disappointment! If you want to see a MUCH superb movie that explores similar topics with MUCH more confidence, with a much stronger understanding, watch the Paul Cox / Norman Kay 1983 film "The Man of Flowers" !!! <br /> <br /> Unlike this, you will NOT be disappointed!
