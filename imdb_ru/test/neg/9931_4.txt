I read the 28 most recent comments of various people regarding this film, and was surprised that no one mentioned the fact that the first victim shown on the bed with “missing centuries” when the camera rises and moves away from her face is blinking! Yes, BLINGING! I recorded it the way he appeared on HBO last weekend, and when I saw it, I literally had to repeat it several times, concentrating on one eye at a time to make sure I couldn't see anything! Of course, after that it was difficult to take the film seriously, although there were some interesting and intense scenes with Julian Sands. Very disappointed and I give him 4 mainly because the 1st victim blinks in one of the last frames when the camera moves away from the body / face. Very bad.
