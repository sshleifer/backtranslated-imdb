Simply put, Mind of Mencia is the worst, funniest show on Comedy Central, and maybe all the television ... ever. I love Comedy Central and watch a lot of shows and movies there, but every time the introduction to this show begins even after a good comedy, I can’t find the remote quickly enough. <br /> <br /> Mencia tells used, worn-out racial jokes in a bad attempt to be controversial, then point out the ethnicity that he just talked about in the audience, as if to say: and, accordingly, me too "Give me a break, Mencia, I don't know whether these people are plants or not, but only because you go to a black guy and flirt with him five times after one of your ridiculous jokes, doesn't mean that he thinks you are funny it just means that you put and in place, and what else he's going to do, slap you on TV? He gets the impression that his jokes are deep, informative and make you wonder what is noticeable in his commercials, but when you actually watch the show, almost 100% of what he says is common sense. He also claims that only smart people get some of his jokes, but you don’t need to be smarter than a monkey to understand what he just said when he says that maybe you need to finish Carlos 3rd class. This guy keeps saying that he is saying what others only think about, but I think you will find that if someone thought about what he was saying, they themselves all understood that it was funny, and therefore they never did not say. First of all. <br /> <br /> In general, watch episode 1 and be done with it if necessary, because after watching episode 1 you saw them all. Why Comedy Central continues to update this terrible performance, I do not know. If you are looking for a good comedy, look elsewhere, because you will find very few here.
