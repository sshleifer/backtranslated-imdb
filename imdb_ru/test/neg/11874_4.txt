Since Wesley Snipes came down (or ascended) to the world of DTV militants, the result was a miss, so miss.Unstoppible was weak. 7 seconds was entertaining. /> <br /> What about the Detonator? We will do something for the sufferer Arrow again. But Detonator has a small amount of merit, which is hampered by a lazy star and a low budget. <br /> <br /> Sonny Griffith is not a secret undercover opera that ravages illegal arms dealers in Poland. When his last appointment ends with a bulletin cupboard leaving a bunch of bodies, Sonny is then ordered to accompany the witness; Nadia (forever hot Silvia Kolloka) in the United States. There is a problem; Sonny is cheating on a traitor in his own organization who is following the Gangsters with Nuclier's ambitions. <br /> <br /> Snipes works in the action department. He is here in semi-blade mode. well in the first 15 minutes of the Detonator, before plunging into the regime of pure sleepwalking, which spoiled Marksman. Collock not only looks beautiful. There is some conviction in her scenes. Many actors look familiar, and have been in the last 3 or 4 Seagal / Snipes films. It's always nice to see Michael Brandon again. <br /> <br /> Telegraph is broadcast here. But never boring. Running, car chases, battles. It seems that director Po-Chi Leong recovered after Seagal's farce; from the outside. He does a credible job. But he is constantly hampered by a low budget. Enough with eastern locations in Europe. It cheapens the look of the movie. Detection may not be so expensive, is it? <br /> Detonator finishes just average. He does not have such a bad, his funny aspect Seag mercenary for justice. But this is not so exciting as the second in the Van Damme team. Not as exciting as the Mechanic Dolph. Perhaps Dolph should run Wesley next, eh? <br /> <br /> It's time for the producers to promote a little more money and think about these DTV publications with the money they earn on them. This is true. As a result, maybe this will be a good seller? <br /> <br /> Snipes will recommend trying to make this movie the latest DTV movie. It is sad to see another waste of talent of this gifted actor.
