"Beowulf" is like a very bad game: no characters, no stories, no real dialogue, bad fights ... This is probably the worst movie in the history of cinema. It is deadly boring, a waste of time. I'm very sorry for Christoph Lambert, who clearly does not know how to choose a role. If someone invites you to see Beowulf, believe me: run like crazy.
