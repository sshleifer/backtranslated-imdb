John Travolta repeats his role as Chile Palmer, a Hollywood gangster who now turns his attention to the music business. Using his “negotiating skills,” he tries to create an independent label with the wife of a murdered friend, played by Uma Thurman, and try to make his young singer (Christina Milian) a hit. > Before I saw this sequel, I heard that this is a terrible movie. However, Be Cool is still a nice comedy, even if it’s not as good as the original. This time, the film focuses on the music industry, not the film industry. The music business is depicted in the film very badly, and it uses a bunch of unconvincing stereotypes. I cannot say whether it was intention or not, as Get Shorty did a good job of faking the film industry. This cannot be said about the sequel, and the attempts are just lazy. <br /> <br /> An impressive cast is what saves the film from being flooded. The best work is given by Rock, and it's nice to see him in a different type of role. Vince Vaughn also gives a funny presentation, although he began to annoy to the end. Surprisingly, Uma Thurman shows average performance, and I expected more from it. John Travolta returns as Chile, and he does a good job. His performance is pretty boring. Christina Milian performs a terrible performance, and she is not as good as a singer. Cedric the Entertainer gives a good job, although he does not act in the film for a very long time. There are also several cameos, including Steven Tyler and James Wood. <br /> <br /> F. Gary Gray directs and he does a poor job. He just doesn’t do a good job with the movie, and the movie is a mess. There were also a lot of goods, and after a while it became annoying. Also in the 118th minute, the film is too long and has a lot of slow spots. The film had to be badly edited, and this is clearly not the case. Fortunately for the film, the actors are able to rise above the weak direction and the script, and they put on some funny scenes. Sometimes the film tried its best, and sometimes it was pretty funny. Compared with the original, the sequel does not fit. However, Be Cool is a pretty innocuous and forgettable comedy. In the end, Be Cool is worth it and that's it. Rating 6/10
