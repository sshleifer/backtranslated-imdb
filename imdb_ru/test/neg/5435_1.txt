Anyone who has seen a piece of steaming poop called Congo understands my title. And I feel for you. This film was not just bad. It was painful. The book was stupid, the script was even dumber, and the actors were terrible. Dylan Walsh? It is rumored that Julia Roberts threw your ass because this film exploded so badly. Huge diamonds? A killer gorilla? Talking Gorillas? Hmmm Sounds like a hit! OH! Tim Curry's accent in this film is so bad that I would rather be deaf! I recommend this film to a bulimic wishing to clear out after a heavy meal, or to Kavorkian's patients who just need another reason to die. If this is the right book, I would say, letâ€™s make it so that the good old books burn and destroy each copy. If future generations look back and find this garbage, how would we explain ourselves? Listen to those who hated this movie! Do not look! Run away! DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM! If you think that it is full of action, expectations or cool effects, YOU are WRONG! If you think it blows more cock than Nicole Richie, you would be right. So if you're still going to watch Crapo ... I mean Congo, I say, do it after you've just taken 50 Tylenols.
