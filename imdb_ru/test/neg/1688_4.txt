This is a painfully slow story about the last days of 1999, when a strange disease broke out and ... I stopped caring. Approximately two people are supposed to live above each other or in a residential complex. The leak, and the plumber made a hole in the floor of the man so that you could look into the apartment under the woman. In addition, as the crisis continues, much of the dialogue is actually news ... <br /> <br /> Sounds promising? <br /> <br /> Not really. <br /> <br /> I got distracted and started doing other things that are deadly in the movie with subtitles. In fact, I started not to look, which made the events even more surreal when I looked up. <br /> <br /> This might work for you, but not for me.
