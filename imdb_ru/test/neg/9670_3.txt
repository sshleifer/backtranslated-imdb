After I saw Shootfighter 1 and the buckets of blood that they shed, I was ready for another brisk walk with a heart massage with open hands and chiropractic in a cage. But oooooooh, it was like the version of Barneyâ€™s first movie with this lamer from a karate kid. At the very least, Bolo Jung is still kicking booty, although he needs to star in films like Bloodsport and Caddyshack.
