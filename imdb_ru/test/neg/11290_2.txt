I have to admit that I was deceived by the title and the summary on the back of the box. So I put it in the VCR and kept waiting ... and waiting ... and waiting for something good to happen But, of course, this never happens. The creators of this film should be tied to the chair and made to watch "Saving Private Ryan." Maybe they will learn something.
