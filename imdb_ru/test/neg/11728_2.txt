A completely forgotten film, but an incredible soundtrack: I would give it (soundtrack) 9 out of 10. I have a CD and the guitar work (Nils Lofgren) is great! I saw the film a few years ago, and I had to check IMDb to remember what it was about. I am obsessed with a soundtrack, and since then I have had to replace it. It ranges from blues / soul / ballad to a dose of gospel. All songs are written, arranged, produced and performed by Nils Lofgren, who is the “other” lead guitarist with Eve Steve Van Zandt. This dude can play! Niels (he can't sing very well, too hoarsely), Bonnie Sheridan (who is a great singer) and Tom Lepson do vocals.
