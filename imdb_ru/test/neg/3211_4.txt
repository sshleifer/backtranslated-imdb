Take the James Bond secret agent / craze of the sixties, mix some concepts from the femme fatal woman Fax Manchu Sachs Romer and move in some ridiculous perverted revisionism of director Franco - you have a lesbian Sumura or a “7 secrets ...” - better known as the “Girl from Rio” in the United States, recalling “The man from Rio” who has nothing to do with it. Yes, it happens in Brazil, we have to give it. Sumuru, or Sumitra, as it is also called, looks like the evil version of Blaise's Modesty, played here by actress Eaton with that familiar shy smile that most of us first met in Goldfinger. There are numerous close-up shots at which she is looking at the camera, slowly opening her mouth, probably watching something unpleasant (however, her key lesbian scene doubles). She controls a whole army of female warriors, colorfully dressed and controls a city called Femina or something like that (near Rio de Janeiro?). These concepts, which previously appeared in “Millions of Eyes of Sumura”, sound amazing, but, despite some intriguing scenographic and visual effects, they follow the same relaxed atmosphere, for example, the very outdated “Some Girls Do”, which came about a time where there was also a female army. At first glance, the sight of all these armed women, usually lined up, attracts interest, but after about 15 minutes you realize that there is nothing more than setting up the visual. <br /> <br /> The plot repeats what looks like a secret agent, a man arriving in Brazil with $ 10 million. He draws the attention of a local crime boss (Sanders, calling him an elderly villain like Bond) who sends dark thugs in bowling hats to molest him. This creates all the conditions for a trilateral conflict between the agent, the criminal lord and the mysterious Sumura (the criminal lord needs the secrets of Sumura). Sumura also keeps different prisoners in glass cells - perhaps this is one of the secrets. It sounds exciting, but there are problems that go beyond the slow pace; There are a lot of shots that could use a lot of tightening: for example, one shot of an arriving plane stays on the ship when it approaches almost stopping, as if it had never been filmed before. There is a similar approach to a typical sunset, as if there is something unusual about it. The fighting scenes are very poor-quality, as if the filmmakers were supposed to use the first doubles. To add some production value, there is a scene of a real carnival in Rio about halfway through. I guess there were various budget problems, especially evident in the climate battle, where the fake sound effects and smoke cover up many fake actions, such as the absence of even real looking guns - this is reminiscent of the time when children use plastic pistols and pretend that bullets shoot, falling unconvincingly. There are signs of sadism, such as torturing a character to get answers, and female nudity, an early description of this after removing some restrictions. But basically, you will roll your eyes.
