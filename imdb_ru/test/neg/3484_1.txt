One of the worst surfing movies I've ever seen. This film is so bad that I do not know where to start. Well, let's start with the premise - some dude from the mainland who almost doesn't know how to travel, travels to Hawaii and participates in a big wave contest that he more or less expects to win. A good analogy for those who do not surf is an example of how an avid smoker slaps pairs of sneakers and participates in a marathon in Los Angeles, waiting for victory. Never! And the competition is held on the North Bank, which conjures up images of 15-foot waves, but on the day of the competition, the waves can be 6-foot. Actions? What is the action? If you have to see this woof on TV, do not spend money on rent. If you want to watch a pretty good movie about surfing - if, of course, it is imperfect, but that's another story - rent a big environment.
