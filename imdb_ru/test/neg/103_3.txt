It is a pity that this film is not so. While “The Nemesis Game” is a little entertaining, it was difficult for me to suspend my disbelief for the entire length of the film, especially in situations in which Sarah got involved. Do we really have to believe that: <br /> <br /> 1) will this hot chick roam unarmed buildings and dark subway tunnels in the middle of the night unarmed to solve some riddles? <br /> 2) the main characters are supposedly such experts that they play riddles for fun, but they don’t put together the whole riddle “I never sinned” until the very end ... and then ... and then ... get it ... should she do the whole mirror thing to finally put the pieces together ?? I know it was the director's device to show the audience what was going on, but do they really think that we are so stupid? <br /> <br /> 3) when Vern and Sarah go to Chez M to interrogate the blonde There is no ONE topless in the whole building. Nada C'mon. I know that this is Canada, but I would expect more from the country that gave us Shannon Tweed. <br /> <br /> And someone else noticed that when Vern was browsing websites and found this Riddlezon site, when he thought the reference to the cursor remained an arrow and did not turn into a small arrow (HOW ALL CURSORS ARE WHEN YOU PRESS ON THE HYPERLINK)?!? I mean, if you want the Internet to play such a prominent role in your film, at least do it right. Geez.
