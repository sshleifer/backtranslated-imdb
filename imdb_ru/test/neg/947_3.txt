The most accurate description of how Billy Crystal performs in “My Giant” is to say that this film refers to his career, like “Ishtar” to Warren Beatty - he did not destroy it, but slowed it down .... . ..lot. A crystal should know the three golden rules of Hollywood: 1) never play against a child 2) never play against an animal 3) never play against someone who is almost 3 feet above you, as innocent as a child, and "leads yourself "like an animal. <br /> <br /> What is this story? Comedy? I think, but I didn’t laugh, except when Crystal is in itself and not burdened with his ex-wife (what is her role in this film) or the Giant mentioned above. Did I mention there is also a baby in this movie? Well, forget about him. The son is introduced to make us feel sorry for the Crystal, and we are sorry, but not the actor, but the character. Billy Crystal is a funny person. If you do not believe me, watch it in the old episodes of "Soap" or "Saturday Night Live". Rent a "City Dude", "Scared Runner" or "When Harry Met Sally." <br /> <br /> “Giant” is much more modest than the fee. <br /> <br />
