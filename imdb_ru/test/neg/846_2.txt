I give him 2, because of the beautiful Mediterranean Greece, otherwise it would be 1. When Nicolas Cage came out with his first lines, I thought that he was just joking. Cell like Italian ?? I'm sorry, but a very wrong actor who acts is also BAD, not to mention his Italian accent. The story is very free, it could be good, but with other actors and, obviously, with a different scenario. The camera is excellent, the photo too, but why the hell did you choose Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz for the role? Please don't get me wrong, I have nothing against Cage, he has some really good films, but he is clearly not for every role. It is a pity that the cast was not better delivered, because the story has potential.
