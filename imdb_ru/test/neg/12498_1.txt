Oh my God! It must be one of the worst films I've ever seen. It is incredibly repetitive; each scene seems to be made up of people being shot, running screaming, or slapped in the face, which quickly becomes very boring. I would not mind if the fight were any good, but it is not; the main character Phillips pushes the various thugs with ridiculous ease, and no matter how often he stands in sight of Trecker, he is never beaten, even though he is shot and blown by additional and secondary characters. I rarely saw the worst actors (especially Don Wilson, if you can even call him “an actor”), but this is not surprising, given the dialogue with which they have to work (approximate line: “Computers killed my brother!”). The plot is a secondary robbery of the excellent Terminator; special effects are ridiculous. Overall, this movie is just awful. And why does everything explode?
