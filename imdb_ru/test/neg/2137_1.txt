a boring, horrible piece of Italian euro-rubbish about a scientist who seems to spend most of his time devouring beer (that's what makes him American, right? Our scientists spend most of their academic life gone crazy, of course. all really great theories come) who study something (dolphin calls, fish migration patterns, who knows). Through headphones, he hears a strange sound, proving that his radio station is picking up a station in Jamaica. At the same time, a girl from Jack Skellington, with one of the worst, most bleached hair manes of the 80s, which I have always witnessed, is trying to reassure the dolphins in the Sea Aquarium she is working on, as they are apparently upset from - for the amount of fish she has been fishing lately. The beginning of the film was a very badly colored storyline about two annoying, very Italian people, whose boat was attacked by something invisible under water. The evil woman was never seen again (the best part of the story), and the body of the guy was found without legs. A dull alcoholic scientist (with an inexplicable Anglo-American-Italian accent) and a stick girl with hay wool are beginning to put forward the theory that a giant monster is hiding under the seas off the coast of Italy. .Florida. <br /> <br /> They enlist the help of an electrician to set up an underwater microphone so that the monster can sing in karaoke. This guy has a beautiful girl, the only drawback of which is that she says Peter “Peach”, but for some reason he is sexually attracted to the anatomical skeleton with curly hair, a situation that makes one blink. <br /> <br /> Overwriting is terrible, the editor is spasms, and the storyline is generally a yawn. There is little about how this strange science corporation genetically engineered this monstrous giant shark-squid-barracuda for some reason that does not make sense, and the really unpleasant fat-haired guy kills women, again without apparent reason. A silly sheriff and his swollen assistant with a female scientist (we know that she is smart because she wears huge glasses). One day a female scientist takes on a huge, horrible monster (yes, that's right, Ed Wood's giant octopus was more believable) with only a small pen, and she won the contest. Hurray for skinny little women who obviously become the best monster hunters! <br /> <br /> The solution to the problem of a giant thing is to blow up half of the Everglades, leaving a dead zone a few miles in each direction. , To hell with the ecology and the environment, right? We have to kill this giant monster! In the end, the electrician and his favorite broom leave for sunset on his Vespa, which is approx. since she survived the death of her colleagues, and he is not very upset that his girlfriend hit a crazy man with greasy hair. Hurray for true love! Wait, isn't there anything suspicious in all this?
