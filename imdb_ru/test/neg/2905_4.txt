You know, after the first few films about Chuck Norris, I got so that I could say that the film was shot by Golan-Globus, even if I tuned in the middle, even without looking at the credits or title. Moreover, I could say that it was Golan-Globus for a minute of screen time. Something about the structure of the story, the stupid relationship between the characters, the mannered dialogue, the wooden game (permeated with random frankly awful performance), the tempo and rhythms of the scene that made Albert Pyun look like John McTiernan, paper-thin and not ready for prime time The battle choreography ... Golan-Globus has been incredibly consistent over the years in style, subject and point of view. <br /> <br /> What you can say is that it should work for them, since they produced literally dozens of films. You go to one of their performances, and you know exactly what you get. And this is not brain food, guys. <br /> <br /> “Ninja 3” is another item from the long GG sausage assortment, offering typical limited enjoyments to moviegoers. palate You have bad ninjas, chopping policemen, criminals, and anyone who bothers them. You have a good ninja who promised to stop him. You have a Westerner thrown into the mix so that we Americans can identify with him (or with her in this case) and be sure that "we can still defeat these nasty orientalists in their own game." You have a love interest (which is usually also the worst actor / actor in the film), fencing a hero. You have an endless series of attacks, murders, and protracted shots of men gurgling in agony, while an arrow or a throwing star unconvincingly protrude from their eyes, neck or chest. You have your pumped up white guy / bodyguards in suits, calling the ninja "Son A * B * tch" and striking with a U-turn, only to pass it * ss to him. You have a final confrontation between “The Good Guy” and “The Bad Guy”, which lasts for 20 minutes and just stops like a RoadRunner caricature, instead of reaching a climax or resolution. <br /> <br /> Ninja 3 is slightly different in that the plot revolves around a patchwork female sporty type obsessed with a bad ninja, so that she eventually kills a lot of cops and criminals and muscular white bodyguards in suits, under his spell . But there are all the other elements that are as formal as a Kabuki play or a drama No. <br /> <br /> I really thought that Lucinda Dickie was quite pretty in this movie. She is well muscled and seductive, has excellent cheekbones and a bit of sporting “mind-blowing movement” in her movements, and you can actually suspend the conviction enough to admit that her character can perform some of the feats she performs in the film. She can almost, but not quite, carry this thing. Another start for her participation and good energy. <br /> <br /> Naturally, Sho Kusugi is here, and he largely dominates the last 10-15 minutes of the film. And just to show you what the 3 and not inspired GG films look like, the director and editor combined the latest climate battle between the Kosugi and the Bad Ninja scene with numerous response frames from Dickie and her boyfriend who watched the battle for life and death. with an expression of slight embarrassment. I'm serious ... in spite of all the emotions and reactions that they show to the hearings, they could look at the sea turtle in Marineland. I can only imagine what Dicky must have felt when she saw the finished product — she probably wanted to really run through the editor with the katana, because these reactions make her look like a complete idiot. <br /> <br /> A pleasant waste of time ... but it is definitely a waste of time. Perhaps if you are a Sho Kusugi fan or even a Linda Dickey fan, then you will find it worth it.
