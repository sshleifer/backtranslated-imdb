Larry Clark is not known for his talents as a writer or director, but he has made several important undisputed films. Children, the Hooligan and, to a lesser extent, Ken Park - all achieve their goal: shock, disgust, and even disgust. These films are uncompromising in their content and use their contradictory nature to identify the very serious problems of today's youth. Children subjected us to breeding. and sexual promiscuity among young people. Hooligan touched on similar questions. Ken Park dealt with sexual abuse and suburban addiction. It is undeniable that all these films showed something terrible and left an unpleasant taste in the mouth. <br /> <br /> Wassup Rockers are a group of poor Spanish skateboarders from the south-central part of Las Angeles who are randomly sent to Beverly Hills. to skate. That's all. <br /> <br /> Wassup Rockers is nothing. <br /> <br /> This makes no sense. It has essentially a non-existent narrative. And, like “Children”, novice actors participate in it, who were removed from the set. However, unlike Children, none of them have a semblance of talent. There is a better acting in porn. In this film, without a doubt, the most terrible performances that I have ever seen in a feature film. You can respect Larry Clark for the fact that he put these young people on the set, but these guys are absolutely worthy guys. May I add that, obviously, these gentlemen also created a soundtrack that presents some of the darkest and most inept garage punks you've ever heard — my advice — to drink a couple of migraine tablets before entering the theater, otherwise you regret it. then. <br /> <br /> But again, they don’t have many scenarios to work with. Each spoken line is contrived, pathetic and annoying. The story itself is ridiculous. It starts reasonably enough, but soon, quite unexpectedly, it turns into an obvious absurdity. This begins, of course, with a whimsical sex drop with a pair of rich white girls, followed by a series of clichéd meetings with national lamps, characters are killed for no reason and, eventually, lead to a ridiculous anti-climax. Shots last much longer than necessary. Be prepared to watch people fall off their skateboards for fifteen minutes in a row, too long, protracted shots with characters that do nothing or skateboarding through the streets. But, again, with a modest 32 pages, they need as much useless filler as possible. Perhaps Wassup Rockers would work better as a short film. <br /> <br /> In any case, I could go on like this. This is the worst movie made by Larry Clark. For those of you who are interested in watching a movie about Clark at least because of his shocking antics with homosexuals, take a look elsewhere. This is by far the coolest film he has shot, as well as the worst. It's horrible. Like, Uwe Boll is terrible. Definitely the worst I've ever seen at the festival. <br /> <br /> 1/10
