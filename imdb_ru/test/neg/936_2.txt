All I can say is that this film was made for the Lifetime Channel on television, which means no solid characters, no particular style, a weak acting game of all kinds of supposed sex, but no breasts and carcasses (because, boyfriend, it just catapults the film into the depths of meanness, isn't it?) but strongly modeled sex, well, that's normal. <br /> <br /> When watching these movies, I ask myself when will these TV channels and their advertisers ever grow? I think these companies are really far behind the times. They really have no idea what the younger generation is up to, and if they knew what they were demanding, we would change. The whole point of many American TV channels like this seems to be basically regurgitating the same disinfected, diluted garbage over and over again, like a regular movie assembly line. I think it works for them ... or at least that's the way it is. Not sure about the future, though. <br /> <br /> Don't tire yourself to death like me. Look for real TV films on HBO, Showtime, IFC, Starz, etc. Any channel that makes an effort to their work and should not ask the priest what they can or cannot show.
