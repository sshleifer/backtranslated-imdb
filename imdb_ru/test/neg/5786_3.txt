The best gun without internal hostility. Or class. Or money. Or a cruise. Justification for the next generation traveling actor to promote their ability to lead a matinee, in which there really is nothing in which anyone could get their teeth. It's a shame, because the first shot of Charlie Sheen opens with a big promise, which is almost immediately spent on ridiculous wedding decorations. Barking. <br /> <br /> Dennis Heisbert is a changeable actor for me, but he is good in this film, especially in action movies. Michael Bean is a first-class action movie hero, but not a leading man: Charlie Sheen, in all respects, a leading man, but never the hero of an action movie. There are hundreds of tricks that are also worth mentioning. 3/10
