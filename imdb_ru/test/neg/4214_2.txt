This movie is NOTHING like a book. I think the author of the script must have wanted to write a sequel, "Gone With the Wind" and was rejected. It was his or her way of getting their ideas anyway. The only similarity between this film and the story he portrayed was in the names of the main characters and the scene. None of the events shown in the film happened this way in the book. For the fan of Gone With the Wind (both books and films), this was deeply disappointing. If you liked Scarlett’s book, don’t watch this movie hoping to see it on screen. They have only a common name.
