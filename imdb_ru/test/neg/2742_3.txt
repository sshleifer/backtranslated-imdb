It was rather inevitable. This film is borrowed from “The Core” and the film “Armageddon,” the films he borrowed, and so on. In addition to this time, there is Luke Perry. This cinematic version of the familiar story “Save the World” includes super-earthquakes, starting in the northwest Pacific and also spreading to the whole ring of fire. It soon became clear that everyone on Earth could be doomed. Thus, the military and some scientists are building one of these high-tech drilling machines to get inside the Earth and fix things (it would not be so fun if they did not have to go somewhere, for example, to space or to the planet). There is even a line in which attempts to make a trip to Earth sound more impressive than a trip to space (as in Armageddon). This is a science fiction film, so the script is drawn according to the figure “Disaster”. There are clashes between scientists and the military, there are lasers, thawing stones, people die and sacrifice themselves for the good of all, and, above all, there are (weak CGI) special effects. Not original and not so interesting. This is a movie to watch when you have nothing to do, especially if you have a beer.
