In the film, there is a point where the female boss of "death machines" (the multinational trio to please everyone, being inclusive, I think, is called these days) tells about the use of leverage on a business person. Except that its delivery is such that it sounds like "leatherage". At this point, this viewer came to himself, thinking that this boring film turns the corner into a new world of perversions. But it is not. The lady boss had to say, because the "death cars" didn't say a single word during the whole movie, and she spoke. Endlessly. There is an action in the film, but it is not so exciting, and the plot ranges from one clich√© to another. Three dumb "death cars" live to survive another day at the end of the film. I hope there was no continuation.
