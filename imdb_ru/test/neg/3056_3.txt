It’s hard to decide if this film suffers from a crappy dialogue or is it just made for crappy actors. In any case, it suffers from writing stories, which is mediocre at best. <br /> <br /> Although it was shot at the end of the 80s, the first part of the film resembles the youthful comedy of the 60s (except for the absence of any actual humor). ), especially the “good girl” part, which also annoys the Doris Day figure you can hope for / fear, including a slightly whiny opposition to anything “funny” that her friends want to do. The net effect is that after a while you begin to hope that she will bite him, so that you no longer have to listen to her voice. <br /> <br /> Some profanity and unwarranted nudity, as well as clothing in the style of the 80s. this is your only clue that this film was shot in the 80s. Yes, and some pretty tolerable music too. <br /> <br /> According to the plot, this is quite a formulaic thing. A bunch of excited (except, apparently, from the "Miss Pretty Girl") teenagers decide to celebrate Halloween night, throwing a party in a haunted house. Then follows a party and fornication, as well as a reckless "session" that starts the demonic animation, which is the subject of the film. After that, the only tense part will try to guess in which order the characters will expire. You really don't care if they will. The actors are so bad that becoming demons / zombies / dinner actually improves their performance somewhat, and the dialogue of the ridiculous cliché is so annoying that you are writhing in your place. <br /> <br /> In any case, this click is no big deal if you don’t think that cheesy is a kind of “special”. For example, the head of a demon that sometimes appears is so blatantly false that you are wondering if this is a 5-year stunt or a cure. <br /> <br /> This is not to say that there is nothing pleasant in the film. Some music is not so bad, and the first of our tasteless Scooby gang, which is obsessed, at some point performs an amazing and really sexy dance routine, before it becomes nasty. <br /> <br /> Besides, and I don’t know why, at the very end of the film I really managed to take part. Waiting, which was not in most films, appeared late, and I began to squirm because of anxiety, and not because of irritation. That is what a horror movie should do. <br /> <br /> Consequently, I cannot bring myself to give this film an extremely low rating, because by some inexplicable miracle (I do not exclude that I am demon-possessed) I actually was a little creeping. <br /> <br /> Although, do not pay money to see it. It is hardly worth your time, but cash alone. Watch it on YouTube while it's there.
