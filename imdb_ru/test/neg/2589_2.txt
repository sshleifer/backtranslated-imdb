This is the black widow's plagiarism so blatantly made for television (1987) - even the names of insects are very similar. <br /> <br /> If you want the best film, Marry Money, see Black Widow. Starring: Debra Winger and Teresa Russell. <br /> <br /> This film is the best! I just had to watch it completely to see how it ended.
