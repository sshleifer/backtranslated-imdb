I must pay tribute to Billy Dee for trying to do this. Knowing that it was a blasting film, I started my DVD with a certain expectation. I knew that this would be a low-budget act of acting, but I hoped that a few stones would be scattered everywhere. If any diamonds or gems were scattered in this film, they would have been successfully buried under tons and tons of coal ... or, perhaps, replayed. As an actor and director, I often shriveled when potential sharp moments were spoiled by horrific actions. However, I must admit, I could not look away. I don’t know if it was like a car accident that couldn’t be turned away, or some mysterious power in the film that kept me there. This film is a good case for a great story that was told wrong. If Walter Kronkit had told the joke "Aristocrats", it would have been a complete failure, although the joke itself is very funny. Let Dave Chappell tell this, and we'll all laugh by sex. This film needed "Chapelle". Now, with that said, if you have the opportunity to buy this film for a dollar, which I made, do it. It is well worth the money. Maybe I will take another dollar, buy the rights to this film and redo it. Who knows ... it might not be better, but surely it could not be worse.
