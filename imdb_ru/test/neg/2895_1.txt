Being a fan of science fiction, I was always interested in this film. Therefore, I was thrilled to see that “Journey to the far side of the Sun” finally came out on an affordable DVD (the previous edition brought $ 100 on eBay - I am sure that these people want them to get the money back - but more about that second) . <br /> <br /> In any case, the premise of this film (like the “Parallel” of the Twilight Zone) is that on the “other side of the Sun” there is an uncharted planet resembling the Earth. This planet, of course, is exactly the same as ours, except that it is turned upside down. In essence, this means that their letters are reversed, and people are driving on the wrong side of the road. <br /> <br /> Sounds intriguing? Well, this is basically all that is in this film. The first hour or so is devoted to preparing for a trip to this other planet. These are just tedious scenes of pressing switches, banal dialogue, etc. This makes no sense. Jerry Anderson managed to find the most boring British actors in film history who will play most of the roles. I mean, they are so boring that I am surprised that the crew could not sleep to finish the film. <br /> <br /> In any case, as soon as the crew finally landed on the planet (after an endless series of seated cosmonauts and Roy Tinnes (literally sleeping in the cockpit) notices that the copy is on the bottle of cologne, and jumps back to another ship to tell people about what he found. Unfortunately, he can never do it as he falls and dies. End! Oh wait, there is a bonus scene of one of the heads of outer space, who at the end rushes into a mirror in a chair -katalka. I guess he also wanted to take off this from the film. <br /> <br /> I’m really surprised that such a film could have been made back in the 60s. Rent it if necessary. DO NOT BUY.
