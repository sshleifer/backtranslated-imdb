I like to think that I can appreciate a movie that is a bit unusual, and, of course, I like a good movie that makes me think. <br /> <br /> If you like unusual films that make you think, then look elsewhere. This film is so bad and scattered that after it ends, you will only think about how it is possible that you spent 90 minutes of your life on this. <br /> <br /> Such a movie needs a driver to get bought from the viewer. Why are we interested in the main characters? What motivates these characters through their existence? Why do they make the decisions they make? This film makes a very weak attempt to do this and fails in the process. There is no chemistry between these two actors, both of whom are excellent in their ability to feel comfortable in any role. So why did they fail here? I firmly feel that they also did not know what their motives were, and when the actor does not know, their audience cannot follow. <br /> <br /> In general, I saw macromedia flash movies that offered more to evoke thoughts, at least I have more interest in a transformed hamster who likes the moon than why this married a family man would risk it all for violating "Code 46".
