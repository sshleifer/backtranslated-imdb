No one in this movie has anything to do. This is probably the longest 65 minutes I've ever spent on watching a movie. The effect of cosmetics for a pianist with macromelia is quite good, but this is the only thing that keeps him from assessing. A doctorâ€™s assistant after a few seconds goes through drastic mood swings from passivity to hysteria, and then seems to forget where she was. the right ingredients for a mad doctor movie, but somehow forgot the skeleton story to hang them up. If you do not know someone from the cast or crew, I would not even recommend taking this sample.
