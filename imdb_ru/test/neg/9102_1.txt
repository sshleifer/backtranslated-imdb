My friends and I shot this film, taking it for another, dedicated to skateboarding. Watching Steve Guttenberg as an acting hero is fun. The film is so incredibly predictable and excessive that in the end it became a festival of laughter. Even though I gave him 1/10, this movie is worth seeing, especially if you can catch it on TV anywhere.
