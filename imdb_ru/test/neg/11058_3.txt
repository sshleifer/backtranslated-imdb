In another case, misleading marketing, this film is included in a set of 10 films called “Women who kick ass”, but even in the original cover, he promises Shannon Tweed as an action movie. In fact, for most of the movie, Tweed plays the typical whiny and good-natured female character that the male leader has to save, and even when she learns to fight in the jungle, she still has to drag him! There is one female rebel who is a stronger character, but she mostly keeps in the margins of the film. The man is Reb Brown, and he has some (unintentionally, I think) funny moments (for example, when he is killed by electricity). The scene of the militants is badly directed and does not work well: some stuntmen took several lessons about how to "kill and die convincingly." I suppose if you are in a good mood, you may find some things in the “Line of Fire” that you can laugh at (at some point we hear Tweed say, but her lips do not move!), But mostly I was just boring.
