This is the worst show! Norris and his family write, produce, direct, etc. And so on. D. The only reason I see this is because my stupid wife likes it. How many times can Norris fly through the air from view to strike a clearly blind villain? No trees, no buildings, just whistling ... out of thin air. He ALWAYS solves the case or is the best in his skill. No co-star will ever get glory. This is all Norris. Obviously, Norris is terribly stuck on himself and will not allow anyone to pick him up in any scene, regardless of the content. Awful game, horrible script, horrible TV series.
