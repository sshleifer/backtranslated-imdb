The name of the DEA agent, Anslinger, is a pleasant inner joke, the name of a former drug addict king who almost single-handedly made marijuana illegal. <br /> <br /> Despite this little book awareness, the authors continue to let farmers collect and sell fresh, raw leaves, rather than cured buds. <br /> <br /> Besides, it was always funny to me that filmmakers never seem to find real marijuana plants for filming. You might think that there would be a business that would make a real-looking fake movie business, or maybe they could shoot a couple of scenes in Amsterdam or Switzerland. I guess it requires too much for the budget. <br /> <br /> Probably the most interesting thing in the film is an attempt to capture the idea of ​​what is right and what is bad in society, and how the law operates the lines and still tries to do justice despite this. <br /> <br />
