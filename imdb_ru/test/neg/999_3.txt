The main genre is a thriller with inconvenient control. Fellowes tried to derive much more benefit from this, using the false names to achieve all sorts of small turns, invariably intended to surprise the characters more than the audience. <br /> <br /> It's really pretty messy, although Fellows doesn’t seem interested in presenting the elements of a thriller in such a way that we are in good shape. Rather, his attention is focused on the moral difficulties themselves. <br /> <br /> The dialogue here is inconsistent, scenic, it is commonly used there and with the constant surprise of realism, which is sometimes overturned with a cliché. Although there is no place to fuss, so that actors can continue to exist in their own space, a terrible account cannot create an extra dimension and often works against the emotional impulse of given parts of the set. There is also very prosaic, I dare say, this is a British feeling for filming. I did not want to see the document of two successful people from the middle class who found themselves in an unusual situation, I wanted to see some tricky storytelling. <br /> <br /> Finally, in fact, this is a story that brings the rest. Just as the elements of uncertainty are rather flat, the story is an asymmetrical sum of plots of various shapes and sizes woven as a means of character verification. Wilkinson and Watson support this meta-essay with good performances, and John Warnabi’s stormy counterpart Simon Wilkinson - a welcome hindrance for most eyebrows. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed; not that it is bad, but that could be much better. 3/10
