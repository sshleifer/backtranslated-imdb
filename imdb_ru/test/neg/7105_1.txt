Perhaps this is because I am not a fan of comics (but if the comics are of the same “quality” as the film, it’s hard to believe that they exist), but it must be one of the worst films ever made. A non-existent plot, a ridiculous game, a dull dialogue ... This film is so bad it hurts. Lot. The fact that some people actually gave this one to 10/10 is an insult to any good or at least mediocre (or at least bad) movie. If you hate yourself, then see Tank Girl! On the other hand, if you hate yourself so much, maybe you should just commit suicide ... My rating: -34/10
