My housemate and I foolishly bought the “The Roller Blade Seven” video in our local used video store in the hope of finding a bad movie to laugh at. This film is not even funny, it is pathetically poor, even worse than Jack Frost 2, and that says something. Scenario, acting, staging, stunts, sound, scenery, everything is absolutely terrible. In some parts, the actors did not even learn their lines and clearly impose advertising or, in one case, actually read lines by frame and simply repeat them. Filmed in the post-apocalyptic “Zone of the Wheel”, the film obviously consists of about 45 minutes of the film, many parts of which are edited poorly or are repeated to nausea from different camera angles to make the film longer. It gets tiresome very quickly. The plot does not make any sense (it seems to be a mixture of two books written by Scott Shaw), there are not even seven of them, most of them are not on blades, they wear roller shoes, and it seems that it seems to me that the film is basically completely sold, because in it about 3 minutes of a female half-a-half. Script writer and star Scott Shaw obviously imagines himself to be something like a samurai, and throughout the film he performs some very bad stunts and prepares fighting for swords that look massively amateur. Despite all this, his website claims that the film should never be compared with a traditional film, because it really pushes the boundaries of modern filmmaking. My companion stayed silent during all the trials, and despite my frequent attempts to record a video tape, she decided that it could be some Ring-Esquire curse to pass. If you see the video in the stores, take it from me! Leave alone!
