It seems there is a spectrum of cinema. On the left, there are films made mainly for entertainment and / or commercial purposes. In the middle there are films that are both interesting and artistic. On the right, films that are not so commercial, but are more focused on cinema as an art, and not on cinema as a product. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m not here to say that some part of the spectrum is better than any other. But when a movie goes too far, it is rarely good. This is the case with Nakoykatsi. <br /> <br /> I had no idea what to expect when I saw the advertisement. Several friends gathered and asked if I wanted to go together. None of us knew what to expect, and by the end none of us were pleased. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are breathtaking images. Yes, I am amazed at what the directors went in search of archival materials. Yes, the soundtrack is enjoyable to listen to and is probably the best part of the experience. The fact is that it goes so far into the right side of the spectrum, which I mentioned, that I cannot say anything good about the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> This is a sermon. This is a confusion of symbolism and obvious morality. It does not say anything new and does not force the viewer to take a fresh look at life. It simply tells us what we already know (that is, if we can even understand what he is saying). <br /> <br /> This film is just art for the sake of art. Trying to say: "Look at how deep and make us think using montage!"
