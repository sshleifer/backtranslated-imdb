Oh, dear, just what we need, another garbage effort in Essex-Cockney, telling about the growth of the British bully / rave gangster, who, of course, followed the West (East London / Essex style). Didn't anyone tell you that they won the World Cup !? And then, of course, the inevitable decay in the underworld of British rave culture. Blah blah blah. Why, how and who would like to finance such a film, I do not know, but let's pray that it was from private financiers (let's look at former drug dealers, merchant bankers - we all know how to call them, and the rest of the bullying) and not funded state means. I hope that with the recession we will not see this again. If we do that, weâ€™ll call a death chime for British films, and, of course, we can all blame the British number one at Mockney Country, a gentle imitator of gangster Guy Ritchie.
