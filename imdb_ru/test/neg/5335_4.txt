Maureen O'Hara is always beautiful and attractive. Here she plays the terminally ill actress. We do not know with what. It precedes the “Love Story” a bit in this respect. <br /> <br /> William Bendix is ​​as good as most other actors. John Payne must grieve, but he seems to be molestation. The girl who plays the child, whom he and O'Hara are adopting, does her best with the plot invented: of course! Adopt an orphan. She will live after the death of your wife. This is a nice movie, but it does not seem sincere. I was hoping to get me fired. I was the meek performance of O'Hara. But I do not like to feel manipulated.
