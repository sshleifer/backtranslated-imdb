If you want to watch the worst movie ever made, look no further. Some pathetic movies can be watched because they are unintentionally funny. Alas, the American film has no mind at all, no unintended humor, only indecency, which its director considers ridiculous. <br /> <br /> For those who liked this film, I suggest you watch Kevin Smith’s “Clerks” in tone. In Clerks you will find creativity, wit and pleasure - all with a limited budget. This should make you forget about this disgusting effort.
