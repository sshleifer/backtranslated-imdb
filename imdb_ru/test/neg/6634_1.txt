Firstly, this film has the stupidest story from all the films I have ever seen, and, unfortunately, I had to watch it. One day I was looking through the channels and came across this lousy excuse for a movie, and it confirmed what I said for a long time. Carrot top is not an actor and NOT funny in the slightest sense. He behaves as if he is a great comedian, and thinks that he attracts the attention of the audience. Honestly, he has the actor's ability to clown 10-year class, and he believes that less than 10-year-old ability to compare them with Carrot Top will be a serious insult to their good name. This film tries to be fun using boring liners that seem to have been removed from the cartoons of the 50s. By the end I would have done everything to erase the memory of this film, but, unfortunately, the memories remained with me. The only thing I can do is warn others so that they never watch this movie. However, this proves the rumors that the Carrot Top cannot act in vain.
