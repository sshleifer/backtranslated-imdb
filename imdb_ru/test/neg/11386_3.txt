Somehow this documentary about Miles manages to turn on very little music and without full tunes. Although Miles appears in the film, 95% of the interviews are other people, not Miles. There are huge chronological gaps, many aspects of his life (his childhood prodigy, his addiction) are missing or embellished, and you will learn little about what made a person and his contribution to music so revolutionary.
