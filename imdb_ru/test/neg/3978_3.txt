Now I suffer from the Parties, the Terror of Clonus. <br /> <br /> The word “horror” in the title of this film insults the real horror. <br /> <br /> The story was about central cloning belonging to "Man." They grow clones to extract organs from clones, and then for original people in need of transplantation. One clone escapes, the government gets angry and kills all the participants, but the story still leaks. <br /> <br /> It is truly shameful that a film with such potential is being destroyed by amateurs such as Fyvson. The only thing he really managed to do was to embody the concept of human rights and the very philosophical aspect that makes a person human, and is it possible to grow clones for organic harvesting? Unfortunately, mediocre actors were chosen, and the plot left the city, to the very end, where a pathetic attempt is made to sum up. <br /> <br /> but !! What worried me the most was the emergence of new characters that did not have real relevance to the plot. Despite this, Firesson feels the need to kill them as a result of a strong explosion, of which only Sir Coleman Francis could be proud. <br /> <br /> The setting was interesting. As Fyvson thought plastic sheet pulling and running water over them would make a believable river behind me, but I think if you compared the situation with Coleman Francis gray paste oatmeal, this film won. br /> <br /> Perhaps Coleman changed what bad movies are to me. 3/10
