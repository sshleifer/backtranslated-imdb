I have been interested in watching this ever since it was named “The Worst Movie Ever” on a science fiction film recording of the 1950s in a British periodical in the early 1980s called “Cinema” (By the way, Leonard Maltin also awarded this unenviable BOMB rating). When he came out on DVD last year, I became interested in purchasing the Classic Camp kit, which was included (along with QUEEN OF OUTER SPACE [1958] and GIANT BEHEMOTH [1959]); However, since I recently purchased QUEEN on DVD-R, I paid for this idea. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I just stumbled upon a DivX movie - but the print was not selected from the DVD Warners (which is said to boast an amazingly pleasant-looking program), but rather a dirty TV print ... although not enough to get lost details (in other words, it was like watching a movie in sepia, and not in black and white). -White!). In any case, to approach this issue: I have to admit that, in a sense, I was disappointed that the film did not turn out to be the ridiculous festival that I had been expecting all this time (Maltin calls it “ridiculously awful”); in fact, I found it quite attractive - and, fortunately, short, just over an hour. Some incontestably funny bits remain, though - for example, when an old nurse starts shouting at her head at the sight of a 50-foot woman, and when the deputy sheriff almost runs through his main and leading Lady Dvoretskaya in her passion to help in such an unusual case. And while the special effects did not seem to me "one of the funniest" (again, Maltin) in the film, although they are certainly terribly bad! <br /> <br /> So, the idea that an alien (in human form of gigantic size, dressed in the rags of a caveman and radioactive for loading!) arrives on Earth on a large ball (!) spacecraft and, apparently, after how a heroine's necklace is complete nonsense - and its quasi-transparent appearance does not do him any good ... but, in fact, our human history attracts our attention (relatively speaking). The nature of the husband-fander is not very interesting, but his two women: a rich but grumbling alcoholic Allison Hayes and an ambitious Victorian girlfriend, Yvette Vickers. The story also involves Heis’s faithful servant (already mentioned), a couple of policemen (one of them, as noted elsewhere, rather stupid) and as many doctors (one of them is called Dr. Cushing [!] And another specialist who is called when Hayes begins to grow in size after exposure to radiation. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film can be viewed as an inverted female version of the INCREDIBLE CONFIRMATION MAN (1957), although it would be unfair to compare them further, since the classic Jack Arnold / Richard Matheson g much more psychological / intellectual in approach; in fact, Hayes does not seem to care about her “state" and, in fact, uses it to teach her husband a lesson! However, her frenzy is exaggerated in movie posters of the era - rather strange (especially considering that it only happens in the last ten minutes or so), when the damage caused by her huge but extremely unconvincing hand (especially when she lifts the puppet, which should be her husband!) is not shown, she mostly seen to going to a long shot, and almost behind (its size, even inconsistent in relation to buildings), it passes) !! However, the death of Hayes using electric current (when it crashes into an electric cable) is done correctly. <br /> <br /> Finally, I followed this with his 1993 TV remake with Daryl Hannah as a titular creature that I specifically rented. for this.
