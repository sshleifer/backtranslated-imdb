This film was a very boring movie. It was a still story that definitely doesnâ€™t make you think of anything else, other than where all the strong moving stuff that other critics say about the film. The 3 main actors are good, and there are a few laughs, but again this becomes another film, which you continue to watch in the hope that it will become better, but simply not. I watched this movie last night and wanted us not to waste our precious time (while the child is sleeping) to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I plan not to recommend this to my family and friends, and also, obviously, to everyone who wants to rent it. I was almost not impressed with everything about this film.
