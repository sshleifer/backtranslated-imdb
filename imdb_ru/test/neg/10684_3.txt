After the 19th century dual weapons went wrong, a charming young woman becomes a vampire. Not only has she become one of the undead, she uses her gothic, clever personality to maintain her talents as a cold-blooded killer. This is a class B feature that should go straight to the video. Violence is cruel and bloody, but actually quite mild. The storyline is so weak and the dialogues are so unpredictable that it is difficult to arouse great interest. Eileen Daily is the main character of Lilith Silver. Also starring Mark Caven, Kevin Howarth and Isabel Brooke.
