A group of heirs of the mysterious old mansion learns that they must live in it as part of a reservation in a will or lose their inheritance, but soon they will learn from its history all who lived there before they either died in strange incidents or killed each other. <br /> <br /> You have already seen it all before, and this one is too low-budget and slow to be scary, and no real surprises in menopause. No special effects or bloodshed, in fact the only really fun thing in the whole movie is the quality of dubbing in English, which is sometimes as bad as a cheap martial arts movie. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10, pretty low in the pecking order of 80s haunted movies.
