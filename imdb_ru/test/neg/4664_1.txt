Two films: The Fifth Element, Armageddon. Same theme: save the world. The same main actor: Bruce Willis. One difference: “Armageddon” is very inferior to the film Luc Besson. Some impressive special effects do not allow to hide the sophisticated and generally accepted scenario. Several parts of the film show this. I think about the speech of the president and especially about the relationship of Willis with his daughter "Grace". At the beginning of the film, he tends to neglect and overly protect her, and this makes her tired. Then, at the end of the film, true love and understanding shines in it. On the other hand, the film falls into the following trap: Michael Bay takes his topic too seriously. Of course, the film tries to be funny, but the result does not work, since the humor presented in the film is often rough and rather low-level, whereas in the “fifth element” the humor was crazy, involuntary and allowed to lose sight of the serious side of the action. The film suffers from two other obstacles: it often gets funny (Russian astronaut) and almost all the actors are poorly used. Bruce Willis is completely contrary to the nature of his "fifth element". He plays he-man, he is rude and sometimes unbearable. Other actors are hardly credible in their roles, in particular, the sinking team of Willis. It seems that this team is here just for fun. One of them is considered very qualified, but looks like a fool. And poor Liv Tyler! She's at NASA, just to be decorative. <br /> <br /> When the film was released in France in August 1998, Bruce Willis expressed fatigue from saving the world. His fatigue was probably justified by this spectacular, but bad film.
