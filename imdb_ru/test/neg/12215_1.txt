Negative numbers are not available to show how bad this film is! Wooden game in combination with the storyline, which paraphrased dozens of times. Everyone in this movie must attend Overactors Anonymous. You might think that the original story could evolve from a general concept. Young people in the preparatory school are trying to deal with the bombing of Pearl Harbor. This raises interesting questions, but the way they are transmitted makes it more of a joke. Typical characters were present, including a zealous athlete and a nerd (glasses included). I could not be more interested in wooden dialogue and cliches. At the end of the movie I had to throw the DVD into the trash. Stay away from this dirt! You will not get 90 minutes of your life back!
