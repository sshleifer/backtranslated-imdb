"Leatherheads" is trying her best. Tries to be frivolous. Tries to be a comedy. Tries to be a love affair. Let's see, this is an attempt to become the "Friday of his girlfriend" with the help of "Sting" with the help of "It happened one night" with the help of a dozen sports films. Alas, trying to fail, and the film is just as boring as the field of the last game. <br /> <br /> A lover of films will watch the scene of a big fight in a battle between Duluth Bulldogs and some soldiers and understand that the fights that John Ford arranged with such style, enthusiasm and humor in films like Quiet Man The Donovan Reef or The Seekers may have seemed easy, but obviously not. I bet George Clooney thought it would be easy with John Ford too. No matter how hard it is: masculinity dries up, punches, broken bottles above the head, an imperturbable pianist ... just put it on the screen with some kind of music. Sorry. It takes a master to make the battle scenes flow. <br /> <br /> Films do not wish to exist. Humor is hard. Romance is hard. Slapstick is a lost art. <br /> <br /> Once I read that you never wanted to sit too close to a ballet performance. Something about not wanting to stab a fantastic performance bubble, hearing the dancers knock or the grunting of elevators. This film looks like this ... all the tension and good intentions, beautiful actors, pleasant scenery, but it permeates all its steps, and does not jump like the original Galloping Ghost, Red Grange, on which the film is based.
