This well-intentioned film fails, and, unfortunately, in too many areas. <br /> <br /> The landscape is magnificent, with landscapes of north-central Vermont providing the setting for this mid-century story. Quebec Bill is trying to return to his past to save his farm. <br /> <br /> Returning back and forth between scenes of magical realism and direct action, this film rarely reaches the goal. <br /> Chris Kristofferson in the role of Quebec Bill seems rather untidy, otherwise it is his lines; or his cross with accents of yankee and quebeque. In any case, it just looks like a low-key strike. Nevertheless, his conversations with the character Gary Farmer in Coville really shine. William Sanderson's Rat Kinneson is solid. Charlie McDermott shows some real potential, like the young Wild Bill; but his role is not large enough to carry the stage, and he never steals it. Louis Guzman appears on Lake Memphramagog (with an excellent performance by Lake Willoughby) as a monk with a boyish accent: who knows? And then there is Cordelia Bujolda: an oracle like her namesake, she transmits Yoda, uttering lines like “You will marry a Quebec woman!” It’s just too strange and far from so mysterious. <br /> <br /> The end is really hectic. Again a bad mix of magic realism and concrete. And Yoda never gives an answer that we can understand.
