Ram Gopal Verma usually does so-so cookie formula taken from some Hollywood movie. Each of his films after Shiva is in the genre of cookies. Sometimes he makes a really awful movie like this one. <br /> <br /> During the first 55 minutes, we only get acquainted with two characters: a struggling gymnast disguised as an experienced dancer (go!) and an imitator actor trying to get rich in Bollywood. They fall in love, zero becomes a hero, a dancer / gymnast gets a break, gymnastics, anxiety, ordinary grief, more gymnastics, anxiety, song, dance, anxiety, some more gymnastics, more funny gymnastics, and before you know it you sleep soundly. And this is despite the fact that the body is the leading lady-sperm gymnast-sperm dancer. <br /> <br /> But you are not alone !! The editor, the director, the photographer, in fact, the entire cast and crew are asleep throughout the performance. The only difference is that they get paid for what you dozed, while you paid money for this shit, so you lost. Ha, joke on you. Do not feel sorry for yourself, but our poor girl, who daily tones up the sexiest swimsuit and sportswear in her high-rise penthouse. Pooh, if the poor guy gets a break, she is STAR-WINNING ?! <br /> <br /> Antara Mali cannot act. RGV has lost its balls. Abhishek tried his best, but failed. No plot. No story. Nothing. She must have paid RGV generously to do all this nonsense in addition to free gymnastics lessons on his couch. What a super deal. No need for an acting career. <br /> <br /> Such absolute rubbish, of course, can only be “Made in Bollywood”!
