Good idea, undermined by clumsy performances. <br /> <br /> The whole dialogue was incomprehensible due to the level of music / background sound, and this did not help the reviewer. Welsh accents were also not, sometimes quite impenetrable. In the end, I lost the will to live, trying to follow the dialogue. <br /> <br /> This film did not know whether it would be a farce or a black comedy - and they require different approaches. Some of the incidents were so severely laid out that they only deserved a moan, some were so incredible even for this kind of conspiracy that they made the story just not worthwhile to follow. <br /> <br /> Acting was mostly good - although the American just arrived as a clone of the mad scientist "Back to the Future." The little boy was very good. <br /> <br /> I watched it all the time, but God knows why: I can't remember having to laugh once.
