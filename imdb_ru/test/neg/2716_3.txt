Sticky, but slightly exciting comedic videos of the early 90s with the participation of Xena (Sarah Bellemo), the Moon (Tamara Landry) and Soly (Nicole Posey) - three teenagers from space. Xena's parents went on vacation for a couple of days. After some persistent beliefs of her friends, Xena agrees to ride her father’s spaceship. Final result? They end up exhausting gas in space, and crash on planet Beta 45, Earth AKA. Meanwhile, teenagers Dave (Michael Todd Davis) and Jerry (Ken Stedman) came to California to spend the summer with Dave Uncle Bad (Joe Esteves), a beach bum who lives right on the beach. All three meet with our three space girls, who without a scratch left from the accident. Uncle Bad is going to be thrown out of his soon condemned beach area thanks to Sally (Linnae Quigley), who lives right on the mountain and has a relationship with Bad. She is also a bikini tycoon, and is trying to win a bikini design contest worth $ 30,000 ... exactly what Bad would need to repair his property, so the girls decided to try to win a prize for him. And that's all guys. Knowing that their thin paper story was barely enough to sustain a full-length film, the filmmakers show us a scene behind the scenes of endless beach parties in which tons of extras twist their half-naked bodies under the scorching sun. Yes, and let's not forget sex. There are quite a few. Before going further, I need to put this film in context. It was released in 1993, long before the appearance of such soft base labels as Surrender Cinema and Seduction Cinema. Compared to these newer, sharper, more outspoken films, the soft films of the 90s seem a bit softer. When Beach Babes From Beyond first appeared in 1993 at Torchlight Entertainment during the full moon, it was announced as a debut label specializing in films like “Mature Audience”. Needless to say, times have changed. This particular genre of the film has gone from several pair, but short sex scenes and fleeting glimpses of female full frontal nudity to long sex scenes that sometimes threaten to risk entering the sphere of hardcore. Looking at Beach Babes From Beyond again after watching its 93rd release, it’s safe to say that if the same film were to be made today, there would be a hell of more attention on sex scenes and less time spent on the plot and dialogue. As for the sex scenes themselves, they are usually hot and cold. Our three space girls don't waste time getting comfortable with the guys that evening. Thus, each pair gets a soft scene with annoying slow camera work and too dark lighting. They are actually not so terrible, and in some places they are surprisingly graphic, especially the scene between Xena and Jerry, which takes place in a trailer. But the same sex scene, which REALLY leaves a lasting impression and makes you wonder about your overall intensity, comes at the very beginning of the film. Sally attends a topless photo shoot when her three models pose by the pool. All the actresses in this scene are beautiful gorgeous, but Nikki Fritz stands out from all two because of her huge presence. Remember that by this point in her career she has not yet reached the enormous popularity that will soon come. Her posing nude by the pool leads to an unforgettable fantasy episode where she shows her soap body in the bath and then again, leaving the bath. Walking toward the bed in the direction of the almost naked pumped up guy waiting, we get a full naked scene with its almost back end in the shape of a heart and a perfect back. Well, Nikki's back is so muscular that she is going to get a pretty good workout. Nikki spends the next few minutes completely naked with a cool guy in all sorts of different positions in a scene that is completely different than in the other three scenes related to love. No dark lighting or annoying slow movement here ... only two actors in one huge sheet without sheets and covers, which seem to barely act at all at that time. Nikki's enthusiastic body language simply proves that few actresses seem to enjoy filming sex scenes just like her. This is really the only time Beach Babes From Beyond really delivers the goods. But even without this exciting scene, I gently recommend this film for just one fact, that it is quite watchable and never boring, thanks to an incredibly energetic and attractive cast, many of which will appear in various videos in the rest. decades.
