“Many of the films I made would probably work just as well 50 years ago, and that’s just because I have a lot of old values.” - Steven Spielberg <br /> <br /> Some moments. <br /> <br /> 1. Although this film is a free remake of “The guy named Joe”, it is also borrowed from “The Question of Life and Death” and “Wings of Desire”. <br /> <br /> 2. This was Spielberg's second attempt to become Frank Capra. <br /> <br /> 3. Spielberg often said that he wanted to make a "Frank Capra film" in the spirit of "This is a wonderful life" and "Mrs. Smith goes to Washington." Judging by his recent attempts to get a remake of Harvey, it seems that Spielberg is still holding this dream, the director is rightfully not satisfied with his latest 3 projects in Capracorn. <br /> <br /> 4. Critics crushed “Always” at the time, saying that the carefully thought-out action films distract from the film’s novel, but in reality this is not a problem. The problem is that “Always” needs much more special effects to distract us from the fact that Spielberg cannot remove any line of dialogue that does not end with an exclamation mark. <br /> <br /> 5. The film is full of comedy, which simply does not work. Spielberg's comedy tastes are not very sophisticated and seem to be pulled out of the 1950s bolts and Looney Tune cartoons. These exaggerated antics may work in a cartoon universe, but in the film it looks like a strange marriage. <br /> <br /> 6. The leading couple of the film is brother and sister, not lovers. Spielberg’s films always raise concerns about sex and intimacy, but this film goes to extremes: she’s an eccentric and crazy old man. They are more annoying than fascinating. <br /> <br /> 7. The film contains one good scene in which John Goodman argues with Holly Hunter, but for the most part the characters of the film are too annoying. There is no subtlety, every emotion is replayed, every joke is overrated, every sequence is filled with unnecessary employment. <br /> <br /> 8. “Always” and “Hook” taught Spielberg to draw the attention of the audience. After their failure (and the double financial collapse of The Colors of Purple and the Empire of the Sun), Spielberg refused the blunt color cinema of The Colors of Purple and The Empire of the Sun in favor of the more unsaturated black and white worlds from Schindler's list, Munich, Minority Report and Saving Private Ryan. From this point on, “less light” and “dark cinema” were identified with “serious themes.” <br /> <br /> 9. After the financial success of each “dark of the film "Spielberg returns to his color cinematography and again falls on the faces “Amistad” followed “Schindler’s List”, “AI” followed “Ryan”, and “Lincoln” followed “Munich.” These “color” films are always annoying for being too sticky, sentimental, banal and deceptive but the truth is that if you remove the unsaturation, all these "serious" films will look the same. <br /> <br /> 10. Starting in the 1970s, Spielberg tried to separate himself from other directors of brother-packs ( Scorsese, De Palma, Coppola, etc.), Pretending to be "optimist" and "humanist." He himself repeatedly stated this during many interviews in the late 1970s. The reality, however, is that he is probably the biggest sadist of all these directors, the very form of his films often undermines their content, their theatrical performances are always proportional to their dazzling showings of slaughter. <br /> <br /> 11. Spielberg’s inability to connect with any of the “Always” characters, and the pleasure he shows instead for filming forest fires, plane crashes, etc., perfectly captures the rest of his filmography. People running from dinosaurs, sharks, Nazis, tripods, rocks, etc., are what makes Spielberg happy. The moment his heroes stop talking, everything collapses. In other words, a film such as Amistad failed because not enough blacks died and White spoke too much. <br /> <br /> 12. The flying scenes of the film do not correspond to the standard set several years earlier in the Top Gun megahit. Of course, when your “enemy” is a forest fire, it’s hard to make things cinematic. <br /> <br /> 13. Failures, such as “1941”, “Hook”, “Always”, etc., are often more illuminated than the more successful Spielberg films. They reveal a steel frame under the technique. They show what a trip to an amusement park looks like when it is not working, showing a vacuum under broken equipment. <br /> <br /> 5/10 ?? There is one good sequence here (two actors in the room, just improvising), but this is basically a pesky picture with a predictable scenario. <br /> <br /> Worth one viewing.
