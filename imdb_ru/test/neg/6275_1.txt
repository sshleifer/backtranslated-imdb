After watching Steven Spielberg’s version of “War of the Worlds” in cinemas, I was hooked by this topic. I can remember my favorite roles in the film: people evaporate, people panic, fire, explosions - it was all so great ... <br /> <br /> A few weeks later, I went to my video store, and I see the version of "Wars worlds "by David Michael Latt on the shelf. "It couldn't come on a DVD, so fast, could it?" I told myself. I read the back of the case and instead saw K. Thomas Howell. “Oh, I remember him from the Outsiders!” So ​​I thought that this could be an attempt. <br /> <br /> I was wrong, completely wrong. As soon as I looked at the opening credits, looked at how they were taken forever, I realized that something was wrong. Something was going to disappoint me in this film, and it happened. The whole film stank like cheese sauce, which was left in the fridge for 10 years. From action, special effects (silly looking tripod things, when people evaporate, they turn into orange skeletons), and, most importantly, it didn't even come close to being as interesting as Spielberg's version, the story was actually boring, and only 3 scenes of destruction! What the hell? In the end, I was so bored that I had to rewind the movie forward, until I found something that looked even remotely interesting. And there was nothing really. <br /> <br /> My advice: don’t even touch this movie, stay 100 feet away from it. The Spielberg version comes out towards the end of this month, buy it! But please, please, I beg you! Stay away from this shit until he strangled us all!
