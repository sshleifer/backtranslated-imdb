Rutger Hauer helps in the film, which basically can be described for a young person in the category, and obviously this is so, so he needs a lot of help. <br /> <br /> The beginning contains much more promises, a film that can turn into Michael Clayton or Alien than fiction. This is very bad, because I was really hooked on the beginning. Then, as in the intro soundtrack, it evolved from remarkable and intriguing to nowhere. <br /> <br /> This is quite fun, with lots of curiosities and good characters. I am sure that this will be enough for many people. The problem is that all this seems far-fetched and empty, which, ironically, should be the main discovery for the self-realization of the character. Not the film itself (this is not a self-awareness film), but the fact that the character must recognize his own life is invented and empty.
