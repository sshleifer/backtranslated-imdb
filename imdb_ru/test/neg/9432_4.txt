Remarkable half-illuminated respect for expressionist black-and-white films by people like FW Murnau, Fritz Lang, Karl Dreyer, Marcel Karne and others. Allen plays a character who fell into Kafka's nightmare, first thinking that he is part of a group of militants who are trying to catch the killer and slowly realizing that he may be a suspect. The letter is a bit obsessive (this is, after all, Woody Allen, trying to be shy by Kafka), but the meaning has been made, and no harm has been done. The cinematography is interesting, about 100 shades of gray, but be sure to look in a very dark room with a good screen, otherwise the details will be absorbed in the fog. This is a funny little movie with a few laughs that actually snort "aha." The game is good, considering the strange car, and it is worth seeing if you are a big Woody Allen fan. Also of interest to those who understand expressionist films. I would give it 6.5 out of 10.
