I did my best. I really, really tried to think of something that deserves a rating higher than two. The point is not that I do not “understand” - I am a big fan of Asian cinema. The truth is that the film is infantile in its structure, verbose and painfully unrelated. <br /> <br /> I believe that if you are from Alfred Hitchcock’s school of thought “Don't tell them, show them,” then you could try to evaluate this film, but you would still be in difficulty. <br /> <br /> First of all, The Terrorizers tries a stream of consciousness in the style of Jean-Luc Godard and fails in it. Edward Young seems to understand the basics of technology, but he is very inexperienced with this. (He may be recovering with age; I don’t know, because I haven’t tried other Jan films.) The bottom line is that he uses the “show it, don’t say” lack, which in fact only serves to interrupt the procession. stories. Sure, he gets some visually fascinating images, but they do not unify the story, and they do not help make it any better. <br /> <br /> In addition, the basic concept behind the flow of consciousness and “show, do not speak” is that with the right images, the right drama, repetition and close correlation, the viewer can draw his own conclusions; This is not to say that these will be correct conclusions, but they can be changed as the plot develops, and each director should strive for some interaction between this type of audience. In this, Edward Yang is very disappointing. The viewer is constantly on the periphery. There is no reason to attract, there is no reason to consider the characters or their motives, there is no reason for emotional involvement, and in fact, there is no reason to stay alert. <br /> <br /> Finally, Jan is lost in the story he wants to tell, not the story the film itself tells. His art moves in one direction, but, like a big dog that he cannot control, he constantly pulls the lead, trying to return him to the course he needs, and not the one to which he naturally follows. The most egregious example of this is the ending. The end really had to happen at the time of the husband's revelation. The end of the book on which the film focuses (and, accordingly, the possible ending of the film) has already been told to us. If Young decided to finish at this moment, he would have a much more powerful play, leaving the observer in suspense - is the story unfolding, as stated in the book, or is Young's “real world” playing out differently? Ask the viewer to think about it - this is the interaction that Yang painfully needs. Instead, he continues to tell the story he wants to tell, straining a natural conclusion for what? In order to linger on the main character - we didn’t need to superficially know more about her, and Jan wouldn’t feel the need to tell us if he hadn’t turned her into a veneer instead of worrying about making her a more attractive and deep character the beginning. <br /> <br /> Why does Jan prolong and torment his film? To get some more of these "visually exciting images." The film really suffers for it. He wants to finish, he has a conclusion that seems natural and leaves the viewer unsure, but instead Ian pushes. Instead, Yang builds a complicated ending that leads the viewer, forcing him or her to constantly ask, “so what?” The first end, the one Ian ignored, was good. The second ending, well, I thought: “so what, who cares?” Because it's not as if he introduces something that has not yet been put forward in the storyline ... but the last ending? It really was a waste of time. Not only did the “real” end leave me alone, I also felt that it was an insult to what this story could be. Ian sacrificed a potentially good story because of the melancholic and noar conclusion, which he insisted on all the time. <br /> <br /> My last problem with the film has nothing to do with the film itself, but rather with its post-production stage. Subbing (if you see it subbed) is terrible. Long sentences remain for a second or two, while short sentences remain too long. In addition, since Ian quickly changes images, subtitles are removed from the screen. This is one of those rare cases where the subtitles have to remain on the screen, even if the image has changed, because in any case a lot of dialogue does not occur.
