Larry Bishop, a writer / actor / director, focuses too much on camera, music, and visual effects. The film uses meaningless conversations and vulgar monologues that seem to pursue no other goal than the boring and annoying public. The actors experience a bumpy ride, from the beginning of the film to the end, and fall into one terrible smoke screen. To hell with the ride. The film is a bomb. <br /> <br /> The winners are presented as weathered warriors who seek their own form of justice for what they consider to be lawlessness. They are bikers, anti-heroes and main characters. Pistolero, played by Larry Bishop, is a vindictive pack leader. Ghent (Michael Madsen) is trapped in his own crossfire of chaos and psychosis. <br /> <br /> Comanche (Eric Balfour) is loyal, but mysterious. Deuce, played by David Carradine, should have traveled, like ticket buyers (if you decide to watch a movie, you will apologize, but you will understand why). Billy Wings (Vinnie Jones) is an obscene and poisonous character, completely filled with contempt. <br /> <br /> It amazes me how this film, with all its constant jokes and vulgarity, made someone invest in a ride on this absolutely nowhere. Buyers of tickets, take my advice: do not pay for the trip. Please do not make the same mistake as investors. <br /> <br /> The first fifteen minutes of the film are confusing and cannot understand. The dialogue, which quickly turns into meaningless monologues, does not make any sense. The whole movie is obsessed with going nowhere. Poor Dennis Hopper got into a real mess. He too should drive. There are headless heads, throats cut and the struggle of naked women. It is clear that Bishop does not know where he goes with the film. He is completely lost. But by the end of the trip you just do not care. Mom Mia! To stay home. And, of course, do not drive. I rate this film as 1 out of 10, but this film is so terrible that it deserves zero.
