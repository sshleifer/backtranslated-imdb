I have to live this movie, but I do not live. He received international awards, he is foreign (I usually like these films), he moves slowly (again, something I like), and there is no useless sex or violence in it. The problem is that it is boring. We have two friends from the same village in Turkey, one “successful”, the other not. Unlucky arrives in Istanbul to stay successful in trying to get a good job at sea. Both living lives that do not bring satisfaction are meaningless and petty. <br /> <br /> Well, this is not the first time such a film has been shot. I have not seen anything new in this tired topic. There are long options when someone is standing and watching the sea, sitting in a cafe or watching TV. I understand that this kind of thing is there to show the emptiness of their love, while it does what I understood in the first 15 minutes. I don't need to hit him on the head for the remaining two hours. <br /> <br /> Symbols are also a bit stiff. a plate of live fish like a minnow with one of the plates and plops in his death throws. Symbols are best suited when they are not obvious, but are in the background, creating a mood just below the viewer's awareness. <br /> <br /> The film is so apathetic that it does not even rate 1, so I gave it 2. To evaluate 1, you need talent to be bad. There was not so much energy in this movie.
