This film is perfect for any novice screenwriter, actor or director. After watching this film, you will see everything that is wrong with the film industry, as it is today. There are so many clichés that it hurt to watch this movie. Nothing about it is original, and every colloquial line was broken from the clichés we all saw in the 90s. Although it has some cheap laughs, on the whole it is wrong wrong wrong. I was very bored and the film was so predictable and pathetic that I actually noticed how much makeup was smeared on Tara Reid's face to hide these massive bags and wrinkles from her endless parties. Seriously, there was so much foundation on it that you could literally scrape it off and fill a whole bottle. <br /> <br /> What shocked me was that many talented and popular actors subscribed to this play. garbage. And I DON'T know how I sat through that horrible scream that Ashton Kutcher makes, do you know when he is angry or something like that, and he shouts out his words in such an annoying manner? Ashton's terrible "talk", Tara's face is ten shades darker than her neck, an owl with drugs, a script that looked like a three-year-old ... <br /> <br /> Seriously, I haven’t seen a single thing in my life a film that I would watch, but to some extent I did not like it, no matter how bad it was. It deserves a reward for being the first. BAD BAD BAD ... I don’t think there is even one word in the English dictionary that can describe this crappy movie. Today I tried to watch it again, but I had to turn it off after ten minutes because I was about to cry from the overwhelming amount of cliches. <br /> <br /> Don't even bother to shoot this into your blockbuster, it’s not worth a cent, in fact I’m willing to pay anyone who wants to watch this movie so they can do something decent in their lives.
