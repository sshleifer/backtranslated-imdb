Lame really is the best way to describe this movie. He has a very bad script, uninteresting dialogue and characters, and he lacks almost everything else. <br /> <br /> Too many characters, and the problem is that you don’t care about them. What is missing in the film is one good and clear main character. Instead, now in the film there is a bit of everything, there is a hero in it, there is a little love in it and a little villain. I wish there was only a little ghoul in it, because in this film they are mostly very annoying. <br /> <br /> It is assumed that the ghouls are devilish creatures that kill for fun. In this film, however, all they want to do is drink beer and watch naked female students. In addition, someone had a “brilliant” idea so that this time the ghouls could talk. It works really bad and annoying. The ghoul dolls were definitely upgraded for this film, they look more detailed and are able to do more, but at the same time they look much more fake than those that were in previous ghouls movies. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this time the goal of this film was comedy rather than horror. The film is similar to the lame school comedy of the 80s (although this film was released in 1991). This humor is really the worst and lamest thing in the whole movie. It is so incredibly annoying and just not funny at all. <br /> <br /> The story goes nowhere with its plot, and the film is just one big mess that never seems to end. It seems that the story line of Guli has nothing to do with other storylines of the film, which involve human characters. The film is not about the ghouls that terrorize college, when people try to hunt them down and stop their violence. It is not surprising that this is still the only film written by Brent Olson. He simply does not have talent for it, and I think that he also discovered this and instead returned to college. <br /> <br /> Even compared to previous films, Guli; this movie is just awful! <br /> <br /> 2/10
