Although this film received a lot of praise, it seemed boring to me personally. There are some beautiful Brazilian sunsets, and the characters are believable, but the story of how they are interrelated, even if they are very unusual by our standards, is not interesting enough to hold the film for so long. The central woman communicates closely with one man after another and puts the interests of her children first. As tolerance of various people stretches, we see how their characters develop. The story unfolds with dignity and is supported by an excellent acting game. This is a rare look deep into Brazil, far from the city, but hardly spectacular enough to keep your eyes open.
