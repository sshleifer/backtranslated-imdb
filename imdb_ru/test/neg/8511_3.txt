I worked as a photographer in Europe that summer, when Jim Salter shot the film “Three.” <br /> <br /> I made some amazing photos for him, one of which, as I was told, became a poster for the film. I did not see the film until a few years later. I thought it was bad. It is a pity because the elements that went into it were irresistible. Roby Porter's girl was almost as beautiful as Rampling herself. Salter asked if I would remain in the role of an additional operator so that they would not have to shoot everything twice. I said, of course, but I had to return to New York, promising to be back. Alas, I never returned. One of the unsung tunes in life. <br /> <br /> I would like to post pictures taken by me. <br /> <br /> Rowland Sherman
