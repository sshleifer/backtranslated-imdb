... or should I say inadvertently funny? In any case, this is one of the best comedies that I have seen in a long time. I laughed all over the antics of some of the most stupid fictional characters on this side of Homer Simpson. This is just one slap in the face, a painfully stupid scene after another, when clown, dull cardboard cuts replacing real humanoid characters, pushing, pulling and dragging the “plot” to its inevitable and obvious conclusion. <br /> <br /> If I had to describe this movie to someone, I would call it a mutant hybrid “Fatal Attraction”, “Dumb and Dumber” and “Three Puppets”, with “climax”, in a strange way on the episode of "Family Guy", in which the whole family enters into a fight in the living room. <br /> <br /> Advice to the Benson family: the next time you have a new pet, do a favor to the poor animal and DO NOT call him Fred!
