Now you can really call it a movie. I knew that some of the films that the Japanese make are not good for anything other than this bad thing? I mean, com'om I fell asleep three times in this movie. No horror, some tiny percentage (0.2-0.5) of comedy. Action, let's just admit that it is, but the scenes are poorly filmed, the actors are pathetic. None of the actors did a good job in their own role. Were not convincing. The script is terrible too. I mean, this movie can be great, REALLY, but for the 60s (not 100% sure.) I recommend NOT watching it if you don’t want to be so bored as I am. I can't understand how hot this movie got its rating. This is more, more, more than rating. This is a PERSONAL opinion, of course. I do not want to offend anyone, but who might like this crap? Therefore, I hope that this will help someone NOT to lose time, “enjoying” this film. Nevertheless, it is your choice!
