This movie is not so good. He is rather stupid, rather annoying and very poorly made. I really saw this film only because one of my friends said that he hated this film. Although I did not hate him as much as he did. I still found it to be a pretty bad movie. The only thing that is remotely good about it was that it was a little interesting, and I also feel that if it was done a little better, it would be equally good. What I mean by a little better is that if he had been completely redone, and would not have looked as if he had been shot for a film festival, and if the script had been improved, it would have been a good slash film. Instead, this is not what it is now, a crappy movie. The game is terrible, I felt as if I watched a couple of teenagers play, for example, a Halloween show, a trip to a thriller or something like that. The killings are pretty cheap (like the movie itself), and basically everything else is low. In general, this film is really bad, and you will not miss out on anything if you decide to skip this film. <br /> <br /> 3.8 out of 10 stars
