After reading some of the opinions here, I begin to wonder if I watched the same film as other reviewers, but after checking my facts, I have to come to the sad conclusion that I have. <br /> <br /> This Mad chatter comedy should be one of the longest 94 minutes I spent, and one of the most unfriendly things I have seen, for ages. Don't get me wrong, I like comedies, but this boring, set-up fool is so far from dizzying heights, like Preston Sturges and Howards Hawks, that he does not deserve (mix my metaphors) thoughts in one breath with these great ones. The dialogue of the writer / director Charles Martin is neither witty nor subtle nor interesting - and there is so much of it. He also does not know how to finish the scene, with some ruthless haircut, especially people leaving the rooms and saying goodbye to each other, the pace of the film would be raised, and then the fact that a limited number of characters do stupid things and unreasonable things what other reason than this comedy would have been a little less obvious. The characters in this film fall in love and come out of love for each other, and enter the apartment and exit from them, at any time only to move some small story along. In an instant, people desperately yearn for one person, and the next - they marry someone else - courting and going off the screen, so we don’t know anything about it until one of the characters tells us, “Oh, they are getting married! “(usually after someone had committed a fraud or made the wrong conclusion). If we knew that these two characters were in love or should have been engaged earlier, we, the audience, could enjoy watching someone exhibit yourself as a fool in front of them. Because these are just characters who look like selfish, irritable idiots, and we have no sympathy for any of them. <br /> <br /> The sets are limited and the action is limited to them in such a way that everything becomes to look like a poorly filmed performance. The only moments about the relief from boredom is Keenan Wynn, who looks like he wandered from another movie and decided to walk around the room and be a little funnier than all the unfunny things happening around him. <br /> <br /> It is very easy to avoid.
