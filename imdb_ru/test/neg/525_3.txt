Some aspects of this production are good, such as the performances of Angela Lansbury, George Hearn, Chris Grenendal and Sala Mistretta. But am I the only one who is distracted by the terrible play of Betsy Joslin as Joanna? She is terrible! She kills songs with her shrill voice and replays in a role that she clearly does not understand. I also think that the choir is not a snuff. They pull the pace and make the worst facial expressions. In general, I think it is good, but Sweeney Todd can be much more, if everything is done correctly. This product does not match the level required by this material. The live version with George Hearn and Patti LuPone is much better.
