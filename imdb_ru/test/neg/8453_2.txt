It was painful to watch this movie. I understand that indie films do not have the same resources as other popular films. But there are basic elements of filmmaking that you usually stick to. First of all, jumping cuts. In the opening film of 15 minutes. There are frames in which it seems that two separate duplicates of the same frame were edited together. By this I mean that the character will say half the line from one take, and the rest from the other take. Secondly, the dialogue. I understand that many authors seek a very realistic and truthful dialogue for their films. Since this film is very specific to its location, the dialogue should also be pronounced in a specific tone (example: set the film in Boston, but people use West Coast slang with a Chicago accent). Even with this understanding, it is still difficult to trace some of the lines that these actors represent. These are only two of the brightest problems that I encountered in this film. There were several others. I do not want to sound like a stern critic who knows nothing. I have many years of experience in the film industry (more importantly for low-budget indie cinema). I also understand that many directors often have a method of their madness. I could not detect this method used in this film. This makes it difficult when I try to decide whether I view this film as an example of a unique style in film production, or just another low-budget, badly composed film. I sincerely hope that this is not the last. If someone has an understanding of why everything was done in a certain way, or he has any thoughts / views on this film, I would like to hear them. I hope I can better understand this film, and my current opinion can be changed.
