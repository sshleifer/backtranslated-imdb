When this show first came to Disney, I loved to watch it all the time. He quickly became one of my favorite Disney shows, but this show somehow turned into something that caused anxiety and frustration. <br /> <br /> Now I find something funny in the second and third season, they seem to watch some teen shows. I take off this garbage. The first season was very unique because it showed Sadie, who loved science, animals and creatures. The first season was very interesting. I don't like the second season anymore because of Ben. He annoys me and makes me angry. The plot in the second season, too, sucks and just awful
