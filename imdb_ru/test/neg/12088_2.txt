The governess was definitely a very pathetic film. I do not use this word at will, since, to be honest, it was a bad excuse for a film. I finished watching this feature with only one word in my head ?? "What for"? Honestly, you could use this question at the end of each scene of this film, and it would seem that it fits. There were so many inconsistencies that led to a lack of development (both in the plot and in the characters), which ultimately led to a very confusing film with the actors going through the movements instead of giving any explanation. Scenes will occur without foreshadowing, understanding, or striving for completion. As if I looked at several different ideas, combined without any solution. The actors set in motion events that did not seem to fit their character or were actually resolved. That was my biggest problem with this movie. The complete and complete lack of structure in this film led to the fact that all the foundation particles collapsed with a genuine “ripple effect” felt throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Let me explain myself further on this lack of coherence throughout the entire film. I would compare this film with a bowl of lumps of porridge, in which there was a zebra. It made no sense, and there was no logic behind it all. Minnie Driver was the worst culprit of this act. The lines of her character were drawn very blurry and almost transparent. She talked all the time about sex with her sister, but, nevertheless, she was always open to sexual experiences. She has the first moment of passion in this film, and there is no pain or excitement. This happens casually, and it just does not fit into the initial conversation that we had at the beginning of the film with Rosina and her sister. She is a very intelligent woman who accidentally finds a solution to Wilkinson's problem and suddenly wants to get full rights to his invention? It was strange and completely coincidental. Is it not obvious to anyone that her teaching methods did not exist? Anyone in her right mind could see that she did not teach the daughter of Cavendish anything. The sudden and embarrassing relationships that accidentally add up between Driver and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers almost made me laugh out loud. I thought that maybe I discovered some kind of magic in this film, because Rhys Myers literally “fooled” on the stage and suddenly caused some unnecessary drama. There was a feeling that the director (or writer) thought that the original story does not move fast anywhere, therefore, by adding this random character, we can slightly advance the plot (or confuse smaller movie lovers). Well, it did not deceive me; I saw that he was a cut-and-paste character used to reinforce an already weakened story. Don't make me start with a finale that didn't fit the rest of the story. Again using the cut-and-paste method, the author of this film needed a way to simply finish the story, and this was the only solution they could come to. Is it sad when actors are forced to do things from character ?? but I think this is the name of the game in Hollywood. Correct until it breaks completely or at least is not saved. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story was a flimsy drop. Perhaps there were a few moments of elegant cinema, when you could see that there was one piece of creativity trying to reach the maximum in combination with a few bars of decent, historical music, but nothing to write to my grandmother. A larger family structure with some stronger introductions could further enhance this film, but, as I said, leaving open scenes just lying around the entire film, you will get a crack at its core. What may seem like a strong story will eventually wear out, and by the end of this film I felt the house collapse on me. Wilkinson plays himself normally in this film, while the Driver, apparently, did not want to undress, but everyone else also had a desire (I will need to see a doctor after these images burn in my eyes). In addition, she wore the same dress every day. It was disgusting, and I could smell her on TV. Sex and dirty laundry. Now there is a great movie for you! There seemed to be some potential here, but instead it was just rubbish. Nothing was answered, questions seemed to fall like snow in Alaska, and mediocrity seemed to reign. <br /> <br /> In general, it could be a decent film that combined powerful themes of science and love, but instead it was just a shame. I can not emphasize the alarming fact that the characters passed through the movement without any prior explanation. I don’t need the cinematic moments that were passed on to me as a child, but something had to be done to lay the foundation. Just remember the zebra porridge that I used. If you were just as embarrassed as I was, then would you fully understand the film Governess, and if you prefer zebras to your oatmeal ?? then maybe this movie is for you! <br /> <br /> Rating: * of *****
