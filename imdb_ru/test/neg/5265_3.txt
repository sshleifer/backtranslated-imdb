The “ordinary decent criminal” is sad because he is clearly trying to succeed and equally clearly has no chance of doing so, apparently due to the lack of a clear sense of purpose. Poor failure in the Irish comedy Droll with Spacey as a thief who likes to outwit the police, and his competition becomes a kind of folk hero in his own mind, this film turns out to be slightly funny when he tries to be funny, a little more boring when he tries to be interesting and forgets about sentimental, sharp or cute, although it removes these qualities. “An ordinary decent criminal” has a clumsy scenario, a naive guide, an apprentice, a fine story, a bad cast, a mediocre game, and ultimately gets lost by itself and sinks into a bunch of hopeless mediocrity. Go through this. (D)
