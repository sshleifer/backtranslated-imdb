I felt that the movie "Scammen", filmed by Ingmar Bergman, was very dry. It shows what people will do to survive a war, and the shame that arises from these actions; however, I feel that it was not complete or holding attention. He never completely got into the plot or deep into the nature of the emotions or the reasons behind their actions. The only thing I found in the film is the transformation of two main characters, Jan and Eva. Many times during the film, only two main characters sat idle or fulfilled their daily duties and did not even speak. I understand that this was to show the reality of these people, but I feel that there are other ways to show reality and entertain it. I think Ingmar Bergman could make this movie in a more exciting way.
