So, we find it funny that this woman travels to the jungle - to the war zone - just to find out why her bride did not go to Switzerland? Or should we take this seriously? It's not even funny, clever or entertaining - it's silly, like a movie. The main actress is one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen in a movie - even worse than Jar Jar Binks. Dialogue tries very hard to be funny (almost all the time), but this does not happen. The number of funny jokes is somewhere between zero and nothing. As for the conspiracy - did they even once bothered to explain to us what the rebels are fighting for (except that they are anti-government)? I guess it didnâ€™t matter to anyone - neither for the rebels, nor for the characters who just flew blindly to the battlefield. Do not waste your time. Coronado is not funny and not entertaining.
