There was a time when the series “Aliens” was a success even with the third release of “Alien”, which promised under the guidance of the guild of the new and young David Fincher. The first Predator was box office hit, mainly due to its history, "at the peak" of the star Arnold Schwarzenegger and director John Mactirnan (Die Hard). Films "Alien", "Aliens", "Alien 3" and "Predator" were very successful and caused great popularity among fans of cinema and fiction. Perhaps Predator 2 and Alien Resurrection should have signaled the end of both franchises, but the studios were unconscious and saw an opportunity to pander to the rumors among fans and merge them. Join Paul W. Anderson, "Alien vs. Predator," and now to the Strauss brothers (graduates of visual effects, not even directors or writers). The problem was that by allowing such a profound and revolutionary sci-fi genre to fall into the hands, first of all, of a mediocre director, and now a novice director, he led only to profanity embodied in incompetence. After the fans of Alien Vs Predator Requiem (AVPR) felt nauseous, this series could have something worse. <br /> <br /> One of the examples of the cinematic deterioration of this franchise is the first scene. and can cause nausea in fans. The film begins with the fact that Alien sneaks onto the Predators ship, jumping out of the chest of predators, turning into an adult Predalien and knocking down the Predators ship (which now seems to have far fewer Predators than at the end of Alien Vs Predator) still in the atmosphere of the earth. As soon as the ship crashed, AVPR quickly resorts to low-cost plot techniques and basic narrative conventions; it does not risk using any raisins or disruptive actions that were raised in the two original films. The exhausting plot develops at a tedious pace, accentuated only by the almost close conflicts of Alien and Predator, and when it risks us exhausting, we turn to either a charming blonde in a bikini or a quick shot. AVPR suffers from an infinite number of continuity errors and gaps in the plot with little or no clarification, i.e. Members of the public outwit the elite military unit or Predator who does not comply with the laws established in previous editions. This is a film that completely ignores its predecessors, it violates some of the most fundamental rules of the sequel, and it also seems that it is trying to set itself up as a separate function. Independently in the film there is no heart, no conviction, no soul, and in relation to other films there is not enough even the most elementary continuity. This is illustrated by the excessive narration of the film, as it undermines the basic premise of the first alien. Because, if the species had met before, then those who were in the first movie about aliens would be more experienced and not so poorly prepared when faced with them. <br /> <br /> On a cinematic note, the film is about to be terrible, in some places I felt the urge to light a torch on the screen, the lighting was so bad. Using such gloomy and gloomy effects, can viewers feel that they were deceived because of some kind of action? which is ironically his goal, and also indicates the lack of budget films. As is the case with all science fiction, one scene usually looks the most memorable, in this case it is probably the impregnation scene in the hospital, as it relies very unreliably on the themes of the original alien, literally translating it. The direction is bad, the performances are weak, the script is rotten. AVPR is a product of a conveyor system for film production, in which ideas and methods are collected by inefficient people, and then the finished product is distributed to cinemas. Is it personified by the absence of bloody scenes of death and protracted bloody battles, because certification will not allow this ?? lower certification to reach a larger target audience. AVPR was a purely commercial enterprise and nothing more.
