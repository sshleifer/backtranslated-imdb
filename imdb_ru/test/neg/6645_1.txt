I would not recommend this movie. Even though it is rated G and clearly for children, there are many curses (including the scary words "F" and "S"). This type of language does not offend me especially, but in the children's film? Come on. <br /> <br /> Between one of the early youthful male characters and any ready-made adult woman who was together, including a prostitute! <br /> <br /> In this movie genre, acting was as good as in the movie, but the storyline was very very stupid, and even my four-year-old child noticed that it was “stupid. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that with Elizabeth Shue, this film is definitely not worth checking out if you haven’t seen it yet.
