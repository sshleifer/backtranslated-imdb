Using the “astral projection” (wandering soul) to exist outside the body, resulting in a terrible death (crushing the insides of the victims, leading to a broken spine and torn organs) for those who are close to those who have this ability, is the threat EVIL, giving Karen Black (... as Janus) another "unique" character with whom you can fool around like a woman who affects the commercial director, Paul Sharpe (Winston Rekert), tired of her declining marriage and boring career. In fact, she is dying and needs his body, her spirit is potentially harmful to his wife and son (.. his son has a “special friend” who tells him about things, even poisoning herself at some point). Detective Kaufman (John Nowak), investigating unusual murders in respect of the killed by a benevolent spirit, connects Paul with death and through him reveals Janus. Soon both of them realize that Janus needs to be stopped, or she will simply move to another person. What Paul doesn’t know is that his new secretary is a lover of Janus, both of whom were actually older intellectuals, shown in his documentary film on the astral projection The Strange Soul. <br /> <br /> Directed by George Michalka (My Bloody Valentine), of course, creates a strange atmosphere with this film, which contains a rather bizarre premise. It seems that the boy Paula can see how the spirit moves in the form of a “blue man”, manipulating the child in disorderly behavior. Blacks, despite the stellar appeal, rarely shoot closely, taking advantage of their face, which can cause evil evil, which requires its character. Instead, she is fired from afar, her voice is duplicated, and she never confirmed herself with the proper threat, which, in my opinion, is a missed opportunity. For some reason, despite the intriguing (... if strange) idea of ​​astral projection, forcing the spirit to kill people from within, the film is simply never removed. The soundtrack is very "yanni-ish" and the lighting (.. and sound), while at times it is whimsical and effective, often quite dark. The tempo is also a problem as the plot unfolds. The cast is rather weak, especially Rekert is in the lead, his performance is unstable at best. It does not help that there are several characters (... except for Paul's wife) that we could care less about, and what really hurts is that Paul himself is not the most attractive person in the world ... he can be quite difficult and capricious, his unsatisfied career reason for such behavior. Black was supposed to be a more prominent figure in the film, but still remains mostly in the background, which was discussed in the dialogue between Paul and Kaufman, but rarely does she get the opportunity to amuse us with her story, which is a shame.
