There are many other comments about how poor this film is. What I wanted to point out is how this film took the biggest science project in history and made it look small. The Manhattan project was an incredible achievement, and it was huge. Almost all the silver in the country went to the manufacture of wire for electromagnetic separators. If each had a choice between two alternative ways, they simply did both. The first supported nuclear reactor was launched under the stands of the University of Chicago football stadium, and graduate students used axes as a melee mechanism. It's a fascinating story involving hundreds of places and thousands of people, and this film seems to be reduced to a small group of eccentrics in New Mexico. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I really didnâ€™t like was a huge moral debate if we should continue the project after the surrender of Germany. Well, we have thousands (mostly) men who have worked for years to make a really big boom. Does anyone think they don't want it to work? At that time there was some controversy about whether we should use this device, but it was not so serious, obviously, it was not the huge controversy that this film intends to make.
