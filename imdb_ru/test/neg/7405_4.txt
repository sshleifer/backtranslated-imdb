Since I'm a fan of hospital and medical shows, I found this exciting and sometimes funny (especially the scenes with Dr. Whitman), which brings a slight relief. However, I was looking forward to the last episode, because I expected the bad ones to be punished, and the good ones restored. Instead, the hospital management makes itself still fools in an incredible way, and it gets worse and worse for the good ones. You can't help but wonder what the trade unions are doing, or Rob, Donna and Maria do not know what the trade unions are for? In addition, never see the outside, trees, grass, sunlight a bit depressing. Has anyone understood what the last words were? that is, Rob Lake's answer to Mrs. Strawberry's children's question: “Why are you telling us all this?” It was very unpleasant that I could not understand it.
