If I only read the review of Alex Sander (sic) here, and did not look at the rating of more than 6 from the selected ignorant public, I would not have seen this desecration. The stranger was fantastic, dramatic and well-made horror / fantasy. The predator was a great sci-fi action movie. I am really guilty only in the fact that I saw “Alien vs. Predator”. He also has an average rating of more than 6 stars from film lovers who frequent this site. <br /> <br /> Enough to read now, if you have any fear of this, when the plot fell for you, ruined for you. /> <br /> From the very beginning this film was funny. No explanation was given about the fact that the Predators ship was captured by aliens. Well, maybe they were going to throw the aliens back to Earth again to hunt them, and something went wrong, but how did this lead to the Alien / Predator hybrid and why didn't the rest of the team understand before, despite their great technology? The beginning was actually the most connected and interesting part of the film, because we had some idea of ​​who is who or what is what and maybe why. Since then it becomes really funny. I always leave my disbelief strictly suspended above the screen door in front of the entrance and collect it at the exit. I could not here. <br /> <br /> Father and son hunt in the forest. The damaged ship was wrecked (from the presented review), I would have calculated at a distance of at least 10 miles through a dense forest. A man and a boy track down one there, find a ship and embrace. Even at this moment, you feel a little feeling for them, mainly due to the fact that the people hugging the face are almost not ridiculous in their movements and actions, but rather scary, and the father seems such an irresponsible stupid jerk. <br /> <br /> Sharp, a thriller-like scenario begins with a former prisoner returning to a city near the crash site to meet his somewhat unemotional, boring now police friend from the bus. When I say "introduced", I mean a weak attempt with shitty actors, and not a single feeling ends. The slasher / horror element is introduced with the sexy girl and the usual, supposedly boring or some undesirable cute guy who is beaten by an overly protective, crazy, nasty type of Jock (American athlete, not a Scot). Oh, dear / not dear boy, by the way, the brother of a former fraudster. Yes, they are smart brothers, directors, whose name I will explore to avoid any other shit that they will release again. Then the modern reversal of roles, about such a boring attempt on the PC, familiarity with the characters of Ripley begins with the fact that a female soldier returns home to her husband and child. <br /> <br /> Guess what will happen next? I will not tell you more about the real (sadly smiles to myself about the demise of the narrative in the vast majority of recent films) the story in case you have come this far and not the brightest star in the alien universe. <br /> <br /> Predator is stupid for the reasons stated by the previous poster, the post of which I read too late. Foreigners are boring. Alien Predator is funny. The action is sometimes exploitative, causeless, disgusting nonsense. Hospital scene with pregnant moms?!?! Oh, I was shocked well. Shocked by how low some people will go to get what? Scare? Some shock? Titanate a pervert? What kind? If you really wanted to shock, tease and scare people who are not pregnant or do not expect fathers or have no soul, why not just force an alien / predator to fuck defiant women and teenage girls instead of killing them? Heroes have no depth, and the plot has no. This is filmed and went bad. It acts unselfish people not that I can blame them. It also casts a shadow on two rather interesting and good sets of sci-fi characters. This film was rubbish, and if you enjoy it, I really have to worry about you. If you have not yet seen this, then please make your own decision. <br /> <br /> PS I didn’t even mention how all the trained soldiers are killed in about 20 seconds while amateur civilians survive everywhere?
