Let me preface by stating that I have lived in Louisville, Kentucky, all my life. I grew up about half a mile from Waverly. In winter, we rolled our sled on the Maryman road and crossed the Dixie Highway to go sledding on Waverly Hill. Many times during the winter of 76-77 we climbed into the tunnel to keep warm. At that time, this place was still managed as a “geriatric center”. We would go all the way through the tunnel up the hill to knock on what we thought was the “Door to the Morgue”. I have to be honest. The only sensation we felt was that we were getting away with something that we should not do. I would say that we went through this tunnel more than 50 times during the winter. Nothing more strange than adolescent boys who behave foolishly happened. I like the fact that it attracts attention after all these years. One evening, when I was small, we looked out on our porch, and it turned out that the whole hill was burning. On the hill was an old hospital that burned down. He burned for hours, while the whole area sat outside and watched. What is lost in Waverly is that many people there experienced tuberculosis. Let's face it ?? The doctors then did everything they thought was right to save people. People worked there very courageously, knowing how contagious tuberculosis is contagious. Too much focused on those who suffered. I also entered the building several times in the early 1970s. We visited closed retirement homes through a church youth group. By the way, the doors there were not prison, like steel doors with chains and locks, as depicted in the film. They were wooden and open, sometimes too open. It smelled of urine and feces, and you saw a random open dress associated with patients with dementia. It was true that it was closed by the state in the early 80s. Much of this may be related to the age of the building, or the right guy was not paid. This is Kentucky. The part of the documentary that most distracted me was the jumble of bodies in a cart. If I am not mistaken, it looks like these were frames of the Holocaust. This has been added for dramatic effect. It left me with a sour taste in the mouth for the director. I am a skeptic when it comes to Ghosts. I believe that many here really think that the place where they will be pursued. However, Waverly symbolized for me a fun adventure spot for a boy with a sled.
