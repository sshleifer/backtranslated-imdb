I like all types of movies, so these are not romantic movies from a guy who loves only the Matrix, etc. Etc. <br /> <br /> I just felt like a lousy movie. I do not feel that the characters were enough to fall in love. They were there for several days and, in dealing with a severe hurricane and serious problems in each of their lives, Richard Gere and Diane Lane hopelessly and helplessly fall in love ?? This is not real. This film did not make me buy it and feel it emotionally, and this is what you are looking for in a good storyline. Some emotional connection. If someone can relate to the fact that falling in love so quickly, without any true substance, then so be it. You are wrong or wrong. Different strokes for different people. <br /> <br /> Another incredible part of the film is Diane Lane's very rough teenage daughter, who became kind and responsive at the end of the film. Is a teenage girl who is so unhappy and offended at her mother due to the fact that she did not return with her cheating husband is going to just turn on the switch and be cute? This film, in a nutshell, had several big names, but for me it was a big disappointment.
