Honestly, on the issue of the death penalty, I could accept or leave it. The problem that I faced in this documentary film is that it is a full-fledged love feast for the killer, with absolutely no sympathy for the family. The execution of Wanda Jin, with her completely one-sided look, only reinforced my opinion that she should have been executed for her crimes. He tried to argue that she was mentally retarded, but nothing in the video supported this view. She seemed uneducated, like her whole family, but that does not mean that they were all backward. I can fully understand if someone is against the death penalty, but completely ignore the crime, as if it did not happen, and try to put Wanda on some moral top, is inherently offensive, and this is not the side of the problem that I will be bound.
