The best I can say about the American version is that Jane Turner and Gene Reilly had to spend money on this nonsense. Yes, American plagiarism was shown for two episodes in Australia, but was not evaluated; probably curious onlookers who wondered how bad it would be. Answer: COMPLETED, a complete waste of time. The actors are relatively unknown, and they do not readily accept the nuances of the Australian script. No luck to them because they are doomed to plunge with this turkey. My advice to viewers from the USA: DO NOT. <br /> <br /> Americans are best advised to find the DVDs of the ORIGINAL VERSION on eBay, but keep in mind that some DVDs have a “zone” format different from those released. in USA. Otherwise, some DVD players will work with discs from both / all zones.
