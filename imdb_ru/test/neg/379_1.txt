If you are ever in the mood for a truly horrible movie, it would be hard to find something that could even compare with that. I spent a lot of time watching a lot of horrible movies just for the sheer joy I get, and, man, this is one of the worst. This film was so bad that I had to buy a third Beastermaster online. It was not so bad, and it is surprising, since it was right on the video. This is one of those films that is difficult to understand how it was made in the first place. I mean, someone had to actually read the script (or many scripts, I'm sure they made several drafts) and said, “Yes, that's all. Here is some money. ” In fact, they probably just wanted to make Beastmaster 2 even before they had a script, and then went with what they had. Ack, it's terrible. So, if you're a fan of really bad movies, watch this one. This is a real classic, and the film does not get much worse than this. And if that happens, please let me know.
