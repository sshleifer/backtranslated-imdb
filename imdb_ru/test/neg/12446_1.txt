Wow, this film is really sucked below the usual scale of boring, boring and unimaginable films that I recently saw. The game was bad and robotic. The story was so frank that one could sum it up with a simple 5-minute short story. The audio was so bad and dirty that it was hard to even listen; maybe it was unedited from the camera from which it was filmed? I'm not sure which movie was commented on by 3 glowing reviewers, but it was not this movie. Perhaps the director had a hand in seeing that his film received a good review, at least before real reviews began to appear. <br /> <br /> Save your time, otherwise you will just waste time and money on this film. Absolute sucking!
