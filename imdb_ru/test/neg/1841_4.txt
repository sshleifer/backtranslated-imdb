You have to disagree with people who say that this is a lousy horror film with good acting and cinematography - I would say that this is a normal horror movie, ruined by a shockingly horrible game and bad cinematography - watch Ju-on: The Grudge to spend time for this trash. The main idea of ​​the film is quite original, given the abundance of horror stories based on killer dolls that have been imposed on us for many years; unfortunately, the story has been worked out with all the subtlety of the last Michael Bay fighter, with a set of characters that are equally unattractive and played with impeccably high accuracy by the actors allegedly filmed from the daytime Korean TV series. It's not scary, and only calms your expectations from the next Korean horror film. Well.
