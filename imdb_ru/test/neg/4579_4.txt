Enough talent and sincerity was invested in this film, and I would like it to turn out better. Everyone is obviously trying to be faithful to an intriguing premise, but this is too deep a vision, too complicated an attempt to unravel mental delusion to survive the transition to the screen. This is an attempt to catch the dimension of spider patterns on celluloid - the result is tangled and slow. I give 10 for the effort, but 5 for the whole.
