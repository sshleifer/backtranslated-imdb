I saw this film quite recently and said to myself: “This film is bad!” William Shatner is an excellent actor, but he is not a director! <br /> <br /> The point is not only that the acting is bad, it is terrible. And instead of a plot, we have a very bad storyline, which is called a plot! What I really thought was bad was at the beginning when Kirk and McCoy taught Spock how to sing “Jets, Row, row your boat!” <br /> <br /> Do I have something against William Shatner? I will not. But when it comes to the director, he sucks! This film is not one of the worst films I have ever seen. But this is the worst of the Star Trek series! <br /> <br /> I noticed that after this Shatner did not return to directing another movie in the series. Obviously, they did not want him to make another film again after this happened! <br /> <br /> In general, this film sucks! <br /> <br /> 2/10
