I am amazed that many people find this film even close to good. Let me make it clear that I’m a huge Hitchcock fan and tried my best to make as many of his films as possible on video, but this one I felt was so low not only for Hitch films - damn it, I’m too cute here. This picture really sucks. I don't care that Hitch did the service of a very talented Carol Lombard, but I saw the sitcoms of the 50s with more intelligence and style than with this boring turkey. Chemistry between Lombard and Robert Montgomery? She likes mashed potatoes and ice cream, but I wouldn’t want to try them together. I have seen better chemistry in highway spills than here. <br /> <br /> If you really love Hitchcock, avoid this movie and watch any of his best. Because he shouted loudly, the bits that Hitch did in the old TV show were funnier than all that this film fails miserably.
