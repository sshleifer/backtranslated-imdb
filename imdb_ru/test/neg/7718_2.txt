The terrible, boring sequel of the zombies is only slightly better than the terrible first movie of Uwe. It consists of a group of soldiers going to a zombie hospital campus to find a certain type of blood that can help in finding a cure for the infection. These soldiers are your typical slaves for slaughter, and none of them is so tight (or at least not very interesting), so you do not feel sadness in your stomach when they are thrown away. The film has typical zombies biting people and splashing blood. He even has the same thing that chew on guts. It just does nothing for the zombie genre to give it a memory. And the culmination of the story is quite anti-climatic and ridiculous. One wonders how two people can plunge into the army of zombies and not get a piece (because they are the main stars who seem to always manage the escape), while the others seem to get a little easier. The only motivation of the film is to show people that they get a little ... nothing more. Just watch Romero's movie for a lasting effect.
