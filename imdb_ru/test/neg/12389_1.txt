I am embarrassed by the fact that in an era when the satisfaction and fulfillment of spirituality is unknown, we are all scattered around the full range of possible beliefs that a charlatan and a deceiver of Gurdjieff’s caliber (he is an exceptional person as a charlatan; he abused him, although due to the strengthening of his wounded ego, feeding on the flattery of unwary sheep, which were his call and call and awe before him, can cause such extreme commitment and gullibility. This film presents an idealized version of Gurdjieff’s own largely fictional and fiction story about his formation and “awakening” (which I would rather describe as his discovery of how much he could affect the mind and will of some types of sadly disoriented people). Look, if you dare to have an unpleasant eye opening about how sadly we lack true religious leaders, so much so that a clown, such as Gurdjieff, could inspire such devotion - and be careful to have blood pressure medicine at hand, if you are one of those who still hope that a healthy religion will come out of the ruins of Christianity, as the highest example of cinematography in the whole service of the premises and the claims of dysfunctional worship.
