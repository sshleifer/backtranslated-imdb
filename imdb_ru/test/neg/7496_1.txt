I was ready for a crouching tiger style movie, and all I got was the worst movie I've seen in recent years. It was almost as bad as Baron von Munhuazen. Dead script. Dead game Dead all. <br /> <br /> Of course, there were some good fight scenes, but the positive side ends there. If this movie arrives at your home, start shouting on the phone, dial 911 and say: “Please help, there is a movie in my house designed to make people commit suicide”
