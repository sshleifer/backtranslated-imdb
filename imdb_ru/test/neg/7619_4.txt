I first saw this movie on Friday on NBC 11-29-02. It was a pretty good movie, but I don’t think it would have been a Muppet movie that Jim Henson would make. I mean, firstly, Pepe, from time to time using the word "sexy", and Pepe says: "It will suck?" And I know for sure that Jim Henson would not let Kermit scream "I WISH THAT I NEVER NOT BORN! " thirteen times a minute. This movie just does not look like the classic movie Muppets. Of course, I can understand that Nicky Holiday is stealing a baseball diamond from “The Great Trap,” but a business woman is cheating on dolls in a contract for the theater to turn it into a smoker’s nightclub. If Jim Henson were here today, he would hate this movie!
