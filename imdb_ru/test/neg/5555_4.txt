Some may recall seeing the film “Juno” as a scene in which Ellen Page praises “Suspiriya” Dario Argento, her favorite horror film. Then Jason Bateman's character asks if she has ever seen the Herschel Gordon Lewis film, and, moreover, he has a copy of the film (I forgot which one), and shows it to her. At the time when I saw Juno, I saw Suspiria and several Argento films, but not Lewis. Now I can see that this is not just another Diablo Cody pop culture “in” the links, but something that is actually an indicator of the tastes of the characters and, perhaps more subjectively, how to judge them based on their tastes. In other words, Herschel Gordon Lewis's reputation is preserved many years after he finished filming his blood films - and this is Shlok-Meister, no more. In fact, less. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to take Argento as a basis for comparison, because both filmmakers are suitable, at least in the case of the “Gore Gore Girls” and, well, in general, with any Argento picture, similar material, Where Argento is extremely knowledgeable about his craft, capturing an audience of small stories through camera movement, music and style, Lewis chooses the easy way to get to the audience using an immature script. and (to put it mildly) dim direction. The Gore Gore Girls talks about a director who is not interested in entertaining his audience as irresistibly as a horror movie, but as a side show or brothel. He may not be direct actors worth a pancake, he lights, like this is a porn movie, and for everyone, perhaps a clever or funny one liner, there are ten who either completely stink or overdone or are not smart enough. <Br /> <br /> In this case, perhaps, as the best informative thing that can be said about the Gore Gore girls, the mysterious film about the detective story (the second cool guy of Sherlock Holmes, played by the somewhat funny Frank Kress) and the newspaper reporter ( Amy Farrell's doll)) an investigation into the killings of go-go dancers is that it serves as a template for countless Troma-style photos. Perhaps this is weak praise, however, and the best thing that can truly be said is that Henny Youngman - “Take my wife, please!” - takes a few scenes and steals each of them without trying to do much. This is sad because it can be a picture that can entertain at a terribly bad level. But even on this point one can laugh more because of embarrassment in the production, some actors (that is, because of the guy who plays the policeman, my God) than because of the pleasure associated with the feeling of guilt. <br /> <br /> Even blood itself is a kind of disappointment. At first, someone thinks that Lewis, at least, is up to the task, showing the murder of these women in crazy, vicious and exaggerated ways. But with the killings, it all goes on longer than necessary; I do not mean it in terms of the value of shock, for that, everything is in order. But there must be something else to really make him “stick”, that showing female faces and dissecting eyes is good if you are 12 years old and you see it as one of your first “horror films”. It becomes, I dare say, boring. Dangerously boring for such a "bold" so-called film. <br /> <br /> This was the last film of Lewis, until 30 years later, a seemingly worthy swan song came out with a continuation of the film he had made earlier, pulled him out of his way out of the cinema and writing books about how to do it in business. However, whatever experience he approached this, he does not show. This is not a failure, but it could be, and it's just ... damn. Take it or leave it.
