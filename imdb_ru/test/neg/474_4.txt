I like the movies B. I think Bruce Campbell is a very watchable actor. I like the way he delivers his lines. "Evil Dead 2" and "Army of Darkness" were great movies. I liked Running Time. However, I do not know if I will watch this film again ... and I bought it. Now, after these words, I am sure that traces of comments and special features will be worthy of attention! This movie has too many holes for me to really enjoy, even as a cheap movie. First, Ted Raymi was annoying, just annoyed. There was nothing in his poorly acting / written character that would not have been better a thousand times. Direction, unfortunately, was at a low level, and the choice of some shots ... yes. I don't expect Woody Allen or James Cameron here, but Campbell has failed. <br /> <br /> I didn’t think it would be an Oscar film like Annie Hall, but still I’m disappointed. I would be happy with Mallrats or the Rhino Brothers. I got a lot less. By the end of the film there were no scenes that appeared in me, no dialogue that resonated in me. Even in the "Hostel" was a classic line for God! I do not recommend this movie.
