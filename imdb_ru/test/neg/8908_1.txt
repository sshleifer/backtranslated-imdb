What the fuck is in this movie. The script just doesn't exist. Sometimes the movie seems like a music video. But this may not even be the case, since the soundtrack is not really the same. Pathetic way to combine action and rap. Some might think that this is a recipe for a successful film ... here it fails. The conversations in this film just killed me. The scene where Harlan is being interrogated by a policeman is just pathetic. Generally speaking, the latest Seagals films can hardly be watched. What the hell happened to a guy? I know he is old, but can't he make Hollywood give up a decent script or something like that? Does he run out of dough for his shoots to India, that he takes on all that he serves?
