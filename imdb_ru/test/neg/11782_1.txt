My website (www.theflickguy.org) considers this movie to be the worst movie of all time. Here is an excerpt: <br /> <br /> “If I were tied to a chair and forced to watch this movie again and again, I could not imagine that hell is even worse. Jim Varney plays the three-handed crazy guy, seeking to destroy the world (apparently, starting with the movie). Now let's face it, no one expects much from Varney’s movie, but this tormenting chatter made me boil for 92 minutes. It is not kamp or gitchy, it is not even meaningless. This evil. Do not rent it, it can destroy your DVD player. Don't even buy VHS from a 29 cent bin for use as a blank tape. This is the worst movie of all time. Period. I mean. Really. "
