The maximum risk is quite amazing for a man who has seen more than one of his films. Directed by Ringo Lam, he shot a regular action movie that can be compared to most other medium-quality action movies, which is a special predicate of the Muscles from Brussels movie. He has a rather stylish style, an interesting atmosphere and, equally important, beautiful Natasha Henstridge. Even VanDamme doesn't make you cry because of his game, he does a relatively good job. Of course, you can't compare Maximum Risk (oh, what a creative title!) With “Ronin”, but after watching “Knock off” this is a damn good movie ... in special standards, of course.
