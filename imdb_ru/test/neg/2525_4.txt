I worked for the company that originally released this film, Vestron Pictures. Vestron had the same problem as many small independent film companies, they did not have a lot of money to invest in the production of their films. Not one money will buy you a good movie. For example, take a look at Kevin Costner's Waterworld. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, if you have a talented person involved in the acquisition or development, you can create your own new talent. But in Westron there was no such person, and they always saved in some important area. In this case, it was about the director and writer. Because of this, it is quite difficult to get a decent movie, even with the great cast that is in this movie. <br /> <br /> I think the basic premise of this film was “Let's place a bunch of weird characters in the room and see if something interesting happens. This is an intriguing idea, but it is not worth looking at. <br /> <br /> Most Westron films end up looking very distinct. My wife and I developed the ability to define this quality even in non-Westron films. Many times we could even determine this quality by viewing only a trailer or a television advertisement. We sat there, watched a trailer or commercial, and then turned to everyone, and almost synchronously we said: “Now this is Westron’s film!” This is Westron’s film.
