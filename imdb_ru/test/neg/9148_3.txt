Positives: Filmed very well. It has several interesting minor characters. Pleasant main character (albeit weak). <br /> <br /> Bad: plot / story. Editing. The characters are wasted. Jessica Alba. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of juicy films, but this film is terribly bad. I do not understand how someone can give 12 million dollars to this guy. And before going further, I just want to say that I donâ€™t like Jessica Alba - I really wanted her to like her in this film. However, Jessica Alba in her fake accent and her model postures made me unhappy. She has absolutely no on-screen presence in this film, and she destroys every scene she is in. Needless to say, the novel does not seem so believable (even the smallest). <br /> <br /> Everything that I saw throughout the actors flapped their wings, trying to get off the ground with the small amount they were given - but unfortunately, all that this film does is sinking. There is no emotional connection, no emotional conflict, and nothing happens. This is a pretty empty movie.
