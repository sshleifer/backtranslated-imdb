There is something strange about antisocial feelings that you can find in the Cheech And Chong material. One of the songs in Up In Smoke, well, I often would like more songs to start these days. But in this excuse for the video, the duo of Stoner shows us a video for the four songs from their album of the moment, also called Get Out Of My Room. You hear a voice-over during the opening credits, in which some anonymous producer describes the recording as a recording of a novelty that simply takes place in the charts. Unfortunately, this introductory voice overs beats a nail right in the head. <br /> <br /> Most music records approved by the RIAA seem to follow the rules for posting the best material at the beginning of the album. Often, when someone misses this first song, an astute listener notices that there is little, if any, recording to keep their attention. On the other hand, the groups that challenged the conventional agreement often retained their best material last, or at least evenly distributed it across the disk. In this case, Cheech and Chong seem to have decided to insure their bets. The first part of “Get Out Of My Room” is a fun song with an incredibly bad video. Many viewers of the 1980s music video will find the careless direction a bit nostalgic. Chick's concept of British punk is also incredibly funny. <br /> <br /> Where everything goes down is the second number, I am not at home now. Nothing kills interest in a song like repetition, and it's hard to become more repetitive than this auditory turd. Honestly, one feels the desire to hit Chika in the face and tell him that we understood that he is not home now, so please continue. The next song on the theme of love, which is a strange thing, is an absolute bottom not only for this collection, but for Cheech And Chong as a whole. It is as if this song was written solely in order to extend the time of the album. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the Stoner duet retained the best for the latter, but it is also interesting to note that Chong is completely absent from this section. Born in East L.A. This is a prime number based on the old Bruce Springsteen number that mocks Reagan’s view on multiculturalism. As follows from Chicha’s tale, one wonders how many poor slaps who could not say a word in Spanish were deported to Mexico simply because their skin was not a sheet. Racism was an integral part of American culture in 1985, and it remains so today. In any case, it became even worse, so you need to ask yourself what Born In East LA would look like if it were written in this era. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, two abbreviations do not make an album, especially when there is so much boring filler between them. For example, the interviews before leaving the room are pretty funny. Not cracking, like most Up In Smoke, but funny enough to justify their existence. Unfortunately, two intermediate songs are reflected in their creation of the material. A boring song makes a boring filler. If you cut off the middle of half an hour of material from this video, you will get something much better. <br /> <br /> I gave "Get out of my room" three out of ten. They are earned first and last video. I am pretty sure that the stars are looking at material like this today, and they are surprised at what they think.
