“Stay Alive”, “Stay Alive”, “Stay Alive”, I noticed that it was a trailer, not a cartel. <br /> <br /> The theme of the film was devoted to the video that I play and which was created by the Countess for the murder. people and live forever - this is acceptable. <br /> <br /> Firstly, a rather horrible horror film, the blood sees more or less lit (gossip), these scenes are bleeding, they are so worse. <br /> <br /> But in fact (really) this film is bad, very, very bad, but bad in all aspects. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone, the trailer is good, the film is bad. <br /> <br /> I don’t do it, because (like, for example) they spend (consume) money and time, acting in these meaningless and too bad films.
