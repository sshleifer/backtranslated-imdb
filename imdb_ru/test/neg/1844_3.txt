I am usually a very generous voter on IMDb and I don’t try to comment on films that I don’t like, but it was just a failure. I actually turned it off 15 minutes before I finished, to see “That's all” (because my girlfriend wanted ... I just chose the lesser of two evils). <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie: imagine this movie as a collection of worse than average “horrible” stories, such as “scary short stories”, which you will find in the issue of “The Digest of Readers "In the waiting room of your dentist. <br /> <br /> I didn’t expect anything special, scary or funny, I’m not a person like “I want to see blood!”, but this “movie” is neither “horror”, nor “comedy”, or entertainment Other way. <br /> <br /> It’s probably more scary / funny and interesting to look at the poster of the movie “You Received Mail” for 90 minutes while drinking chamomile tea. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: “horror comedy” for people from 4 to 7 years.
