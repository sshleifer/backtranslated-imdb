We really do not know where to start when we talk about this film. But we will start with the plot. We sincerely suspect that the one who wrote / produced / shot this film has never read a book. Because they missed the whole point. SATIRICAL, not horror. Just a hint. Secondly, the bath scene. Enough said. Thirdly, the added characters. Sketchy gothic french lady and her black page that likes to hold hands and ride on wheels. We also do not understand where it came from. And then there was the casting. They were all really incredible. We were very upset that Catherine and Mr. Tilney were together because they were so unpleasant that no one would ever want to see them happy. And ... music. We think the BBC producers ran out of money, so they attacked their grandmother's attic. And they found some old records. Saxophone, screaming female voices and a random electric guitar. * shiver * <br /> <br /> In addition, the best line in the story: "Since you left, the white rose bush has died of grief." If anyone has any explanation, we will be happy to hear it. Because there is absolutely no point. <br /> <br /> We are still wondering what all the participants thought about when they cruelly released this pathetic excuse of the film to the public. We believe that this should be considered a federal crime. Torture is prohibited. <br /> <br /> This film is the worst we have seen so far. And I saw a lot of movies. <br /> <br /> Our recommendation: give this movie to someone you hate. They will watch this and want to kill themselves. And we agree with the previous post, we would give it 0 stars, if at all possible. DO NOT LOOK !! And we strongly suspect that everyone who has so far spoken in favor of this film has been involved in its production. Or were mentally insane. These are the only reasons for which we could come up with, which would induce to give a positive feedback.
