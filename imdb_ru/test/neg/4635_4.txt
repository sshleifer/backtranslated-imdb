Not bad performances. Whoopi plays a wise / warm role pretty well. However, the storyline and situations cannot be believed (forced PC stereotypes). At times they are good Jews and black against evil white Christians (ho-hum). Typical Hollywood fantasy. The film has its moments, but I would not advise with all my strength to watch them.
