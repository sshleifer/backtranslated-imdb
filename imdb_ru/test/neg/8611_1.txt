This movie is really bad. The hero can not play. You see too much that he learned his walking movements by heart. And believe me, he walks a lot. For 45 minutes nothing happens. He only goes to places and leaves ... For example, if the story was so short that they had to expand it, adding useless and boring scenes in the style of "like hanging". <br /> <br /> Dialogues are very bad. I counted a lot of “greetings”, and few “hung out” in the first part. <br /> <br /> Orange blood, like mercurochrome, which you put on children's bubbles. And the scenes don't follow. Bloody neck on the stage, clean neck on the next. <br /> <br /> History could be improved. Yes, I mean, what the hell is the story? <br /> <br /> Martial arts? Where? Is it martial arts? See how slow and slow moves !!!!! If hitting and getting hit is called martial arts, then I'm Bruce Lee !!!! <br /> <br /> The only good point I found was the fighting scenes: they do not play with zoom and the fast switching of scenes, which causes a headache in most action movies. <br /> <br /> There are many inexpensive films that are just great. This one was just to make money. Nothing more.
