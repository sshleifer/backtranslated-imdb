Well, make no mistake - this is a pretty awful movie, but I actually thought that there were some creepy scenes in it and from time to time overcame its pitiful budget. At least, he is unintentionally funny in places and has a certain atmosphere of eeriness and discomfort (scene of a scalding face, part with a disfigured bride). <br /> <br /> This child falls into my category “so bad it is interesting,” and for that I would give him a star. The effects are terrible, the acting is terrible, and it looks like it was shot in one day. You will love this toy ship! This brought back childhood memories of what I saw this late on the television many years ago. Although the Alpha DVD imprint looks weak and as if it was recorded directly from an old television broadcast or something else, I really liked it in this case!
