“Messengers” is a bad, common and boring horror film. The film has a big problem: it does not scare. The performances and screenplay are completely stupid. He uses old techniques to intimidate, and all the supernatural events make laugh. I would not call “The Messengers” a bad film ... I would call it a random comedy, because it is so bad that it makes you laugh. The only thing that is good about this film is that it is short, so this shit will not stay with us for so long. There are many masterpieces of the horror genre that are considered low-budget (such as Subject Two, Lucky, or May), which, unfortunately, are ignored, although all this crap is box office success. So I do not recommend this weak and pitiful horror film, which is called "The Messengers".
