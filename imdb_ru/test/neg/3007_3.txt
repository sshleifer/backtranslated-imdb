This is one of the best films of the past few years. The fact that it was done on a virtual basis (about $ 1.8 million. They say on the DVD: they conclude that they got even less money), makes it even more impressive. Not just a photograph, but a design and especially places (Eastern Montana), which are both truly American and otherworldly. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that there is no coherent film to go with it. The extremely promising installation of the last 48 hours of clearing the rural city in 1955 before it is flooded from behind the dam is washed away with a pretentious mumbo-giant hint of angels and a dying child. And what is being presented as the “real world” has been hopelessly accomplished. Note to Polish brothers: the Coens are funny, but you are not. <br /> <br /> No doubt many cinematographers will find abundant symbolism and incomprehensibility of Northforka as signs of some kind of depth, like sophisticated people fighting all night long in coffee shops while the brain masses are watching Charlie's Angels or something like that. (Sigh) If you insist ... <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, it is recommended only as an example for filmmakers for its flawless technical credits and photographic beauty.
