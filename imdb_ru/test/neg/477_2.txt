My brain shouted, “Why do you keep looking! Turn it off and go to bed! ”But the couch sweat won, and I watched to the predictable finale. I guess when it's Bruce Campbell, I need to give him a chance. <br /> <br /> I find it difficult to complain about a low-budget film only because of a low budget ... again and again we see low budget films that prove that a good story, good writing and a good acting game is enough to make a good film. Ted and Bruce started their journey with such a film, but they didn’t seem to know from Sam that it would take a little more to make a film than just put it on a film. because Bruce has always been a favorite. After the 70s and 80s, I just can't believe that such bad films are still being made. Bruce, I am very disappointed.
