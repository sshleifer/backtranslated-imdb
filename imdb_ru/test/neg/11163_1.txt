This implies the life of the apostle Paul. It opens with him involved in a loin-dressing contest with a priest. The Pharisees were called so because they were "separated" from Hellenism, imposed on the Jews by their pagan rulers. The fact is that Saul would never have taken up the Greco-Roman wrestling. PERIOD. <br /> <br /> Then we have two people (Saul and the Priest, Reuben is a completely non-biblical fictional character) who were washed naked in a Roman-style bath. Again, the Torah, which Saul adhered to rigorously, condemned in the strongest terms a glance at the nakedness of another person. <br /> <br /> Reuben is shown to those who are pushing Saul to destroy the church. Again, the text of the Holy Scriptures does not matter, because their Paul says that he devastated the church and breathed out threats and murders against the church. <br /> <br /> In the film Barnabas "sprinkles" Paul - do not baptize (do not immerse) him when the text of the Scripture says that Ananias did it. <br /> <br /> They don’t mention Mark or his return, so the scriptwriters are forced by Paul and Barnabas to argue about Paul’s desire to preach in Rome as the basis for their separation. <br /> <br /> No Silas about Paul’s Second and Third Missions; No Timothy ... EVER. No Titus; No Apollos ... No, NO, NOOOOOO !!! It is said that James “knew Jesus long ago,” and does not say, as the Scripture says, that he is the brother of Jesus. <br /> <br /> Why not just name the film “Frank, a fictitious apostle?!?! "At least it will be closer to the text of the Scriptures.
