This film started really tense when a pack of wild dogs attacked a poor young man. After an intense chase, his grandfather saved him with a magic whip. <br /> <br /> We get acquainted with a series of annoying housemates, including one pie, which is always half dressed. At this stage, the film intensifies tension with the help of strange “plink-plink” background noise, which makes me sit on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> I stopped paying attention for a while, but when I looked back at the screen, there were weird things like things that grunt and kill. One piece of advice, if you have ever been trapped in your home, take out a few cardboard boxes and a tray. <br /> <br /> Although we missed half of the film, because it was not at all interesting or memorable, we are now in a terrific conclusion, the last creature of a surviving creature is fighting the “Whip Fight” with the grandfather and his magic whip. I will not say what is happening here, but I can say that the battle with the whips is full of tension, with air battles, battles with a divided level and all sorts of dramas. <br /> <br /> Now I’m going to push this movie through the door of a neighbor I don’t like.
