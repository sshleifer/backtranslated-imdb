If there is something worse than this film, I do not want to see it. I remember so many amazing things - a nun fell out of a coffin to make a raft for a little blond boy; the little blond boy himself adored like a god; lots of videos about Peru as an ideal place to relax. The Shining Path and Alberto Fujimori must destroy all perceptions that Peru is a paradise for relaxation. All this is so terrible that Plan 9 or even Robot Monster is an aesthetic pleasure. This film must be bombed, shot at and bombed again.
