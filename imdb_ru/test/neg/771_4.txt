Someone else called this film “Fables of Horror”, and I think it fits very well. This is a concept at least. A group of teenagers, each with its own vice, catches the eye of a crooked lackey. He decides to teach teens a lesson, making them part of a strange show. Cool idea, but could be done better. The fate of some of the teens is too obvious, while other characters might be more understandable. In addition, the final was a serious disappointment. No resolution or big twist or anything. <br /> <br /> But as a low-budget horror movie, watching it is quite fun. If you like lousy ghosts, you should laugh about it. I think one of his mistakes ... that she takes herself too seriously. This is a stupid film, and if it were a bit more self-aware, I think it would be better. But at least there are enough neat carnival themes and b-movie monster makeup to keep you watching.
