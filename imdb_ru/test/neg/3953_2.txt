In the Ring it was a video; problem with the site in Feardotcom; the danger at Pulse came from computers; "Telephone and one missed call" - you guessed it - deadly phones. In Stay Alive, the technology that causes all sorts of problems is an online game: those who play it soon become dead. How clever! <br /> <br /> Directed by William Brent Bell (who?) And the cast of twenty things you might have seen before, but you probably can't remember where and how the hell their names are yes it is an extremely derivative part of filmmaking, aimed directly at the horror set of PG-13; Experienced viewers of scary films, no doubt, find “Staying Alive” extremely tedious, very predictable and in no way frightening. <br /> <br /> A poorly designed plot follows a group of gamers with extremely stupid names (October, Loomis, Phineas, Hutch and Swink!?!), who are trying to solve the mystery of the deadly game before they also become victims. In the end, they discover that the evil spirit of the legendary Countess Elizabeth Bathory kills anyone who dares to play, and that their only hope of survival is to continue the game until the end. <br /> <br /> With such a stupid story like this, viewers should expect a movie with a lot of loose ends, without any kind of iota of logic (who created the game, how and why it is never explained), very little in the way of panic or bloodshed, and stupid closing of the scene to leave the door open for a “God forbid” sequel.
