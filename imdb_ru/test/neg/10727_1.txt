Jim Carrey is a special brand of humor, and I personally think that he is a great actor (for example, Eternal Light). <br /> <br /> However, this film appears to be nothing more than Jim Carrey’s vehicle, so keep in mind that if you don’t think his comedy style is funny, you’ll sit with stone face throughout the film, because more than ANYTHING would recommend. <br /> <br /> Even if you like the Comedy of Kerry, I'm not sure that you will find this movie fun. I went to see him on Saturday evening at 10:30 pm, and the audience was definitely ready to laugh. They giggled on all the trailers, which was not particularly funny, but when it came to the film, there was a stone silence. I think it caused five genuine laughter. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is that he doesn’t know what he wants to be. He cannot decide whether he is going to farce or seriously. If it were stupid everywhere, it could be forgiven, but (I guess) it also tries to sort out the relationship between the two main characters. <br /> <br /> The film’s strong point is its ups, and there were many possibilities. But they did not start about halfway through and remained largely undeveloped. Meanwhile, you will have to spend the first painful 40 minutes, as the life of the couple is getting worse. <br /> <br /> Four separate groups came out of this film when I was there, and if my flatmate didn’t ask me to leave away from home (his girlfriend had just returned from a month’s leave!) the same thing. And in all my 25 years of work in the cinema, I did it only once.
