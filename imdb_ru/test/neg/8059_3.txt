CANNIBAL FEROX (1+ out of 5 stars) A pathetic excuse for a movie ... which you might like if you really like boring, meaningless jungle movies, spiced with scenes of graphic violence. A couple of drug dealers fleeing from the crowd, go to the jungles of Paraguay in search of emeralds and cocaine. They meet with another young traveler and his two hot girlfriends, one of whom is an anthropologist seeking to definitively prove that cannibalism does not exist and has never existed. One of the two merchants turns out to be a psychopath, and he tortures and kills a couple of natives to make them tell him where they hide their jewelry. (And how could they even tell him when he doesn't seem to speak their language at all?) Well, the locals are suddenly not too excited by the white people in their jungle and capture them all for some kind of retaliatory torture. Bad game, bad plot and bad leadership. Not a decent moment of waiting altogether a dreary 90 minutes. Even the special effects are not particularly convincing (although a couple of shots will still make most viewers cringe). The only good scene in the whole film is when two women are imprisoned in a dirty hut and seem to touch the hearts of the natives with their performance of the “Valley of the Red River”. The following is a quote from the film, but I won’t be surprised if many viewers don’t say exactly the same thing about this: “Oh God, please let her die soon. Oh, let her die soon. And let me die soon too, please.
