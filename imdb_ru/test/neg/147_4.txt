I usually enjoy watching Laurel and Hardy, but this is obviously one of the films they made while they became a successful comedy team. <br /> <br /> The plot is too simple and based on one joke; what strange kilts and scots. And it's all. Well, there are some other jokes, but I haven't found them very funny; they were outdated and (I think) were not very interesting when the film was first released. <br /> <br /> However, the film has two of the most charming faces in history, and they make the best of the Awkward Story (which I expect was filmed without a proper script), and itâ€™s nice to look at the landscape. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is only worth watching for Laurel and Hardy fans, other people should stay away from it.
