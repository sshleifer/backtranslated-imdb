I attended the premiere last night. The film began with a bang (perhaps because of the excitement before the premiere). The audience laughed for about 15 minutes, then most of us spent the rest of the time struggling with sleep. This film can not be compared with _Spinal Tap_ or any of the Guest's work, unless you want to say that _Sons of Provo_ really wants to make a mistake. Just fell, died, it was painful. The story went nowhere, the jokes were soft, even if you were a Mormon and could get all the internal jokes, it was a waste of time. There were two redeeming qualities: the game Kirby was at the height! And the songs were very clever (only for an LDS audience). So my recommendations ... Avoid the movie. And if you're a Mormon, buy a music CD.
