First, there are some holes in the plot in this movie. We see that at the very beginning the child dies from the game. But who was tied up in the mail truck delivering the package with the game? How did the driver put the package in the mailbox when he was tied to the steering wheel? Not that he was Mr. Fantastic. Wow, what in just the first 15 minutes ... Actors are second-rate, take the "Bad Boy" played by Patrick Kilpatrick (who?), It was he who appeared in one episode of everything on television and some minor roles in bad movies like that ). So much of the action is like television dramas, I can live with it, but the graphics or special effects are terrible. The free voice "Game" sounds like a poor Hal clone from "Space Oddessy 2000". What they called Zombies was more like shadows jumping around like monkeys from Planet of the Apes. The aliens had transparent bodies that looked like zombie shadows. In most cases, the film was simply predictable, as there was no clue or hidden agenda. The story was a good idea, but like most of the good ideas discussed at lunch, it never developed beyond this stage of a good idea.
