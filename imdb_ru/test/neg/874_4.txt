Not really a bomb? Lacked only enriched uranium. In fact, the “maybe” scenario would have worked if the main roles were played with younger actors, but the drama of an aging Diane Lane, acting as if she were a teenager (or even twenty-something), was too big to survive. Every time she (Adrienne) jumped into Richard Gere’s arms and then pulled both heels along, you could almost see the pain on his face when he probably thought, “Oh, my aching back ... is babe Of course, it does not weigh more than 125 pounds! "In any case, both characters were completely unbelievable, especially Richard Gere: a self-absorbing plastic surgeon (Dr. Paul Flanner) who participated in some sort of" mental search "after an unsuccessful operation that resulted in a dead patient (an elderly woman from a small farm.) Then there was her angry husband and son, whom he had to deal with in order to explain what had happened. Dr. Flanner is going to meet with an angry husband (at the request of her husband) when he meets Adrienne. She is recently separated from her infidel mu Ms. (shock) helps her friend watching her rented house on the beach. Of course, this is where Dr. Flanner stops, and they both end up falling madly in love (especially after she finds out that he is a rich doctor and a plastic surgeon). Between romantic breaks and the nauseous song / dance routine that Lane (Adrienne) performs while listening to an old record (without a CD?), They both try to understand how their lives are completely screwed up. Dr. Flanner was also not a father and has a son (who is also by a doctor) who is offended by Oh, he was not next to him while he was growing up. (Naturally, Dr. Flanner was more interested in his medical career at the time than raising a fast-moving, distracting boy.) To make a long (predictable) story short, Adrienne helps Dr. Flanner to meet his inner demons, as well as confront an evil heart. the husband and son of a woman who died on his operating table (after the “routine” removal of a face cyst). Dr. Flanner can finally tell her husband (whom Scott Glenn plays with sympathy and sympathy) that he regrets the incident, although this anesthesiologist is to blame for everything. “I told him she was too old for this juice!” Glenn's character (Robert Torrelson) seems to accept Dr. Flanner’s apology. It is difficult to say, because his emotional reaction by this time is so passive that you are wondering if he hears a good doctor at all or is thinking about some area that he needs to plow. Being more circumspect, Dr. Flanner decides that he needs to visit his son (who is currently engaged in free medicine in a third world country) in order to improve their relationship. Unfortunately, this means that he has to temporarily bid Adrienne. Of course, entertaining the natives in Timbuktu, every hour he writes a love letter to Adrienne (who loses consciousness almost every time, like a schoolgirl), and tells her that the most difficult thing he had to do was tell her goodbye. Obviously, apologizing to Robert Torrelson for the death of his wife was the second most difficult task. In the end, he is killed in monstrous dirt (poetic justice, as in a package of dirt?), And she only has memories of what could be ... I hope there will be no more sequels of Gere / Lane!
