This charming dog (called differently in the film) seems to be loved by the whole city ... but he is alone. He is friends with two children (Cindy and Paul played surprisingly badly), but their father did not allow them to have a dog. Then Benji meets Tiffany - ANOTHER charming dog. They (instantly) fall in love, and this leads to a hysterical installation of two of them frolicking in the grass, drinking from the fountain ... in slow motion, no less! Benji also lives in the cleanest abandoned house I've ever seen. Then two children are kidnapped by the most inept, unfunny kidnappers that I have ever seen, and - don't you know, - they hide the guys in the very house where Benji lives! <br /> <br /> WOW that was bad! A huge success (for some reason) in 1974, which led to many sequels (which I will NOT see). The film is simply horribly filmed with a "humor", so unfunny and poorly made that you just watch with surprise at the TV. The film also has a song that plays NONSTOP during the film - so much that you want to scream. He was inexplicably nominated for the best song on the Oscars - he did not win. Yes, dogs are amazing and much better than human actors, but I need not just cute dogs to interest me. <br /> <br /> You might think that I’ve been working a little on children's films, but I’ve seen this with my 5-year-old nephew. For 20 minutes, he was bored and stupid, and he basically stopped watching. I continued to look in the hope that it would be better - no. Really lousy - but VERY patient children or dog lovers might like it. <br /> <br /> Note to parents: This is a G grade, but the dog was severely kicked several times. You do not see it - you just hear it, and the dog survives, but it can disturb real little children.
