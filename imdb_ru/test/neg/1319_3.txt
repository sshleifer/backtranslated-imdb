A truly remarkable cast and a very talented technical team spent their valuable time on their careers and our equally valuable free time, bothering to support this completely predictable and clearly stereotyped piece of commercial garbage. The film is based on a really good and very relevant idea, but both the producers and the director simply applied the standard Hollywood formula for a “disaster film” and thus destroyed any potential value from the production. <br /> <br /> An unusually high tide and very strong storm conditions together lead to a record storm surge that floods London and floods most of the Thames Valley. The plot is centered around a heroic scientist (Tom Courtney), who warns authorities about the danger and ultimately saves the day, a glamorous woman police chief who controls the entire show, and a military deputy prime minister (David Suchet) who is trying to look important. <br /> <br /> But all this is so unreal that after 30 minutes a long tea break is felt. A young glamorous woman police commissioner demands complete authority over the army during a declared state of emergency and gets it (as if!). An experienced general is simply repelled like a complete idiot who has to lick his shoes because of her clearly superior ability. The trouble is that our superior woman, currently responsible for millions of lives, spends most of her time worrying about the fate of her two daughters, who set off on a journey through southwest London and did not call to say that they were okay Therefore, our powerful woman makes her employees look for them and decides that the only priority for the whole army and rescue services should be south-west London, and not any other quarter of the city. Of course, the minister, the army and the whole environment unconditionally accept its priorities. One can only assume that they had property there. When her children eventually show up after endless communications and the efforts of her staff, our hero tells her: "Thank God that they are safe, this is the main thing." Never mind the millions of others or all the other responsibilities that she had to control; as long as her own children were safe, everything was in order. <br /> <br /> This film is another excuse to push the same old female chauvinist sexist trap that women are intelligent, attentive, caring and clearly capable leaders, while men are good for nothing except physical courage, mindless strength and very special knowledge. Yet one simple instruction that she could give to the public; namely, go to the nearest tall building and quietly climb to the 4th floor or higher and wait for instructions when the water does not recede from this superhero woman or anyone else. The whole problem was so easy to solve, and yet millions of people clearly did not think to just go upstairs! Pathetic trash.
