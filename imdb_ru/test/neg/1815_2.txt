After watching the film Heart of Darkness, I feel I wasted 100 minutes of my life. Although the book was not my favorite, I was very disappointed to see how badly Nicholas Horn portrayed this story. Despite the fact that he missed a lot of important information, the actors simply did not correspond to their roles, and the whole film seemed completely unemotional. The book depicts vivid scenery and details that are completely ignored in the film. <br /> <br /> You might think that the director will be able to place 76 pages of a book in a film lasting at least an hour and a half. The differences completely changed the story for me. For example, when the character of Kurtz's bride does not pay attention to the fact that Kurtz is dead, this completely changes the ending that the book has given. Not to mention the scenery and decorations used in the film, they were not as beautiful as they were described. It truly seems to me that Rug filmed a different story with links from Heart of Darkness. <br /> <br /> If you watch a movie without knowing the title or expecting it to be something like the story of Joseph Conrad, you can find it good. Although I thought the camera work was bad and the actors were inappropriate, it’s still an exciting story. However, if you are looking for a good version of a movie of a famous classic story, do not look for it in Roag’s movie.
