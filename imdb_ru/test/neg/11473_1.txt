I heard that this film was stylish and intriguing, but I just found it annoying. It’s been a long time since I saw it (and I hope I don’t find out that all my memories are wrong and I unfairly condemn this film), but I remember that the filmmakers tried to portray Leopold and Loeb as a victim of society gay, and this somehow caused their horrible crime. I completely disagree with this point of view and I think that this is unfair to both homosexuals and Bobby Franks, the real victim of history. I can not imagine why someone would like to demand these two martyrs. I also thought that L & L were portrayed as more sophisticated than they really were - after all, they were teenagers who lived at home. The film puts them in a kind of fantasy world that seems to have been driven by Morrissey. <br /> <br /> I just read an interview with one of the filmmakers, which implied film anachronisms, such as the Phones button used by the characters, meant to “add Brecht distance”. They, of course, do it, but it seemed to me very tedious. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this film seemed interesting to many, but I would prefer a less “stylish” and more realistic analysis of the role of homosexuality. may have played in the case of Leopold and Loeb.
