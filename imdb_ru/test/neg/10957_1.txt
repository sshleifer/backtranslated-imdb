Unreal !!!!!!!!. After reading the initial reviews published by prospective reviewers, I was shocked to find that almost all of the initial reviews, 38, all rated this movie at 10. Compared to other great films, these reviewers felt that Fast and Undead are the best movie than “The Sixth Sense” (8.2), “Salvation of Private Ryan” (8.4), “The Lord of the Rings” (8.7), “The Godfather” (9.5), “Gladiator” (8.1) and “The Dawn of the Dead” (7.8) and many others . I hope that these shills use their next lasic procedure at a discount, about which they hear, because it is clear that these reviews were falsified. <br /> <br /> I was convinced that this film has a unique concept in the zombie filmmaking genre. Unfortunately, after watching “Fast” and “Undead”, it is obvious that these reviews were created by people who were either involved in the production or had a personal interest in film competitiveness / financial success. Nothing cements it in my memory more than the rumor that part of this film was filmed in Texas, coincidentally with early publications praising the film. The culture of the film “Zombies” / “Horror B” as a whole is a forgiving group, but this film, unfortunately, is not subject to any redemption. Characters are recycled, and the plot leaves much to be desired. The film quality was not bad enough to label the camcorder, and at least they used a film-quality camera. The game is terrible, the star tries unsuccessfully to break away when Clint Eastwood wants to become a clone. Christ on the bike !!!!!! Even the main actor is called Clint. He was just awful. The only similarity with Clint Eastwood is that in his acting style the moderator uses the “forest” on behalf of Eastwood. Zombie makeup was above the quality of a Halloween party, but was not fully applied to undead actors. A lot of zombies were not made on their hands. The plot was so fake that I was hoping for a power outage, a defect on the DVD, or that the zombies would turn their attention to the director. Perhaps the film has value for some viewers, but not for my hard-earned dollar. Fortunately, I used my free rental coupon to check out this DVD. Maybe this film will be saved by Notta's entertainment (aptly named), who released a special DVD collector that will connect free flaws and deliver the promised goods ??? Somehow, I think NOT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!> !!!!!!!! !!! Let's only hope that their next release, The Flesh Keeper, will truly be the "keeper" of the film ... and not a reworked version of the Texas massacre by the 5th generation chainsaw. Fingers crossed here guys ... but only if you don't care.
