So many great actors, so few worth watching. But with the script that misses so much of what made the book special, I donâ€™t hold it against anyone on the screen. Despite the shortcomings, the book was one of those that Grisham really liked, especially because it captures the scent of a small town in the south, a little different from a coastal urbanist like me. I also loved the factuality, the naturalness of what happens in the book. In the film, the heroes are given the "nobility" of a person who seemed so unnatural. Villains and films are flat and one-dimensional. But, as in many other works of Joel Schumacher, authenticity and authenticity are clearly missing, and each point must be delivered with a sledgehammer in the middle. So preaching, untidy and superficial about such a terrible tragedy, I would like someone to do a remake and believe in history a little more truthfully.
