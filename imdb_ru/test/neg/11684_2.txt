Well, the first thing I saw after watching the DVD box was the “Best Screenplay” and I thought it would be a good rental. Wow, I was wrong! I’m sure that once there was a good movie here, but after an incredibly bad gaming and video game performance, it looks like the backward half brother of the Throne. The first scene sets the overall atmosphere of the entire movie. In five minutes you will ask yourself: “What the hell am I looking at?”, And from there there will be only a snowball. The horrendous soundtrack that makes every song sound like Rob Zombie's “Dragula” completes this pathetic piece of shit in a ridiculously bad movie. On the other hand, No. 3 is the most romantic quotation in the film - “I think you are the final destination.”
