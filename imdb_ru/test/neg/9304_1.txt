Without a doubt, this is the worst film ever, and the Schindler's List actually caused more laughter. This not only shows how ridiculous this film is and how great SL is, given that it is heartbreaking and contains 1 laugh. I would like to meet with Yahoo Serious so that I could strangle him personally, for this and all the other very, very, very bad films that he has ever been to. There are also very few things that can be said about Australia, seeing how they like it stupid fruit. Don't get me wrong, the people (Mel Gibson) from Australia are great, they brought Mad Mad to us. I feel very sick that people like this garbage (a review that I just read said that it was “very funny,” disgusting, isn't it?) Personally, I will boycott this film and start an online petition to ban and burn all Yahoo Serious films for what they are, and I emphasize this, so MISSING. <br /> <br /> These are just my personal thoughts, I have no doubt that they are shared by everyone who has seen this film. <br /> <br /> Note. If you are forced to watch this movie in the style of A Clockwork Orange, call me to perform euthanasia for free.
