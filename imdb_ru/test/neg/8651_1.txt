This film is worth nothing. I mean, if you want to watch such things, switch to Hollywood movies! This is a complete disgrace to the name of Bollywood. Neal N Nikki seriously sucks! Never watch this movie. As for the actors, it seems that the acting genes have missed a generation. Tanisha could not wear less, and Udai Chopra was obviously just chosen because he was the spoiled son of the director. (All this Halla Re was surprisingly stupid) Songs, yes, and I hope that the director did not spend a lot of money on this ... As a result, I hated the film. Don't let your kids watch this, and if you have it in your home, this is a stupid film, so give it up! Buy a disc if needed. (As I said, the songs are yes.) At least it's better than the movie.
