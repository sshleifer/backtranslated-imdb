Armored <br /> <br /> The best thing about driving an armored vehicle is that if any bums with a red light come up and ask for money, you can shoot them in the face. <br /> <br /> The armored guards in this thriller do not use their defensive power to clean the population of drifters, they use their position to run away from their employer. <br /> <br /> When newcomer Tay (Columbus Short) gets a job with the company's armored trunk, he feels he has found his destiny in life. Unfortunately, however, when he discovers that his colleagues (Matt Dillon, Jean Reno and Lawrence Fishburne) plan to take on a cargo of 42 million dollars, should Tai strengthen himself ?? and means ?? in an armored truck. <br /> <br /> “Tired Capers” with a delicate plot and phone conversations, “Armored” is a film that is easy to forget. <br /> <br /> Also, if you really want to win millions, it’s much easier to disguise yourself as an ATM.
