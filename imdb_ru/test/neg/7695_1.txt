Total shame! Really awful! Scenario and dialogue is a joke, combined with a director who has no idea about life in Saudi Arabia. This is not surprising, a rather Saudi film, a Palestinian Canadian filmmaker, a Lebanese writer, a leading Jordanian actress, and filming took place in Dubai, and all these elements very well show that the film is far from Saudi society. Yes, it contains some Saudi clichés, something we see in cartoons in the newspapers every day, but that’s all. The film had the opportunity to show a real problem with Saudi society, or at least give us something new and genuine about the problems and problems of young people in Saudi Arabia, instead it was copied and pasted from here and there, and the result was a mess. Even the supposedly love story in the film does not exist, or at least we have not seen it. The only bright side to this complete debacle is a good performance from an auxiliary staff. The veteran Khaled Sami was funny in the poorly written role of the great father, of which he was clearly mistaken, because he looks younger than the actor playing his son. Also the actor who plays the role of a fanatical brother, Turki Al-Yusuf, succeeded, in fact, he was the best actor in the film. The rest of the cast, being professionals for a long time, did well, but main actor Hisham Abdulrahman was just plain bad. He had one look of little charming Bobby for all situations. He could not even say his lines in a proper manner. He has a charisma, thanks to which he received the title of Star Academy, a very famous reality show, and he is good at interviews and television shows, but he was just the weakest link in this film. I didn’t particularly mind the main actress, but even in some scenes she played poorly and replayed her sensuality in an unnecessary way. <br /> <br /> The film was a huge success, Saudi Arabia was flocked by thousands to neighboring Bahrain and Dubai was present when it was shown there, and he earned tons of money, then he was shown pay-per-view, then on television, and it was a few weeks. This should have been earned by the Saudis' desire for home entertainment, but alas; the film was neither homegrown nor entertaining.
