La Ragazza del Vagone Letto or Terror Express! as it was called in the version I saw, it starts when various passengers board the long-distance train. The three gangbangers, Dave, Phil and Ernie (Carlo de Meggio), and it became clear that they could cause trouble, intimidating and insulting other passengers and personnel. Since the train speed becomes terrible when a prostitute named Juliet (Silvia Dionisio) refuses to have sex with Dave, he and his comrades decide to take the whole train hostage so that they can have an orgy with Juliet and, well, no more comes apart from some policeman and his prisoner who set out to save the day. Hmm, that's all ... <br /> <br /> This Italian production was delivered by Ferdinando Baldi and is complete and complete crap from start to finish. Scenario George Eastman, as Luigi Montefiori can be as easy to describe as very boring porn as much as horror / thriller. It is tiresomely slow, it is 35 minutes before something even remotely unkempt happens, and in general the film lacks the elements of exploitation that Italian meanness and horror delivered at that time. The film can be compared to another Italian production, which “The House on the Edge of the Park” (1980) did infinitely better, but in the same year it is a very broad comparison, since everything that made “The House on the Edge of the Park” a notorious film is not in La Ragazza del Vagone Letto ”, there is no blood, no blood, almost no violence, there are only a couple of really tame rapes, there are no turns and reasons to watch. The Italian meanness and horrors of the late 70s and early 80s are not known for their strong plot lines or magnificent scenarios, but these films really do not make it to the bottom. The characters are terrible, the film spends the first 30-odd minutes, building them up and giving an idea of ​​why they are on the train, but everyone quickly forget about it and means absolutely nothing. I also hated the lame ending, and I don't know if I missed something, but was there any reasonable explanation given why these three chromosomes could hijack a train? I don't think I was, was there? Sorry, but due to the fact that you are angry at a prostitute, there is not enough reason, the filmmakers might have come up with something more substantial and interesting, if not more believable. In my opinion, this film stinks, it is as simple and straightforward as I fear. <br /> <br /> Directed by Baldi does a good job with his work, to be honest, he has only one corridor and several car compartments for working with this, I will weaken him a little, saying that the film is becoming very repetitive. There is no style and he films sex scenes, like bad soft core porn complete with a terrible romantic sound of the piano. IN THE FULL FILM IS NOT ONE, ONE, ONE DROP OF BLOOD. Forget about any blood or violence, since you will be very disappointed like me. There are several rapes, but they are amateur productions and have no effect, dirty exploitation and meanness, say, "I spit on your grave" (1978) or "Last house on the left" (1972) is not here. <br /> <br /> Technically, La Ragazza del Vagone Letto is all right, and it's pretty well done on what must have been a small budget, but the settings obviously helped to reduce the cost to a minimum. The acting game, as usual, leaves much to be desired, although since it was announced, the original performances have been lost. Fans of Italian horror will learn many voices here. <br /> <br /> “La Ragazza del Vagone Letto” is a terrible film, this is just my opinion, but I was bored to tears, waiting for something to happen, and when it ended up I never felt deceived, I want to return these 80 minutes of my life. This piece of shit doesn't even fit to decorate a 99-seat VHS basket in your local blockbuster, which should be avoided.
