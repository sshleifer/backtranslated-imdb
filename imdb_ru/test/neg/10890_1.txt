I only comment on very good movies and full trash. My goal is to help people who want to watch great movies, spend their time - and money - with the mind. <br /> <br /> I also want people not to waste their time on garbage and would like to tell you that the director / producer of these garbage films cannot get away with for a long time. We will find out who you are and vote without legs - and wallets. <br /> <br /> This film clearly falls under the category of garbage. <br /> <br /> Director and screenwriter - John Shiban. This is always a bad sign when the writer is also the director. Maybe he wants two checks. He should not get one. So remember the name - John SHIBAN. And if you see something else from him, forget about it. <br /> <br /> I will not say anything about the plot - others have already done. I’m a bit worried about how the director likes to bring a poor girl’s face closer when she cries and screams. These long shots are a little disturbing and can say something about Shiban's state of mind. Perhaps he should seek psychiatric help. <br /> <br /> Enough already. This shit - do not waste your time on it.
