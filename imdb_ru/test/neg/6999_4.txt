Dare Rudd (John Wayne) and sidekick Dink Hoolie (Syd Saylor) - itinerant barns that can not stay in one place for very long. At Helltown, the boys go to Montana, where they meet with Rudd's cousin Tom Fillmore (Johnny Mac Brown), who offers them work. You can hear the boys in aprons when they start cooking with the herd, although Deir becomes shy when Miss Judith (Marsha Hunt) goes to camp. Judy is Tom's girlfriend, but the attraction between her and Deir manifests very early. <br /> <br /> Fillmore has a herd of cattle, and he encourages Deir to launch, partly to prove to Judy that he cannot do this. be aware of the tasks. Meanwhile, the bad guy Bart Hammond (“Monte Blue”) looks at Fillmore's cattle, but when his minions fail to put out the flock, he believes it is easier to win the money that Deir paid at the end of the journey. By forcing Deira to enter a tough card game with his man Brady (James Craig), Deira's money begins to evaporate hand in hand. Only when Deir cannot return to Fillmore's ranch, does Tom go out to find his cousin. Exposing the cheats, Tom, Dair and Dink brag about how the bad guys can get revenge. <br /> <br /> "Helltown", also known as "Born to the West", was released in 1937 by Favorite Films Corporation, a couple of years after Wayne's western series for Lone Star Productions. It only slightly changes the formula of the Lone Star; Wayne does get a girlfriend at the end of the film, but here he tried. There is a great scene with a runaway horse where Wayne rescues Marsh Hunt in which Johnny Mac Brown's horse makes a full tumble. Sid Sailor copes with the role of a comic playmate, trying to sell lightning rods to unsuspecting victims. He replaces the familiar faces of George "Gabby" Heis and Yakima Kanutt, the main roles in the films "Lone Star". John Wayne's charisma begins to develop here, preparing him for a leap into superstar status, which he eventually achieved. <br /> <br /> “Infernal City” is based on the novel by the legendary western author Zein Gray. If you're looking for more films based on Gray's stories, try “Fighting Caravans” with Gary Cooper, “Light of Western Stars” with Victor Jory, “Drift Fence” with Buster Crabbe, and “Heritage of the Desert” with Randolph Scott.
