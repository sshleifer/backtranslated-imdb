As a film reviewer for a local gay magazine, I’m automatically sent to any kind of trash if there is homo in it. When I write this, the chicken Tikka Masala flashes in the background. I gave it my undivided attention for 53 minutes before I found myself involuntarily screaming - like a sufferer from Turret - “This is a test film I have ever seen.” We are just approaching the emotional climax when the son gives some kind of protruding speech to his father at his wedding. Father seems to take it pretty well. An attempt to kill honor at this stage would at least revive the film a little. And he made it funnier. <br /> <br /> I, for one, didn’t really like Beautiful Thing, but at least I could understand why other people like it so much. It was done with some professionalism, and I seem to remember that he had at least some good lines. The lack of wit in this film is very striking - even the most mediocre comedy series, as a rule, will have recognizable jokes. The closest thing this movie became funny (at least in the first 53 minutes) is a commentary to a fat unattractive woman with subtitles: “Look at her with her legs wide open — she looks like a Mersey tunnel.” Absolutely reckless, and I did not have a smile, but I could imagine that someone with a low IQ (perhaps he works in a chip store) would like it. <br /> <br /> I would have thought that this is a lottery funded atrocity. If not, then I can at least console myself that supporters will lose a significant amount of money, since even a low-budget British film will still cost someone a couple of millions. Seriously, if I met the most beautiful guy in the world and, returning to him to make sweet love, I would find a copy of this in his DVD collection (“Man, I love this movie”), I would probably kick him in nuts and leave immediately. And this is from someone who has gone about six months without any of the aforementioned sweet love. <br /> <br /> Oh god i hate this movie.
