This is the story of an investigator who hates his job — which proves why the actors — even such weak ones as Tom Cruise and Denzel Washington — are on the big screen, and your neighbors are not! <br /> <br /> I will though, let's say, the best moments show some basis in order to be really funny (not just stupid), continue to try, perhaps, to attend some lessons and spend time on learn how to make a good movie. (“Dude, where's my car” and in “The Scary Movie” have all this ... a college attempt.) <br /> <br /> There was no lighting; production was not; and the script had moments (a conversation from space is a very good attempt, unconvincingly executed). (It reminded me of “Dark Star”, that is, “loss in space,” but this film has just been lost.) <br /> <br /> The bartender’s talent (he said “dog” so vexingly that I knew that he had to play ... didn’t he? ... now IT plays!), the guy from Mark Hammond and Marty. I think I gave the film a point for each of them ... 3/10. <br /> <br /> -LD <br /> <br /> ______________________________________________ <br /> <br /> my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
