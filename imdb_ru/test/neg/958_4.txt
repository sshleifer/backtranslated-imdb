This review contains a partial spoiler. <br /> <br /> Small from the start, "D.O.A." at least it starts as if it could be a smooth, interesting piece of nonsense, like Fincher's The Game. His central character (Dennis Quaid) suffers from a nightmarish series of events that seem to unfold a cunning and cunning thriller. But the plot thunders too fast, leading to a dramatic turn not halfway when the character finds out that he was poisoned and he only had 1-2 days to live. And this is just too big a twist to randomly add to the story. Once this has happened, the only chance for the success of the film is if he views someone’s psychology in this situation as his main, in fact, the only subject: but “DOA” continues as if it were just normal revelation, like any other that you can usually meet in the thriller. The problem is twofold: first, Quaid’s actions do not convince of what someone in his situation could do; and secondly, even if they are convinced, it is difficult to care about what happens next when the most significant point of the plot has already been resolved prematurely. The rest of the film is a fairly standard fee for a movie of this kind, but made more tedious than usual, due to the slightly processed difficulty of the character, which logically overshadows events that the film is interested in. In the lead role, Dennis Quaid does not convince either as a burned-out professor or as a person who is destined to die: Meg Ryan, as often, is dizzying and annoying. Another negative feature is the horrible 80s soundtrack. Instead, see “The Game”, which of similar roots remains tough and character-driven, while “D.O.A.” drifts into events that only undermine its own premise. Since the premise itself is quite intriguing, it is embarrassing to see that it drowned in an abundance of digested plot.
