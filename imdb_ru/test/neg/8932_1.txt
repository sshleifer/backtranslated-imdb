I would just like to have a class lower than F to give it! I scored 1 point in the counting of votes. I do not rate it as an ordinary film, but as a T & A film, and this is the worst, roughest, roughest and most terrible film I've seen. Acting, history and music are terrible, not to mention the fact that in T & A connisuer there is not even nude. She is about a male fan, and the viewer has to look through the many painful scenes where he does cheers. this is the worst of the teenage cinema of the 80s.
