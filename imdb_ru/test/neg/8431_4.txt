GINGKO BED is a strange film. This is very confusing, as if he had many ideas, but it was not possible to combine them all into one holistic history. Instead, we get different storylines that diverge into their own separate small films. Oh, of course, in the end they meet, but it all looks pretty ... redundant. It should be noted the girl and her problems in the hospital. It was interesting? Then there were the elements “we are spirits, therefore, we do not have physicality”, which leads to the same problem as people with GHOST, namely: if the characters do not have physicality (that is, there is no physical form) and they can the walls and what not, how exactly do they keep from falling through the floor or float to the ceiling in this regard? <br /> <br /> GINGKO BED was widely advertised as a new breed of South Korean film. There are many special effects, but the film itself is hollow, and its artificial melodrama will “touch” only those whom it is easy, well, to touch from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (for a more detailed review of this film and reviews of other foreign films, visit www.nixflix.com)
