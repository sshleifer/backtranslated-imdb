Hectometer Where do I start? I usually ignore any IMDb rating when I watch a movie, because I think I might like it or something else, and I should at least give it a chance, but this time I would like to draw attention to it. <br /> <br /> I know that some people liked it, and I’m not trying to say that they shouldn’t. In some places it was pretty funny. But if you are like me and you don’t like to watch cats jumping in the underbrush for 20 minutes, random scenes with fast movement of clouds, dogs bark in cages for another 20 minutes tuned in to “exciting” music, while people talk, then you can avoid this movie. The actors were either positively wooden, or simply amazing, and the quality of the film was terrible, fuzzy, grainy and boring, and not at all artistic. And I know that we should have thought that Carol was not just a crazy maniac with a pistol shooting innocent people with this strange religious psychosis, but ... well, she really doesn’t convince me otherwise. In fact, I really didn’t like her crazy nature. And what happened to the souls in space? I understand that this is a fantastic film, but come on. <br /> <br /> I’ll say that the angel was damn creepy at the end. It was the most terrible thing in the whole film, WAY is more terrible than the demon Darth Maul with a lava face. I give them props for this scene, it was good. But not good enough to actually see the movie. And the opening credits were great, but don't be fooled! I would prefer them to use all the money that went into these loans to make the film better. <br /> <br /> Bach. I wish I had bought it even for the 2 dollars I paid for it, I could buy candy instead. : /
