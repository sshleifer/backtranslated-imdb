I would reject any temptation to watch this movie, it's just boring. Characters are predictable and thoughtless. The killer is pretty unenigmatic. In this train crash there is no tension, no fun, no style, not even a glimpse of originality. And the swamps of Hollywood clich√©s are choking. Oh, and you have a movie that makes the hero an IRA terrorist. Sweet. And now I need to talk a little more to fill ten lines. And a little more Is this enough? Not really, how about now? No, well, further confabulation should work, but Jackal is really not worth ten lines of presentation. The original was great.
