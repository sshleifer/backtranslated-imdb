I am from Romania ... and I apologize for this if my English is not very good. <br /> <br /> I just finished watching this movie and I must say that I am very disappointed. I always liked the films of Wesley Snipes, but this one is terrible. Sorry to have spent more than 3 hours downloading this movie. There are a lot of mistakes in the film. For example, the stadium in the film is not Lia Manoliu. The name of the stadium is Gencha. The name of the football team is called Steaua Bucuresti, not Uli. The stadium scoreboard is not capable of displaying graphic images: video replays, live images, etc. This is a simple scoreboard that can only display letters and numbers. The rivals of the Uli (Seua) team are displayed on the scoreboard as Dina (probably from Dinamo Bucharest, Steaua's main rivals in the Romanian football championship). Images from a football match are taken from the match between Steaua Bucuresti and Poli Timisoara (my favorite team and my only love is look on the Internet and you will understand why). The police cars in the film are made wrong. There is no dark blue police car in Romania! They are all white! The “list of mistakes” can go on and on ... and I will stay here! In a short time this movie is terrible. It should not be rented, you should not buy a movie ticket, you should not download it! I, frankly, wish that Wesley Snipes played in this film. His previous film ... 7 seconds ... also shot in Romania ... was fine, but it's terrible!
