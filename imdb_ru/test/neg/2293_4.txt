Swedish film spray? Is the world crazy? <br /> <br /> Perhaps not, but these days it is still not common with Swedish bloody jokes, the b-movie business in Sweden seems to have problems these days, the golden days of “Rymdinvasion i lappland”. And this film seems to have some problems in itself: it has too much talk, it still manages to be somewhat funny, mainly for good FX, which is great for a b-movie. The script and most of the acting skills are still pretty bad, but it’s actually not so important, it must be a terrible movie and nothing more, which is why it’s not going right for some reason. There simply is not enough blood to fill the void. <br /> <br /> Anyone who knows about Gert Fillinge will laugh at his role as a sergeant. though. I almost laughed. It really is so fun. <br /> <br /> In addition to the good details I have listed, there really is nothing to recommend, unless you are short of Swedish B-films. <br /> <br /> 4/10
