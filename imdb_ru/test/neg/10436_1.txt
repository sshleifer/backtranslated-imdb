The recent DVD release Good Humor Man calls the film a comedy. This is hardly a comedy, rather a boring indie film about a group of losers. Presumably established in the 70s, little attention is paid to the details of the period, and in its place comes overly muffled color correction. The monotonous soundtrack serves only to emphasize the repeatability of the film (perhaps this is the point, but it does not add to the pleasure of watching). In fact, the clique of losers likes to hang out in only one place - the stands. It seems that the packaging of the film in the form of a comedy is designed to deceive people who want to rent or buy this film, which is a waste of time.
