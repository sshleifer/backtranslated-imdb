This is one of those great martial arts movies that start with two groups of tough gang members fighting in the park; and when the deal goes wrong, and the battle begins, it turns out they all know karate and kung fu! Eternal wooden Cynthia Rothrock plays (as usual) a cynical, deadpan, good cop, this time in Los Angeles. She and her police partners are trying to break the fake ring, and when this storyline is exhausted, the story simply switches to something else, and Cynthia becomes the personal bodyguard of a rich, beautiful-looking magnate. The budget of the film is obviously stunning, there are some actions with a helicopter, some actions on a speedboat, some car chases, a fight when Cynthia beats everyone in the western bar of the country, some scenes in a bimbo pool in a bikini string and a surprisingly good chase on horse riding About a dozen and a half policemen were shot dead. There are many plot twists that simply make no sense; don't worry about them (And fake currency is a federal crime, so where the hell is the FBI? I think they were too busy.) The fight choreography was made by Cynthia Rothrock's frequent colleague Richard Taylor, whose cool and witty presence in front of the camera frankly, would make this movie better. He also tended to make Cynthia a better actress when they appeared together, and, frankly, she could use it; she seems tired and bored, and goes out of her way to play GUARDIAN ANGEL when she plays against her beloved dog, to whom she delivers bitterly drunken monologues. The dog almost beats her! She also wears the worst clothes the leading lady ever wore in any film: loose, baggy jeans with pale washed areas on each buttock were the most shocking. Other actors are all over the map. You can portray many of the secondary characters that are being shot this way: “Hey, I and some other guys I know will be in the movie. Do you want to be in it too? No, man, I'm serious! ”Then there are professionals who are asleep: the most interesting is Lydie Deneir, the amazing French model and veteran Red Shoe Diaries, Baywatch, Melrose Place, and many other variations of the sexy French bomb ; here she plays a psychopathic killer, as if she were in a BAISEZ-MOI or in an episode of "Alias", and not in some bin like this. There is also a tall, dark and handsome Daniel McVicard, who now regularly appears in the movie “Brave and Beautiful,” John O'Leary, who played a decent old man in dozens of films and episodes of the sitcom and does it again here, and Aaron Ipale, an Arab actor a veteran, perhaps best known as the “Pharaoh of the Net” from the movie MUMIYA AND MUMIYA RETURNS For these professionals, GUARDIAN ANGEL should be the funniest entry on their resume. I gave this film a higher rating than it probably deserves, because my daughters, who are martial arts enthusiasts, love to see a woman kicking ass and doing big fighting scenes for a change. They are still too young to care about what a poor quality picture it was, and they just enjoyed encouraging Cynthia when she was doing her steep leg, kicking, battling on sticks. If you like this movie, you will probably like it at this level.
