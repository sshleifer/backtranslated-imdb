I remembered this terrible film that I bought at the Camelot music store in the summer of 1989, when I was visiting my grandparents. It was a time when I had just discovered such films as Resuscitator, Because of, The Return of the Living Dead, and Dawn of the Dead. I was ready for the whole horror / blood genre that I could offer .... or so I thought! At that time I was only about 12 years old, so I don’t remember all that very well. I remember how a psycho ran with a corkscrew that kills people and several policemen (I think) who were driving in a car that didn't actually move, but swung from side to side to look like it was, I also remember that it was the worst movie I've ever seen before, and I quickly threw it in the trash. <br /> <br /> Something made me think about this film today (I can't believe I actually remembered the name), so I jumped on IMDB to see if it was on the list. To my surprise ... IT WAS! And as many as 5 people have seen this .... Amazing. Despite the fact that I remember how I hated a movie at the time, I somehow wanted me to hide it somewhere, because I would like to check it again for a laugh (it would probably make a good fiction movie with drinking). In any case, I am glad that I am part of the elite who saw this little “treasure”. I would like to take it somewhere for a couple of bucks .... but be careful, this is not a recommendation ... it's terrible ... it's just for nostalgia.
