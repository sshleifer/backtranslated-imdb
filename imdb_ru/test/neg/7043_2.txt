If you have enough time to kill, and the DVD was given to you by your friend for free, but you still may need a lot of courage to watch this movie, in which there is no good script or humor. <br /> <br /> On the acting front Imran froze in time / acting, Tushar Kapoor was a little better than Imran in this film. Paresh Rawal was good at comedy. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds around the campus, where Imran is a bad boy, and Tushar is a good one, they pretend to be the opposite of nature, so the story continues ..... <br /> <br /> See it, only if you have nothing to do, and the film is broadcast on local cable television.
