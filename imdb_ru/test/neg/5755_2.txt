Returning to Frogtown was not easy to track. Well, I completed this mission, and she sat on the shelf for a long time. I wish it were so! First, Sam Hell, of course, not Roddy Piper. It is replaced by a dude with a big face, less charismatic, and this poor actor speaks very gently on the part! Sam Hell must be rebellious and awesome. Here he is captured three times! What kind of hero is this ?! Spangle is also replaced here by another actress. Why didn't we get other characters here? That was stupid! Lou Ferrigno plays a major role in this film, and he is not even a hero. Common sense says: Let Lou be the hero of the film! Bad effects, bad game and just forgotten movie. It's funny when they shoot in Ninja Turtles 2 the whole concert scene in this film. At least Ninja Turtles 2 was a fun and good movie! I really wanted to return to Frogtown, but I just cringed when the fighting scenes began. This movie makes Turtles 3 look like gold! Avoid this, otherwise you will sing "More terrible, greener, talk at dinner on television!"
