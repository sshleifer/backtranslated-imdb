Many questions arise about the making of this film. The first one: why make a film that plays no more than a clumsy feminine fantasy? It’s one thing to leave the audience with problems to discuss the film’s intentions, it’s quite another to write a script that cannot adequately solve real human problems before they are displayed on the screen. <br /> <Why the outrageous melodramatic and often funny soundtrack? Why excessive and often awkward dialogue? Why is the girl of the protagonist one of the captors with hoods? What is the purpose of turning the main character’s freedom from abduction into a joke if he fulfills his “mission”? (This is a classic moment for the film “Little Australian Film.” Resort to a bizarre comedy at the most inopportune moment.) Why are there so many scenes where absolutely nothing happens? (This is about 15 minutes of film, which is at least 30 minutes longer.) Why, if a person is imprisoned for so many days, does he not try to make a serious attempt to escape? <br /> The director, who co-wrote the script, for many reasons could not give a satisfactory story. <br /> <br /> Dave Garver, Australia.
