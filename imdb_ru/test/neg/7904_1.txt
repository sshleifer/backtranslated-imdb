This “movie”, and I say it lightly, is just rubbish. I feel sorry for those people who actually spent their money to watch it in cinemas ... I saw a movie with a friend and has since regretted it. <br /> <br /> As a black woman, I am extremely embarrassed to see this. Moreover, I am extremely frightened that people of other races could also see this and believe that this is the behavior of blacks in general. He is full of stereotypes against all nationalities and genders, horribly coarse, rude jokes and settling single-row phrases, made by quite famous African-American comedians who should have known better after reading this script! I should also mention the numerous rap and hip-hop artists / rappers who fill the film as if it were a long music video - they absolutely had no place in the film. I think they were "Jiving & Singing Minstrels?" HORRIBLE. <br /> <br /> “Writers”, producers and those who had the stupidity of funding this “film” should be shot or locked in a room and forced to look at this shit without stopping for the rest of their lives. DON'T LOOK-THIS IS A FILM !!! This time is wasted from your life that you can never return.
