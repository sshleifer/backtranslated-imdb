I watched this movie from time to time, since it started playing about an hour ago, and I must say that this is the hour of my life that I wasted and will not return. The action is shit, and the scripts should take a serious look at the person who wrote them, they need to be slapped, maybe the TV will explode and save me from my sufferings ..... The only good thing about this film is that for guys and girls have nice eye candies in it, though, most of which i would like to disappear, as for the movie, special effects like sh * t, dante? who thinks the guy wearing leather-clad leather pants and half a leather jacket is scary, he looks more feminine than most women in this film, Dante's voice is pitiful, no one finds him threatening or frightening at all ... Please, TV, I ask you to blow up !!!!!!!!!!
