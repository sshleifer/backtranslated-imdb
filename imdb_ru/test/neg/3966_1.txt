For those of you who have a few good words for this film, I suspect that you didn’t see it when it was released as "Party: The Terror of Clonus." <br /> <br /> It was a terribly boring movie. He missed the mark in at least three ways. It was not good enough to be scary; it was not bad enough to be funny (although MST3K took care of this); and even in 1979, the plot was unoriginal. <br /> <br /> Previously, applicants called the "Resurrection of Zachary Wheeler" (1971). This is the same idea (clones as parts). The film is interesting, and he had a great cast. The other is Sleeping (1973). Yes, the Woody Allen movie. Remember the flattened nose? And The Clones (1973). The last two stories are not as similar to Clonus as the first, but they precede Clonus. <br /> <br /> This is also a few art books decades ago in which the idea is considered, although the word “clone” is often not used.
