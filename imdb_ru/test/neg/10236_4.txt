Time was not kind to this film from the transitional day of the sound of silence. The plot has a gangster falling in love with a secular man who wants to help his violinist for the luck she loves. There are of course complications. The problem with the film for me is that he could not stand it well. The performances are everywhere with some emotional scenes that seem so excessive to be funny. One late correspondence, when Carol Lombard throws someone out of her room, made me howl during the transfer of her song. There are other cases where the film becomes static, which is a sign of the limitations of the microphones. This is not a bad film, just the technical limitations of the film interfere with this pleasure. I usually forgive, but this time I just could not go with the flow (again, the copy I saw was absolutely terrible). It is worth taking a picture in forgiving mood (and it should be recalled that Robert Armstrong actually did more than played by Karl Denham in King Kong)
