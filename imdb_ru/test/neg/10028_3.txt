Stupid travelers go hiking in the mountains of Utah, only to face the murderous, disfigured gypsy. <br /> <br /> The Prey is a pretty cool film about a mill that mostly suffers from a lack of imagination. The victim characters are too familiar teenage idiots, which means that no one cares about them, we just wonder when they will die! Not to mention the fact that there are too many tender moments in it, and it is complemented by endless, unnecessary shots of nature. However, he has a few points of interest to fans, slasher, a casual touch of the eerie atmosphere and decent musical accompaniment of Don Pick. However, this is a common thing for movies about the dead. <br /> <br /> In this vein, there are much better films, but in general The Prey can be watchable enough for fans of the brutal slasher. Although someone may be more rewarded, to again see "Before Dawn" (1981), "Wrong move" (2003) or even "Last Terror" (1983). <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
