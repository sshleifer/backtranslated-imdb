El Padrino: The Latin godfather — although it seems to be a direct DVD / video film — my full-frame copy clearly looked cut off — so perhaps this film was limited to a theatrical production. And the title character seems more like a gringo than mine (I'm half Honduran). A rather typical rise and fall of a drug film involving an A-list B-list actors - Robert Wagner (drug lawyer), Kathleen Quinlan (crusade judge), Tiny Lister (con man), Gary Busey (child abuser), Brad Dourif (white power jailbird), Stacy Keach (lost governor), Joan Pakula (dead mother), Faye Dunaway (lawyer of the Crusaders) and Halo Mack Kenot as an uncredited guest at a party. This film is rather backward - I just watched it to kill time before the Skins Game - the only thing that saved her was Jennifer Tilly as a crazy assassin-drug dealer from Latina. She was incredibly sexy and sexy because it was fun to watch her scenes. Do not shoot or search. D +
