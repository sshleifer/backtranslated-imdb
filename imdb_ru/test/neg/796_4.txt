Ha ha - oh no - what to say about this movie? Yes, green eggs and ham make more sense than this film. Where to begin? A lot of good has already been said - so I will not be revealed on the same territory. I believe that you already have a summary of the film - so I will not rephrase the film. <br /> <br /> First, let's start with the good. <br /> <br /> 1). If you like psychological thrillers that make you think (like me), the first 29 minutes of this film will be for you - this is one of those films that illustrates the question that you always talked about on long cars when you were children. (what if you had to choose one family member live, another die or what if you had to die as a result of drowning or fire) This film is a great concept - the essence. <br /> <br /> 2) The dressing group did a great job returning us to the seventies. Realistic, however, how difficult is it to do? ..... Okay, this is all for the best. Let's talk about the bad. <br /> <br /> 1). This film is reminiscent of the two-hour episode of the Twilight Zone. It can be easily 90 minutes. This could make the film tolerable. <br /> <br /> 2). Do you remember in the movie "From Dusk Till Dawn?". The movie began interestingly, then halfway through the movie did it just take a derogatory turn? Yes, here is the same. I would venture to say that the authors began with the concept, and then had no idea what to do with it. I received a more profound provocation from Transformers 2. <br /> <br /> 3). Yes, we get a dilemma in the film. We understand the philosophical shades and the utilitarian approach - but the story jumped too much, did not stop at the current storyline, and took (forgive me) a completely offensive direction. <br /> <br /> 4). The ending did not make sense. It's my pleasure. Not. <br /> <br /> This film will be an excellent course article on college philosophy 101. If you are crazy, sick in bed or have ever enjoyed the cake in the face, and you can watch it free online - whatever either way, go for it. <br /> <br /> If you need to pay per view of this movie, do not waste your time - you better watch old Howie Mandel get up on You Tube. You will get more philosophical incentives by reorganizing your sock drawer.
