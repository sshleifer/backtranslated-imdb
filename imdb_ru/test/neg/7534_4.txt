Think of the extremely cheap version of Heathers, and you have the Pep Squad. This sums up the movie in a nutshell. I have to pay tribute to where the loan should be, though. The film has a pleasant visual appeal. I liked the cinematography, I liked the wild color schemes, I liked the designs of costumes. But without a good game, the film has no expiatory value. I would prefer to watch a film with a little visual appeal, with good actors and a keen dialogue (i.e. E. The Brothers McMullen or any Edward Burns film) The actors either monotonously tell their dialogue, or shout it out as if they were in a bad soap opera. That is why I do not scold most of the mainstream actors. Let's face it, most of the mainstream actors are the main reason. If they are not “great” actors, they are at least competent. People scold Leo DiCaprio, but when was the last time you saw a film in which he reads a dialogue, as if he reads it from a page? It's a shame, because the director seems to know his business when it comes to the stage. At the same time, I cannot fully praise Steve Balderson (director). He wrote a script containing a terrible dialogue. He may also be a bit racist, because the film has a black director who populates the climax of African American stereotypes.
