Let's see, cardboard characters, such as Muslim terrorists, forced a cardboard scientist to do some exotic drug tests on some cardboard people who were poisoned and kidnapped. You will surely laugh when these pitiful excuses of humanoids receive only their merits! It turns out that experiments with drugs gave them the opportunity to feel another world ... a world of religious fantasy! - complete with cardboard demons that look like they are made of papier-mâché. Everyone goes to hell, except for one poor guy who goes to heaven, where he can supposedly spend Eternity with the dummies who created this Masterpiece of Absurd. I think I will choose Hellfire myself. Go and see something else, unless you are stoned, in which case you may really like it! It doesn't hurt!
