Here is a film that was so pedestrian by 90% that in the end it had no right to become so complicated and disappointing. The director decided to become an author suddenly, 80% thanks to the creation of this film? Ish SPOILER WARNING. It usually starts in the 50s, when you are young; there are drifters, good girls, bad girls, gangs, a good old diner manager, and city goosebumps. Things follow the expected path about 15 minutes before the end, when they kill the only handsome character and blame the anti-hero (it would not be so unexpected if this were the main plot of the film ... but all this things start to happen and fall apart during the final movie! Big ball curve). Then everything becomes strange; A good old coder forms a mob and beats the hero down to bloody pulp. The mere presence of a friend of the hero somehow pulls the confession out of a real killer — an evil, terrible city nut (which in any real universe could have become the main suspect from the very beginning, even if an antihero with her body had been found). <br /> <br /> We still have a weak “happy” ending, which almost does not look like the rest of the film, like the events of the 10 minutes preceding it. <br /> Even more bizarre is that this film insists on playing homosexual hints to the hilt, but constantly presents two men's leashes as straight. Maybe it was on purpose - perhaps Bix’s resistance to settling with the girl was more because of his sexuality (which in the 50s should be held back and not discussed or even recognized) than because of his need to be a “tramp ". If the director intended to do this in the form of sex yarn, the vagabond drifts because he feels that he is sexually outcast; that his fatherly attitude to Danny is not really a fatherly, but a conjugal one; that his inability to stay with Carrie is rooted in sexual aversion, which even he does not quite understand - this could have been made clearer. Instead, we get a very bizarre alchemy of homoeroticism and behavior that is completely heterosexual. <br /> <br /> These young people sleep next to each other, even when they have room for breeding. When Danny makes a proposal (and once even in bed with a woman), Bix breaks free and takes it. Danny pays Bix (of course, there is another explanation, but he still resonates every time Danny buys Bix’s lunch). They end up living together at the end. Not since Hitchcock's Rope, Homosexuality was so blatant, but was denied. <br /> <br /> MST3K did the right thing by taking it over. In addition to Jack Elam, the film is not much praised.
