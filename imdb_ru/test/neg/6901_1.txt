At first I went to look at it myself, to make sure that it was suitable for my little boy. <br /> <br /> Thank God, I did it, because, of course, I did not allow any small child to see it. What for? Violence, death, funeral. If you are not ready to explain these concepts to your children, keep them away. <br /> <br /> Why should these topics be covered in the children's film, especially the one on which there is a line with the words “Original animals for parties”. ” You can also put the penalty gangsters in the cartoon "Hello Kitty". <br /> <br /> With regard to laughter, there were very few people between them. Speaking for myself there was not one. The cows looked remarkably similar to the cows in the far side comic. I believe that there is nothing original in this film, except ridiculous violence and anti-social actions for all young children.
