In Bollywood, often useless films become hits, good films fail, and good actors don't make it big <br /> <br /> AKS is such a movie <br /> <br /> Himesh after the music director and the Singer tried to play the role of Hell simply because his songs became a hit, which means that next time he will become an actor. <br /> <br /> The producers were confident that the film might work, the songs were also a hit, and, of course, Himesh did his cheap advertising, as usual, <br /> <br /> The film tells the following a bad story, such a bad guide, such a bad behavior that makes you cringe <br /> <br /> Indian rickshaws in Germany, tricks of Himesh and many others <br /> Direction is bad Music saves grace, although most songs sound the same <br /> <br /> Himesh tries his best But, unfortunately, his emotion of the scene - a joke, without expression, he is best suited to his musical director and a little singing. He cuts out an apologetic picture, Khansika is terrible, Malik is fine, Sachin, Hedekar is fine, Darss. Khan Jarivala Hams
