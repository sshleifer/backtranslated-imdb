I have vague memories that this movie is funny. <br /> <br /> After seeing him again, I changed or even thought about another movie. <br /> <br /> It seems that we are supposed to be sympathetic to the character Jackie Mason, but nothing in the film gives rise to these emotions. It is noteworthy that he is really the only person who showed gentle communication with loved ones. No one else is allowed to rise to the status of even a vague person. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t even like golf, but when the film continued, I was really rooting for Robart Stack and the guys from the club, really hoping that they would reflect on Mason and Chevy Chase.
