Blimey! Here is another video stuffed, which will please cinematic masochists. If cheap starting credits do not mean that a real trip awaits you, then surely a devilishly tragic “letter” will be. <br /> <br /> A diabetic child is tied to the legendary scarecrow, part of his dedication to the baseball team. Then the scarecrow goes crazy and starts killing people. Do I need to say more? This film largely consists of cheap effects that make it look like it was edited using iMovie (note that it’s a terrible color inversion) and actors who were obviously not good enough to appear on some special evening Cinemax. In fact, this is unfair, as the actors did not have enough space to work on the terrible script. Parts of this film do seem to be parody, especially when one character takes his guitar and starts playing the worst song ever conceived by people, with the worst lip sync ever played with it. The "mountain" here is also a big disappointment. In most B-films, such as this one, there is a thick layer of cheap Gore FX to make up for what is missing in history and acting. Everything is so cheap here that it’s not even fun. Compared to this film, Jack Frost-2 looks great fun. <br /> <br /> If you think that this film is the “worst of all you have ever seen,” then you probably didn’t go into it. world of direct video b-horror. Despite this, this film will cause you a strong heartache, regardless of your origin.
