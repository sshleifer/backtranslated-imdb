Another day - this film requires you to watch it another day in order to understand it. I really enjoy watching Shannen Doherty, and it was very interesting to see how well Julian McMahon and Shannen appeared together after the roles played in Charmed. Of course, I can praise the acting skills throughout the entire film, even directing - but the plot ... what happened? I am at a loss for words, because I am still confused. I have to remain loyal to the actors who have really done a good job, given the madness of the plot. I should also recommend that you see it, because, despite the insanity of the conspiracy, I will still watch it again and again.
