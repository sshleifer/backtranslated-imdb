then the second half of this film is difficult to follow. I got the first part with the Spanish Inquisition, but the film missed many years ahead with the French ruling Spain. The film says little about what happened, and I don’t remember much about it. So, the film becomes confusing then. The film begins when Ines, the daughter of a wealthy merchant, is accused of Judaism by the church, in particular, the father of Lorenzo. She is put to the question and is forced to admit. Even the wealth of her family cannot buy her from prison. Her father forces Lorenzo to sign a confession stating that he is a descendant of chimpanzees in the hope of Ines’s release. All he does is cause the church to condemn Lorenzo, who is fleeing to France. <br /> <br /> Then the film skips many years, and the French Revolution is in full force. Ines released from prison. It was a very good job to make Natalie Portman look so torn. She finds her family dead and is looking for Goya for her help. She tells him that she had a child in prison. Goya sets up a meeting between her and Lorenzo, who is now with the French and in power. He is the father. Goya sees her daughter and tells Lorenzo, who decides that it is better to send her to America, so no one will know. But before his plans come true, the British will join the Spaniards, and Spain will regain power, and now he is being pursued. This part is not well narrated in the film. It looks like the film shows that it will happen in one day. <br /> <br /> FINAL CONTROL: The film is good until many years after the Inquisition, then the film expects you to understand what is happening. This is just too confusing for me then.
