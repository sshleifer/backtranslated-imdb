This P.of S. was highly recommended to me by two friends who have a great <br /> <br /> (similar to my) taste in films and have seen more than anyone I know. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what they saw in this movie. Sadistic, cruel, and repulsive in a fascinating film, but it is a trifling effort, trying to impersonate a high-ranking, low-sex film. ransom social value comes to mind. Bill Pullman tries, maybe a little hard, and, besides the child, the rest of acting seems shy and somewhat lame. <br /> <br /> Get rid of this and watch a double role in the movie “In the Cold” Blood ”and“ Hitchhiker. ” Jennifer Lynch was not the overvalued daughter of David Lynch.
