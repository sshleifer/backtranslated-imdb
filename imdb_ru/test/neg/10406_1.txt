And, obviously, I did not see it! <br /> <br /> But looking at the cast and seeing that Dag Masters is back from the dead, I now know to avoid it like the plague! I hate it when Hollywood, producers, writers, directors, or all of the above think that the audience is stupid, that they are not going to catch the error of continuity. Allegedly dead Doug Masters, who returned, - a giant man, is not it? <br /> <br /> And I can't believe that someone like Louis Gossett Jr. will be back for something like that. > <br /> Jason Gedrick really refused it? Well, I hate to say it, but even if he took on the role again, he would still have the same continuity error. I bet (if he really refused), he must have been incredulous to see that his character died in the second movie. <br /> <br /> I’ll probably catch it by chance in a late night broadcast on some channel, but I’m not going to rent it or buy a DVD!
