This film surpasses everything. Well, it depends on what you are looking for ... it can be 10 or 1 in scale. This film is in full league by itself ... I donâ€™t think any film could come close to it. I'm not sure that the director intended to do it like .. thriller or comedy. If he really thought he was acting in a thriller, then, thanks to luck, he created one of the best Bollywood comedies of all time. You have to see it in order to believe it ... matrix + terminator + many other films combined into one, along with the plot, going back to the Hindi films of the 1980s, with ichchadhari naagom (a mythical snake that can turn into a man) . <br /> <br /> This is a perfect movie if you sit with a group of friends with alcohol on the side and plan to make fun of the movie! I'm not sure whether to give him 1 or 10 .. Based on the coin flip, I decided to give him 1!
