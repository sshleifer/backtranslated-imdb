Summary: A group of five young American men, all that remains of the platoon that was badly damaged during the offensive on the Ardennes during World War II, are assigned as an outpost and are looking for enemy actions. They are in very poor condition, both physically and mentally, and they think they hit gold when their outpost is in an abandoned, but once posh mansion full of food. But after a while the activity of the enemy appears, and this is very strange. Not hostile, but strange. It seems that there is a German squad, in as bad a condition that wants nothing more than to surrender. <br /> <br /> Comments: based on the novel and I assume that the novel is much better, but the story does not seem to translate well to the big screen. In fact, this is another war film, much more about psychological pressure during the war than about battles and battles. But I almost feel that the scenes, which must have been full of anticipation, full of uncertainty and unknown elements, simply fail in the film. This is not tense, just different and in many ways absurd. Many times people just act insane, and the reasons are unclear or, at best, hint at it. <br /> <br /> Therefore, when this mental pressure does not pass, the main structure of the whole story, I thought that the story collapsed through. It was not good, it was not interesting, it did not keep me on the edge, and it really did not send a message. In fact, nothing happened. <br /> <br /> The cast is interesting, many young actors at the beginning of his career turned into stars. The game is good, but not stellar, and several characters also fell into the absurd zone. I feel that a lot is due to the fact that in this story these characters need time, space and pace, indicated in the novel, which they cannot give here. And going half is definitely not good enough. <br /> <br /> 4/10
