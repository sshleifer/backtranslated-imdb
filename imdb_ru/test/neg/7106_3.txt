I made the mistake of buying it as I collect films inspired by comics. Even for $ 6 it was too expensive. I thought that there could be some fun fun, “so bad” that it could be good, maybe I was wrong. I watched it once a long time ago and did not remember anything. Now I know why. I was bored and I was looking for distractions to do something else. I'm all for grrrlr power, punk attitude and absurd humor, but Tank Girl doesn't work on all fronts. The script is bad, you do not care about the characters, and the humor is mostly lame, except for a few funny one-liners. Special effects or locations are bad or are often replaced with comic panels or animation that are too sharp compared to live action. As if they had no money to shoot cool things, and they resorted to drawings, no matter how cool they were (the animated feature without censorship would be much better for Tank Girl now that I think about it). The scenes were funny, but not in a fun way. The tank itself was far from impressive or dynamic, although it was interestingly decorated. In fact, the best battle scenes with the tank were in animation. <br /> <br /> It has some interesting songs by famous artists such as Bjork, Hole and Portishead, but instead of improving the atmosphere, they just don’t fit most of the time. Once they even broke into a funny song and dance number, which was just meaningless and terrible. I think that it was then that I completely disconnected. I believe that Tank Girl, played by Lori Petty, looks like a crappy panet part, but outside of her “relationship”, and sometimes just funny objections, is more two-dimensional and superficial than the worst characters in comics. The jet played by Naomi Watts is probably the only saving grace of the film, and it is amazing how such a good actress was involved in this mess. Malcolm McDowell played his usual villain role well. For some, this may be a cult film, but please note that it really differs from the original independent comic, and its creators were disappointed with the film itself (see the Post for Tank Girl on Wikipedia). <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 10
