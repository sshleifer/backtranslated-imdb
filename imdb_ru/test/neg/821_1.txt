I have already heard about Ali Ji in Madonnaâ€™s music music video. I always think he is funny. (Actually, he really is.) Just last year, I was always thinking about buying the Ali G Indahouse VCD. That's why a few months later I bought it cheap and started watching it. <br /> <br /> But the movie surprised me. My older brother and I expected it to be a great funny comedy. It turns out, "Indahaus" - just a stupid piece of garbage. It was really very bad. It also contains explicit sexual content and very rude humor. It also did not make me laugh, even just a big smile. We definitely hate this movie. Oh, by the way, I have plans to sell it. <br /> <br /> Ali Ji was really different in his film from his TV shows - in such a negative way. Maybe he was not well focused enough and serious enough to make that click. The fact that there are some sexual scenes in it does not mean that it is damn funny (because sometimes too much is not funny anymore). For the first time I was disappointed in it. It really upset and saddened me. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 1 point for 10. In fact, I really want to give it a rating of 0. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen in my whole life. I would not recommend to anyone who wants to watch good comedies that are not too explicit or horrible.
