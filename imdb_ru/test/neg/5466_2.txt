Of course, I like some indie movies. A lot, in fact. I do not always understand them, and this is normal. Not all of them should have been understood, especially by people like me. I probably show my ignorance, but I'm still puzzled why the Book of Revelation is called that. I like these stories about the end of the world, and the only thing I could see was like the end of the world, and this film was the torture it took to get through it. I am not talking about the subject; perhaps i am subdued from all the other torture / porn i have seen. It was an incredibly slow story: one hour, the 15-minute material stretched for almost two hours. (Main spoilers ahead) Dancer hetero stolen, seduced and raped in six ways since Sunday, or in this case 12 days, by three women with hoods. After his release, after his somewhat upset dancer / girlfriend barely shudders (except falling from her glass), wondering if she missed more: him or the cigarettes for which she originally sent him after the abduction. Still in a state of sensible shock, he refuses to talk, and she continues to work without such an embrace, as if nothing had happened, and he was taking a very necessary shower. Problem. No matter how hard he was tormented by the memories of his “attacks,” he is equally agitated. Of course, I was not tied up and not used as a toy, but I doubt that I will really "be in the mood." Oh, I forgot, how is he trying to solve this crime? Sleep with as many women as possible to try to identify birthmarks or tats in criminals. I see where they go with this ?? show gang rape from male POV. Well, despite this, you can never feel this guy. The only saving grace was a good LifetimeTV Dancer / Cancer Instructor game. But even she could not save the film.
