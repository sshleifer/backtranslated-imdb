A boring, dignified, heinous conspiracy, one of the worst directions I've ever come across, a meaningless game and terribly clichéd. The film ends with the fact that one of the main characters wakes up from a dream. What's up with that? Even JR from Dallas could not survive this unfortunate turn. <br /> <br /> You have something that can be described only as inappropriate relationships, developing between the main character and the young girl, who supposedly should be fatherly, but which seem perverted. You have special effects from a college cinema school of freshmen with Kimberly Hole-sized loopholes. This is similar to how the “Children of Corn Meet the Passions of Christ”, imposed on the endless cycle of government administration training videos — by the end of this, if you don’t plan to end this, you have no mind. <br /> <br /> Don't worry.
