Have you ever wondered what is the worst movie ever made? Stop being surprised. I'm telling you, Michael, aren't you? <br /> <br /> It does not “warm the soul”, “entertains” or “Travolta at its best.” It just sucks. If I had children, I would let them see "Deep Throat" before Michael! <br /> <br /> Sold John Travolta, washed and balding William Hurt, and Jean Stapleton will soon die. This movie. <br /> <br /> But wait ... you'll hear Andy McDowell sing! Yeah. Hollywood really spat on us with this!
