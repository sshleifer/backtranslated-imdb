Terrific babe T-Rex is freely available in a small western town, prompting Sheriff Eric Roberts and animal control agent Melissa Brassel (who goes through her role in a very uninteresting manner) to figure it all out. They discover that the mad scientist (Corbin Bernsen), unbeknownst to the government sponsor, continues the long-abandoned American research project called Operation Jurassic Storm (ha!), Creating an army of dinosaurs in a secluded underground laboratory. Soon our heroes were trapped inside, summoned the marines, cut off power and freed dinosaurs to quickly have lunch with everyone they could wear with their claws and jaws. <br /> <br /> Despite this scenario, JURASSIC PARK and CARNOSAUR, which often infuriates the inept script, full of holes in the plot, inconsistencies of characters and unhealthy ends, is a fairly easily digestible garbage, thanks to good manufacturing qualities, tolerable FX, casual laughter and many mindless actions. <br /> <br /> Someone noted that the opening scene of this film was stolen from CARNOSAUR, but anyone who is used to watching Roger Cormanâ€™s films knows that it allows directors to freely use clips from their earlier films to save time and money. . <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 10
