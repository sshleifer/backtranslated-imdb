Oh my god, this is terrible. Stay away, just stay away. If you think you've seen bad movies, think again. Never before has my brain ached as much as after watching this movie. Actions, if you can call it that, are enough to cause internal bleeding in your head. The story is so thin that it is simply not there ... no, wait, scratch it. There is not a complete story, but from time to time, there are a few thin lines that stand out from all the horrors, and believe me, these few lines should have been removed. The best way to enjoy this movie is to throw napalm at it and watch the cozy fire from a distance. <br /> <br /> Some may call me sarcastic in this review, but I'm only trying to save some of you from a serious headache. However, if you, as I call it, are a visual masochist (like me), please continue and watch this monster.
