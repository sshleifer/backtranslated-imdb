I give this movie "Vampire Killers" a rating of "2", mainly because it does not have sex or nude. Other than that, I'm not sure why this has ever been done. It was more like a movie exercise with a very limited budget. The characters Derek and Slovak were the best actors. They were closely watched by a "biker dude" with Pleather trousers and a silver belt. He was fine too. Most of the film was shot at some distribution warehouse. If you are tired of watching kung fu tricks, you can check the packaging of Scott fabrics, Windex and other cleaning products. You will have plenty of time for this, believe me. I almost started making a list. The Kung Fu dialogue and tricks were very slow. They spoke slowly, fought slowly, and so on. D. I do not know why. At least with the very slow delivery of the actors, you could hear everything very clearly. I struggle to find good things to say about this movie. We watched it all until the very end to see if it was better, but itâ€™s not. We could never decide whether the actors really knew the martial arts or simply behaved as if they knew the martial arts. You can watch yourself and decide. My favorite line was something like (vampire speech :) "what are you looking at?" another man replies: "your bad dental work."
