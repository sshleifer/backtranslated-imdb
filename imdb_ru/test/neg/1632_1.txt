Why is it none other than Ator, whom Miles O'Keefe played very poorly. Surprisingly, I was lucky to sit through this turkey before Mystery Science Theater 3000 tore it apart. I highly recommend reading the MST3K version because it is fun and one of the best in history. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is a typical B-movie that was produced by Italian filmmakers. in the early and mid 80s. This film was obviously made to make money on the crazy Conan, but it fails miserably on all counts. <br /> <br /> Watch the scenes where Ator fights with a giant rubber snake, and also managed to make a complete hang-glider during the cut. <br /> <br /> "Thong, fish is ready!" <br /> <br /> assessment: the film itself-1 Version MST3K: 10
