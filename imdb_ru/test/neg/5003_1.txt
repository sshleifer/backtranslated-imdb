This movie was terrible. It was very terrible. <br /> <br /> The most annoying thing was how the process was conducted. During the interrogation of a witness, defense counsel is allowed to wander and continue without objection from the prosecution. He attacks the children who are led to testify with cruel ferocity and repeatedly shouts to them that they are lying. These are simply not the things that they have sexually abused children with. The trial is stupid, and it destroys the whole movie ... (Law and order spoiled my accuracy in the courtroom).
