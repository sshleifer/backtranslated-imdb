This thing. oh god i can't even call it a movie. a film is something that does something. going somewhere has some semblance of a plot or SOMETHING. I do not know how I do it. I'm really not. First, I say that dark fields are the worst movie in history. and I thought it was. then the pirates of the ghost island proved me wrong. and now for the third time in a row another film goes beyond the call of duty to prove that I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> (sigh) OK. Dark Harvest II: Corn. God, this is terrible. Let me break it for you. The human senses feel that their daughters are in danger thanks to some of the magical powers that he received from his popcorn from Act II, and he rushes to look for them in a cornfield. Of course, this is the largest corn field in all existence, the size of corn fields from Jeepers Creepers, Children of the Corners and Signs combined. the protagonist, whose name is Shay (amazing name, by the way), runs across a cornfield ... finds ghost girls, talks to them and ... runs across a cornfield. digs for a while ... and runs through the corn field. and incredibly sad thing? I really don't miss anything. This is almost the whole movie. The only thing I can leave is how he is being pursued by two policemen who want to arrest him ... I don't know. pretending to be an actor. I didn't care. He escapes, and the police - something - a killer off-screen. hell is there a killer? apparently, yes, since he put almost 4/5 into the film. but wait! then he runs away for a while, and, you guessed it, even more run through the corn field and dig. Then there is the end where he saves his daughters. Huzzah <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this film is that itâ€™s boring. it's incredible, inhuman, terribly boring. I can't explain how awfully boring this thing is. nothing happens, the characters are as attractive as the root canal, and this is only an hour and a half ANYTHING. The only good thing that came out of this film was that my friend and I might have gained enlightenment because of a condition close to nirvana, in which this film put us after the effect of the drugs in our brain turned into acceleration to support us. During the ensuing madness, I found that hugging a wall was much nicer, and my friend had a new passion for hysterical laughter when he plopped across the floor, as if he had a fit. This is the insanity that this film brings. it's not just bad. it's bad for your health. The cover looks amazing with the image of an AMAZING killer stuffed, which I would have fully thought of, dressed as a terrible scammer, but it was the most misleading box. DON'T GIVE THIS FOOT TO YOU TOO DON'T watch this movie. Watch the best movie of corn. ANY film about corn is better. just don't let it get you! not! 0 out of 10
