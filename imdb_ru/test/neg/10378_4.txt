Is the dispute meter in Cannes surprisingly esoteric, or are we Americans so insensitive and cynical that we never read between the lines again? Be that as it may, with a lot of careful analysis, The Beaker Falscher in no way seems to correspond to the popular contradiction that allegedly brought to Cannes in 2005, a mysteriously gray and aimless movie that rather justifies its grim American re-title ("Low Profile"). <br /> <br /> Based on the familiar themes of bourgeois fear and subsequent sexual liberation (such as), it is generally recognized that this film is not without interests at the surface level. It starts with a takeover, as the haunting shot of a deserted road off-highway focuses on the teenage stroller, who ultimately goes on a fussy car, where the supposedly brutal hitting left the driver dead in a terrible mess. <br /> <br /> The tramp from school turns out to be Armin Stibe, a product of German suburbs with minimal ambitions. Constantly putting pressure on his caring, but somewhat sore parents, in order to find a good job, he suffers an interview after an interview with each haughty interviewer along with each, with the same fruitless result. He is very sick of this, his above-mentioned collision on the highway soon provokes his first act of rebellion: to take responsibility for a crime he did not commit. <br /> <br /> Pretending to fill out more applications and get more and more strange interviews at dawn, he takes part in roadside sexual fantasies and petty vandalism after sunset. As the days get shorter and the nights get hotter, he continues to live in his suburban area, as if he is not doing anything out of the ordinary. <br /> <br /> If you don’t understand what exactly is happening, don’t worry about being the only one: it’s as far and consistent as possible. The plot seems simple enough, and perhaps because of his seemingly direct goals, which is why the Falseer Beckenner becomes meaninglessly winding, fascinated by endless false conclusions, dream-like situations and graphic sex scenes to try to shed light on the story , devoid of clear logic for the already vague argument (presumably the stunning effect of the modern suburban wasteland or something about youth engaging in crime. Hey, this could even be a film coming out.) at hand. He spends a lot of time creating many symbols, both material and surrealistic allegorical, but they seem to symbolize nothing interesting. <br /> <br /> The most fatal flaw, however, is that the filmmakers paint all their characters in a coarse shade of vanilla. There are hardly any distinctive features that help to understand their purpose and, as secondary characters (especially the intricate relationship between Armin and his rather normal - perhaps too normal - family), catalyze the already developed "difficult situation" of the main character, never get into focus. How should we identify ourselves with the rebellion of this young, almost adult person, with a slight sensation of the world in which he lives, or of the outstanding figures around him who help compose him? <br /> <br /> Many people come and go from the film (including a kind of girlfriend Armina Kate and a strange rich visitor who for some reason gets pleasure from the main character eating cake) and seems to exist for no reason at all. Ultimately, they seem just to be lengthy additions to an already subtle story with meaningless plots, which continue to prove that the film does not make it clear where to go next. <br /> <br /> And even the film, which supposedly plays with reality (especially Armin’s nightly feats), ends with a literal, almost moralizing dizziness, which seems to stop questions to a “story” that does little, but puts viewer in a state of pointlessly exhausted confusion. <br /> <br /> Without any color it is impossible to obscure anything vital.
