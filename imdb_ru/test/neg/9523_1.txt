Unlike one of the reviewers below, I do not think that the director of this inept and tedious work in the umbilical cord should expect a great brilliant career. While it is nice to see a British director trying to go beyond the agreement, AKAâ€™s only claim to innovation glory is based on the novelty of the triple screen. At first you think that this may be an interesting device, but its only real contribution to the film is to test your vision and patience. Seeing the same character from three different points of view in a two-dimensional film does not make it more revealing or difficult. If you can forget about the triple screen (which, of course, is very difficult to do), you will have to face an unintentionally hilarious scenario. The audience is beaten for the British system of classes. The film has the political and emotional sophistication of the episode Above and Below. To summarize: the emperor's new clothes. And pretty bad outfit too.
