There is only one word to define the whole movie, it is terrible. The way "Basically Martha" has been redone is awful. The name of the movie is terrible. The actors are terrible. And the idea of ​​combining good cooking and the United States is terrible. If you saw "Bella Martha", this is the original name and it means "Beautiful Martha", this is a blow to the stomach. Miss Jones' play is so poor and unnatural that even Jessica Alba, considered one of the worst actresses (http://www.razzies.com/history/05nomActr.asp), would have done better. Not to mention the cook, which is better to play another role. And a little girl ... not worth mentioning. Bella Martha was a very good film, genuine ... why was it remade? There was a story .... so they pulled it out. There is no story ... What will this represent? On the one hand, this film was perfect. Do you know when all the ingredients go together? Well, this is the case here. Perfect shit ....
