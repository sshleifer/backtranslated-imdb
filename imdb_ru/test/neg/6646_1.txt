I saw this movie, but not in one sitting. What happens when he plays on TV, I watch for a few minutes, discover that I have everything I can take, and then leave the room. During these few minutes, I never laugh, never enjoy what I see, and feel even more depressed, angry. Interestingly, they tell me that psychological states are incompatible, that is, one cannot be angry and depressed at the same time. This film tests this theory. <br /> <br /> I think part of the problem is that I spent almost ten years in Chicago, since I watch scenes, I think about my own experience in this rotten city, and therefore I carry most of your luggage. Quite possibly, I am ready to admit that if you are not a resident of Chicago, you will find this piece funny. If so, then I envy you. <br /> <br /> And yet. John Hughes put his films in Chicago, and these films helped me. I think the difference is that Hughes was a first-class writer. I think it is obvious that he knew how to comically balance his situations, and also make his characters sympathetic and believable. In comedy (as opposed to farce), this balance is vital. And this is not easy to achieve. If it were all, we made great films, and we would not have to worry, as in the real world, wondering when the genius will appear. In “The Adventures of Childcare” this is not the case. I hated these characters. <br /> <br /> There is a difference, deep and real, between sympathetic and just pathos. <br /> <br /> For me, every scene in this film is nothing. There is no humor, no humanity, no people whom no one will know. It's just that the actors read their lines, as if this is all they can do to keep from screaming, sure that the fun will finally begin, this time for sure! It's like watching the antics of very bad comedians. It is embarrassing, and after a while, usually at the moment when I get up and leave, I begin to feel pity for all interested parties, which, in my opinion, is a kind of emotional connection. Elizabeth Shu is terrible. She does not act, of course, does not act comically, and it is quite possible that she can not. But lord, as she tries. She looks older than 17 years old and behaves much younger, like a seven-year-old schoolboy, confident that this is how they get an award. And she is not alone. As if everyone cannot relax and let the fairytale flow. As if everyone just has no idea what they are doing. <br /> <br /> Now this was an early effort for Chris Columbus, and he clearly improved, and undoubtedly the best writers (for example, John Hughes himself) helped, so maybe you need a little pardon. But the film just smells of despair. However, as I said, this may work for some. If you like any of the above, and some reviewers definitely liked it, then take a DVD and go out. Otherwise, avoid this mess, as in a dark alley in Chicago, where, when you are in a hurry, you can only see the shadows and hear the muttering threats.
