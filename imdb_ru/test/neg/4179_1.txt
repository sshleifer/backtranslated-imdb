If you want to enjoy the money that you would spend on renting this money, buy an ice bag and see how it melts. This is more interesting than this movie. <br /> <br /> Bill Cowell, shame on you. <br /> <br /> Or if you want to watch this plot of the film, go to the corn field, bring the two most annoying little girls you can find, run a couple of hours while the girls scream as loudly as possible. Then send me a couple of bucks you spent. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the first Dark Harvest, after watching the sequel, I will pay myself to sleep.
