Seeing this film in the preview, I thought that he would be witty and in a good mood. Unfortunately, it was a standard case of “funny bits were in the preview,” not to mention that everything was bad. But "good moments were in the preview." <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie for teens that puts you to bed, then watch this movie.
