What ended: Kasparov and Mashina are doing everything possible to immerse themselves in the soul of Garry Kasparov during the 1997 competition against Deep Blue IBM. You see that he is becoming more and more paranoid and more and more disheveled, because in the second game Deep Blue made a move that seemed too human for his preconceived notion of chess computers. Then Kasparov thought and still thinks that IBM has deceived. <br /> <br /> Game Over is trying to seem impartial, but it is clear that the director believes that IBM has cheated. However, they do not provide any real evidence to support the fraud, only hints that IBM’s security surrounding the computer room was that IBM really had the grandmasters there who blocked the computer in certain key cases, and Kasparov’s statement that the computer did not play as the computer usually does in one moment in the second game. In the second game, Kasparov played a game designed to deceive a computer, trying to sacrifice a pawn in a situation where previous computer chess programs would take a pawn, which led to a possible loss of a computer. Deep Blue did not take the bait, and Kasparov was so excited because the computer seemed to play like a human being, that he didn’t even see that he could play Deep Blue for a draw and ended up retiring. This game infuriated him, so that he could not recover, and after playing games 3,4 and 5 for a draw, he terribly lost the game 6. <br /> <br /> The question of whether IBM deceived everything comes down to this single move in the second game, when Deep Blue made a move that anyone could have done, but until that moment, he powered the computers. Joel Benjamin, a chess grandmaster at the IBM team of programmers, explained in the documentary that they knew that chess computers were always confused in this situation, and therefore spent a lot of time and effort programming Deep Blue to avoid mistakes, which other computers do. If you believe the statement of Benjamin, then the case is clear, IBM is not deceived. Unfortunately, the director quickly moved on and never mentioned IBM’s explanation for the rest of the film, preferring to shrink between the falsification of the 19th century chess of “The Turk” and the frames of Deep Blue, hinting that Deep Blue was really human controlled. As someone who has an understanding of programming, an IBM explanation makes sense — if you knew what you were doing, it would not be terribly difficult to insert something into the code so that, if conditions were thus achieved, then do so and so - in other words, tell the computer what to do if ever there is a situation similar to the one that Kasparov created in game 2. This is not a hoax, this is a good job of programming a chess computer. <br /> <br /> In the end, it’s clear that the director thinks that IBM was deceiving, and repeated comments that IBM’s shares are growing 15% a day when Deep Blue won, suggests that IBM has been deceived to raise the price of their shares (Kasparov even compares IBM and Deep Blue with Enron). Nevertheless, both in chess and in the computer community there are many third-party opinions that Deep Blue won honestly and fairly, and Kasparov lost because he simply could not move away from his view of computers as "stupid machines" and fainted. in a car that didn't seem so stupid after all. I just want the director to let us see an alternative opinion. <br /> <br />
