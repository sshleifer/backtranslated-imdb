The story is not very strong. Don't expect the movie to look like Bourne. This is the beginning of a strong one, Tara spoke in Russian, and it even sounded believable. (Not that I was an expert on the Russian language.) Moscow had such a gloomy and gloomy look that gave the potential of this film, I still believed in it. Unfortunately, it took only half an hour to see that they really missed the place with it. It was bad to act, perhaps because the story itself was not very strong. In the film there is this part where Gordon Patrick (Nick Moran) is on the phone with C.I.A., as if you are listening to a Chinese synchronizer. W.T.F!? It is a pity that the writer did not even make much effort to give the main characters depth. In addition, some cheap and easy finish. <br /> <br /> Plus - almost every scene in which Tara Reid plays. Not that she behaves so well, in fact, no. But she really looks great in this movie. Overall, this was a bit of a disappointment. Rolled material ??. Maybe.
