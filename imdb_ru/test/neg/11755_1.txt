I know that curiosity killed the cat, but I just had to see a remake of Psycho, especially after a recent trip to Hitchcock and knowledge of his work. I watched the original film “Psycho”, although from my childhood I knew how to respect him, and not only that, it was a great movie! One of the best, in fact! The first thing I said when I heard about the remake was “How did you remake perfection?”. I also adhered to this, but I think that now I have a more open look, and I thought that maybe it was a way to introduce Psycho to a new generation. <br /> <br /> But it turned into a complete insult and slap in the face of the original Psycho. I know that it was said, but I watched the creation of this film, and the director said: “Oh, I just want to update it and shoot every scene, shot behind the scenes, like the original” ... What the hell is there? ! Good, but I want to judge this film separately, despite the insulting blows of the original. I mean, the acting was not at the proper level, but to be honest, it seems that the actors simply watched the original and simply memorized the lines from there and made them their own shitty ones. In this film, I wanted to slap Anne Hush, she said: "I have never seen the original, I just wanted to work with Gus." Oh, it made me angry, because, to be honest, it’s not only that she really got involved in this role of Marian, she wasn’t convincing, not to mention that her soul scene was really horrible. Vince Vaughn did not ... let's say, the film was terribly wrong. It was a sin against the movie, and in itself it was a bad movie. It was too much and destroyed what could be a new presentation for the new generation. But Gus, leave the film to someone who knows what they are doing! <br /> <br /> 1/10
