Zoey 101 is mainly about a girl named Zoey, who goes to a boarding school for all boys during the first year, when they integrate girls into her. This rough storyline, I admit, is a pretty good idea. Although this show was intended for children, a five-year-old child could probably point out his fatal flaws. Firstly, Zoe is a clich√© character, she is very popular, super attractive, super smart, and she is fine; no girl is like that. It seems that the show attracted special attention to Jamie Lynn Spears and increased her fame. Dana, who appeared at the beginning of the first season, is just despicable. However, in my opinion, she was probably the most realistic character of all, and it is sad to see that Dana is never cute. Nicole is too vigorous and behaves like total nonsense, but in a mysterious way gets direct A. It seems that Lola can fool something with her acting skills worthy of Emmy. Quinn must be very clever, and although she is capable of creating the most unreal things, she also looks weird and she never has guys, although she is beautiful and clever, while Zoe, Lola and Nicole get guys, and all of them beautiful women, not personality. Chase and Michael are very similar, and sometimes I even confuse them. Logan is unreal rich, and gives out millions, as if they were dollars. No one is so rich. I also noticed that every character in the series matters to that girl Stacy, who does only nice things with them. It's not funny! It means, and it just affects young girls to act meanly with absolutely good people. Finally, the school itself adds zest to the unreal cake, providing students with 5-star amenities such as a picturesque location, a sushi bar, a hot rest room with free vending machines for drinks, a pool and jacuzzi, a cinema and a manual for boys and girls. free to enter dorm rooms of the other sex. In the majority of boarding schools, if a boy went to a hostel for a girl or vice versa, he would be excluded. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, Zoe 101 was poorly written and had to spend a few more years preparing the process.
