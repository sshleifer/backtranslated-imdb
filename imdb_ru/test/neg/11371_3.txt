Although “Meltdown” is not as bad as some films (for example, the terrible “Atomic Twister”), it still relies on common misconceptions and inaccuracies in the nuclear power industry to promote its plot. I am currently studying nuclear engineering in search of a master's degree, and it was easy to point out flaws that would be obvious to anyone associated with this industry. <br /> <br /> On the false fear that a collapse in the Chernobyl style could happen in an American factory, and the film says that any fall (even a partial one, according to one of the invited commentators in the film) would mean a catastrophe for that district. In fact, partial melting at a US plant, destroying the core, poses no risk to the surrounding area. Three Mile Island survived partial melting, and radioactive material did not enter the environment at all, due to the natural stability of the fuel design and core used in this country, combined with a substantial protective jacket. <br /> <br /> The security steps shown in the film were perhaps part of the film, the furthest from the truth. In any important strategic location — be it a power station, a chemical plant, a military base, whatever — you will never see the staff react to anxiety by running around and talking as if it were an undeclared workout. This is especially true at a nuclear power plant, where when an alarm is triggered, the reactors will be immediately discharged, turning them off. SCREENING can be done with a single click of a button in the control room (you do not need to put the core into “shutdown mode”, as shown in the film), and nuclear fission chemistry prevents the core from returning to power for about 9 hours from SCRAM. Thus, if this scenario is played out in real life, the attackers will not be able to cause a significant crisis. Theoretically, they can still cause partial due to residual heat if they immediately put out the core, but this would be almost impossible, given the numerous backup systems present in the plant - there is much more than single standby pumps that they talk about in the movie. <br /> <br /> With regard to spent fuel pools, it is possible to turn pools into a dirty bomb by detonating them, but it’s much more difficult than just putting a truck full of explosives. near the pools. The fuel is under (approximately) 18 feet of high purity water. Water can not become radioactive (there is no radioactive steam, which is referred to in the film). Particles dissolved in water can, but water itself cannot; Thus, the reason for very thorough cleansing. Thus, the only way to turn a fuel pool into a dirty bomb is to extract fuel from the water. This is not an easy task, as the water is very heavy, and the pools are underground with very thick concrete walls. Explosives must be in the pool under the fuel (which is securely fixed). And there should be a lot of explosives, as the water is very hard carried by the explosion. Even if this happened, the spent fuel would not have been extremely radioactive, and the explosion would not have caused almost as many dead as mentioned in the film, especially given the small amount of radioactive material that will be distributed. <br /> <br /> From the basic point of view of the movie, I'm a little tired of the style used. Permanent appearance and disappearance, the use of sandy black and white, as well as fast tracking and panning looked amateur. The characters were one-dimensional, especially in the US government. I have some problems with the rotation of the film, but I will not discuss it, since it will be a serious spoiler. <br /> <br /> Overall, 3/10
