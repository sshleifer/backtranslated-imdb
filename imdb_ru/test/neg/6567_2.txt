While “Star Trek” in the movie was mostly boring, “Star Trek to the last frontier” is clearly bad. In this terrible continuation, the team goes ashore when it receives a distress signal from the Federation that the ambassadors representing Earth, Romulus and Kronos (the Klingons' homeworld) have been abducted by the renegade Vulcan, who is trying to get a spaceship to risk the big barrier. There he hopes to find God. Using mysticism and bad writing, he convinces many senior officers of the Enterprise to betray Kirk and take possession of the ship. They reach the inside of the great barrier and find a planet where they meet a god-like alien. It's so bad that it's hard to know where to start. At the heart of a good idea that has never been developed. The plot goes nowhere instead of where no one has gone before. It's almost like the authors had no idea how to put an end to this fiasco. The action scenes do not have the expectation of Anger Kahn, philosophy is boring, and humor is outdated. Now I will focus most of my anger on William Shatner. When he takes the director's chair, the ego becomes bigger. Much of the attention is focused on him, Spoke and McCoy, but does not give the rest enough to do. Moreover, while Shatner is usually guilty of excessive actions in previous films and television programs, he is simply not good at this. Now Kirk is reckless, the prankster is practical and stupid. In one of the worst scenes involved three leaders singing the song "Row Row Row your Boat" in the round by the fire. In any case, this is the worst Star Trek franchise. I should have given him three out of ten instead of five.
