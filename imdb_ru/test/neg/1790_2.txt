I have been a big fan of Lynn Peterson since her breakthrough role in the 1988 blockbuster Extreme North, and although I loved her in yet another film, Slow (2004), where she plays Francis, this is her strongest role. <br /> <br /> Lynn, as I am sure you all know (or should), plays a decisive role in Driver. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, other than the amazing performance of Lynn, I am afraid that this film doesn’t need much. <br /> <br /> Oh, wait - there was one more thing - amazing editing creativity to remove profanity for viewers. , Memorable lines such as: “You, son-of-the-gun”, “You, son-witches!”, “Shoot!” And “Well, forget it!” <br /> <br /> OK Until. <br /> <br /> PS: Does anyone know where I can get another poster of Lynn Peterson?
