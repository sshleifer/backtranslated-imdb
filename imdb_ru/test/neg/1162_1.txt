I got this movie for fifty cents on sale. I want my fifty cents back. Bad game, bad script writing, lousy manual, historically inaccurate, even the sound of a movie is terrible. This is not a subject that offends. I am one of many who find films with uncertainty and real crime films very interesting. This question could be taken more seriously, with much greater attention to detail and accuracy, and a lack of respect for the victims and their devastated friends and family enough to perplex anyone. In addition, little attention is paid to what could cause someone to start the strange behavior that Ed Gein was demonstrating when playing these horrible crimes. <br /> <br /> Save your time and efficiency. Do not watch this horrible movie. If you bought it, you have my sympathy. Although it is not a complete waste ... You can throw away the disc and use a plastic case!
