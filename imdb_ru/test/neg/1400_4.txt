Stylized Hollywood westerns, full of familiar conventions, as if they live forever, and this is an avatar. It seems that everything that was in it was deleted from the back of the 1939 drawer, a larger budget was applied, and this production became a problem. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper played such a role dozens of times - a displaced Southerner, quick to draw and firm with honor, although, if possible, rather calm. He plays Blade Hollister, who travels to Texas in search of a gang that destroyed his cotton plantations. He wears a shirt with a deerskin and packs two six hands with an ivory handle. He says with a distorted accent: "Feller may suffer by doing this." (See “Sergeant York.”) The group is led by mocking Raymond Massey, who buys and sells land, usually with backstage tools, whenever possible. The gang includes Steve Cochran, who cannot play a Western man, although on the whole he is very good in bags with scum. Mandatory woman is Ruth Roman, the daughter of a Mexican plantation owner, who looks and says that she is Mexican, like brown Betty from Boston. <br /> <br /> I don’t think I’ll be too concerned about the plot. Without a doubt, someone has gone into this in some detail, and it is not worth mentioning much more. As in any Western 1939, this is a labyrinth. All but Cooper and his friends are backstage, they have many double crosses, a change of identities and hidden secrets. <br /> <br /> Everything is retro. The plot, dialogue, wardrobe, even music. Bill from resistant Warner Max Steiner. He is the guy who scored "King Kong". It was 1932. This film was released in 1950. <br /> <br /> By the way, Cooper's name - "Blayde Hollister" - prompted me to look through the records of RACA - Real American Cowboy Associaton - to see if that name appeared in their archives, which date back to the beginning of time and February 4, 1911 when the last Real Cowboy passed away due to an unsuccessful meeting with an abnormal baker. There has never been a real Cowboy named Blyde. Hollister, yes, but not Blade. In fact, there is no record of any real cowboy named Wade, Luke, Cole or Matt. The most popular names of the real cowboys in order of decreasing frequency were Clarence, Mortimer, Noble, Nebukadnezzar, Plavt, Pinchbek and Hortensia. <br /> <br /> If this film were released in 1939, it would have been a chore. In 1950, it is a terrible monument in the history of the processing of people.
