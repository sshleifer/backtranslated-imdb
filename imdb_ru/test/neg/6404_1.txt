This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I did not expect high expectations, but as soon as it started, I thought that this could be about. Jim Carrey did not seem to be trying, but he pronounced all his lines, as if he was a devilish cartoon character. All other actors seem to be trying their best, but partly wooden. The plot has a good foundation, but the melodramatic lines make it dull and somewhat silly. I laughed for the entire second half of the film, and after five minutes of this, I was tired of it. Most of the plot "twists" could be seen for a few miles. It's just not worth watching. I really would like me not to waste my time with it.
