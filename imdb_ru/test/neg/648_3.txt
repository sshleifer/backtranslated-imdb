"I suppose you are here to damage your mental scheme." - VAL <br /> <br /> Mike Nelson made me watch this ... he mentioned it in his book "Cinema Megasines". I asked myself: “Why did Mike Nelson send me wrong?” Now I know why the bots never trusted Mike Nelson. <br /> <br /> The music is written by John Williams, which is probably part of his payment to the Devil. In fact, I’m sure that anyone who worked on this film is probably allied with Slewfoot or now damned, from the executive director to the guy who drove the food truck near the studio. Do not look ... for the love of God ... do not look !!! Even the fact that you do not make a copy and do not show someone else will not curse you ... Now I am doomed, I understand that. I accept it. But save yourself ...
