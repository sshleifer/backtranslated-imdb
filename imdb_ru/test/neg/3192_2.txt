Perhaps one of the worst films ever made, I'm still trying to figure out if this should be funny, but surely I wasn’t fun at all. Maybe the film lost something during the English-Italian translation, I don’t know, for sure I miss my courage to watch it again in the original version. <br /> <br /> My score is 2/10, and I feel that I’m pretty generous (say, 1 point for Liv, because she’s a good baby, and another for those decent actors who have fallen into useless, useless and pathetic film) <br /> <br /> Take care of yourself <br /> Alex
