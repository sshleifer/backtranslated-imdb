This bastard mysteriously often rotates on one channel, and again and again I look in horror. The scenario is similar to something that one could find with friends for too many drinks, and the production figures perfectly match. <br /> <br /> It is intended for a children's film, but with a grotesque (and poorly explained) abduction. scene; star dog lacks the quality of a star, equal only to other actors; and in general it looks as if it was filmed in the backyard (in a climate football game, no more than three dozen extras, unfortunately, rejoicing in the background). <br /> <br /> It even turns out to be a budget film behind the scenes, when the story, to its relief, simply stops. The main players here should be either manufacturers, or most of the extras from a football game!
