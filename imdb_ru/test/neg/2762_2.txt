Good composition ... A good idea, but it turns out that it is wrong, since hypnosis is not allowed as evidence in court. So many good actors, and they all act so badly! So why did all of them get attracted by this confusion ... And yes, it has its advantages, such as lighting, etc. ... But in the end I was surprised at two things ... How could such a great talent lead to strange mess? What is the emphasis Nigel Hawthorne puts on? He was / was a great actor, and what is the accent? Is it impossible to identify? What was he trying to do? Maybe this is his subtle indication, as if he told us: “I got in touch with the turkey, so this is a shitty accent!”
