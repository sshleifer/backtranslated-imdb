Obviously, many people who saw this are confused. The original name “Cottonmouth Joe” would allow looking better at things for the most part of the audience. I personally experienced the state of the paperman (often accompanied by a really bad hangover after the weekend over the weekend), and it is really very similar to the movie “Skeleton” - a dry, disgusting film that regrets a recent choice and asks for a hot shower. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the choice of “Skeletonist” for the title was finally determined by the distributor (perhaps the work of some stupid studio artist who simply did not receive it), and not “CottonMon Jo”. Those of us who have seen the movie know that the Skeleton is in fact Cotton-on-Joe (skeletal-masculine vision, not a real Skeleton). Deception of people advertising this film is unforgivable, and only for this I can not give this film a high rating. Imagine: when the future directors get together to create a real final film "Skeleton", and they need a name, they will be completely screwed up, and we all, as serious fans of the genre, are reduced for this. <br /> <br /> Cottonmouth Joe could be a horror film icon right there, next to Mad Marz, Black Claw, Manskito, Hamongous, “Fight of the Nature” Billy Conners, wooden doll Morti, Bougain, Ego, Lunar Monster, Bloody Bill, the driller Killer, Mickey Rooney, etc., But he will always be remembered as a mannequin with a sword in a cape, tied face to face, wanting the skeleton of a horse. <br /> <br /> This is very bad
