Sorry, but I cannot even partially agree with some comments about this terrible piece ... <br /> <br /> English is not my native language, because I am a German citizen, so please do not blame me for inappropriate grammatical structures or something like that * I can't understand why this movie got such a high rating? 6.3 ??? Are you kidding me? This film does not make any sense, it does not even seem that it plays well ... <br /> <br /> When I looked at the comments to the Da Vinci Code, which, I think, has almost the same rating, I had hitting my head on the table, because I watched "00 Schneider" right after Sacrilega, and, my God, there are worlds between them. <br /> <br /> Most of the posters on this board rip apart all the popular films while evaluating this crime of making a film from 6.3 and nominates Helge as a genius. Of course, he knows how to make money, but I think the main aspect of your opinion is the fact that German is not your first language, and you just ignore - or rather do not notice a bunch of crap that says in the sentence. Well, I have to admit that some scenes are funny, but overall, 6.3 is too much for my compatriot;)
