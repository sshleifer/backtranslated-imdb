I was looking forward to it, based on the reviews and a pretty good rating. It was a big disappointment. It does not hold a candle for modern zombie films such as Shawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead, Land of the Dead, etc. Dreadful films sometimes take time to start, you have to create characters to kill them. You feel some sympathy, etc., but even in this case, you have 45 minutes to sit here before you smell the corpse, until that moment, it's like watching a bad show, nothing interesting or meaningful. It does not happen, and if you watch it for the first time, you can honestly start looking after 45 minutes, you will not miss anything from the plot. When things go, all this is not very quality. Some of the killings and makeup are done well, others are done very poorly, the sequence is not enough here, and there are some really shocking continuity mistakes and some of the most wooden actions I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> All this can be bearable if you really believe that all this was happening on an airplane, but with guns fired with an incendiary bomb, without pilots in the cockpit during a severe storm, but the airplane remains in the air, come on, we are not all simpletons. <br /> <br /> Yes, and is a fighter rocket really a full minute flying a plane that is several hundred yards away? I know that this is a film about zombies, and you have to stretch things, but this film, along with the other major defects listed above, was not credible. One to skip.
