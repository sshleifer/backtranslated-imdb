This film definitely made me laugh, but that doesn't mean that it was funny. Well, again, my friends and I had a lot of fun watching it. <br /> <br /> I doubt that this film has something that has not been done at least twice, just like the plot itself. All characters are a surplus of roles in a cardboard box that do not even require acting skills; accordingly, such skills are not delivered. We have a corrupt policeman, a ruthless killer who claims to take care of his people and their families, and at the same time does not care about the people he shoots in the forehead at such close distance that blood is sprinkled on his face. We have an “exhausted cop on the edge,” which is so nice to point out in the forums of this film; we have an old policeman who retired for one day, which almost everyone had to immediately identify as the most likely person from the inside, because he was most profitable, and he didn’t say a single trustworthy word throughout the film, about the same transparent as a glass house on a sunny day. The big black gangster king was a replica of all the previous big black gangster kings in cinema history (they could just call him Marcellus Wallace), but a little tougher and more ruthless because something must emphasize that we also know Lawrence Fishburne from good films. Then, finally, we have a HIGH EDUCATION DOCTOR who cannot come up with anything sensible, as soon as the situation is different from her usual life, and who spends most of the film, sitting helplessly in a corner, trying to figure out how to stay. the weapon she was given. NOT USING IT. <br /> <br /> The whole siege story is not interesting, not original (used twice before), and this film manages to add absolutely nothing interesting. There is an initial probe, then a siege, then an assault, then an attempt to escape. In the meantime, a bunch of tense, tense, anxious police officers and thugs managed to hold down a police assault team with the help of high-tech equipment and quite an important advantage of VISION. On the other hand, on a deep night, when a power outage and blizzard rage overhead, there is definitely a lot of light coming, so who really care about night vision. <br /> <br /> But the best comes right at the end. In the first scenes, showing the 13th section, we see that it is located on the outskirts of the industrial city; factories and office buildings surround it from all sides. From this point on, the besieged can pass a hundred meters into the sewer and where will they be? Some alley that ends right in the middle of the forest! FOREST! Where did this forest come from? Who decided to lay a pine forest in the middle of an industrial zone? How did this forest, in the last scene, suddenly end up on a hill above the city, while in the forest scenes it looked deceptively flat? <br /> <br /> From here I leave the decision to you and your common sense. Go and watch this movie, if you are looking for an unintended laugh, I can really recommend it.
