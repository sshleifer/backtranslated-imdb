Although sometimes it can be VERY tedious, this film is not so bad. The acting is pretty well done, although stereotypical, and production values ​​are quite high, considering some science fiction films that were supposed to appear later in this decade. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with this film is one of very outdated features in it. There is a guy from Texas, a “professional” scientist and, worst of all, a woman scientist who is finally aware of her femininity. For a film seeking to make a statement about humanity, he loses some of his influence, reducing his characters through sexist stereotypes.
