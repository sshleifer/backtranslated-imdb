Horror comedy fans will love this one. Others can quickly get angry and turn it off. This is a kind of fellow film, with brutal violence and blood, deliberately stereotypical characters and lots of madness. <br /> <br /> It looks like it was placed on a budget of about $ 100 guys from the fraternity after a big beer party. There is a presenter who is a frustrated nerd, and his friend, a tantalizing loud prank who mocks him about 30 times a second. Cool monster truck chases them for hundreds of miles, which is the highlight of the movie. Whenever this masked thing comes along, this is a great scene. A mysterious girl who accidentally appears in the back seat, and a lot of giant guys in overalls dangling in red pants. A nerd friend never closes his yelping and gets them in one mess after another. Their controversy got on my nerves, but other aspects of the film compensate for this. <br /> <br /> Spectacular jokes ridicule several "psycho-agonizing and trying to fool someone" films everywhere. Choose which one is the riffiest: the Hills have eyes, a saw and Jeepers Creepers - that's what I learned. <br /> <br /> This is a pleasant madness if you are in the right mood. Touch boring Brewskies with your friends can make watching more fun; This is a good bet that this is the state of the filmmakers when they put this thing together.
