When I started watching this, I immediately noticed that I could not understand what someone was saying. I increased the volume. With the background noise that was now booming, I could hear voices. What do the actors say? The film is not duplicated? Do they speak spanish? After some confusion, I understand that it was English. At least I think so ... Amazing Jess Franco placed the microphones too far from the actors. As a result, we cannot fully hear what they are saying. He did it before. But maybe this is the intention of Mr. Franco? Not knowing what people are saying, we plunge into some mystery about what is happening, and we have more visual clues left ... Maybe it's just me, but I would like to know what is happening! How about a few tips? The basic premise (I refuse to call it a "conspiracy") concerns a young American exotic dancer named Paula (played by Amber Newman) who has a boyfriend who invites her to a small island owned by some dirty rich people. It is somewhere off the coast of Spain. For this visit, Paula promises a large cash payment that the guy receives. Then he escapes from the island to return later. What for? Pay close attention to the scene where the guy opens Paula's passport to the USA. Although his hand tried to hide it, you can see the real name of the actress, Amber Newman, printed under the photo at the bottom of the passport !! Be that as it may, let us return to the "story": on the island there are still a few sloppy, rich, beautiful characters with ambiguous motives. We see sadistic games (are they real or fake?) And unattractive lunch scenes. But the food should be good, as her fake French chef cooked! There is a servant of a young woman who runs around naked and never speaks. Is she really dumb? And we care? Of course, in this film all women are mostly naked ... Oh, well, we can at least be thankful that men (over 50 and more) are dressed! In addition to the terrible sound quality, oh Jess Franco, I always admired his amazing ability to shoot beautiful naked women in such a way that the viewer completely disconnected. This film is no exception ?? I need fresh air after watching! <br /> <br /> In conclusion: I am pleased to report that no matter what Mr. Franco can dream of, women still attract me.
