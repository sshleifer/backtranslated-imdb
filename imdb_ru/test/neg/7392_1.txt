I went to see "TKIA" with high expectations, which may affect my opinion about it. I've seen all the Dogme movies, and this TKIA is definitely the worst. The story is intertwined with the themes of Shakespeare's play “King Lear”, but she never succeeds in capturing the public and forcing her to take care. Directing actors is very free, even for Dogma movies, and leads to a poor indefinable game. In this story there are no dynamics at all, and I very soon lost interest. There are several scenes in the film that will shake the viewer, but I don’t think they have improved the story at all. Mifunes Sidste Sang and Festen are both Dogmefilms, which turned out to be well-directed and had good storylines, so I will look forward to the best Dogmefilms in the future. Perhaps Aake Sandgren's “Invisible Man 6” will again raise the quality. For he, as Winterberg and S.K. Jacobsen is an experienced and educated director.
