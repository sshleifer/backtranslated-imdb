Warning, spoilers ahead (even if I doubt that no one has yet seen this) <br /> <br /> The film starts off pretty well, but about halfway through it falls apart and becomes a banal, sweet, predictable and unrealistic mess of "romantic harmony" . I mean, it’s quite obvious that there are serious problems in the marriage of the main characters, but these problems are never solved, but simply forgotten. <br /> <br /> In fact, as soon as she decides to have a child behind her back (even without asking), all their problems magically disappear without a trace or explanation. Considering what was happening up to this point, it would be much more logical if the marriage broke up, and did not become commonplace and cliche, when you have a child, everything will change. <br /> <br /> Two main characters “Families and neighbors are also extremely one-dimensional and seem to serve no purpose, if they don’t annoy the viewer, and they also mysteriously disappear from the film as soon as the moments of harmony begin. <br /> <br /> I’m sorry that I’m tearing up this film, but considering the beginning, I was expecting something more. 4/10 for me.
