Yes, this review may contain spoilers, but you thank me for it. This is the worst movie I have seen lately. I came to this board, expecting to see the same response as mine, but for unknown reasons, there are several people who love this film and especially the play of Spacey. <br /> <br /> Some will punish me for it, but I find Kevin Spacey is quite limited, despite the fact that the world admires him. I felt that I was watching a more vile version of Kevin's American Beauty. His character in this film is ridiculously exaggerated, down to his ridiculous insults, which he throws at his assistant. <br /> <br /> There are universal banal and boring scenes, for example, when Spacey rushes to Whale to bring him Equal instead of sweat and low. For some reason, I suspected that this particular scene was supposed to be funny, but by that time I was ready to press the “Stop” button (after about 20 minutes of the movie). <br /> <br /> How about falsehood to "Dogs"? Whaley announces: "I think I saw it in a movie once," as if he were going to cut off Spacey's ear. But what does he use to cut it? The envelope! That's right, he is going to give him paper cuts! This must be one of the worst Hollywood scenes in history, and the fact that the actors and directors tried to do it with a bare face, makes it even more terrifying. <br /> <br /> I admit that I don’t see the end of this film (my DVD, fortunately, is blocked about half an hour before the end), but anyone who wants to say can spare me what I’m missed a big twist and everything would make sense. Well, I don’t care what happened in the end, because it can never make up for all this bad game and relentless dialogue. I even had the feeling that the actors themselves wanted to get out of this film as badly as I did.
