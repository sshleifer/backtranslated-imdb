I watched "LOST" with my family from the first episode, it was great. Last season was very disappointing, it seems that they (the writers) do not know what to do with the series, so they continue to try to make up for it, stretching one storyline in the whole episode. The current season, which, by the way, I decided to continue to look only to see Rodrigo Santoro, and also with a little hope that everything will be better; there was one disappointment after another; my husband and son even stopped looking. First of all, he (Santoro) appears only for 30 seconds in each episode. But the real problem with the storyline, NOTHING REALLY HAPPENS ANYTHING, each episode could be shown in 15 minutes. We watch each episode, expecting something that will never happen; I'm not asking every secret to be revealed right away, but what about variations in storylines? In the first and second seasons we had different storylines, we saw the story of the characters, a little action, a little romance, now it looks like one big event that reveals the entire episode. Watching him is almost tedious, when it ends, you get the feeling that you have lost time. Now it is important to note that the actors are still great. I can't believe that they killed Mr. Eco (Adelawale ...), he was great, Jack (Matthew Fox) is still an incredible, ideal hero, so kind, generous, Brave. Sawyer (Josh Holloway), the “bad guy,” softens a bit because of Kate (Evangeline Lilly), but that's cool. I miss Said (Navin Andrews), Song and Jin (Youn-Jin Kim and Daniel De Kim), they are all an important part of the story (or should be), but we hardly see them. I hope that Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro) will play a big role in the show; if not, why did you influence his participation in the show so much (Access Hollywood, etc.)? Sorry if I rumble too long, but I feel deceived by this show. When I started to look, it was great, I got used to it, and now it's very sad to see how everything goes. I will be here, hoping for improvements !!! Katia
