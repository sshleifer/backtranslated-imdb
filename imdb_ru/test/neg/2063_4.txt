There are those who resent that this is NOT an opera, but then they do not argue with the movie CABARET, which was not an original show. All movies of musicals / operas are and must be "adaptations", otherwise they do not work. CABARET took more freedom with the original show than the PORGY AND BESS film, and yet it retained its original integrity, reworking the material, and is considered an artistic success. The same applies to “PORGY AND BESS” - it turned the opera into a dialogue / song libretto, because the audience at that time loved musicals, but stayed away from several operas shot by Eht. For Preminger, it would be an economical suicide to create a film about opera - it would lose a fortune for Goldwyn. <br /> <br /> However, this is a great adaptation. The acting game is gorgeous, the André Osvin Oscar winning award is gorgeous, as is the choir singing, and the individual vocal achievements are incredible. Robert McFerrin (dad of the popular musician Bobby McFerrin) was named Porgy, and Adel Addison was named Bess. While Sammy Davis Jr. sang his own songs in the film, his recording contract would not allow him to hear his voice on the soundtrack album, so Cab Calloway recorded his numbers (effectively) for this release. Brock Peters’s bass / baritone is extraordinary, and Pearl Bailey is her own unique personality. Diaann Carroll, although a good singer, plays Clara's small role, which requires a high soprano, so old reliable Marnie Nixon called her singing. <br /> <br /> The Gershwin Estate hates the film and refuses to grant musical rights, although the dramatic rights are freely available. This kind of hate hostility has delayed the release of CAROUSEL video for almost fifteen years (although in this case these were dramatic rights that were in the lawsuit) and currently prevents the release of both PORGY and BESS and ANNIE GET YOUR to video <br /> <br /> Of all the stage performances presented by film versions, the last two are the only ones who refrain from video. Only a letter campaign on the Gershwin estate in New York can weaken the reserve.
