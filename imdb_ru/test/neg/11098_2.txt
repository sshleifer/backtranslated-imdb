Well, I admit that I still associate Sophie Marceau with La Boum. That was the main reason I went to see this movie. But it was so boring that I almost fell asleep. Sorry, but her actress talents are not very convincing. In addition, this film was presented as having outstanding special effects and CGI. Yes, for B-Movie, it's not that bad. Seeing her in the "Marquis" a few years ago (also a very crappy film), I thought that she would play more convincingly. But La Boom (and, perhaps, James Bond of "peace is not enough") seems to be the only good films with her. Is this her “talent”, does she have a bad taste when choosing films or is it just a failure?
