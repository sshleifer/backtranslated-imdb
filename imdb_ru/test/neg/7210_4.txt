In this sequel, only by the name of the classic ROADHOUSE is the DEA agent (John Shek), who comes to the aid of his uncle (Will Patton) when the uncle is brutally beaten by the local gang of drugs, led by that wooden Indian from actor Jake Busey. The gang wants to seize the poor man's bar for heinous reasons. Patrick Swayze is missing here. Schaech is an indifferent actor, and he is not convincing as a vigorous lawyer. The battles here are intermittent and not as strong or vicious as the battles in ROADHOUSE. The final is equally weak. Some beautiful women keep things afloat for some time. There is a terrific fight between the type of Daisy Duke, which turns out to be useful with both fists and weapons, and a nasty-looking kid, Busey, who is comfortable with sharp cannons. In the beginning there is also a poorly dressed girl who is Sheikhâ€™s partner, but unfortunately she never appears in the film. Very bad. She does a short lap dance for Schaech, which was my complete attention. ROADHOUSE 2, to say nothing else, starts with a strip club, which is pretty darn close to what a real strip club looks like, which is a rare circumstance in any film. Rest time retry.
