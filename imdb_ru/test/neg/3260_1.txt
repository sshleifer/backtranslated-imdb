Watch this movie ..... just to truly appreciate how good the original is. It's not very difficult to please me, but it was one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It hurts a lot because I like Chevy Chase, Jackie Mason and Diane Cannon. The letter was just awful! I thought Chevy would at least recommend something better than him. There was nothing to laugh about in this movie. I went into it, wanting to enjoy it. I wanted to laugh, but I almost cried. <br /> <br /> In the first credits he read "Special appearance" from the Chevy Chase. It worried me from the start. Chevy is actually more than I thought. This is more than a "special appearance." It is a pity that the appearance was not special. Mason's character would be a good minor character, but he was getting older as the main character. I would prefer to see more (much more) Diane Cannon. At least her character was funny, if not very well written. I also missed the teen sex scene gratuatis. Mr. Gopher has evolved from a sweet and innocent into an annoying rodent, which is deserved to blow up. Jonathan Silverman - the only character that interested me, and we did not see him enough. <br /> <br /> I am taking him back. Try ... see half of this film, then ... remember Alamo, Maine and CaddyShaka I.
