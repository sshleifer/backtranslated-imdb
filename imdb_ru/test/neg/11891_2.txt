While studying at the university, our professor of philosophy, Mr. R., played us "Roger and me" in full. This was at a time when obesity was still unknown; a charlatan created, a name that will soon become a household, still busy sharpening their skills to bend facts and still learn to manipulate easily impressed, pathologically paranoid, mentally ill, sexually upset, illiterate, semi-literate, ignorant and ridiculously trusting among you. <br /> <br /> When we finished viewing it, I thought, “Yes, it was somewhat funny - in a completely insane rabbit Bugs” is a kind of way - but what a biased, anti-capitalist propaganda turkey, which has no objectivity, her only goal is to take cheap pictures of people and ideas to whom the filmmaker has addictions. a documentary film of any fantasy. "However, our favorite Marxist professor was delighted with R & M, and we not only did not end up criticizing any of its aspects, but Mr. R. actually spent the rest of the class praising him." qualities. ”Just for us to understand each other, the words“ propaganda ”,“ manipulation of the viewer ”,“ left extremist ”or“ selective presentation of the facts ”never went out of his constantly smiling mouth ... And just to remind you: it should have been be a class of philosophy, and do not LEARN YOURSELF STUDENTS WITH YOUR OWN POLITICAL course. <br /> <br /> In any case, I’m now moving to a really interesting aspect: this professor, Mr. R., is currently a very successful screenwriter in Hollywood. He wrote several left-wing scenarios stars of class "A". <br /> <br /> The moral of this story: these are the people for whom all the doors in Hollywood are open. <br /> Michael Moore is a talentless director (which he proved beyond doubt in “Canadian bacon”), but, being a Marxist liberal, opens the door to almost everyone. Tinseltown is teeming with frantic supporters of Chavez, so political brainwashing through simplified representations of reality has been an integral part of Hollywood experience for many decades. <br /> <br /> Accept this demagogue and you betrayed your brain forever.
