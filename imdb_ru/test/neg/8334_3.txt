When the film began, I felt that it would be something special. Actor and camera work, of course, were good. I also liked the characters, and I could empathize with them. There was a good atmosphere in the film, and there was some hint of fantasy. <br /> <br /> However, as soon as the film continued, the plot did not seem to take off, but simply appeared on the scene. I could not understand the connection between the stories. All I could see were characters who occasionally ran into each other, and links to ships in bottles. Without this connection, I just left a few unremarkable stories. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that everything worked out in Cannes
