“The Evil That People Do” (1984) was one of the few non-cannon films made by Charlie Bronson in the 1980s. Unlike most Cannon films that Charlie starred in, this movie was not fun or interesting. Charlie basically tortures and brutalizes people for more than an hour and a half. If you used to think that he is Mr. Emotion, wait until you see it! <br /> <br /> In this, Charlie travels to an unnamed Central American country and shows the population that whoever mixes with Chuck or his people must pay for the piper. It is not fun. This is not trashy or indecent, just brutal, sadistic and not in a good way. <br /> <br /> I did not like it. I have no love for this film. No recommendations, because you should not look. Maybe if they had not cut him out of it. Look with care. <br /> <br /> Don't worry.
