Well, this film was the worst show I have seen in recent years. The actors were not bad (I thought it was a b-movie, so they were filmed in the b-movie). In any case, I watched this movie, thinking, Oh, COOL a science fiction UFO film. WRONG. For radical Christians, this was simply a pretext to impose a message on people. The last scene was extremely confused. This is a terrible thing to make a person believe in something. What someone believes is a matter of opinion. This film simply shows how spoiled religion, especially Christianity. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a bi-movie, it is not. If you want to watch a movie that WILL TRY to brainwash the masses. Well, this is a trash pick. go straight to that. If you are going to send a message, do it, do not force it. It's funny that people will abuse the media to such an extent. Especially Christians.
