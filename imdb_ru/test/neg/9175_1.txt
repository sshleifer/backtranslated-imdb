What is night vision? Well, according to the star (Williamson), let's see ... one packing shop owner tells him: "It becomes dark in the street," to which he replies: "It improves ........." night vision " What the hell does that mean? Actually, what the hell is this movie trying to say? He has holes in the plot through which you could drive the killer's wagon. Not to mention the cop on duty drinking Robert Forster in a dream through this strange attempt to cash in on a serial killer and a murderer who takes video of his murder. In fact, everything that I remember. <br /> <br /> The film took place in Texas, had several car chases and cliches. Perhaps, if you watch this film with your eyes closed, can this be good? After all, without being able to see it .... it will improve ..... night vision. Did it make sense? No. And it does not make this film.
