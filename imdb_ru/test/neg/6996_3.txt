You could see the final result per mile. All the signs were there ... prom, liquor, fast driving, distraction of women ... Good advertising for using seat belts, and later cars that sit passengers farther from the windshield. In addition, the finish is quite anti-climatic, since the Ford Econoline van barely feels a crease in the nose after hitting the bridge at high speed (very unlikely). made it a little more believable. And why do these films always occur during / after prom? Is this the case when you survive the prom, will you be good for life? Most of all in the world, it is evident that there is no supervision of alcoholic beverages at the graduation party, and minors who leave the dance for joy are not monitored.
