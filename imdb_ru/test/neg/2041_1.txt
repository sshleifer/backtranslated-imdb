BLIMEY! What a terrible, disgusting waste of time, this celluloid atrocity turned out to be. I remember seeing this many years ago and thought it was fun, but now ... it's just silly. Not to mention the fact that this is the blatant robbery of the "Exorcist" to such an extent that it was reissued in one place called the Sex Orcist. The only real difference is that producers have the opportunity to further discredit themselves by lashing out at the allegation that the events in the film are REAL! Who in their right mind really believes in such a brazen lie? Worse, a cover video was released that was clearly trying to make money from the Rocky Horror Picture Show, putting a couple of lips on the cover! How low can you dive? Do not be fooled by false statements, blatant lies or looting a title, because, unfortunately, you will be disappointed!
