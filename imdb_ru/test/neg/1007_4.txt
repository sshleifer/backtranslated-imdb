I was disappointed with the third movie in the Death Death series and would not recommend it if you really dislike Bronson. In this he is his ordinary man, perhaps a little weaker than in others; the rest of the actors are good if you watch the movie of the week on TV - the whole movie has the production value of a bad A-Team episode, and I like the fun of going out of a TV show like the A-Team, but not on the big screen, even if it's an action movie does not pretend to sophistication. The film takes time to get started, and then, when it finally comes out, it goes out of control to the point of absurdity. The plot is something from the Highway to Heaven episode, and Bronson seems like a fish out of water with most older people, and playing with weapons is so unmanageable that you don't even get any satisfaction from Bronson's revenge against the bad guys. Skip this and go to The 4th part, which I highly recommend.
