This is a film that was probably made to entertain children of primary school age. Maybe they are funny, they may even see something terrible in it. For me, acting is bad, and the plot is bad, just for an adult viewer there is not much value. I saw this film as weak and boring. At times there was the possibility that the film could become interesting, but it was never realized. Creatures look pretty good, but after seeing them for a few seconds, they seem to have nothing but appearance. Sometimes I wasn't sure if the film tried to make another comedy attempt or it was just another horror attempt that failed again. This film just wasn't good for me.
