I really, really do not understand how this film could get a rating of more than 4 here on IMDb. It's just a huge mess, and I have to admit that I really liked AvP 1: close to the story, okay, I can put up with it, but at least they immediately reached the point. AvP 2 no. After the stupid premise was presented, there are more than half an hour of stupid and unsuitable cliches of teenagers, stupid as hellish dialogue and almost nothing but a few scenes with Aliens that seem to be an excuse for having this first half of the film and the Predator scene that make You wonder if those guys who were shooting the movie watched any other Predator movie, or simply didn't care about being disturbed. <br /> <br /> After that, this shitty festival finally got to the Point where the Predator starts attacking the aliens, or at least pretending to do it. And boy, this Predator is stupid, blind and deaf. It's horrible. How he even managed to earn what he has, above me. He misses almost every shot, only notices the aliens when they are right in front of his face or if it is absolutely necessary for the script so that he can move to where he should be. He is even constantly surprised by small human teens and deputies. Who should be this guy? After the first hour of this abomination, I more or less constantly shook my head in every scene. Almost no scene in this film passes without incredibly stupid dialogues, the stupid actions of the Predator or the stupid absence or the stupid actions of our "heroes." <br /> <br /> Then this thing is finally over. To my surprise, not only my friends and I did not know whether to laugh or cry, but everyone I heard as they left the room half cried, half laughed because of the hour and a half they just spent. <br /> <br /> Don't look. Never.
