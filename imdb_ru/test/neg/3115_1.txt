Then you get the worst kind of film that some other reviewer very accurately defined as "pretentious" shit ". For those who find this film clever or even masterful, I can only say - your intellect and your imagination you obviously used to try to comprehend this pathetic attempt (in our human nature to try to understand the meaning of things). <br /> <br /> One more thing: I can och I’m good at tolerating political incorrectness, I’m for freedom of creativity and suspension of disbelief, but there were too many Slavic women’s natures. connected with the forces of nature, probably due to the fact that she spent all her childhood looking at the stars and milking the cows on a three-legged chair.
