River Queen's sound recording should have been fired, nowadays there is no excuse for poor recording on the set. The murmuring voices were the end result, and the cinematography was, at best, medium or fair. The story had potential, and I feel sorry for foreign actors who should have known that they were shot in Turkey, while they were being shot. Obviously, the film suffered from budgetary syndrome, and the scene where Temoera breeds inside the house while the battle rages outside is too stupid for words. <br /> <br /> I noticed several shortcuts on the Maori side of the protocol, but this was probably due to the restriction of the length of the film, etc. In general, this film did not impress me, the Wanganui River has many beautiful places, but This film gives us a cold, monotonous and claustrophobic image, without any beauty. The film needed more sunlight and better camera angle, less confusion on the screen, better sound recording and more thoughts about what the audience would see on the big screen. <br /> <br /> I hats off to everyone involved, although to complete what should have been very difficult. I am very grateful to everyone who can make a feature film, unfortunately, I did not like it.
