So, when my friend told me that he was supposed to lead MM2 and MM3, I thought, damn it, I should check out Monster Man and see what it looks like, maybe I can take part in it, but when I jumped out it's in my dvd player and and tried to put down the first 45 minutes of nothing but bad, bad, I mean horribly annoying comedy from this fat ass, thinking that he is funny, not to mention how the director spent a meaningless journey on desert, I came to the conclusion that these guys had no idea that they were bark, and missed the boat in the background. The potential of the story could be slightly different from the usual BS, which you see on the Blockbuster / Hollywood Video shelf, released by Lions Gate these days, but they probably spoiled this one. Why spend so much time and effort on shooting annoying bad roles and bad jokes, why not shorten the trip and add more plot to the film. My work was so bad that they had to cut out most of the film, or maybe the director didn’t remove so much horror and smell that they had to look for filler in order to make the usual 84 minutes ???? All in all, and it’s easy for me here, maybe because my friend is a bald cattle on the stage of a bar who smashes his skull while chasing three exits, I will give him at least 1 star for trying, and horror / murder scenes were not so bad, again, they tried. It is a pity that Lions Gate could have created a cool franchise out of this idea, but failed. I do not recommend paying for rent, perhaps you can find a stripped-down version where the movie begins with the hitchhiker. SHIT!
