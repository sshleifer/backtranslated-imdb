Performances are rated better than the assessment I gave to this work, simply because I will not support the film, which shows how a child or a mentally retarded person receives, prepares and injects drugs into his body. <br /> <br /> This is a disgusting film that does not pursue any goal in the world, except to charm and try to legitimize the drug lifestyle. It carries convincing actions that add to my disgust. What did these people think ?! I could not enjoy a movie like this. It is enough to force the one who has never used drugs to think about it, and those who bought themselves out think about returning. I'm surprised that not every pure addict who sees this falls off the van. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good in this “film” that more closely resembles the “How to pull out” document. drama. This is the embodiment of what is wrong with Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Absolutely disgusting. <br /> <br /> He estimates 1.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Monster:,
