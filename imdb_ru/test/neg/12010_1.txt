The first parody really brought money? This is another continuation (on the line OTHER OFF) that no one asked for. But we still got it. The sequel, like its predecessor, is completely dead. It's also pretty disgusting (remember the dinner scene?) I think I almost felt sorry for Ritter, Yasbek and Warden. They needed money so much?
