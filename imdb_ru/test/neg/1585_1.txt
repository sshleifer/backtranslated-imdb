This is a sad story about a selfless romance between two unpleasant people, one of whom is married to someone else. It comes first on my list of the most boring movies ever, and I'm a die-hard romantic. My husband refused the first hour of the three, when little happened. The desert landscape is spectacular, with endless sand and sunlight on Katherine's golden hair. However, cinema does not make a brilliant film, unless it is a journey through National Geographic. The magnificent Saharan landscape in this ill-conceived story looks like a pig perfume. <br /> <br /> The film tells about a severely burned dying pilot named Count Laszlo de Almacy, who was left in the care of a Canadian. Military nurse, Hana, during World War II in Italy. It seems that he does not remember much about his life, but through the book at his disposal, his story VERY SLOWLY reveals his story with the help of a man from his past named Caravaggio who mysteriously appears on his deathbed. Almashi was a Hungarian cartographer hired by the Royal Geographical Society to map the Sahara desert. He entered into an affair with his wife Catherine, a research colleague who turned out to be a British spy. Meanwhile, currently Nurse Laszlo has her own story with a Sikh, nicknamed Kip, who is involved in the dangerous work of disarming mines. <br /> <br /> I have a lot of quarrels with this film, the length and boredom for beginners. I don’t blame acting in particular, it’s just not a good story. Caravaggio seems unnecessary, his connection with Almashi is sketchy. He creates a scene of torture, but it does not seem to serve any important purpose in the film. <br /> <br /> The main problem is that the two sides of this novel, Almásy and Kathryn, are terribly non-sympathetic characters, small and boring. They are just not very pleasant, so there is no one to cheer. Almashi is cool, alienated, arrogant and ultimately disgustingly attractive to the wife of another man. Catherine is also detached and disgusting, not to mention that she has a lack of guilt or feelings for her imperfect but loving husband ... except that he managed to break one tiny tear in the corner of her eye when he dies. <br /> <br /> This is more a story about LUST than love, with pearls like “I can still try you.” Almasi ridiculously voiced to a colleague his erotic obsession with indentation on the neck of his beloved, which is certainly more indicative of his focus on Catherine’s body. The victim of this unrepentant adultery is unfortunate husband Jeffrey, who is treated only as an unpleasant affliction. All this is pretty disgusting and disgusting - a feeling of Catherine's weakness, so that these lovers can indulge in their vaunted unbridled passion, and all this when Quiet Night is sung in the background. I’m not sure if Carol’s intention was to counter the purity of their selfish thirst, but I wasn’t impressed with blasphemous overtones. We have complete frontal nudity with Catherine, but their sex scenes seem cold, selfish, lustful, and sometimes completely hateful ... not warm, loving, giving back or even truly passionate. If any of these two have any emotions for the other, this is absolutely selfish and definitely NOT love, as I define the word. <br /> <br /> Almasi’s return to the Swimmer’s Cave to find his lover’s body looks far-fetched rather than moving. Catherine must have died only moments earlier, because she shows excellent color and hardly sleeps, not at all like a corpse. Of course, this is all for dramatic effect, since the romantics who are following this story (usually I would be one of them) would not appreciate the decaying, putrid corpse. To return the body of his adulterous lover, he betrayed his comrades and allies, handing over his cards to the Nazis, and the British were called the villains of this work. Regardless of whether he fulfills his last promise to Katherine, I do not admire his treacherous act. <br /> <br /> Kip seems to be a pleasant guy, and Hana is generally nice, but their novel is not so attractive, just a brief military clash with the parties, indicating a slight injury when parting. Moving back and forth between the two places (past Sahara desert and present-day Italy) turned out to be distracting and unpleasant, but in fact both stories were boring, like dirty water. The only spark of interest in the whole picture was the intense disarmament scene of Kip. <br /> <br /> Without being completely heartless, I had some sympathy for the present, strongly burned and dying condition of Almásy. However, perhaps my main claim to this film is euthanasia at the end, when Hana commits his patient, giving him an overdose of morphine. We must feel that this is justified and morally acceptable, because she is obviously tied to Almashi, crying while she is preparing a deadly syringe, and reading aloud his supposedly passionate book of Herodotus to console him while he dies. <br /> <br /> One should not insult the masterpieces of the amazing director David Lin in comparison with this pitiful amoral story. Yes, Lawrence of Arabia also has a desert, but in the films “Lean Manufacturing” (“Doctor Zhivago”, “Brief Meeting”) difference from full self-absorption. this pair. In the daughter of Ryan, the cuckold husband shows moving loyalty and forgiveness. <br /> <br /> This film is supposedly intellectual, incredibly overpriced, boring and disgusting, but, unfortunately, pretends to be a great love story. His best picture Oscar does not speak well for the Academy. For those wondering why people are working so hard on this film, the answer is simple. It's horrible.
