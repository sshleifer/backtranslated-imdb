DO NOT BELIEVE HYPE! <br /> <br /> I had to understand why all critics are curling over this film. I have seen it and still do not understand. The plot is thin, very thin. After the film was finished, I still did not know the name of the main female characters, and one of the two male characters did not even have a name in the credits, he is considered a "farmer." I was not interested in the characters, so I did not care about the film. <br /> <br /> The scenery and cinematography was great, as was the material on the National Geographic or The Discovery Channel. <br /> <I can not recommend this movie to anyone.
