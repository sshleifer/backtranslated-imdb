I cannot say that I was surprised by this atrocity when I watched it a couple of months or weeks ago (I do not remember). I saw it as a two-part episode from Zoey 101, because that's how they showed it here in Canada. <br /> <br /> I was incredibly annoyed with the Makeover a Nerd thing, this is just an example of how unacceptable, underestimate, superficial, negative, biased and stereotypical people in the entertainment industry, and, frankly, I'm extremely annoyed. It was not at all funny. A nerd is a stereotype, and it hurts people a lot. <br /> <br /> Secondly, people in Zoey 101 have no real problems. Logan has a big house, he has a famous dad, he has everything, and Zoe is also rich. They never have to deal with things that modern adolescents and teenagers face, such as peer pressure and stereotyping problems. In addition, the actors are terrible. Jamie Lynn Spears doesn’t deserve to be on a television show as successful as Zoe 101 (what’s wrong with the world?) She has no talent as an actor. In fact, it is worse than Britney! Chase and Zoe were incredibly predictable, I mean, how could the show go on with dates Zoe and Chase? What other problems can they have? Except for the fact that Chase doesn't get the girl he wants, everything is perfect! Absolute worst 48 minutes of my television life. Ever 0/10 (and this is generous)
