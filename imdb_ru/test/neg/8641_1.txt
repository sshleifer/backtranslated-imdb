This film is absolute rubbish, and it gets worse to a very protracted end! <br /> <br /> The plot is tangled and difficult, the actors have a completely indifferent attitude (perhaps they were paid in advance - a bad move, or they knew they wouldnâ€™t be paid), and the Sets were faceless, boring and cheap. <br /> <br /> I fell asleep twice and decided not to waste time on the last 5 minutes, as I assumed that by that time the actors would fall asleep themselves. More wasted time spent living. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch it, take it to the bedroom and forget about the sleeping pill. But maybe you will need an antidepressant! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is good if celluloid decomposes.
