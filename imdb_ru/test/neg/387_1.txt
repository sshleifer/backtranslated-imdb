This is arguably the worst movie ever made, which he took himself seriously. And not as a result of acting, because, as an actor, I must say that Rickman and Stowe should have been at their best, just to avoid having to use electroconvulsive therapy after taking a picture of the principle. Being one of 57 people who actually saw this film in a theatrical release, I must say that I had never seen or seen a film where the film ended, the credits rolled, the lights in the house turned on, and no one moved from their seats. About five minutes after the lighting turned on, people started to come out of the coma to look around, and I think most of us thought, well, we realized that it was a joke, right? In the end, after the assistants handed out disguises, and we took an oath of secrecy to never admit that we were there, we felt it was safe to leave, praying that we would not be seen leaving the hall. I saw some pretty bad movies in my time, (I have Cinemax, for God's sake), but I'm still sad that I can never recover the two or so hours of my life that I lost while watching Closet Land.
