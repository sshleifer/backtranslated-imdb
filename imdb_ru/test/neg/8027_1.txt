Low, low, low. . <br /> <br /> My God, boring. <br /> <br /> Characters are so annoying - you will cringe every time you see Jimmy Smits or the guy who played with Tomt from now on. They must have never rehearsed or reviewed the film in the process. Mel Gibson was completely wooden. <br /> <br /> This may not be the worst movie ever made, but the fact that it almost immediately sounded a video, says it's pretty darn close. <br /> <br />
