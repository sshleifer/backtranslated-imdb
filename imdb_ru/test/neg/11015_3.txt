Humor is a very individual thing, and the viewers on the preview of The Wog Boy seemed to like more than me. I found this an anachronism, more revealing for the old-fashioned racial humor of the Australian cinema of the 1960s and 1970s. The boy is dating a girl, the plot is never taken off due to a lack of chemistry between Lucy Bell and Nick Jannopoulos, while I found a thin laugh on the ground. If you want to spend your money on it, wait until it appears on the video.
