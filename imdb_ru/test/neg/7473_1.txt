I saw it at the entrance when I was 9 years old. All I remember is a few scenes (those where the main character is haunted by a masked guy) and scared and frightened. Seeing this now, my opinion has changed. This is a pathetic horror film about an orphanage run by Gloria Graham (sadly) and who talks about a young, talentless girl Ella who was sent there after her mother, a city tramp, was hammered to death (graphically shown). In the film, adolescents (in fact, actors as young as 20 years old) are beaten, tortured, killed, starved, attacked with meat grinders, raped, and so on. You will not recommend ANYTHING about this crap. The plot is stupid, all dialogues are bad, and actions ... the less, the better. How did this patient handle GP (now PG) rating? It would get R now. Pleva One last thing: a really repulsive spin end implies incest!
