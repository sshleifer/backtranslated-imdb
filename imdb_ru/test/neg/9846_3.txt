In short, this film was terrible. It was boring, predictable and completely creepy. I kept waiting until it was over, and when it happened, I was terrified. The end left a bad taste in the mouth, if not more. My advice to anyone interested in movies about nascent female sexuality: stay away from this movie. Such films give notoriety to classics like Lolita.
