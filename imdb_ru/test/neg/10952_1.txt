Wow, they told me that this would be movie B, which is worth seeing. I feel that I was misled after viewing this preview. The plot at best is a twisted of several films. Even the title is the taking of another movie, if you can give the film such importance. I'm sorry to say that I was taken to the cleaners. I would not waste your time on this. It seems that this film is a bunch of imitators who got together and did not take care of the film on the weekend with a borrowed camera. Being in the entertainment industry, I can judge a decent movie, and this one deserves to be put on the shelf or thrown away. My advice is to stick to such classics as the 1979 Dawn of the Dead. On a scale of 1 to 10, even 1 is good for producers, because this film explodes. (Below that sucks) Manufacturers should stay at their jobs during the daytime. If you are watching a movie, please be honest in your posts, this one seems to have been promoted and bloated by some. There are some who have seen it so that it is sent correctly. Sorry, but I have to say that this is the one that will be missed.
