It was one of the most boring films I've ever seen. I am already over 40, and I watched him with my son-in-law (at the age of 20) and son (17). The scenery was beautiful, but the story was a failure. We watched for about an hour and turned it off. I spent more time on the iphone during the hour we watched it than actually watched the movie. I gave him 3, because I enjoyed the scenery and the cinematography; otherwise I would give him one. I’m sure that there are people who are really passionate about the “art” of all this, who will find my review terrible, but we all have the right to our own opinion, right? I could not understand whether it was a “click of a chick”, where the focus was on the mother, or it was supposed to be a movie for guys with an emphasis on battle and adventure. In my opinion, this also failed.
