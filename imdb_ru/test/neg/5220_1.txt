This is the worst movie I've ever seen. What were they thinking about? Stop preaching to me already! That's why we all watch the Walker Texas Ranger and donâ€™t admit it to our friends. A terrible game and an extremely false conspiracy. As the film unfolds, the story stops, and the actors begin to preach to the audience. The director somehow believed that they worked well together. It was like shit! When I saw the title in my local blockbusters, it looked interesting. They should have had a warning that it was a religious, and not a false advertisement for an action / adventure. For the first time in a long time, I stopped the film and could not tolerate its end.
