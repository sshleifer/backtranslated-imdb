It could be a great movie. However, like many other people, I also think so. This is poorly done due to the translation of languages. If the entire film is to be read, then it takes away from the film and becomes something else. I have a really great rating, and I could not wait for its lease. But as soon as I did it, it was a real disappointment. Here in Boardman, Ohio, I could not find the English version for anything like that. This film was also compared to Dark Hours, and we will not see it in Boardman, Ohio. It is not available. So, I think we will never know how good the film really is.
