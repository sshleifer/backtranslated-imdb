I see no point in overcoming so many troubles to make such a film, and then throwing the history book out the window. In this film there was not a single exact detail, apart from the fact of the death of Richthofen, for which I was grateful at the end, so I no longer had to watch. Such films are an insult to anyone who knows anything about the history of World War I aviation. <br /> <br /> I’ll skip the obvious that they flew the Fokker DVII in 1916 because Blue Max did it too, or that the 209th Squadron flew SE-5 and would attack other units. First, they first call Pfalz D-III the “old albatross”. On the other hand, they have Voss, Goering and Wolff, all in Jasta Boelk. The only one who was in this Jasta was Voss, and he joined after Boelke's death. Richthofen was not charged with the death of Boelke ... Erwin Boehme, who faced Boelke, dodged to avoid a British plane, pursued by Richthofen. When Richthofen was wounded in the head, it happened during the attack on the two-seater FE-2d, and he did not hit the trenches, and the soldiers fought for him, and NO .. Werner Voss did not die that day. He died on September 28 in one of the most ambitious battles in the First World War. <br /> <br /> Manfred was short, not like an actor who towered above all others. His brother Lothar was also never in Just Boelk, he joined the squadron when Manfred was in charge of Just 11. <br /> <br /> In historical fact there are so many other glaring mistakes that I will let them go, except perhaps worst place of death. In the film, Manfred beat Brown, and then shot down, making a perfect landing. Brown broke down once in Richtofen, while Richtofen pursued Mei, and the facts accumulated over the years, overwhelmingly show that Richthofen was killed by fire from the ground, not by Brown. <br /> <br /> The only value in this film was the opportunity to see the flying scenes themselves, which were as good as Blue Max, besides, I will not watch them again, and I paid $ 30 for the tape!
