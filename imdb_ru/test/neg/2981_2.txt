I saw this movie coming out, and could not wait to see it. I have to say that I was very disappointed with this. It would be better as a mini-series. The whole show seemed very hasty. They did not explain things very clearly. At the end they showed John Paul II, alive and well, and on the next scene he was dead. There is never any explanation as to what happened. (We all know what happened in real life). I think ABC threw the ball at something that could be great. Overall, I think this film was blurry. It seemed that a drunk monkey was jumping from one point in the life of John Paul to another point, never explaining how or why everything happened. For example, when his elder brother leaves, they never explained that his brother was a doctor, and therefore he left home. Furthermore, when his father dies, all we see is his father lying on the floor, and thatâ€™s all. I was very disappointed with the whole movie.
