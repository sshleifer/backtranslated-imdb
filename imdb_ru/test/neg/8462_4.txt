This film is not so good ... in general, but it is good when you just want to laugh, because it is rather ridiculous :) there are a lot of mistakes in it, and this is stupid. I received this film for Christmas as 5 years ago, but for some reason I never gave it away. I think I just like the rainy day, although I only watch it once a year. This is a film from the 90s, so it’s very funny to see everyone dress and behave. This film is good for someone young ... although, if you think about it, I didn’t really like it when I was 12, but this is just my personal opinion. the film was really predictable. I would like to have some strange turns in it, but I think that he was trying to be a suitable film for everyone. I think it was appropriate for the whole family, but Hally's dress was a little indiscreet, but definitely suitable for family material.
