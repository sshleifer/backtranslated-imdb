As much as I respect firefighters for what they do. I was not impressed and bored with this film. Acting was fine, but Joaquin Phoenix was a poor choice of actors, to say the least. <br /> <br /> What worried me the most about this movie was Celtic music that whined again and again at the wrong time. film. Direction and succession were also pretty bad! <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER ** For example, after a Phoenix character falls into several stories and is seriously injured, he can barely move to talk to his captain on the radio. Then, miraculously, he manages to crawl over a huge space, covered with rubble and fire, to pierce a man-sized hole in a double-walled brick wall, using only a foot-long reinforcement piece ???? And to top it all off, he again becomes very weak and offended. <br /> <br /> Someone also noticed that throughout the entire film every time you see Joaquin's footage fighting the fires and saving people, there is little or no smoke in the buildings. I think the smoke should be pretty thick in the fiery building. <br /> <br /> I am also tired of hearing the search and rescue team shout: “I need some equipment here !!!”. <Br /> <br /> I really thought I would like this film, but I found it to be a weak attempt to portray the real life of a firefighter. The intention was, but I sincerely think that this film could have been much better. I could not help but think that the producer was trying to meet the deadline with this film and had to hurry to put it in cinemas. More time had to be spent on editing and ensuring a good flow of the film. <br /> <br /> The special effects were impressive in some scenes, but disappointing and almost ridiculous in others. Kind of like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. <br /> <br /> Call me critical, but I just don’t understand what is so good about this movie. At least it wasn't as bad as Just Ten Yards, which is currently the worst movie I've seen in recent months. <br /> <br /> I really hope that there is no manufacture in “Ladder 50”!
