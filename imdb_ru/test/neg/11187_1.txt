When something can be something that you want or mean, it is necessarily recorded as something special. But just as the form of clouds in the sky may seem to one of us or remind us of a battleship, and the other about the back of his aunt, and yet the other, absolutely nothing but a cloud, this does not make this cloud meaningful except interpretation of the audience. Anyone who thinks that throwing a stuffed giraffe out of a window is brilliant or worth it, not linking it in some context, perhaps just trying to impress us with its intelligence. <br /> <br /> Sending this movie like a madman’s dreams is pretty good, especially since there’s no standard or expectation of what dreams would look like, and even if we ourselves were insane, it would hardly have us sane benchmarks for comparison. A love affair with this film carries the same risk as the serious interpretation of Nostradamus. Whatever real meaning is conveyed at that time, he can be buried in private jokes, reflections or provincial details of his time, and at the same time elected radical intellectuals! Although I identified some issues, even with their limited capabilities. <br /> <br /> The film is definitely anti-fascist and to some extent anti-Italian. I noted that, although the years 1929-30 were the years of great public works and the renewal of cities in Italy, any signs of this seemed to be avoided. In addition (avant-garde academic spinners take note of this for your next lesson), a very short hairy trimmed man with a mustache at a party near the end - a caricature of Victor Emmanuel III and his high female companion equal to Queen Helen The former princess of Montenegro. Without an understanding of potential historical significance, even seeming irrelevance goes beyond the remit of academic or other intellectual posers who have no meaning to impress us. <br /> <br /> I’m happy to add my own buckets of paint to damage this cinematic joke. But in the film adaptation of the famous word of a little boy; The film really has no face (for spoiling). The paint will help it burn yet.
