I do not think that the number of blunders in military and strategic terms contained in this turkey can be defeated. Everything in this mess was made cheap and made the soldiers look really stupid. Examples: In the beginning, a 2-star general receives strategic advice from a lieutenant and, of course, accepts him. The map used by the lieutenant shows the enemyâ€™s position, but they obviously have only one narrow valley to use to advance the battalion (although a dozen were shown on the map). The rear guard takes the position from which they are clearly seen by the enemy and exhibited. They beat our heroes from a height, but this excellent firepower makes little difference. The only enemy tank comes closer to the end (at the beginning, called the armored division), followed by a single infantry point (!), Which moves very slowly without cover, scouting the area, and then refuses the tank to continue is the strangest scene. The soldiers are hiding in a cave. There is ice and deep snow around them, but in a cave, a few meters from the entrance, there is a deep puddle through which they all make their way repeatedly - their feet will last only a few minutes before they freeze. Later, the survivors pathetically slowly make their way through the chest of the river and return to their squad. Remember that this is a deep winter and the earth is frozen. Yes, right! <br /> <br /> And so on. They shout out teams to higher positions, they set mines next to their position and warn each other so that they do not trample them (!). In the beginning, we pay tribute to one soldier who was awarded the Medal of Honor by the Congress. Was he blind, or was director Fuller simply ignoring him? Indeed, the most inept soldiers I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> One of them picks his own wounded leg with a bayonet and, eventually, pulls out a splinter, without flinching and groans. He announces that he must qualify as a surgeon. Now it was funny.
