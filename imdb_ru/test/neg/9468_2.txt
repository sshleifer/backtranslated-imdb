A couple of clarifying comments in order. Gershell Gordon Lewis made a brief introduction to the DOCTOR GORE video (aka THE BODY SHOP), in which he touched upon his joint efforts with J.G. Pat Patterson, director and star of DOCTOR GORE. In the late '60s, Patterson came up with the "blood effects" for THE GRUESOME TWOSOME and several other Lewis films. Lewis notes that while 2000 MANIAKS were “five gallon” films (meaning the necessary amount of blood on the stage), Lewis-Patterson’s productions were “fifteen gallon” films. Lewis does not describe DOCTOR GORE as a “fifteen gallon” film — he only talks about the films that he and Patterson shot together. Lewis admitted (elsewhere) that his introduction to DOCTOR GORE was improvised before he saw Patterson's movie! So take it with a grain of salt. <br /> <br /> This may be an “unfinished” movie, but, like in some unfinished novels, it has an “end”. Just not enough connective tissue. <br /> <br /> Patterson has a certain presence on the stage and a dry sense of humor, helping to make this simplified presentation somewhat more watchable than it should be. There is an extremely bare plot - even the BLOOD POWER - more complex - and William Girdler's tediously recurring musical score. A bit of nudity and a lot of skin. The entire middle section of the film includes the creation of the "ideal woman"; it is concentrated blood for the bloodthirsty and funny. <br /> <br /> Patterson, the director, stands above his head, but he does his best to creatively tell his story if it is possible to creatively use Frankenstein’s cliche. But the best reason to watch this movie (if possible on the Something Weird DVD) is because it shows a great Nashville cry, "The heart is dying every minute." Is it not true!
