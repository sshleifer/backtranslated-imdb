This film, which I shot under the title “Black Voodoo”, should be avoided. I was expecting a flash of explosion / horror; but what I got was a very dull, standard "spirit of ghost extracts." In this case, the ghost was a religious leader who tried to refuse treatment, but whose request was ignored, and he died during the operation. The result: his spirit is obsessed with nurse Sherry and makes her commit murderous acts. The only connection voodoo was with one of the three black characters, in this case with a blinded former footballer, whose mother practiced voodoo. The film is very slow and very boring. There is a very standard ending that provides arousal followed by a terribly stupid ending (warning: SPOILER) <br /> <br /> in which a woman really manages to protect herself from the charges of murder, saying that she is obsessed. This film is slow and bad, not funny, just stunning. Avoid this at all costs.
