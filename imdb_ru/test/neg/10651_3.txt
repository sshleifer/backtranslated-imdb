Never mind serious gaps in logic, never mind the skinny image of a cliché, never mind random writing, and you might like this movie. The main character Alyssa was supposed to be a sweet heroine for whom you support salvation (or, in this case, salvation of yourself). But instead she just decides and wonders, is it really all so pretty stupid about ballet dancers? Her busy mother was obviously only needed to further spread the illusion that ballet troupes are evil monsters, ready to wrest your poor, innocent young girl from your hands, with a constantly present, biting artistic director / villain. And the cliche! Not only does she become anorexia-afflicted, bullemic, a hopeless addict and a pathological liar, but it all happens within a few months. As if the writer had read every horrible story about a ballet that he could dig up, and decided to see how much he could squeeze in two hours (with advertising). <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, but I am a dancer, the ongoing “revolt” or “revival” of anorexia and boulemia is absent in all dance schools that I attended. In fact, the teachers are so scared that they even assume that the girl may have a better chance of a few pounds lighter, most dancers in my classes will in fact reckon with a little extra weight. I'm not saying that eating disorders never happen, but not to the extent that was shown in the film. <br /> <br /> Another annoying problem this film has encountered is the writing style. They turned it off again; the guy again probably had half an hour on the screen, all in the first half. Other minor characters were simply props, decoration for the further development of the story. With the right dialogue, this would be a very difficult study of psychological problems. In fact, it turns into a one-woman show, and Kimberly McCullough does not have the audacity to handle it. <br /> <br /> For non-dancers, this film would be the supposed “understanding” of what really goes alone behind closed doors in a ballet troupe. For a dancer, this is a very offensive film, in which ballet dancers are portrayed as stupid and parents assertive and poorly informed. These adjectives more correctly describe people who received it on the air in the first place. 3/10
