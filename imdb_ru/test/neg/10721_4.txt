As a big fan of Jim Carey, I sat down to the cinema with optimism. In the end, Fun With Dick And Jane had all the raw materials to make this next Carey success. After the first five minutes of a good mood, it seemed that this film would provide, but everything went wrong as soon as the plot began. The idea that a charming, charismatic, high-ranking VIP employee can suddenly find himself at work in the nearest supermarket. It’s just so hard to believe, and then think about the fact that this guy also became the main criminal, is almost impossible. The actors seem confused by the situation. Of course, the stereotypical, rich, indifferent leader of the operation is not struggling to remove his one-dimensional character, but for Carey and the people around him the work is much more difficult. In one minute, Dick becomes an impudent office professional, possessed by property, and the next minute he is a clumsy mess that can barely put two words together, and eventually he becomes a petty thief who can, fortunately, put a pistol to another man’s head. Jane is equally embarrassed by her role, and her character never begins. <br /> <br /> The idea behind this story is so good and offensive that this film could not make it work. A strange moment of laughter can be found in all sorts of comedies, but this is usually more physical humor than something witty or clever. Carey tries his best to save the sinking ship, but his comic talent can never flourish in a character that has so many gaping holes in his personality. Carey shines when he is presented with a strong, defiant character (Man on the Moon, The Truman Show, Ace Ventura), who this film has never presented to him, despite all his efforts.
