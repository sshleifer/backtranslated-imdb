This is a little unnerving when the studio refuses to show a film for the press before it goes on sale. The fact that many films suck is not surprising, but when the studio itself recognizes this much ahead of time, the filming process becomes a kind of passionate game. Consider that this is an early Christmas present from Hollywood, that “Aeon Flux” is not an insult to taste and decency that can be expected, given the above. Although his shortcomings are ultimately overwhelmed, at least he has (sort of) an idea to play around. It is a pity that director Karin Kusama seems to have no idea how to do all this. <br /> <br /> This is the future. There was a plague. There is a dictatorship, there are rebels. The latter are known as Monicans, and far from being a cult of fans of berets or tennis rackets, they are trying to overthrow the first, called the Goodchild regime. From time to time, the regime is evil for citizens, which is more than Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) and her buddies can endure. Through some kind of biochemical technology of virtual reality, Moniqueans receive orders from their dear leader (Francis MacDormand), such as a mystical priestess who seems to be crossed with carrots. Eon has to pounce on some attractive, futuristic spandex outfits in order to carry out the High Carrot orders, which, of course, are the version of “destroy the regime”. A few years ago, she watched her sister liquidate Goodchilds, and she didn’t need a lot of conviction. <br /> <br /> No wonder everything is complicated. Goodchilds may not be exactly as they seem, and Aeon herself may have an unexpected story with them. Although sometimes confused, the film’s central vanity (which I’m not going to talk about anymore) contains some clear ideas about the nature of human existence and survival. There is a place for much more study, which the film does not use, but there are ideas at least. The big problems of "Aeon Flux" are technical. Kusama made a strange decision to shoot almost all the events so close that we can rarely follow what is happening. To make matters worse, it is edited in a variety of jump cuts, which leave us completely lost. As a result, serious spatial disorientation occurred. Aesthetics "Aeon Flux" is an elegant costume, strange architecture and deft characters. Most of the action takes place in minimalist, open spaces that ask for some continuous long shots that could convey the grace and athleticism implied above. Instead, we get fractions of a second of flying limbs, broken glass, and the accompanying sound effects. <br /> <br /> There is a pretty good movie trying to get out of the Aeon Flux swamp. Tell me that this is in the hands of the Wachowski brothers, and the results may be quite different. However, I felt that “Aeon Flux” deliberately pushes me away from the movie I wanted to enjoy. This film is not tuned to its strengths. As a beginner poker player who won a royal flush, he somehow finds a way to lose, despite his potential.
