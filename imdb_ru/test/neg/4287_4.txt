In this film, Gary Oldman plays a defender who was previously a prosecutor. He is a bit tortured, but more or less plays the usual guy, and not some figurative or literal monster. Funny, but he didnâ€™t quite handle it. I suppose that from there you cannot fully bounce back. Kevin Bacon was pretty creepy. The scene in the park was too long, too many false fears. And the weird scene of sex with Oldman and Karen Young seemed to come from another movie, although the rest of the time Miss Young coped just fine. This film suffers from weirdness, trying to hide predictability. And failed. Do not worry
