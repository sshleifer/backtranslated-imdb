It all starts pretty well, with the accident and the decision not to return to Los Angeles. But everything falls into place too quickly. There is a nice plot twist towards the end, but so many scenes that don't make sense. Randy (played by Brian Austin Green) comes home angry and ready to confront people, and he is not in a hurry to put the club on when he parks his car in front of his house amid nowhere? I do not want to spoil it, for those who decide to see it, but the last 45 minutes are ridiculous. Even a game that was not bad early on becomes bad by the end. Do not worry if you do not want to see how bad it is.
