It's easy for a movie that tries to be tense, to be just uninteresting. This happens quite often. Dark Harbor is not only uninteresting, but very poorly made. The scene behind the scenes is tied to an otherwise exaggerated premise. A restless couple raises a restless stranger just to find more problems. <br /> <br /> Tension is created in some films, creating a plot. Dark Harbor continues to add its history, but never relies on it. I hoped that, like in other films, the uncertainty would finally explode. It never does. Also, the characters do not have continuity from scene to scene. They can act one way in one scene, but then act completely differently in another scene. At first you think that they are simply out of character, but by the end you realize that they are not characters at all. They are simply props for the final turn. The last ten minutes are trying to be shocking. Instead, it is rather lame and uninteresting. The only thing that shocked me was that the film was finally over. In less than ninety minutes, the film still seems too long. <br /> <br /> This is not one of those low-budget gems. It's more like fake watches that break as soon as you take them home.
