Julie Delpy plays a major role in this horrible film about the sadistic relationship between a father and daughter in France in the 14th century. The film is trying to destroy the romantic knightly image of the heroic medieval knight, showing a rather dreary image of the period defined by psychological dysfunction and violence. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a child, Francois, who grew up in the shadow of the Hundred Years War, to whom his father told him to take care of his mother and wait for his return. Francois takes action when he discovers his mother and lover in bed. Francois kills him in the name of protecting the honor of his father. As a father, as a son, Francois grows up and leaves his family to go to the same war. This situation is something of an explanation for the upcoming events, as we already noticed on the way home that Francois was not right. The war with him failed, he has changed. <br /> <br /> Daughter Beatrice de Cortemart (Delpy) is waiting for her beloved father to return from the captivity of the British. She is pure in heart, and she was left to take care of the estate while her father was gone. In the absence of her father, Beatrice faces financial difficulties, which heightens Beatrice’s hope of returning her father in order to save her. But on his return, she notices that he has lost the desire to enjoy life, and he torments and humiliates everything around him, even his own daughter. From this point of view, the film tells how Francois tortures his family. Starting with the humiliation of his own son and the rape of his own daughter, Beatrice. <br /> <br /> Shooting the film in the Middle Ages was supposed to soften the blow, as the viewer can say to himself that such violent actions were carried out in difficult times. Indeed, many incest films, such as Tim Roth's The War Zone (1999), which are modern, were more shocking because of this. <br /> <br /> Delpy appears in this film in several bold nude scenes. Indeed, she seems angelic and beautiful. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed when I saw scenes of torturing animals. I believe, and it is not confirmed that some birds were killed for making this film, which really upsets me. The quality of the film falls when real violence is applied to animals. I hope this film will be re-released without these scenes of cruelty. These scenes do not make a big contribution to the plot line of the film. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is too long. The scenario is problematic. We do not see Francois and Beatrice before the war, we do not get an answer why he has changed to such an extent. I would like to skip this film, however, I have to mention a few scenes that made this film worthy of attention: <br /> <br /> * The scenes of a small child who can kill in cold blood are really shocking. I first saw it in the “City of God (2002)”. Here Francois kills his mother's lover while his father leaves for the war. Great scene and very graphics. * Scenes from the rape of Beatrice from her father, until she finds out that she is pregnant from him, really shocking and interesting. The scene after the rape, where Delpy burns his clothes and cleans himself. She asks her brother to hit her in the stomach with the hope of a miscarriage. <br /> <br /> * The scene of the humiliation of a brother when a father throws his son's head at food - humiliating him, and then ranting about war. Later, dressing his son in women's clothes. <br /> <br /> The film was awarded César (French Oscar) for the best costume design, I agree, the costumes here make the film truly authentic for that period of time. The scene of the film is Château de Puivert, a real 12th-century castle and historical monument located in Aude, in the south of central France. A beautiful castle and mountain view will really help you enter the period of this film. The film is also nominated for another 3 Cesar Awards, but all of them were captured by the widely successful French film "Au revoir, les enfants" ("Farewell to Children", 1998). <br /> <br /> --- Released as Beatrice in New York, March 1987. Only for showing in France in November 2007. Watched it on YES3 on May 3, 2007, 17:45, at work.
