Seriously, all these Satans come to Earth, Catholics always participate in films. Why is Lucifer never associated with other denominations. <br /> <br /> The plot is that Asmodeus (played by former Jason Vorhis Kane Hodder) has a plot to become a man (but not always he was a demon) forcing this young girl who is his sister, pregnant with his child. Except maybe she's not his sister. The plot is not clear about this, and they intertwine these scenes, where he sees the psyche about his problem. <br /> <br /> The lead girl becomes pregnant while still a virgin, with an incredibly eerie scene, her father gives her a gynecological examination to prove that her virgin membrane is still intact .... Eeeewwwwww. Her sister (played by washed and looking much worse because of the clothes of Denise Crosby) concludes that this is a sign from heaven. Praise be! <br /> <br /> Well, the baby demon takes the body of the mother on a joyful trip and picks up, in order, the truck driver, the boyfriend of his friend and her friend, who are watched by a former military priest whose mission is to kill baby when he is born. We discover that Asmodeus is actually the Catholic cardinal who controls all this. <br /> <br /> The ending is pretty much incomprehensible, and if you could do it so far, you would have a stronger stomach than me, (I stopped the movie a couple of times, it was so terrible.)
