this is only the second time i have been moved enough to write a review. Unfortunately, both times they were for films that can be described in several 4-letter words that can be defined as feces or excrement. another film of this magnitude was disguised and anonymous. <br /> <br /> In any case, in the review. There are several key points in this film that I will describe below. <br /> <br /> 1) Stephen lost the plot (that is, in all his other films, family / friend is killed. Stephen gets angry. Stephen kills people. End). <br) > <br /> 3) Stephen seems no longer engaged in his action. instead (from memory) 2 battle scenes were killed by the neck down and behind, so you could not see his face. likely doubler. I think Chuck Norris. <br /> <br /> In general, the worst film about Seagal. The second worst movie I've seen in recent history, and I've seen a lot of bad movies.
