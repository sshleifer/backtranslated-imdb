It struck me that someone had spent so much time to appreciate such a bad movie. The beginning (of the film) was a bit of truth in this. The guerrilla "AF" was launched in 1943, when two communist pilots from the Croatian Ustashi AF deserted with their observers at Breguet 19 and Potez 33, respectively. The plane saw some actions in shooting and manual bombardment, but did not last very long. One crew was killed and the other survived, the pilot was killed later during the flight on the Spitfire V. The real guerrilla squadrons were created when the Air Force detached its two (Yugoslav) squadrons Spitfire Vc and Hurricane IIc, respectively, manned by pilots of the former Yugoslav Royal Air Force, and transferred them to Tito's forces on Vis Island. Even those who have never participated in air operations, but strictly for ground support. Thus, the film was one gigantic cow dung, to put it mildly, and the lowest point for it, otherwise not at all bad, the director. For some fad, I attended the shooting of the last episode of the film, when dozens of German planes were destroyed at the military airport of Mostar (Yugoslav 522 simulators, which were also used in flight series). Pyrotechnics was impressive, and the scotch, served by the film crew, was even better. Otherwise, the film was a shameless lie that modern viewers often joked.
