Umberto Lenzi reaches new lows with this recycled waste. Janet Agren plays a woman who is looking for her missing sister. It turns out that the sister is part of a religious cult such as Jim Jones in New Guinea. She hires a dirty guide, played by Robert Kerman, to help her get to the cult complex located in the jungle. This is another (!) Film about cannibalism, and I would probably like it if Lenzi hadn’t added scenes from his excellent film “Man from a Deep River” to this film. I mean, every ogre scene is directly taken from this film, which I think makes it as trustworthy as Al Adamson. I felt ripped off. *** SPOILER *** 1/2 stars, and this is for the scene dildo.
