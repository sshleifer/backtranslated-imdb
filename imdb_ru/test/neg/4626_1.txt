I saw it on the Science Fiction Channel, so I knew it would be bad from the start, but I was surprised how much worse than expected. The effects of computer graphics on the dragon were terrible, even for a science fiction channel, and the letter was pitiful. I could not say if it was as stupid as a joke, or it just happened. The only quality of this film is that it is so terrible that it is almost ridiculous, especially in the part where the knightly character of Patrick Swayze returns home to his knight father, who retired after losing his legs and is now bedridden in armor with the sole purpose of making the audience understand that he is a knight. Most of the film is about a huge dragon egg that hatch into a little dragon with one of the worst CGIs I've ever seen. It was just awful.
