I still wonder why I sat through it all. There were only about 3 minutes of real entertainment, the rest was just boring. Acting is not so good, but action movies are sooo funny, not even funny. I would like to say something good about this film, but now I can think of nothing. Perhaps there was something to enjoy in it, but ending it should be the stupidest idea. What type of person would take a small toy helicopter with a remote control with a burnt machine gun to kill the president? This idea would never have been realized, let alone that anyone was so stupid as to try it, I think the writer must have been obsessed with the toy car scene in The Dead Pool, but in reality tried to give it a serious look.
