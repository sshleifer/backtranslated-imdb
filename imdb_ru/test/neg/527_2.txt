This movie was moving too slowly for my taste. The concept of this story is extraordinarily different in that it explores the family dynamics of life with a mentally retarded family member in ways that I have never seen on the screen. The implementation of the concept was erroneous. Each character fully developed in the scene of her first appearance, then you had to endure the feeling that each character was marking time. That is, each character awkwardly hesitated in her interpersonal communication. relationships with others in the film, which I discovered are a form of emotional and social backwardness. I believe that this is of artistic value, given the irony of the fact that the story centers around a mentally retarded person surrounded by friends and family who have above-average intelligence. The acting, however, was well done without exception. I agree with other reviewers that the cinematography was beautiful. Overall, I think the film has a strong artistic value due to the fine. cting and cinematography, but fails on an emotional level because of the shortcomings described.
