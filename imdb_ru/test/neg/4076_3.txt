If you are not a fan of the 80s, and you need to be a particularly strong fan or one of the two main characters, there’s nothing to recommend in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story, like the others said, is boring, almost an afterthought to the basic concept of the characters and the idea of ​​making a slightly manic comedy. I watched him for about an hour, hoping that he would turn the corner, there would be a turn or he would somehow turn on the gear, but no ... This is not unattractive, just boring. It passes. He passes by, madly running in a circle, puffing on his feet from strange angles, screaming madly, but I did not feel a real feeling of energy or maniacal fun, it just seemed compelled to me. Needless to say, there’s nothing to laugh about. A little light fun here or there, but no more. <br /> <br /> By the way, not to mention the mention of feminism, all that in this case means that almost all the main actors are women. In any case, it actually covers up ... Two women lead, excellent, excellent, a drug dealer - a woman, well, their owner is the owner, well, their friends are a woman, well, the only other person we especially see who lives in the same building, oh, a woman ... I was not looking for this, but after a while I felt that a conscious decision was made that the film was shot in this way, and this, again, was a bit forced and closed. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you are a fan of fashion and culture of the 80s, you have something to see, and if you are a Helen Slater fan, it’s fun and pleasant to watch. Carol Kane also has time on the screen, which is great, but not enough ... <br /> <br /> Overall: 3/10. If you are a big fan of the 80s, Helen Slater and Carol Kane, you can increase them to 5 because of them, although there is still the fact that this is not a funny comedy that slows it down significantly. If you are not a fan of these things, you can also make it 0, because there is nothing more to enjoy.
