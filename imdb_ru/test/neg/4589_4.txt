Another horrible hockey movie. I would never watch hockey or see a Hollywood version, I would hate the game. This film also does not make Canada so great. I can laugh at it and not take it too seriously. However, this movie is terrible, with all the things you can put in an 80s movie. After all, don't even watch it on TV. 4/10
