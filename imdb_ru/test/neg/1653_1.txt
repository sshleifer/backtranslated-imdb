It says a lot about the United Kingdom, when such television programs are not only being created, but also launched in three series. Unfunny, politically correct to a disgusting state and bad acting and written. Mira Syal was not funny or perfect in everything she was, go on, tell me that I am wrong, and Jasper Carrott, funny guy like him, far behind his eighties prime minister. It's such a bad comedy that it could have been made by ITV, but even smelly, like The Upper Hand and the one with James Bolam as a parking attendant, look like Fawlty Towers compared to this garbage. I would like to sit down with the author / director of this show so that they can point out the humor in this program. Admittedly, the majority of the UK population consists of poorly educated chavs, but that would not tickle their funny bones. This if they could break away from Big Brother or from their mobile phones, but that's another story. Full and full of dirt!
