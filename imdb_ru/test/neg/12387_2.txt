I have not read this book and, based on this adaptation, I will not worry. I hated every character in this show - Miranda was slutty, selfish and mumbling miserably because of the terrible dialogue, her sister was a complete weakling, and it was the worst image of manic depression I have ever seen. I have a degree in psychology and this was not accurate. In fact, until it was mentioned, I did not understand that Troy should have been bipolar - I thought he was a normal, slightly grumpy teenager. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace in this stupid show was David Tennant, whose brilliant psychotic performance was the only thing that made me watch the second half. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the authors and producers of this show have not done any research - Troy’s mental problems are not very accurate, as is the criminology involved in the twist finals (and if you haven’t noticed that ole mannequin!) <br /> <br /> Bullshit.
