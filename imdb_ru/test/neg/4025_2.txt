I rented this DVD because I’m a big fan of science fiction, but this thing (I won’t call it a movie because it was obviously videotaped very quickly), it seemed they came up with it along the way. I'm still not sure what it was about. These guys are dressed in some strange S & M outfits, and I think that from another planet, one way or another, it doesn't make much sense in this low, low, low, budget film. If this was their first film, I’d relax a little, but I think it’s like their fifth film, and it’s REALLY bad. <br /> <br /> A very bad cast is not a good actor. This director must have been out of his mind to even work on such a terrible film. Do not waste your time and money on this DVD, please do not make people. It is not even worth the .99 cents I paid to rent a DVD. In fact, I'm going to tell them that the DVD was damaged to get my money back. I generally do not believe in a bad review, but I have to here. My advice to anyone associated with this sinking ship - please find another profession to enter. How could you make such a rotten film? I would give these negative stars, if it is possible, it is so terrible.
