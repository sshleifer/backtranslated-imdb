In the third sequel, presumably explanatory, there is a lot of ketchup, but there is not much point that heaps up flutter visual effects without result. Good old Alan Smithy shot this scene, in which various members of the same family (all of them played poorly by Bruce Ramsey) are being terrorized by Pinhead (Doug Bradley, who had already unscrewed mothballs for the hundredth time). Peter Atkins is trying to fill his script with poetic strokes, but he does not seem to understand that his dialogue is as deep and informative as the patient's record. Inconsistent plot is not able to adequately fill the meager time of the film, although it may be more associated with studio intervention than anything conceived by the filmmakers.
