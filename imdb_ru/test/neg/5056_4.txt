Mrs. Tingle, a history teacher, seems interested in a student of Lee Ann Watson, who is determined to get a scholarship for the school of writing. She gets another low score from Tingle, which does not help. When one of her classmates, Luke, steals a paper on the final history exams and puts it in her bag, Mrs. Tingle discovers that she is sticking out. She threatens three that will go to the director on this issue, but he is unavailable. Therefore, before she reports this the next morning. Lee, her friend Joe Lynn and Scott head towards her that night and try to convince her not to tell the director. However, due to Tingle's stubbornness, which are returning to drastic measures to stop this exit. <br /> <br /> I wasn’t a fan of it when I first saw it, and after another viewing, I'm still not alone, Writer Kevin Williamson was in shock after writing successful modern horror films for teenagers; “Cry (1996)”, “I know what you did last summer (1997)”, “Cry 2 (1997)” and “Faculty (1998)”. He succeeded (also not forgetting the Dawson Creek TV show), but this project will be the final blow. The difference there, compared with this record, was not in the writing of the script, but in the director’s debut. The strange thing was that I found that his leadership was done correctly, but the material that he dispersed is odorless and fatigued. It seemed that he was caught on a role in a black comedy and straight-line thriller, without turning it into a gel. The script is replete with acumen, constant jokes, trivial stretchings and trick links to other films, but the problem is that it is too blurred because of so many contrived events and rich moral currents that destroy the flow. The broken script was supposed to be stronger and more powerful, as this is a small-scale performance that looks like you are watching a stage show because of its mostly limited sets. He is trying to play intellectual games with characters, but these moments exist only to serve the poor progress of history in a puddle of stupidity and meaninglessness. The end of the film takes the cake. Williams's sharpened direction sounds sensibly, but more so in pedestrian form, and therefore he lacks tension, and even on the move, even with his tight situation, you can really walk. You finally feel it after halfway, and it shows how insignificant the story is. The performances are quite tolerant, although, if not for the cool, ice-filled image of Helen Mirren of manipulative skill, like Mrs. Tingle and the cheerful Marisa Koflan, we would be stuck watching the ruthless Katie Holmes. Barry Watson is more modest in his incompetent role, and Molly Ringwald plays a smaller role. The soundtrack has enough energy, but I found that his choice is terribly overloaded and shapeless. <br /> <br /> Watchable, but mechanically throughout.
