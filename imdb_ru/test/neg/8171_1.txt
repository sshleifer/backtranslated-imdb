Two days ago I had the opportunity to watch this movie on cable (TV-Asia). I have been very concerned since then. The film "Bagban" was very successful in depicting only one side of real life. It is very partial to the parents. Have you ever thought about the other side (children)? In this world, few parents who just give birth to their children, but do not give proper parental care. I am a victim of this. Why do you (parents) want to have 5 children in your life if you just earn only 2000 rupees per month? I was forced to work in the streets with my brothers and sisters. I have no idea how I managed to reach IIT from there. Much time has passed since then, but I still donâ€™t believe it. Now I am a research assistant here in the USA. I provided everything my parents needed along with the care of my two brothers who stay with them. They could not provide us with basic things when we were children. I find this film very offended. This is very partial. This deeply hurt my feelings. I urge the producer / director of this film to look at Indian society from a different perspective and make another film.
