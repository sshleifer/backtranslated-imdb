I like Arnold and I love the subject, but it was a very disappointing movie. When I first saw the previews, they were gloomy and sinister, and the name Arnold was not even mentioned. But I recognized him, and it made me believe that he was shooting a film with a more serious, tense mood. That it was not just another Schwarzenegger combat vehicle (although, I confess, most of them are quite good!) Until now, he avoided films with any real religious theme. And I was excited. I was wrong. It's just another action movie, an explosion, shooting from a movie. And that's pretty bad.
