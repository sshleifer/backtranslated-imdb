This film is terrible, just terrible. Someone bought it for me as a Christmas present, because they knew that I liked a good horror movie. I don't think they understood the “Good” part. All I can say is that next year this person will get slippers from me. Avoid this movie - it saddens you. World. <br /> <br />
