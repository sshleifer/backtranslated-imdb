Jim Vinorski again strikes with a very literally tuned KOMODO VS. COBRA. There are no guesses. The giant KG Komodo Dragon CGI - it looks like a dog without fur - takes a huge royal cobra CGI, with a bunch of woody huggers and others caught between them. Hugesters get charter boat captain Michael Pare (who else?) To take them to a closed federal island. The experiment of an insane scientist to grow very large vegetables was an experiment to grow very large creatures, thanks to our crazy military. Now all that remains on the island are very large beasts and a small, slim daughter of a mad scientist. The group encounters it in an old plantation lab, monsters arrive, and the pursuit continues. If you watch enough Wynorski / Sci-Fi Channel movies, you will learn some sets and locations from many other movies. Action does not exist, as well as the plot. At the very least, you can enjoy watching a badly animated composition / dog stamp on the intended victims just before you damage them. Cobra simply amazes and swallows. No imagination at all.
