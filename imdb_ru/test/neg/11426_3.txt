Because I would never have watched this movie to the end. Although there are, but not many funny moments in this film, I could not understand more than 15% (the quirky English couple in the 3rd story) of what people said. Three short stories, none of which have real meaning, only with some of the most miserable and lifeless people I could imagine, and a load of obscene language. Did not find it funny, did not find it funny, did not find in it any sense. 4/10
