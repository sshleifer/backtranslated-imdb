This program would be useful for teaching hardened criminals to basic human emotions. In addition to this goal, the show has no meaning except to fill the bandwidth, which otherwise would not be used in the electromagnetic spectrum. I feel more waiting and waiting when I listen to a computer voice chip, infinitely filling the products of a random number generator. Fortunately, useful and frequent musical cues will tell viewers what they should feel if they are not able to fully grasp the predictable and superficial storyline. I find Amy an outwardly positive character because she serves as a role model for young women whom they can serve in traditionally male spheres. Unfortunately, her completely subjective approach to the law is guided solely by capricious personal principles that Amy chooses to use, with the result that Amy courts are more reminiscent of appeals to the personal mercy of a tribal despot than true administration of justice. This show is unpleasant in any quantity, although it is somewhat softened after two episodes originating from God, God-given filtering processes, thanks to which the show, fortunately, leaves the same impression in the viewer's memory as the TV tuned to the dead channel in maximum volume
