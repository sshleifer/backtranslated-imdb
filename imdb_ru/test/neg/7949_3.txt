Why remake the original "Sturm"? In my opinion, “Storm” was a real masterpiece by Carpenter. It contained all the elements of good Carpenter films. External threat to a small group of individuals. People accept the challenge because they have to do it. Insulation! Just remember that the original Carpenter pistols did not make any sound, and therefore were much more threatening than conventional devices. And now this remake. Concentrating on the psychology of the “main character I” and its relation to the main character II (evil, but noble). The anonymous threat in the movie "Carpenter" is replaced by a rather ordinary plot / corruption. “Alterations” simply did not understand the main plot of the original. And so something pretty ordinary is produced.
