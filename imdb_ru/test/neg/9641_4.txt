My mistake is that I thought it was a serious film “War in Hell” before I watched it. It all ended with a second of the film when the MTV logo appeared. With the same success it can be called "Sexy-N-Loose from National Lampoon". And it played on the MTV crowd; the film that followed these comical first seconds was played as music videos that they played over 40 years ago. At least Disney was smart enough to send his Rated R stuff to the Touchtone and let us take it seriously. OK, I'm rude; it was not so bad in the movie. However, he definitely has his share of replay, and the film is extremely biased / one-sided. True, I am not a fan of war films. I can’t watch Platoon, Full Metal Jacket or Saving Private Ryan more than once. Of course, these were good films, but they are not my forte, and they all seem to mix up after a while, and I cannot distinguish one from the next. After the tour in Iraq, Philip plans life after the war, but retreats because of a reservation in his contract. Or, at least, this is the plan of the military, until it comes out of AWOL, and the characters will not catch the speed on a few dollars, surprisingly. No, I was neither in war nor in Iraq, and I disagree with that. I also do not have all the knowledge when it comes to hiring or signing contracts. I can say the following: although I wish they were drawn into this conflict, I cannot feel too much for someone who is so stupid not to read the fine print. It’s like someone on his deathbed leaning over to finally read the warning of the surgeon general on his pack of cigarettes and say, “Oh, what are they? Deadly? I'll sue them! ”
