This is a flick that you can safely avoid. Children's plot and bad game from Cameron (she really should not take on these serious roles - they do not suit her). In addition, she looks extremely untidy, let's face it, she is gorgeous in Charlie's Angels, and she was gorgeous in Mary Something Is ... Pope would not be a good US president, and vice versa that there are some actors / actresses who are suitable for a certain type of character, and Cameron is not best suited for this serious type of housewife - there are a dozen other actresses who would do a much better job. The film itself is quite incredible and youthful in its plot (did I write correctly “Juvenil”?). I noticed a comment from another reviewer who gave The Box 10 points, which was ironic in his comments to other reviewers who gave the film 1 or 2 ratings and cannot spell. I mean, what does spelling have to do with film review? He means that people who write great can appreciate this film more than those who can't? Come on professor.
