"Snafuperman" Frieze Freleng - one of the smallest shorts Snafu. The warning of the importance of learning about your field guide, Snafuperman, makes it rather clumsy. The story in which the First Class Technical Fairy turns Snaf into a superman to help him see the mistakes of his ways is predictable and unfamiliar. Freneng's previous short “Rumors” “Rumors” was replete with ideas and laughter, but here the director is puzzled by a rather boring topic, and he struggles to make an entertaining short of her. Even for about three minutes, Snafuperman seems to be pulling, and, unlike the best cartoons in the series, it seems like an educational film, and then an entertaining movie. Although they were knocked out faster than the usual Warner cartoons, Snafu shorts mostly maintained a surprisingly high standard. Snafuperman is a reflection of the quality you more reasonably expect from a less talented group of creative minds.
