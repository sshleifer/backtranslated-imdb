This is definitely the worst vampire movie ever. I started watching this right after the vampire interview, and I was completely disappointed. Not only were the craters the size of a large canyon in the screenplay, the film seemed to be jumping from one stage to another, leaving the audience completely puzzled. The vampire Lestat, played by Stuart Townsend, was terrible - a good body does not make you an actor! The end of the queen was too easy and sudden, insulting the viewers with intelligence. I will give this star because Aliya really tried her best in this film, and the soundtrack is pretty good. In addition, I would advise Ann Rice to take an ax and begin to crack those who destroyed its brilliant history.
