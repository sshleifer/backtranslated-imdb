This is a badly written and badly directed short film, clean and simple. What was interesting and followed me, to some extent were production values. Filmed on video, it seems, with a bad scenario and a bad direction, one would think that it would also have terrible production value. This is what the viewer expects when he watches a horrible movie filmed on video. BUT not in this case, they spent some money, and it shows. I am very interested to know what will happen next, just to see! <br /> <br /> Perhaps the worst short film I've ever seen looked like big budget Hollywood, even though it was shot in some kind of video format. <br /> <br /> Instead of spending the amount of money they must have spent on some pretty impressive set designs, it would be better to see a better-executed story with good leadership. But then again, how can we expect new directors to do this when even Hollywood is gone.
