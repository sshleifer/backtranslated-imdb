I know that? Family Guy started off as something fresh, fun and original. Random humor is used for funny. In fact, I thought it was the best animated sitcom next to the Simpsons. After watching the new episodes that were broadcast over the past few weeks; I'm fed up with the show, relying too much on random humor to be funny. South Park was right about the death of FG when they raised manatees and balls with ideas. <br /> <br /> And watching the show itself, I don’t understand why my parents like it; there is nothing great about it. “Intellectual” humor is funny and would be funnier if the show did not rely on chance.
