I just found out before writing this review that Komodo vs. Cobra and another film called The Komodo Curse were shot by the same guy, Jim Winsorski. This may explain why these films are almost identical rooms. On both islands there is a military island, a colonel, who cares more about hiding his tracks than about the lives of his employees, people running to get to the helicopter, conveniently located in a field somewhere on the island, and giant komodo dragons Created by Genetic Experiments What are the differences? Well, the intruders on the island are now capitalists who want to uncover government secrets, and the island also has a giant cobra, hence the name Komodo vs. Cobra, although the conflict between the two monsters is hardly related to the story. ' “Komodo vs. Cobra ”is more or less what you expect, given its name and the origin of the channel: the Sci-Fi channel. Although from time to time you will find something that for one reason or another you might like (I liked the movie called “Komodo”), I hardly doubt that it will. <br /> <br /> Komodo vs. Cobra is not only a boring movie, but also one of the least enthusiastic sci-fi films I've seen in a long time. In some of these films there is a broadcast that indicates that the filmmakers have made at least a certain level of effort, but I see very little here. Again this is indicated by the fact that it is just a rephrasing of the “Komodo Curse”. CGI for monsters looks like they came out right from a second-rate video game, cinematography and a different scene are bad, the action varies from bearable to bad, the action scenes are boring, and then there are some parts that are honest, this is unforgivably bad. I see a lot of movies where a person shoots a pistol many times without reloading, and I can handle it. But in this film, where Michael Pare takes one thirty-eight pistols and shoots about fifty times without reloading, well, at first I laughed, but even then he just became tedious. That would be “action.” A monster appears, people scream, Paré fires without stopping, without reloading his gun once throughout the picture, and someone eats up. <br /> <br /> Komodo vs. Cobra is a very bad movie. The only thing worth mentioning in the film is an actress named Michelle Borth, who is not only very beautiful, but also amazingly strong. Even with the crappy dialogue and lack of enthusiasm in the script she was given, Michelle Borth managed to achieve a surprisingly good performance, and it just terrifies me that, just as good as she, the actress can get stuck in an as stupid film as this one. She obviously took it for a salary, but, I'm afraid, it will not improve her career.
