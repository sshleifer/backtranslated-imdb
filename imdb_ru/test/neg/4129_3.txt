Three is a seriously stupid film about shipwreck. Disguised as a psychological thriller, his closest relative is a monumentally superior Dead Calm (also featuring Billy Zane). "Dead Peace" provided well-traced characters in the form of the grieving parents Sam Neal and Nicole Kidman, trying to redefine their relationship on an ocean cruise. They end up being terrorized by the insane psycho killer Zane. This provided a sharp, increasingly tense expectation, a terrible feeling of claustrophobia on the high seas, when the cat-and-mouse game of life and death unfolded. <br /> <br /> “Three” suffers from poorly traced characteristics (the audience doesn’t care what happens to any of them), a stupid and unnecessary voodoo plot device, a complete lack of expectation or excitement and some deaf, hummy speeches players. In particular, Zayn irritably maneuvers. In Dead Peace, he was formidable, confused, and seething with barely controlled sexual abuse. Here he is pompous, irritable, slimy and unraveled. And where does he get his seemingly inexhaustible supply of dry cigarettes and cigars? And why is his lighter full of juice for over a year? Miss Brooke is very picturesque, amazingly good, but her chest and rear seem to be greatly inflated by some kind of life raft pump. They succeed, however, in acting more skillfully and convincingly than others. A dramatic actress, in the purest sense of the word, she is not. The guy playing the arch-voodoo Manuel, the third component of this miserable triangle, could be replaced with a piece of snag — no one would have noticed. In fact, judging by his complete lack of ability to engage in dialogue in any meaningful or dynamic way, snags represent a potential improvement in casting betting (excuse, pun). <br /> <br /> Pros: the landscape is pleasant and the cinematography (above and below water) is trustworthy. <br /> <br /> I assume that it was a very limited (if any) theatrical release or immediately on DVD for rental and retail sale. The reason for this is that it is not very good. If you want something decent in this direction, get Dead Calm. This was done by people who knew a little about the movie.
