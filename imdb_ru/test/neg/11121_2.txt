In general, I prefer horror films that scare me so much that Iâ€™m only afraid the next day or so, not those where people behave foolishly and are killed by an indestructible monster. This is one of those movies. The legendary chupacabra is a greenish-gray monster with lizard skin, like a kangaroo, with fangs and claws, with sharp spikes protruding from the back, and sucking the blood of livestock. As in many horror films, good and bad, this film gives freedom to legend. He not only attacks people, but also feeds on their intestines and has a bulletproof, almost indestructible constitution. So tell me, how can a hypodermic needle penetrate the skin when bullets can't? And why, when the marines find out that armor-piercing bullets can damage him, they break up so that the chupacabra can shoot them one by one? John Rhys-Davies gives an idea that goes beyond a bad film, and Chelan Simmons and Dylan Neal also deserve credit for their performances. Otherwise, the rest of the acting was bad or bad, like the rest of the film. My rating is based on Rhys Davis, Simmons and Nile.
