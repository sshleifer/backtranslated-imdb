Why did they have to make such a terrible adaptation? The whole series "Complete Jane Austin" as part of the Masterpiece Classics looks like a big disappointment. The characters are completely wrong, and there is no chemistry on the screen. It all looks pretty urgent. The release of the 1999 film, based on the same novel, seems like a masterpiece compared to this. I really want to forget it. I'm really happy that Pride and Prejudice will not be redone as part of this project, and we will see iconic and gorgeous Colin Firth and Jennifer Elle as the main characters. If you missed this play "Mansfield Park", then consider yourself lucky!
