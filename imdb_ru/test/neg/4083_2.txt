Oh, Mr. Carell! How far have you fallen! After a bright moment in the movie Little Miss Sunshine, the choice of Steve Carella films begins to contrast sharply with what has happened since then. Despite the fact that 40-year-old VIRGINA was interesting, she was clouded by his “sunny” character. Hoping to find something that would make me spew popcorn from my nose, I decided to rent Evan Almighty and see what possible shoots could wait for me here. Not a lot ... <br /> <br /> Given the banal and cliché script, the whole film looked forced and unemotional. Evan Almighty makes a joke to mark family values ​​and how the current US administration cares for the environment is also trying to express a deep biblical moment in humorous terms, but fails miserably. <br /> <br /> Almost every person on Earth knows the story of Noah and the Ark. God's wrath was lowered with 30 days and nights of rain that flooded the entire planet, while Noah, his family and two of each of His creatures on Earth expelled moisture in relative comfort through a gopher a wooden ark. It was a huge moment in human history ( if you believe in bible text). <br /> <br /> So why would God appear to one person and ask him to build an ark that will carry the animals of the world only to a few? minutes after breaking the dam? The simple answer is that He will never be. Too much emphasis was placed on US government policy and not enough on world events, which makes Evan Almighty a terribly short-sighted and American film. Although it was created as a comedy, it never achieves anything like a stomach. Maybe a few grunts and smiles, but little else. <br /> <br /> John Goodman (CARS) arranges another forced appearance in the role of the despicable congressman Chuck Long, whose only goals are to create opportunities for development in protected national land holdings. Even the strong presence of Morgan Freeman (10 STAGES OF LESS), because God can not help wipe this wet disaster film. <br /> <br /> The only funny moments are between Carell and the animals. Especially since Evan finds out what animal magnetism really looks like. Birds literally flock to him. A flock of sheep around it. The lions are proud to be near him (please forgive the pun). <br /> <br /> The special effects were fun to watch, but they were short (with good reason). The Flood was interesting in that the Ark was obviously heading with His hand and pushing only in the right direction. <br /> <br /> But besides this, a little more awaits you than an insult to common sense and intelligence.
