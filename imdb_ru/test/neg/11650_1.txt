Sorry, but it does look like a modern fake Apollo 13. Absolutely implausible (at least Armageddon FEELS like a comic! It was like a bad movie project for high school), the acting was as cliche as possible, and .... put the space shuttle on the Los Angeles freeway ? Come on. Seriously. Jerry, what were you thinking about? And all the clichés: the wife of a pregnant astronaut, a curious reporter who bothers everyone, a strong manager with “Go Fever”. And this is one thing - to distort the laws of physics, politics or something else, to create an interesting story, but at least make it GOOD! Fact and science were completely killed for that. The space shuttle does not have wings with fuel tanks, and even if it were, it could not control by switching fuel between them (and the DC-10 could not). <br /> <br /> If you like bad behavior, bad story-telling, low realism and raw cliches, it cannot be defeated!
