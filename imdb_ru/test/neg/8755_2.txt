This is the worst movie in the world. the only reason I gave him 2 was because the first 10 minutes were hysterically funny in “is it really ??” like. it was so stupid and with a low budget ... they shouldn’t even have to worry. there was nudity and violence for pure nudity and violence, and the consequences were so terrible that you would not believe it (think ketchup like blood, and cabbage for severed heads). don't give it up !!
