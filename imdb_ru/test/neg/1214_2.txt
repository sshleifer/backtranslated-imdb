Brooke Shields - in retreating from his duties, "Suddenly Susan" - plays a bitter divorce that draws three girlfriends on a "girls only" weekend in Palm Springs. Problem: Brooke is "not attached" and prowling, while her friends are all involved. Hence the name and the emotional reaction of their “immoral” causes of the weekend. <br /> <br /> Despite a few laughs caused by Dan Cortese (Victoria's Wardrobe) and MTV by Relationship Authorities Adam Corolla and Dr. Drew Pinsky, these are dark things for women only. D.B. Sweeney, Virginia Madsen and John Polito co-star.
