I like dark humor and non-PC stuff, but not if it makes no sense but to lift myself. Beating a group of people with no trace of self-irony is crap. <br /> <br /> There are people who can laugh at concentration camps, but the one who made this film, unfortunately, could not cope even with the VERY easy task to make fun of the Turks in Germany. This is a very simple task, but if you in Germany are equivalent to an inbred redneck (= an inbred southerner from a village where virginity is often lost to farm animals), you will surely fail in this as well as in life. I heard and saw a lot of funny things about minorities in Germany, but this “movie” (this piece of shit listed here is an insult to the next worst movie) sucks like a calf that the creators of this film met a few years ago.
