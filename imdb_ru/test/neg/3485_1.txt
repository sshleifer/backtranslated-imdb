I was lucky that I grew up surfing in San Diego (not the biggest waves in the world, but it was a hellish childhood, I tell you), and I saw A LOT of so-called surfer films in my life. After the first viewing of NORTH SHORE only now I can say THANK YOU GOD, I never saw it in childhood. If I saw this and mistakenly thought that this is a realistic image of a surfing scene, I would sell my board and completely carried away, I do not know, accounting records or something like that. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this film has as much in common with real surfing as TOP GUN had real military life. The acting is terrible, the music is worse, the cinematography is dubious at best, and Oh God, what was Leird Hanilton thinking about ?! BLIMEY!!! DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE !!! THIS sucks !!! If you want a REAL surfing movie, see the GIANTS section. Gosh, see SURF'S UP instead. Seriously. Sucks. Sucks bad Sucks REAL bad Brah. ;) PS: I had to change the summer with "WTF?!" to wtf, because apparently we have to whisper on this site. NO screams !!! (shhh!); D
