There is not much to say at the end. One would expect much more from a director who has made films better in the past. It seems he did it without worrying about it. The actors are doing their job (although Belmondo is far from amazing), but you simply will not be hooked. In a word, boring. This is even more disappointing, because I have heard several times that this film can be viewed as a reaction to all the major American blockbusters, who are considered a threat to the French exclusion by those who simply cannot accept that they should turn to another. Job. I tell you, if this is the best reaction we should get, boy, I will soon be very upset ...
