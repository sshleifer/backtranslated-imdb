This is easily one of the worst films I have seen in years. I started watching the movie, not expecting much, and this is exactly what he delivered .... not so much! In fact, the result was even less than I expected. My first reaction when I saw the first parts of the film was that I probably would have rated it as “4” as a result. I thought he had some pretty good photos and a haunting atmosphere. <br /> <br /> However, as the movie progressed, the rating continued to fall and fall, mainly due to the action of the pedestrians and the plot, to be just silly and tasteless at the beginning to be both silly and disgusting at the end. By the time the movie was finished, I was ready to rate it no more than “1.” <br /> <br /> Don't waste time and money on this.
