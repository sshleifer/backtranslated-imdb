Jacqueline Hyde begins, like any other ordinary day, for telemarketing individual Jackie Hyde (co-producer Gabriella Hall), until her boss (Robert Donovan) fires her for accepting personal calls at work, but this is not all bad news, since the call she received from the lawyer told her that her grandfather (Malcolm Bennett) had died recently and that he had left her mansion and state to her (why does this never happen to me? Sigh). Jackie, very excited, goes there and feels like home, while late in the evening he is looking for a thermostat, Jackie stumbles upon a secret room, where her grandfather hides the bright red formula he invented, which allows anyone who drinks it to change his external view. Being a bit irritable, Jackie finally stops at glamorous Jacqueline (Blythe Metz), but Jackie’s more attractive alter-ego begins to capture ... <br /> <br /> Scriptwriter, director and director Rolfe. Kanefsky I thought that Jacqueline Hyde from start to finish was complete and complete crap, and it was so simple and straight forward. According to the opening words, Jacqueline Hyde was “inspired” by Robert Louis Stevenson’s classic novel “The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde”, to be honest, if Mr. Stevenson could see what was going on with his story, he would pass his grave. For a start, I think that Jacqueline Hyde was / should be a horror movie, IMDb certainly lists it as such, but there is no horror in it, except how bad it is. I would say that Jacqueline Hyde is a softer core of porn than anything else and is very tame with him, why sit down and watch it softer than soft porn shit when you can look at you with the proper malicious thing that actually delivers the goods ? Why, this is the question I ask here. This is not even good porn either, except that it is too soft, it is boring, boring and not-worth-mentioning sex scenes little and far apart. The cleverest aspect of this film is the title, which would be pretty clever if it were not for the fact that another film used the name Jacqueline Hyde (1998) in the last century, and judging by the IMDb plot, it sounds damn much better than this piece garbage. This is one of those films that you have to watch yourself to see how bad it is, but just hope that you will never have such an opportunity. <br /> <br /> Director Canefsky obviously worked on a small budget, but this is no excuse. nowadays, shot with a digital video camera, the film looks cheap, and a few CGI instances look like they came from the Nintendo Gameboy, the last “shocking” twist probably has the worst morphing effect I've ever seen, and pretty good for laughing like a scene when Jackie's breasts grow through more horrific CGI. This is another thing the film takes itself too seriously. The subject sucks, is too predictable and makes for a bad movie, but maybe if the dialogue was intentionally funny with some dirty porn talk the movie might be more interesting to watch, alas, it is not so. Forget about any decent horror, violence or bloodshed, since in the end there is nothing surprising about bloodless decapitation. <br /> <br /> Technically, Jacqueline Hyde is homemade cinematographic things, photography is from the flat side. A variety of “keep the point and shoot”, music, design and special effects comply with the standards corresponding to the script. The game was terrible, seriously, this is bad. <br /> <br /> Jacqueline Hyde, in my opinion, a lot of shit, there’s nothing positive in this dim film that I can think of. Any real movie lover will be almost impossible to try to find in this shit some kind of redemptive value, definitely one that should be avoided.
