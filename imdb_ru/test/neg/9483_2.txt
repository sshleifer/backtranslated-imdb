the boys were the most attractive things in the whole movie. the girls were lame and miserable, I mean, how can they own their own clothing line, dolls, movies, produce studios, and not smell this bomb from afar? to get some responsibility, which I really see no point in punishing ... they are sent to Paris, very far from home, to live with the so-called strict grandfather, who occupies an important position with Paris. I can't remember who he was, so who cares? the details don't help, the girls are sent to Paris to learn something ... so what do they find out when they meet two French boys and are able to manipulate the guy who needs to watch them so that they can meet these guys on scooters? a typical film for teenagers, in which there are all teenagers who want to misbehave and can afford a trip to Paris or to some distant country away from their parents? In any case, I don’t really like olsen, they can never shake off Michelle’s image on a full house ... if you haven’t seen it, then you are lucky from the very beginning. (F F-)
