I wrote a warning about the spoiler, but there is little that can be spoiled. This is like spoiling rotten meat. This film is probably the worst I've ever seen. Not because of the actors or special effects, but because of the huge number of errors, both actual and physical. First of all, MIG is not really MIG at all. These are mirages and french. And how the hell can Papa Doug resist the maneuvers his son is doing to fight off the MIGs without a suit? And why is Chappy trying to get on his plane without a suit? And how could Doug beat the enemy pilot so easily? Anyway, I did not like this movie. And worst of all, he has 3 sequels, the last since 1995. Now it's scary.
