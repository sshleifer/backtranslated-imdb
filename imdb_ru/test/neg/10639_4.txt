This fourth installment of the series is the last to receive a theatrical release, although it looks like a direct viewing of the video. I think everything is fine, but nothing special. The acting is not yet seen on the show. and, as in the third film, the imagination is not so much. In addition, the proposal "director Alan Smithy" is never good. This is an acceptable film from Hellraiser, but not much more. This is a slight decrease in quality from the third and a huge drop from the first two. For me, Hellraiser IV: Bloodline 4.5 / 10
