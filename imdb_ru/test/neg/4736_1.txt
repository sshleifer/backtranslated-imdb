I don’t even want to vote for one shit for this nonsense, but IMDb doesn’t have a zero as a rating option ... the worst movie I've ever watched. some people hug and they start killing people. 3. One predator arrives on earth and starts killing aliens and humans. 4. Then one person drops the bomb and kills the person, aliens and predator. 5. Some people find the predator's shoulder canon. 6. Final Directors should consider returning money to viewers. If you still want to watch this movie, download it from some torrent site and say thank you for saving you money ... the whole movie was shot in a dark corner of the earth, you only see dark shadows in the fighting scenes .. too much violence .. I did not expect this from the fox movie
