The Brotherhood of Satan is a stunning combination of traditional elements of horror mixed with some imaginative characteristics and direction (Bernard McEvity). It all starts with the fact that Father Charles Bateman (as Ben) leaves to the west with his lovely blondes: juicy Ahna Capri (like Nicky) and daughter Jerry Reisch (like KT) when they are approaching the city of Hillsborough, which is engulfed in a satanic cult! <br /> <br /> When stupid travelers get into Hillsboro, the “action” switches to a more interesting set of characters in the film: the townspeople L.K. Jones (as Pete, Sheriff), Strother Martin (as Doc), Charles Robinson (as Jack, Priest) and Alvi Moore (as Toby). Their interaction is sometimes fun. Soon everything becomes very stupid and predictable. Mr. Martin stands out (as you might expect); he considers the possibility of a satanic cult "a story about a rooster and a bull", but is (of course) their leader. The end of “Come on, children” is puzzling; if perhaps it was not the original movie title.
