Let me say from the very beginning that I am not a very artistic person and that I do not “understand” a new art. Moreover, this film is absolutely crazy, and, in my opinion, not crazy in a good way. The film "Avida", shot entirely in black and white with a series of loosely related stories, is intended for those who can look at contemporary art and say: "Wow, I feel the energy and passion of this picture." The only reason I give this film 3 out of 10 is because I did manage to laugh at some parts, though I mostly laughed at the sheer madness of the movie. Two characters throw chairs on the lawn, and I have no idea what to do with these characters. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
