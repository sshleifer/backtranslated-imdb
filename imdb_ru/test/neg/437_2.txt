AWiP is trying to be fun, scary, tense and romantic ... and fails in every way. Acting is at best average, but mostly stupid. The special effects are not enough to compensate for stupid plot techniques, and the chemistry between * ANY * character is juvenile. <br /> <br /> If you don’t want to get mad at yourself, don’t pay money to see it.
