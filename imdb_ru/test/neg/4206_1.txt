Well, with this film there are several ingredients in the work: <br /> <br /> First put a bunch of village truckers - good ole boys who secretly want to take the law into their own hands. The second is evil cops driven by a Texas criminal. The third put in karate combat trucker performed by Chuck Norris. Fourthly, he misled a teenager in the role of Norris' nephew, captured by evil police officers. The fifth show. Chuck Norris fights in slow motion. <br /> <br /> Now mix everything together and what do you have? <br /> <br /> As you may have guessed ... one very mediocre movie!
