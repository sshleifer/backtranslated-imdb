There is only one word that describes this film: bad! I have no idea why this movie was even made, or how they made Dennis Hopper star in this movie. Stuart Gordon is the best director, and Hopper is a much better actor. The film is just stupid. I really liked the idea of ​​“square pigs”, and there was an interesting love scene involving a cyborg, besides this, avoid this movie at all costs.
