My father insisted that I watch this film with him, and I regret that I wasted my time watching it - I want these to be back about an hour and a half ago! "Funny" little film tells about the elderly Don Amesh, who stayed with his son Tom Selleck. It turns out that Ameche is not just "forgetful," as he was told, but has dementia (it seems very similar to Alzheimer's disease). And since dad is having dinner so often, he gets into such trouble again and again - almost like a charming grandmother from BABY'S DAY OUT. The problem, however, is that you know that BABY'S DAY OUT is all fantasy, and everything will be fine with the child. In addition, you are not laughing at a child because of deformity or illness. But in this case, you are encouraged to laugh at a person who is gradually going crazy - and where is the humor in this ?! If this film were more successful, the producers would then make films that make fun of people or people with cerebral palsy or a carnivorous virus?!?! There are a lot of people who should be ashamed of this movie.
