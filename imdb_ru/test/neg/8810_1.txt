Danny Glover and Cary Elvis obviously forgot how to behave when they made this film, the acting is absolutely brutal. Payback is even worse. I feel sorry for Danny Glover, I hope that he was well paid for it, because it makes him look completely stupid, the same applies to Mr. Elvis. Absolute slap to any horror movie lover. Nasty. This is probably the worst manifestation of the acting skills of veteran actors I've ever seen. I wonder if they bothered to look at the script or they must have said: “forget everything you know about acting,” because it makes the two of them look ridiculous. For two experienced veterans, it’s terrible to act like this, I hope the pay check was very large, at first I thought it was a hoax. If you can find satisfaction in this film, then more power for you.
