After more than 50 years of passionate about watching movies, I developed some simple rules for making good movies. <br /> <br /> 1. Get to know your main characters as soon as possible, of course, in the first half hour. When adapting the novel, combine the characteristics and actions of the minor characters in one person. 3. Make sure that the actions of your characters are credible; If necessary, create additional scenes to establish motivation. Violence should not be manifest, but it should not be misleading. 5. Get the best music money can buy. Often this is more important than acting, photography, etc. 6. Usually, if the film is not very good in the first 10 minutes, it won’t get better <br /> <br /> “The Gun for Cordoba” is a tutorial example what happens when these simple rules are not followed. Elmer Bernstein's account is Rinkydink, one of the worst I've ever heard in the film's modest budget. This is absolutely surprising when you consider the powers of Bernstein (“The Man with the Golden Hand”, “The Magnificent Seven”, “The Great Escape”, “The Sons of Katie Elder”). The direction of Paul Wendkos is dull and confused. The performances range from very good (Don Gordon, Peter Duel) to terrible (Raf Vallone, Giovanna Rally, Gabriele Tinti), where usually reliable George Peppard falls somewhere in the middle. This should not be surprising, given the mediocre direction and the amateur scenario, which violates rules 1, 2 and 3. Do not waste time. I give the "Gun for Cordova" "3."
