I didnâ€™t care, it seemed too far-fetched for a documentary. In addition, the filmmakers seemed to push me towards certain characters, and yet I was completely not sympathetic to the main character because they decided to show it to me. <br /> <br /> This film disappointed me, because the story and the people was interesting, but the film failed due to quick editing, which did not give the viewer enough time to understand each scene. The events in this story were clouded instead of showing people in boxers or other things that were random for the story they were telling. <br /> <br /> I recommended you skip this one and just read on this story.
