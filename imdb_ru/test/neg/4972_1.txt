I like films from the Jurassic Park, they are three of my all-time favorite films of all time. <br /> <br /> And I hate this game if there was one game that I would never have, because it was Super Nintendo. br /> <br /> How can a game based on a classic movie be too terrible? And what's worse, I was scared by this game when I was a kid. <br /> <br /> How stupid it was, but again I was a kid when this game just came out. <br /> <br /> The game in this game is just weird. One minute - the game in the genre of action, and then - shooter. What in the world is wrong in order to make a decision when creating a video game. <br /> <br /> The sound in the game is awful to listen. <br /> <br /> Music is too sick to listen. <br /> <br /> The controllers in the game do not work most of the time. <br /> <br /> The Jurassic Park game is simply a waste of time and money and will not be a classic. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs
