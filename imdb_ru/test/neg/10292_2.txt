Significant spoilers! <br /> <br /> This is a sick, exciting film ... just like a sick, twisted film director Jennifer Chambers Lynch, who also wrote it. I don’t even know why I gave this movie a rating of 2. It’s not the actors' fault for sure. The cast, of course, well reflected their roles. That was how this film was written and how the characters were written, which was the benchmark of a truly sick mind. <br /> <br /> I really know that I will never and never watch another movie that was written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch. She is sick, perverted, dirty, abnormal deviant. She looks, speaks and sounds like some kind of biker chick with brains roasted on drugs, who spent 20 years with difficulty. You can clearly see what kind of person she is by looking at her on the special DVD section “Observation: the watched are watching.” You can see and hear it for yourself. She was just as bad as I imagined from writing this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not shocked by a bad language, although this director certainly speaks like a sailor. This goes far beyond simple bad language; worse than any other film. The level of implied sado-violence and the perversions that it includes in every character she writes belongs to a genre that is even illegal by generally accepted standards. This perverted, disturbing thinking is clearly manifested in her own personality and the things she says. Another reviewer found the description I was looking for. This is a snuff film. <br /> <br /> Be sure to listen to her story about deleted scenes and alternate ending. This director / writer is really a sick person. I can not believe that someone will put it for the film, much less pay for it. You can be sure that I will never watch another movie with which it is associated. In the thousands of films that I watched and collected, there are only a couple of directors and writers who deserve such a boycott. She is more offensive than anyone I've ever seen in a movie shoot before. There were some bad directors and writers, but none could compare with her sick, perverted mind. <br /> <br /> When I saw this film, which was just one violent murder after another. After the cost of killing the hotel ... then the sick police officers shot and drove the drivers behind the wheel ... a family from vacation with bad parents (who didn't have a business in the presence of children) ... then drug addicts ... The film then went on to (even more) perverse, deviant serial killers. <br /> <br /> When I saw how serial killers manifest themselves, I began to wonder what kind of really sick mind wrote this movie. These were my real thoughts when I watched this movie. I fully intended to find out which writer had such a sick mind ... because this writer must be seriously devoted to long-term psychiatric treatment. To my surprise, it turned out to be the director. When I saw and heard what she said on the DVD, I realized that my writer's assessment was right on my nose. On DVD, she was really sick, a perverted person, whom I supposed to write such an alarming film. <br /> <br /> Although the little girl, (Stephanie) Ryan Simpkins, really stole the show ... I can 'I do not believe that her real parents would allow this sick, disgusting director to be with their daughter. <br /> <br /> This film is exciting, sick, insulting, perverted, and the screenwriter needs it. some serious treatment in a psychiatric hospital. <br /> <br /> Regarding the ending of the film ... the alternative ending was to be the result of this terrible ordeal. There was no point and no benefit for the film or the story or the flow of the film by the death of another character. I am stunned that any studio actually distributed the film. The trailer was misleading. The only reason the film got an audience was because of the clever creation of words and the creative image in the trailer. This trailer is not representative of the film that you will see. <br /> <br /> In addition to the child ... every character in this film was sick, murderous, perverse, perverse, violent sex freak, and their characters were reflected in the mind of the writer-director who created them. But if you look closely, even the parents of the resting family; sick cops make shots; serial killers posing in alternate roles; police at the station; and even the station manager ... each of these character roles involved a sexually perverted, violent pervert. I'm not too sure that some actors after watching how they talk about shooting a film and a Canadian city in the “Features” section on DVD. <br /> <br /> This screenwriter-director has such a personal psychic deviation that, no matter what she writes, each character role contains the same copies. The only character who did not have these deviant tendencies was a child. Watch carefully and you will see it in every character. Then listen to the speech of the director-writer in the “Features of the DVD” section, and you will understand that I am talking to you about her mental state and psychological problems. She would not have been allowed in too many decent houses if she were not from a Hollywood cinematic family. <br /> <br /> Luckily, Jennifer Chambers Lynch doesn’t have a big filmography ... less than a few things. Since she copies these disturbing traits in all her character roles, I don’t think we’ll have to watch a lot of films written or made by her, unless her father, director David Lynch, helps her. I would recommend staying away from any movie with which she is associated ... and I'm not too sure that her father's films will be better. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Avoid anything written or sent by Jennifer Chambers Lynch.
