I watched it on Italian television as a child and remember that I liked it - because of the fact that he mixed live action with animation; nevertheless, it was a pan across the board at the time ... and, catching up with it again after all these years, I must admit that the critics were right! <br /> <br /> What should have seemed to the child’s eyes was in fact done very badly, not to mention the boring adventures of fantasy; fatal, and the star (ex- "Angry Young Man" Richard Harris), and the director (action expert Hunt) are poorly suited to the material! At the very least, Michel Legrand's assessment (with words provided by screenwriter Don Black) is sound - if not entirely inspired. By the way, among the famous singers of this British-Belgian co-production featured a number of famous personalities (Julian Glover, Bessi Love, Murray Melvin, Robert Ritty, Vladek Sheybal, Graham Stark and this is his last film. Work, Michael Bates). <br /> <br /> While the plot points of the classic novel by Jonathan Swift (the “giant” Gulliver become a pawn in the war between small people from two neighboring countries and end up in the country of real giants when they escape) really appear here, this is done on a strictly childish level (with stereotypical characters, although, fortunately, a slight invasion of comic / romantic diversity) - which makes this whole enterprise somewhat meaningless, outside of its essentially experimental nature. Since Max and Dave Fleisher has already made a great full-length animated version of the book in 1939!
