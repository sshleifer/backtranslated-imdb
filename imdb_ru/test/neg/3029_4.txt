Does anyone remember the threads of dokudramy? This is a dramatic documentary that shook the UK in September 1984. Although the Holocaust horror film Mick Jackson did not quite entertain me, I could respect him. Unfortunately, I cannot respect this documentary broadcast 20 years later, in which terrorists launch a radioactive dirty bomb in central London. <br /> <br /> The problem I faced was that director Daniel Percival was very much appreciated in production. too good, when in fact it will benefit from the rather cheap cost of production. Cinematography is great, but in this type of speculative drama, do we need an excellent and well-lit standard Oscar cinematography? What we certainly do not need is musical accompaniment, since the survivors of the explosion slowly run out of smoke. We also do not need vaguely known actors. Has anyone else sat there and asked himself: â€œHey, where is he? Do I know this face several times? I know what I did, and it is very distracting. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest drawback of the DIRTY WAR is that someone decided to make it a doodrama with an excessive stylistic emphasis on drama. In "Threads," action breaks away from action at Sheffield many times and becomes an edition of "HORIZON" about the consequences of nuclear war, and then again reduced to fictional characters, and because of this, NITI are very effective. Here the information presented stifles a drama that is drowning in an expositional and completely unconvincing dialogue. The characters in the television show are not really characters, they are just ciphers to inform the audience about what happens when radioactive material explodes. It would have been better if the action had been reduced to signatures in order to transmit information of the type such as "THREAD" Worst of all, director Daniel Percival used the same technique as in Thread, a couple of years ago in his documentation of smallpox. He should have used the same style with DIRTY WAR <br /> <br /> I should also put my cards on the table and state that although I do not think that most Muslims are terrorists, I am a little fed up with such television programs , like the HAMBURG CELL, the NET and the Dirty War, forced to point out this fact to me, luring me over my head, which is somewhat typical for PC patronage in television companies, I was able to skip the studio debate, which Bob mentions here, but I also heard that this was discussed elsewhere, and I can't help but think that this makes browsing better than DIRTY WAR itself, with its heated arguments between the various factions of the political spectrum. If DIRTY WAR is remembered in twenty years (which is unlikely, I know), it is quite possible to recall it for the discussion that caused most of all
