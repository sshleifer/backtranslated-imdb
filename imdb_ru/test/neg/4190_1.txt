This film was so bad that I don’t know where to start, apparently, the filmmakers. It all starts with a guy about thirty or forty watching television. The news is about a corn maze that is open to Halloween. He has a "vision" that God knows what he is, and he rushes to save his children, who go into the maze of the corn field and are somehow connected with this "vision." How do you ask? I don't know, and, as I said, the directors, too. They are simply visions of the feet of people. How did he get these "visions"? This is never explained, we just have to agree with that. He enters the labyrinth to find his two daughters who are lost inside, and twice the girls he seeks pass by him, once they come across him. What does he do? Is he chasing them? No, he stands there like an idiot calling them when they just ran past. Girls stop? Not. They run away and ask, "Was that a dad?" Then someone dressed as a demon jumps on the "star" (dad's character), he beats him in a miserable fight, only to find out that he is a worker in a haunted maze. They called the police and, finding a "star" (which is a really bad term), put handcuffs on him. They shackle his hands in front of him so that he can find something to break the lock, which he does. First of all, anyone who has ever been arrested knows that the police are shackling your hands behind your back, and secondly, why does this “middle guy” seem to know how to break the lock on the handcuffs? Well, in the end, he runs away from the cops who give up and leave after the star's wife launches a siren in a police car to get distracted. By the way, it's night time, and all the workers who manage the labyrinth seem to have left after sunset. Leave the person who attacked one of their workers and two missing children in the maze. Considering that it was a slow night, that they are their only clients, why not. In addition, the police apparently have more important things to do. By the way, the "star", which bears the name "Walker", we find out that this is his last name, the name by which his wife even calls him. Somehow he knows that something is buried in the middle of this labyrinth and starts digging. I say “somehow” because I could not understand why he began to dig in the first place. He finds a locket, what does that mean? For anyone who follows this, but for him it is a kind of key to crime. Someone killed his children in his "vision", and I think that this is what he does, real detective work. And now he knows that there is a killer in the maze of corn, which he somehow knew was there from the very beginning of the film, so he is looking for his girls. Every time we see a killer, or, more precisely, his legs, we hear a strange robotic sound like a science fiction toy that changes a man’s voice to a mechanical one. Why do we hear this sound? Does it have something to do with ... anything? Again who knows? Of course, not the creators of the film. The peak of all bad behavior and bad dialogue was when "Walker" shouts: "Hey, Mr. Bad Man ... I'll catch you." On another occasion, his wife was attacked by a “bad person” at the entrance to the corn maze, which, as I mentioned earlier, is strangely deprived of any officers or police officers. The "bad man" calls the "Walker" on a mobile phone to inform him that he plans to kill his wife, his children and him too. “Walker” can only answer “Hey. Hey!” before you drop your phone and run away. Not being able to talk to someone at the other end, the killer also dropped his phone, dragged his wife a few feet, and then left her alone for the rest of the film, missing the first opportunity to stay true to his pleasures. If this script had not been written by a child, I would be surprised. Opps it was not. It was written, directed, and produced by the same guy. And not only that, he also did so much shitty work with the camera, where we get random shots of feet walking through a dirty maze and pointless shots of a corn field that waste 90% of the film’s time. In the end, “Walker” uses the cuffs for the “Bad Man” handcuff, who also seems to know how to pick locks with the same metal object that “Walker” cracked him with. Apparently, around this corn field are many small metal objects. But after the killer insists he is still going to kill the children, Walker kills the Bad Man, and the world is all right. Now, in reality, this makes “Walker” a murderer, he killed a man who “allegedly” killed his own daughters and tried to kill him. He knows this not because of the evidence, but because of his visions. He never found the body, no one else knows that this guy was even in a maze. And the locket? He returns it to the ghosts of two dead girls. There is no evidence. Therefore, he kills a person without any material reason. I can't imagine what the filmmakers thought about it. It must have been a way to hide the misappropriation of funds by a manufacturing company. I'd rather watch the Blair Witch project five times than watch this movie again. The actors should be ashamed. The director / producer / writer / operator should also be ashamed. In fact, the entire production company should be ashamed. If there is someone associated with this film, please respond. What were you thinking about?
