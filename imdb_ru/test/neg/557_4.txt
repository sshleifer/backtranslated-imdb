“The Next Child of Karate” is an absolutely predictable film, like its predecessors. Its predictability often leads to a feeling of impatience on the part of the viewer, who often wants the story to move a little faster. However, despite their sleepiness and extreme familiarity, this fourth entry in the series is painless almost exclusively due to the presence of Morita. He seems not to be tired of his role, and he brings a bit of life and humor to the film, becoming for you the best reason to see him. Not terrible, but nothing special.
