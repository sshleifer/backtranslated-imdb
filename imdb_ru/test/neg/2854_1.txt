Before watching this film (at the director’s screening) we were informed that he won a short film prize in the Flewh Galway film. Undoubtedly, this result will give hope to filmmakers, anyone can achieve greater success than this! <br /> <br /> As no one can see Donny Darko’s blatant robbery in this, I will never know. The film is idle talk, actor's cardboard, ridiculous dialogues and the ending is just flat! The only comforting bit we enjoyed after watching this garbage is to loudly comment on how awful it is in front of the director! Yes, it was mean, but it releases! <br /> <br /> At least the Irish film industry can’t come down below!
