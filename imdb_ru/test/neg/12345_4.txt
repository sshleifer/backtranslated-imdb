For the first forty minutes, the Moon is a real pleasure to watch. The characters and their situation are interesting, and the photos and locations are beautiful. Then Jill Clayberg discovers that her son Matthew Barry uses heroin, and the film begins to break up, and then becomes just ridiculous because of his illness. <br /> <br /> Kleiburg asks him why and when he started using drugs, and she, or the public, would ever get a direct answer, which would be a little useful. He mentions that he doesn't care about anything, but this is not correct, because we clearly see in the amazing early scenes that he is very interested in singing, baseball, his mother's sex, and obviously takes enough care to refuse marijuana. This film is for people who think that the younger one gets drugs, because mom and dad were workaholics who missed his piano concerto. I think that such a dangerous and emotionally volatile drug like heroin was chosen as a kind of intellectual catalyst for the subsequent incest scenes. There is a lot of discussion about motherâ€™s love for his son, but in fact Bernardo Bertolucci is pretentious. The moon would be gorgeous, like a strange little family drama. <br /> <br /> How old was Matthew Barry in this movie? I was more concerned about the strange things he had to do as an actor for this film than anything his character went through. ** outside ****
