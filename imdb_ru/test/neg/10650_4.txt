Rarely seen is a film that is so different from the original premise and still remains (more or less) acceptable. The bloody line is a rather short (in this case, a good thing) escapade that focuses on the mysterious HellRaiser's box. Who wanted it to be done, and how it conjured the whole family tree of the person who ultimately created it. We are introduced to 3 generations of the Merchants family (all played by Bruce Ramsey); one in Paris of the 18th century, one in the present and the last in a future galaxy far, far ?? Opinions on this storyline can vary greatly - either you think that this is very idiotic and contrived, or - original and bold. Clive Barker's original atmosphere and setting has completely disappeared, but the painful environment remains, and several episodes are still very creepy and disturbing. Hellraiser: Bloodline contains quite a lot of exquisite slaughter, and the pinhead’s charismatic presence (Doug Bradley) is still an added value to horror. Pinhead ?? accompanied by a pet puppy this time ?? still knows how to kill, too bad, he talks too much, and his wicked speeches tend to get bored as a rule. The best aspects of this production are the recently presented “senobits” and an occult Parisian portrait. Giant outages are a weak scenario, the absence of typical creepy humor and the lack of references to Barker's original masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Bloodline, though not particularly catchy in itself, remains the last watchable movie Hellraiser. After this continuation, the series went downhill completely. At the moment, 2 more sequels have been released (2 more are continuing), and none of them is worth watching. HellRaiser: The Pedigree suffered from many production difficulties, and ultimately the director chose to be credited to Alan Smith. This means that he does not want to be remembered as a director. Who could blame him?
