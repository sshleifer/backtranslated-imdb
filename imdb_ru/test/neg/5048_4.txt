Entering in “Learning Mrs. Tingle,” all I wanted was a funny, pleasant, youthful comedy that would entertain me, because this is a work time. Despite the pretty good first half hour, the film quickly turns into a boring, mediocre mess that is about as entertaining as pulling eyelashes with pliers. Rusty pliers. The author of the movie "Scream" Kevin Williamson wrote and shot this film and proved that Creek may have been an accident. Most of the elements of this film have already been seen a million times in other films; and although it was normal for him to steal elements from other films in Scream because it was intended as a slasher tribute; here, it seems, he has absolutely no ideas left. The plot follows the smartest girl in school, played by Katie Holmes. Being caught cheating with her two friends; three decide to take the teacher who caught them hostage in her home. However, it is not just a teacher; This is Mrs. Tingle, the meanest bitch in school. She is also not tied to a bed and does not go to bed, since she begins to play intellectual games in order to turn her captors against each other. <br /> <br /> The plot is very similar to the 1997 film “Suicide Kings”. and a whole series of earlier films. This is actually a good idea for the film, and if Williamson could populate the film with interesting characters; it could work very well. Mrs. Tingle's character is the most interesting in the film, but she is massively one-dimensional, like all the other characters in the film; it's just a caricature. The game is mostly devilish, with the exception of Helen Mirren in the title role. She is angry enough in this role, and although she doesn’t have many opportunities to push her teeth into her; she obviously likes to play the central figure. The teenage lineup is not worth mentioning, only Katie Holmes stands out; and this is only because of her star profile, not her acting talents. Williamson draped almost every scene with boring soft-rock music, which would be very unpleasant if the film was not terrible anyway. Honestly, there are some good moments in this movie; but basically, if you want to see a good example of comedy for teenagers - this is not the movie you want to watch.
