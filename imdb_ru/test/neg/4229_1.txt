It was just a misfortune to see this truly horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Think about this scene in Magnolia at the end with a slow panorama of this woman. Now remove the pan, add to the mixture of breathing and unshaven men, and you get what were 2 and a half hours of humanity. <br /> <br /> The inspector is a real fool, not even a fool, just a vague, slow-moving simpleton. How they solved the crime, I do not know. <br /> <br /> Mandatory sex scenes are terrible and grateful. <br /> <br /> Possible villain (he raped and killed an 11-year-old girl). ) is marked very early, and it is not surprising if you are not as weak-minded. <br /> <br /> Uninteresting camera work. <br /> <br /> The director said that the audience should provide their own interpretation of the case. I suppose that he also had in mind to provide their own dialogue (there is everything that is needed, adding to his level of boredom), resourceful camera work (just static shots that completely deprive the obvious beauty of the landscape in which the film is made) and the plot! br /> <br /> Really awful. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10.
