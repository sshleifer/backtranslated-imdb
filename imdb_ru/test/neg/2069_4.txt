For those who expect the cover and storyline to point to another interesting Bollywood performance, be careful: there are no musical dance numbers or production songs that could beautify the mood in this rather weary story of organized marriages in British Indian culture - with multiple options. As written by Rupesh Pareh, the script sorts through topics worthy of discussion, only to cover up their routine avoidance tactics. Harmage Singh Kalirai is sent as a traffic cop, trying to hold the disparate scenes together to the point of Keystone Cop's tactics. <br /> <br /> Jimi (Chris Bisson) is a medical student, gay and lover Jack (Peter Ash), and they live with obesity, alcoholism, Jack's loose morals, Aunt Vanessa (Sally Banks) and the plump daughter Sally Hannah (Katie Clayton). The Jimi family is visited by the Patel family from Delhi, who is carrying her beautiful daughter Simran (Jinder Mahal) to England to find a husband. Jimi's parents (Saeed Jaffrey and Jamilya Massey) and his grandmother (Zohra Segal) decide that Simran is the girlfriend for Jimi to marry and arrange engagement and wedding according to the custom of the Indian ways - without consulting Jimi. Jimi discovers a conspiracy and is too characterless to disagree with him, a decision that infuriates Jack and infuriates Vanessa. Hannah says “little lie” to Simran (that she is Jimi’s daughter), and the wedding ends. When Jimi's parents visit Jimi's house, they discover a drunken Vanessa, repelled by her, but ultimately decide that for the sake of happiness, Jimi will agree with the fact that Vanessa gave them a granddaughter, and decide to use wedding preparations as a wedding for Jimi and Vanessa. Jimi convinces Vanessa very reluctantly to agree with this idea, and soon Vanessa dressed in a sari, prepared for the wedding, and Jimi, frightened by what he does, just to please her parents, considers Jack to be her best man. At the wedding, it turns out the truth, and to the surprise of Jimi, his family adapts to the true nature of Jimi, and the day is saved by the fact that he is just true. <br /> <br /> Actors do a fine job with this silly nonsense, and there are some good performances: Chris Bisson and Peter Ash are attractive men and play their roles well, although without any sign of a love relationship (director, seems afraid to show the smallest assumption of intimacy between two men); Sally Banks provides most of the laughter like Vanessa; the rest of the actors repeat the stereotypical roles that they have played countless times in Indian films. This is not a bad movie - it has its moments - but it’s too superficial and tired to make us care for any of the characters.
