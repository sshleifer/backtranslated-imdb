I don't know why, but I watched it with a sense of anticipation. Unfortunately, this was inappropriate. Firstly, it’s not terrible, it’s not scary and (if it wasn’t even worse than I thought, it’s possible) it’s not trying. This is a trashy comedy, and the fact that I once smiled means that I gave her 2, not 1. This Gramlins movie in a truly special way, I can’t say that I’ve ever seen a movie that is more devotes himself. Very, very bad - avoid.
