This is one of those road films that would like to tell you a lot about women, the universe, a better life, the terrible loneliness of a brilliant Manhattan architect who breaks all ties with everyone, including his three-year-old child - which may seem irresponsible to some. In fact, the hero wins when it comes to egoism and the scene with his old school friend, who begins as a kind old-fashioned conversation and ends on a threatening note - an oasis in the film about the desert. <br /> <br /> A scene with the father who left the house when I was, the child was told, told and told. Of course, this did not prevent the child from getting through. of life. And when you see the attitude of the hero's wife, you might think that she had never heard of female freedom. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack sounds best and includes great songs by Willie Nelson, Tom Waits or Bonnie Reitt ... But you can enjoy them without this tedious, pretentious work.
