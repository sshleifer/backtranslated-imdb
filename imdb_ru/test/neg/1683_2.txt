I jumped for joy, having learned that this show was over. The characters of this show were extremely annoying. None of them had a singing, redeeming quality. Damon Wayans is probably the most worthy. Kisha Campbell is ... Kisha Campbell. She is just as annoying as in Martin. <br /> <br /> Children are also very annoying. The older one is an idiot, the older one is a stuck girl, and the younger one is upset about listening to her. <br /> <br /> I think I liked the little smart boy. But that's about it. <br /> <br /> He did the world a favor by finishing. <br /> <br /> Let's pray that Wyan never starred in another show ... EVER.
