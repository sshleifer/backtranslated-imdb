I generally do not appreciate the lightweight attempts to create funny stories, which means that "Anita but Perd El Tren" can not get very high marks for me. The story is good: a middle-aged woman, but still looking good, acquires a new love. But attempts to turn this film into a romantic comedy sometimes turned out to be comic. <br /> <br /> Rosa Maria Sarda skillfully demonstrated that she can be a serious actress in such productions as Amik / Amat (see), Todo Sobremi Madre (see), Las Amargas Lagrimas de Peter. " von Kant "(see) and El Embrujo de Shanghai" (see). However, the forces that they had over the years saved her from many trivial things, for film and for television. Something similar can be said about Jos√© Coronado: he is very good at giving serious ideas. Maria Barranco safely belongs to this group. <br /> <br /> In the end, I had the feeling that I would be very happy to see the new creation of this film, in a serious tone, which will allow the actors to really show their performing skills. And it's curious that this should be cd Lano with the same leading actors. Wasted talent on pretty silly movie that could be really promising.
