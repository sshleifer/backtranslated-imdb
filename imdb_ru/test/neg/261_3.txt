When I read the reviews about Kahin Pyaar Na Ho Jay, I thought: “A?”. It was very strange. To be sure, I went to watch a movie, and what do you know? This is a remake of "The Wedding Singer". Several scenes have been modified to fit the whole essence of Indian style, but the rest is a direct climb from the 1998 Hollywood hit. Bollywood is not new to remakes, but it is so poor that it hurts me to just watch it. I so moaned, watching it, and realized that I am not the only one who does it! One guy really left the theater and never returned! Salman Khan should seriously stop playing comedic roles. He screams and whines too much. Why can't he just calm down? He does not pay tribute to the role originally played by Adam Sandler. He has no sense of Sandler’s comedic selection. Rani is a wonderful actress and one of my favorites, but she is not Drew Barrymore. The scene where she is standing in front of the mirror, practicing to say her new last name (“Hi, I'm Mrs. Pugalia”) does not match the version of Barrymore (“Hello, I'm Mrs. Julia Gulia”). I was embarrassed to watch this scene, although I loved the original. The music is not so bad. This is probably the only saving grace of this terrible film! Avoid this at all costs!
