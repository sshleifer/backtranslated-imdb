Without a shadow of a doubt, this will probably always be the worst film I've ever had the good fortune to see all my life. Take the 5 wooden actors that were thrown out of the acting school because they were so wooden that someone sat on them, thinking that they were a bench. <br /> <br /> Then add a cheap camcorder. You know the old VHS types that cost Â£ 20 on ebay. Add a horrible storyline with no effects, and yes, you have this movie. What a shocker it was. They could not even save him, having a suitable girl in him. She was fat and ugly and was the worst of them all. I actually watched all of this because I could not believe that this shit was ever funded. <br /> <br /> SKIP ALL COST
