In 1932, Humphrey Bogart was relatively unknown - an unsubstantiated actor who starred in one of his first films. And, since he was unknown, the film they gave him was clearly a B-film — a quick film with relatively low expectations. Seeing this, I understood why Bogart would need many more years. And one more film studio before it becomes a household word. Although the film is not terrible, it is certainly not very good, which makes it more curious than anything else when they see it today. <br /> <br /> Bogart is a pilot who dreams of creating his own aviation engine. Company. However, when an empty rich playing girl appears on his way, all his dreams seem to come true. As one of the characters in the film said, the combination of these two words is like oil and water — they just don't mix. <br /> <br /> While Bogart is throwing out his promising career, his sister is going at full speed on the way to Scanville - meeting a lousy guy who convinces her to sleep with rich guys so they can shake them for a lot of money! The ghost does not know that his sister is NOT an actress for whom she claims, and does not realize later that the rich woman whom he loves leaves him for the sake of the same guy whose mistress ... Bogart's sister !!! All this leads to the final, which is quite pleasant. However, what follows is one of the stupidest scenes I've seen in a very long time! By now, a rich lady is not going to marry a boy who is sleeping with her sister, Boggi (like that!), But since she is now poor and useless for Bogart, she is going to fly away and kill herself. The ghost finds out, chases the plane on foot, jumps on the plane when it takes off, and crawls up the fuselage to take control of the plane and save it !!! It is so stupid and ridiculous that I laughed out loud. Up until then, I could get 4 or 5 - it lowered the film to 3 (the way one reviewer gave it 8, is higher than me). <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that it was a talking and stupid film. On top of that, everything is different for Bogart, because the hero of the action movie at the end who loves each other is a terrible match for his person, who was so wonderfully created in the early 40s. Courageous and solid is better suited to a man - one of the great American actors, but clearly not in his element. <br /> <br /> By the way, those who love Pre-Code films and their very grown-up feelings may want to see this one. Virtually everyone in the film believes and practices premarital sex and Bogga’s curses in the film - things you would never see after the more stringent and more moral Production Code was adopted in 1934.
