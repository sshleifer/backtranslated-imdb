I love Ustinov's distinctive, competent narration. And the picture is quiet, pleasant. We put the film for our 3.5-year-old, who seemed to be wandering and leaving the room. So for our first viewing, we only saw about a third of the film and were completely fascinated. When we reviewed our family time, we were all upset by the violence and life-threatening situations that the poor otter fell into. About halfway through the movie there is a flock of dead, bloody, furry animals. A lot of blood, not just a little. Then, at the end, there is a wild fight with the dog, then the blood clouds the water. You might think, given the G rating, that's all you see ... that they mean that one of the animals has died. Nope They pull the carcass out of the water and show it for a few traumatic seconds. Personally, I, as an adult, love horror films, and cruel films like Scorsese, Cronenberg, Tarantino suit me. Gosh, I love the ultra-brutal Battle Royale. But these are not children's films and do not advertise themselves as such. If you consciously educate your little ones to see the harsh realities of the life of cute animals, then this film is for you. If you are like me and my wife, you may want to save your child from nightmares and avoid it.
