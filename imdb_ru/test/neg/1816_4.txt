This is the first and, as far as I can tell, the only finished production of "Heart of Darkness" ever released. Before the start of “Citizen Kane”, Orson Welles made several test videos for the version of “Heart of Darkness”, which should have been completely shot in what will now be called “POV”, where we will see everything from the point of view of the main character Charlie Marlow; it could be seen only fleetingly in mirrors, windows, water, etc. The film was not shot. The POV technique was used, not too successfully, in 1947 in Dame in the Lake, where Robert Montgomery played a major role in the role of Philip Marlow. Presumably, the coincidence of the two characters "Marlow (e)" is just that. Of course, Francis Coppola's Apocalypse Today was based on the Heart of Darkness. <br /> <br /> A short novel “The Heart of Darkness” by the British writer of Polish origin, Joseph Conrad, first serialized in British literature. The 1899 magazine tells about one of his favorite alter egos, ship captain Charlie Marlowe, who also tells the story “Youth” and indirectly tells the story of “Lord Jim”. Marlowe, temporarily out of work, decides to get a job as captain of a riverboat for a Belgian company involved in the brutal exploitation of the personal wealth of King Leopold II, who is cruelly called the Free State of Congo. Marlow travels from London to Brussels, signs a contract with the company, and is told that his mission is to take the boat up the Congo River to a distant inner station, headed by one of the company's most productive agents in the colony, a German named Kurtz, Deliveries of ivory, latex (for the production of rubber) and other products from Kurtz station ceased, and for some time not a word reached Kurtz. Rumor has it that he is "native." Marlowe must conduct an investigation, take any necessary steps and draw up a report on his return. He runs along the West African coast to the mouth of the Congo, lingers for several weeks while he is forced to repair the boat at the company's station on the coast, and finally goes upstairs to find the Kurtz station. The river, heat, vegetation, wildlife, insects, people - all this affects his endurance, his imagination and his mental resources. He finds Kurtz sick, half mad, and close to death. The final meeting and the death of Kurtz are almost anticlimax, all the more so because Konrad is so unclear about what is actually happening that we have to figure it out ourselves. This is a novel in which you close a book, vaguely dissatisfied with the ending, but nevertheless rising in price for its amazing atmosphere. <br /> <br /> This Heart of Darkness was taken from Guyana in Central America, which stood for West Africa. Best of all, when the novel is in its greatest flaw: it actually shows us the urban worlds of the First World how the boat trip up the tropical river will look like. But the rest of the film was forgettable. Tim Roth does everything possible like Marlowe, but so much about the plot, the characteristics and the relationship of the characters has been changed beyond recognition, so you wonder why they were worried. If the goal was to make Conrad's story for the screen, why didn't they leave her alone? It is unreasonable to expect that when creating a book in a film, compromises will not be achieved, but so many changes have been made that there was no cinematic justification for me, that you are wondering whether we are dealing with incompetent scriptwriters and cinematographers. The most disappointing was John Malkovich in the role of Kurtz. He was completely out of touch and just indulged in the role. Everything about him is wrong: his appearance, his style of play, his voice, his accent, everything. A much better choice would be someone like Bruno Ganza (unlike Malkovich, a real German, like a character). <br /> <br /> This is a very disappointing work, and I recommend it only after you read it. If you want to get a visual picture of a boat trip up the Congo River around 1900, you can count on you need to rely not only on your imagination.
