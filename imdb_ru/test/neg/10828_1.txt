That's right ... so you have a dam, tons of water (it seems that it flows very slowly) and a small town that is right under the destructive dam. Add to this the speculative gluttony, obviously mentally unbalanced and disgruntled architect and his son, and then, to revive the situation, you add a weak conspiracy and a bad game. In general, when you look at this movie in terms of paying customers ... I would feel very annoyed if it were a pay-per-view movie. If you want to laugh ... then you really need to watch this movie.
