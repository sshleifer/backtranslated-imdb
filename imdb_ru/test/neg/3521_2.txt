usually a film that starts off badly stays bad in a monotonously descending order. This bad movie started to look better before plunging into a cool dive. The game, with the exception of the male antagonist, was terrible. The plot was essentially prepared for the final main stage, which is probably good as a performance art, but in this film it was wasted. Not sure why this movie was made.
