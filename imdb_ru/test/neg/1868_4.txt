Some things just won't stay dead. They just have to come back again and again, whether we like it or not. I think some people love to beat a dead horse. The first “Ghoulies” was an unexpected hit, and its first sequel was an even better film. The third film used a more comical approach, and by this time the little buggers began to experience their reception. I think someone in Hollywood thought it was a good idea to revive the franchise, but the result is likely to disappoint fans of previous recordings. <br /> <br /> Pros: acting is really good for a movie like this. Stupid, but fun to score. Moves at a normal pace. Some cheese for those who love it. Some pretty good action sequences. It has a little more plot than the others, and unlike II and III, at least it tries to connect itself with the original. <br /> <br /> Cons: Not as fun as its predecessors. Although it has more plot than before, it is rather ridiculous. Bad effects. The original Ghoulies only appear in the memories, and here they are replaced by two trolls that serve no purpose other than being comic reliefs. Speaking of comedy, all attempts at humor are inconclusive. This is a direct continuation of the first film, but there are so many loose ends. For example, I thought Jonathan did away with black magic after what happened in the original? Not that it was impressive in others, but the direction of this film is especially soft. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: the first three films of "Ghoulies" are the dream of bad movie lovers. This fourth, and so far the final (hopefully) final, is a little disappointing. Of course, you can have fun, but it's not the same. Others also have low budgets, but the people involved invest much more in them. See if you are a finished man or want to see beautiful women in scanty clothes. Otherwise, just stick to the other three. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/5
