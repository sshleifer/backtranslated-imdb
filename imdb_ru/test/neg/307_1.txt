I checked it at the Vancouver International Film Festival and was not impressed. <br /> <br /> The only area of ​​the film that I liked was the comments about making the film. For the most part, this film seemed random and somewhat fantastic (I’m not saying that as a compliment, however) and just silly. It was as if he confused fantasy with everyday life, which may sound intriguing in some films, but this fantasy seemed too perverse. <br /> <br /> My criticism of this film is not the actors, but the story itself. I found it boring and narcissistic. I wanted to get my money back, but considering that it was a film festival, this should not have happened.
