Watchable, but pretty awful. How shocking the fact that this was the last director's title of the great Gregory La Cava! Even in his more famous roles, I donâ€™t care about Gene Kelly. He seems complacent, hostile and self-absorbed to me. Here, paired with a minor actress, such as Marie Wilson, he seems to be showing these features in peaks. <br /> <br /> Marie Wilson, who plays the heiress, who falls in love with the military, is extremely tough and does not sympathize. The actors seem to do their best to overcome the tough, unpleasant essence of the picture, and they cope. <br /> <br /> The knowing butler seems to have to be funny, but he seems to have an extended riff on narrow pieces that Franklin Pangborn was famous for (and in which, despite their stereotypes, he was generally funny - unlike this guy). Phyllis Takster is, as always, very attractive in a rather underdeveloped secondary plot.
