One would think that a film in which the three biggest stars of male cinema of the era after the Second World War were filmed would become a classic. These three, who also turned out to be my favorites, roam in a daze, looking as if they should be anywhere but there. <br /> <br /> Sadly, The Way West definitely had some potential to be a classic. These days of political correctness, a film about the American pioneers and the difficulties of their migration to the west has not been made. Then it would be better to do it. <br /> <br /> Kirk Douglas is a former United States senator who heads a train to the west to build a settlement in the Willamette Valley in Oregon. As a former politician, he values ​​above those hoi-ploy he heads. The scenario requires that he not only had a covered wagon, but also a carriage to drive the train. <br /> <br /> You think it's funny, you have to see the scene where Douglas orders his black servant, played by Roy Glenn, to beat him. I will not spoil it by saying what makes Douglas demand it from Glenn, but believe me, this is bad. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum is a guide along the trail, and of the three stars he looks the most bored. It was assumed that on the set between Widmark and Douglas there should have been a lot of friction, but Mitchum just strolls over the film over it all. <br /> <br /> Perhaps some friction helped, because the film calls on Douglas, a widower, pay attention to Mrs. Widmark, played by Lola Albright. Now she is the most beautiful thing in the film. <br /> <br /> The film says she represents Sally Field. This was done between her Gidget and her days of Flying Nun. She plays a piece of white southern trash with a musical comedy named Mersey Macby. We first see her in the film, sitting in the backseat of her parents, with arms akimbo and attractive. Of course, she receives an invitation at her invitation. <br /> <br /> Her character is similar to what can be found in every trailer park in America, and then that it was a wagon, but one large trailer park on the go. <br /> <br /> Despite this film, Sally Field took up the career of two Oscars. What this woman had to overcome. <br /> <br /> Victor McLaglen's son, Andrew, led the subject and, along with a lousy script, turned it into a messy mess. Shame on Andrew McLaglen, he certainly did better in his career. <br /> <br /> And you too, unless you are a star.
