I had just finished reading a book and was looking forward to this television adaptation, which was broadcast on the Hallmark Channel on Monday evening (05.30.05). The key to the whole book was a manifesto that was stolen by a man with steel teeth, but I watched for an hour (out of 3 1/2), and I saw a man with steel teeth, but I never saw him steal the manifesto, I saw how someone stole a virus, but what does this have to do with the book? This is very bad, because this film had great production values ​​and a good cast, but not the idea to turn a book into a film (television or film) to make the people who read the book be part of the audience. They kept me for only an hour. I thought the premise of the book was gorgeous, and what they did, but they threw away the whole premise. This book was a great McGuffin (paraphrasing Hitchcock), but they ignored him. And the names say that Forsyth was involved in production. They must have paid him a LOT of money.
