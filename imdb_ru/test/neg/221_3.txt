I am so angry that I usually do reviews with spoilers, but in this case I will make an exception. The first scenes of this film are weak, and then when they reach the meat and potatoes of the film, it sucks. This one film in which I rooted for the bad guys because “Captain Saved the Day” was incredible, and there was no connection to it or nothing that could make you love him. The main actor gave the weakest performance, and Laurence Fishburn or Matt Dillon could not even save the film. Sometimes there are revelations or great moments in a film that may not be so good ... they are not in this film. If you are looking for a film to watch at the same time, while nothing interested you ... don't choose this ... leave your money.
