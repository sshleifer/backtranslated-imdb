OK, let's start with the best. building. Although it is hard to believe that after 35 years it had electricity and running water, as well as fire, terrible walls and strange objects found everywhere were interesting. besides this, it is not worth it. <br /> <br /> How bad it is made by WWE movies. WTF? should that make you want to see it? anyway, stay away. A terrible, terrible idea for them to make films and let Gregory Dark control him. bad choice. Previews were more interesting and interesting. <br /> <br /> I can't even begin to discuss how bad this film is. mediocre actors and disappointing, vague plot. Apparently, many of the actors from this show are all saints. It's amazing why I never heard of them or their shows. besides this, the bus driver, whom you donâ€™t even see, only he closes the door, had more actions than everyone else. at least he copes with the tricks in some decent movies. <br /> <br /> I like watching scary movies, really. but this one blew up so much, the whole audience laughed at it and cheered the characters halfway through. very annoying. the child behind me shouted more during the previews of other horror films. <br /> <br /> this is not a film to watch, even less if you have to pay for it.
