Gordon Scott has made some good Tarzan movies, but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> While I was watching him, I grimaced at the bad, obviously interior decorations and the hollow wooden “cloning” sounds when they supposedly went through them. dirty tracks, and clinging to the poor dialogue and the worst actions among the support staff, I continued to think: “Damn! This is the level of the TV show! ”Then I find out that the three episodes of the pilot series were intertwined. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see Scott walking outside (one), far from lame sets, in several scenes; and the fights do have some pretty good moves ... but oh, and oh, how about dialogue. And did I mention acting skills? Hell, Cheetah (or “Chet” in this version) was a better actor than most people. <br /> <br /> And that says little. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of stitch to see the younger Sherman (i.e. Skatman) Carothers acting as a native. But probably not worth the total cost of time.
