Did Agustus and Call really do anything? Why are they heroes, they did nothing but get to places where the bad guys were dead. What was the point of this show? I was very very disappointed. I expected more action, more history and see the birth of Heroes and great deeds. Instead, I saw very little, it seemed that Agustus and Call was just an extra story for a great Indian leader. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m not even sure that the story is even very close. They did very little to show why Texans and Comanches fought against each other. <br /> <br /> The only good part in this film was Jean, who played Gus very well and is a great actor. Lots of good story you could miss. It was sad, and I wish I had watched it.
