First of all, just to say that I did not receive a publication, which I thought I would receive - I chose the Italian version instead of R2, but in fact it was the British edition of 1998 pretending to be a special edition, I never knew that there was a DVD release in the UK - but the promised biogs were not really on the disc - just a couple of trailers. In any case - as for the film itself - just as I was recovering after Killing at Night, my second thriller dedicated to female genital mutilation appeared in the same month - this time in a (Italian) British schoolgirl dismissed, and the teachers Fabio Testi - unfortunately) is married, but nails one of his students - becomes the main suspect. Joachim Fuchsberger - a detective in the case. Sorry that I was less than fascinated. It was watchable, but more than equally unsuccessful, and, apart from the aforementioned horrible nature of the crime, the “unexpected” assassination of Christina Galbo, which was actually “spoiled” by the DVD cover telling me about it - Grrrrrr !!!! and the unexpected twist that throws the "victims" in the new light - I thought that was very common. This will not push me away from two "sequels." with Karin (Hannibal Brooks) Baal and Camilla (I spit on your grave) Keaton.
