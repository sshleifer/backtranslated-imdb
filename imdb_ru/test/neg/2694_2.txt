I saw this film as a preview before the opening of Venice at the Telluride Film Festival. Your reaction to this will largely depend on your attitude to the text of Shakespeare. On the positive side: Pacino gives a very good performance, like Shylock; Lynn Collins - the perfect portion; and the film has a gorgeous look. <br /> <br /> Negatives are predictable. The Venetian Merchant is perhaps the most complex of all the plays of Shakespeare, which can be staged today, mainly because we look at it through the distorting lens of 20th century history. Romantic plot with Bassanio and Portia is no problem. The character of Shylock is, because we lack the original frame of reference for the Elizabethan audience. Shylock is both a human character with human qualities and motivations, as well as an abstraction of the ruthless quality of the Old Law. When he says, “Doesn't a Jew have eyes?” He is a character; when he proclaims: “I will have my connection!” he is an abstraction. A long excerpt about music and cosmic harmony in the final scene (transferred here and cut to ribbons) is the key to the play, as it restores universal harmony after the forces of destructive power and evil (Shylock test scene) are thrown away. One can understand the psychological character of Shylock’s character by showing that he is gradually going crazy and turning into a monomane by the time the test scene rotates - the main thing is that at some point he ceases to be sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Speech by Pacino almost does it, but not quite. The film can not decide - on the one hand, in the character of Shylock is the correct movement, and on the other - a lot of extraneous video recordings of cruel treatment of Jews and Venetian whores with ruddy nipples. (no doubt to show the decline of Antonio et al.). Shakespeare did not write a social drama like Ibsen; he wrote a comedy, following the classical scheme of destruction of public order and restoration of social order, symbolized by marriage, with the theme of love and law in the center of the plot of Shylock. <br /> <br /> In this sense, the film is a parody - the operation of Radford on the game and the guide almost forces us to what the game really means. (Taking the start of the final scene, cutting out most of it and moving it to the test scene is the most extreme example.) There are other significant difficulties. Jeremy Irons, a wonderful actor, plays Antonio as if he was overdosed with sedatives. Joseph Fiennes is nice, but as shallow as Bassanio. Most of the actors, with the exception of Collins, Pacino and the actor playing the duke on the court scene, mumble their dialogue. <br /> <br /> The final verdict? Cute film with a few decent performances. This is not Shakespeare, this is a bad interpretation. In fact, not worth your time or money - although Lynn Collins in the role of Portia almost redeems them.
