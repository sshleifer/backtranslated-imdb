Was the cast and crew on drugs before they started shooting it? There was a hole in the plot ... so big ... nothing could fill it. From the first scene, when a colleague is late for dinner, was there any doubt about where he was and what he just did? The wait was from there. Now it took 85 more minutes to solve the mystery. I have to admit that the biggest hole in the plot made me watch for hours, wondering how stupid the writer, director Chris Slater, Molly Parker and Stephen Rea were, not to even explain how our killer who was not a lawyer or a policeman in a locked cell in prison, kill your second victim and tie him out of the loop so that it looks like suicide ??? I kept wondering if I fell asleep from sheer boredom and missed how it happened. If someone can explain it to me, please do ... and then, for God's sake, did he kill the third victim? Nothing made sense ... and yet someone considered this film worthy of an official selection at a film festival. Perhaps it was a comedy, and I could not laugh.
