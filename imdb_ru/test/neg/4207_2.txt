One night I made this film a few years ago, and it was one of the funniest films I've ever seen. However, since it must be an action movie, I cannot give him any more stars, because the humor was unintentional. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris plays a truck driver who comes home from the road to see his family, and for the first five minutes there is a conflict that makes Chuck avenge the rest of the film. Good thing, because the sub-item, acting by all involved, began to age very quickly. In fact, the judge was pretty good, but I can't exactly describe what makes him work, you have to check it yourself. <br /> <br /> And the usual Van Chuck Norris driving is awfully classic!
