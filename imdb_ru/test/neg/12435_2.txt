I have never been a big fan of Larry Clark, but somehow I was pulled to almost every film. Now I like independent films, and I grew up very much in punk rock, and I would like to say that this film disappoints both audiences. Not every punk song includes "Oi!" in his choruses, as in this particular film. <br /> <br /> But the real problem with this film is that it changes mood every fifteen minutes or so, and it lacks cohesion. Clark earned his living by pretending that his made-up stories are “what children really are,” and therefore you will give him ten minutes of scenes of foolish dialogue that lead nowhere because this is the cinematic feeling he is waiting for. However, when he removes the ridiculous death scene (choose any of them, except for the first pass), overly stylized attempts at what, I believe, should be black humor, completely taken out of context, cases are ridiculously shot, student film) and absolutely ridiculous in terms of history. John Cassawett and “Date in the Cinema” make poor fellows, because the raids on the latter style take you out of any reality to remind you that you are watching a movie - really, very bad.
