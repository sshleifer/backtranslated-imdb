Right then. This film is completely unfunny, childish, has jokes from other films, there are songs from other films (“Mutt” Blink 182, “We Luv U” from Grand Theft Audio), an incredible presenter, a ridiculous plot and unconvincing parodies of films like Mission Impossible 2 and american beauty. Redeem features? Shannon Elizabeth and Jaime Pressley. Enough said.
