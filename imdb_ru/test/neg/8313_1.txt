What a gigantic stinking heap of order! Gods, why start with this ??? <br /> <br /> Well, mixed nonsense (including one damn furious woman who says she’s either a) painfully chews ice cubes, or b) just woke up after undergoing some kind of extensive surgery on root canal), which seemed to make it clear that celluloid was cut and spliced ​​with an angle grinder, some really hopelessly choreographic martial art “action”, a script that was supposedly written by a two-year-old child and the most disgusting and intrusive loud background music that ever existed in any movie, and, hey, yes, you have Death Machines aka The Ninja Murders (although note that surprise, surprise - in fact, nowhere in fact there are no ninjas) can be found in this lousy parody!) <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, if the cinematic equivalent of a particularly violent attack of dysentery ever existed, then surely it does! Avoid at all costs!
