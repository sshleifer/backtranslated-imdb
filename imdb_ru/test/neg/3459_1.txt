I also made the mistake of thinking that I was going to see the 2003 upstream swimming with Jeffrey Rush. It was worse than many student films that I saw. The script was forced, the acting was low, and editing was annoying. It was so slow that I just managed to force myself to stay. But I always give the film a chance, so I endured to the very end. Apparently, there was a note about this film, because my friend and I were the only ones in the theater. Why no one sent me this note?!?! That is why I write as a warning to others who are thinking about putting out good money to see it. I just hope that you actually got to this page, and did not fall into the trap, like me, looking at the wrong "swimming upstream." Postscript Sorry for the cast and crew if you are reading this. I know you worked hard to do that. I know what goes into making a movie ... keep trying!
