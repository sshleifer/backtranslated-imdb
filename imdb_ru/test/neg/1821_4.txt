In this detective film, Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson show good results with accents in the southern / new Orleans. It is worth looking at their scenes - and the Rickman scene with Hal Holbrook. It seems these three actors have to entertain us, no matter what movie. The plot of the film demonstrates the potential, but when watching the film it seems that the film was not shot as well as it could. The fact that it is cluttered with a rather uninteresting plot and mostly uninteresting kidnappers really confuses things. The film is worth seeing - at least for the entertaining performances of Rickman, Thompson and Holbrook.
