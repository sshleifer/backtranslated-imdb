Rita Hayworth is simply amazing at times and for me the only reason to watch this stupid movie. Despite the excessive lipstick of the 1940s, Rita was one of the most charming women in Hollywood. In fact, for a couple of years, I can’t imagine anyone who looked better, except maybe Elizabeth Taylor in her prime. <br /> <br /> In any case, Gene Kelly's colleague does not play his normal pleasant, at least that guy with whom we all know him in "Singin 'In The Rain". Here, Kelly "Danny McGuire" blows most of the time. Phil Silvers, whom I loved on TV in “Sergeant Bilko,” is as stupid as “Genius,” you just snuggle up listening to his silly jokes ... and they are stupid. <br /> <br /> Visual effects are great with great Technicolor, which looks almost amazing. Here too many beautiful women can be seen, not only Hayworth. Unfortunately, the story is not so much. It centers around Hayworth deciding on career choice. Along the way, we get the usual battered treatment of marriage and get an offensively blunt end. In general, an unforgettable film, with the exception of the demonstration of the beauty of Hayworth.
