I was looking forward to it, and, frankly, there were several bright spots, but it would be better if he concentrated on one story, rather than on filming around the world. Many dogs had a lot of fun, but I was bored by the winemaking fascists who pompously whine (;-)) about their achievements. <br /> <br /> I felt that it would have worked better, like an hour-long television documentary, concentrating on one of the many different questions that he explored. The most interesting is the French city near Montpelier, fighting with the campaign of the American winemaking company to get rid of historic forests. The mayor-socialist agreed to the deal, a beautifully chosen time arrived, and the mayor was a communist who refused, to the great irritation of American wine managers ... <br /> <br /> I hope that the director will be shorter than the original. .
