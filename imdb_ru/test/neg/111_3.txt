This cheap Italian film with a grainy photograph tells of several heirs to a manor in an Italian village who go to the house to stay and then find themselves killed by the ghosts of the people killed in this house. <br /> <br /> I was not impressed. In fact, it was not so scary, basically the way a cheap Italian film should be. The girl, her two cousins ​​and the friend of one cousin for some reason are sent to this huge house (I can't understand why) and stay there, clean and look around the place. Characters come and go from the film, and in some moments it's pretty boring, and most deaths are pretty quick. The girl ran out of the car when she ran out of the house after sleeping on her death, and the scene is pretty good, but then things slow down again, until an unclear end, when male cousins ​​are killed together in some strange way, and this strange guy (I I could understand who he was during the film, or maybe I just don’t remember) goes after this one girl, attacking her, until finally this other girl kills him. I hate to give the ending, but oh well. The female cousin decides to stay in the house and look after him, and they show scenes of her life there many years later. The end. You really do not miss anything, and in any case, you probably will not find it anywhere, so good luck to you.
