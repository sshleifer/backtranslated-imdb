Writer and director Robert Downey Sr., a pioneer of the underground cinematographic movement in the 1960s, ridiculed the New York world of advertising on Madison Avenue with his avant-garde comedy “Putney Swap.” Downey does not limit his mockery to advertising, but he is engaged in the black culture of militants, the dynamics in the image of the race in Hollywood, the elite structure of white power and the nature of corruption in any power struggle. No matter how audacious and ambitious Putney Swope is, it can be called a terrible film, amateurishly shot on a budget string with a nameless cast and humor that lacks fun. Everything in this film smells like improvisation. Putney Swope caused controversy during its initial release of its politically incorrect handling of race and consumer culture issues. As in most of the Marx Brothers films, the plot is very subtle, which gives an excuse for the anecdotal joke of Downey, most of which are terrible. <br /> <br /> Chairman of the prestigious advertising agency Madison Avenue dies during a meeting of the board of directors. Before the body is removed, the council conducts a secret ballot to determine who will replace it. Each participant understands that he is forbidden to vote for himself. Pure coincidence occurs when everyone votes for the iconic black participant, Putney Swap (Arnold Johnson), because no one thought that someone would vote for him. Swope Pink slips out all but one of the white executives, surrounds herself with black, packs pistols to employees and renames the company "Advertising the truth and the soul." Swope decides to change the face of American advertising. He refuses to accept customers whose products are alcohol, tobacco or military toys. Swap clients are satisfied with the outcome after he becomes CEO, and the suggestion attracts a new line of clients who appear in his office, dragging bags of money and prepare to suffer from ill-treatment by the militant Swap employees. Swope also exploits its African-American employees, mercilessly appropriating their ideas after he dismisses them, and causes a number of offensive advertising campaigns, each of which is proclaimed a “new wave” of marketing genius. Incredibly, Swope’s conservatism is successful, but the agency becomes the target of government operatives who claim that Swope’s advertising tactics are a “threat to national security”. The culmination of this black and white 85-minute comedy are television commercials shot in color. Unfortunately, Downey does not know when to turn off these ads, which are consistently beginning to slyly, but their greeting will wear out. The most ridiculous part of Putney Swope includes the relationship of our eponymous protagonist with US President Mimeo in Washington DC (Pepi Hermine), freshly played marijuana, with a Tisson-like advisor to Kissinger (Larry Wolfe) who spews tasteless jokes trying to convince the Swap to come up with an advertising campaign for his new car Bormann 6.
