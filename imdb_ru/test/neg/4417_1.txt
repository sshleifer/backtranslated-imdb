For me, this is a case that you will never understand if you had not lived it ... so read this to find out why I have such unlimited anger. <br /> <br /> I heard a lot about (Bruce Lee) .. my father loved him .. my mother, who hates any minor shot of violence, loved him! and how she still talks about his "Big Boss", known as "Fists of Rage", and about the experience of watching this film in Egyptian films in 1973 with all the huge success. In addition, I watched a very good movie about him (Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story - 1993) .. so I cried: where are your films, Bruce? !! <br /> <br /> I went to the video store .. and it was a stupid move .. (you will understand why!) .. and wow ... I found a lot of movies about Bruce Lee ... I chose one named (Bruce Lee in New Guinea) <br /> <br /> I did it for myself and watched it .. Oh God, please forgive your servant .. I hurt myself, but without deliberate decision .. I would not do it if I knew that this evil is harmful !! his mythical level of disgrace !! <br /> <br /> After that, I didn’t understand at all what the fuss of Bruce Lee was like a great immortal star ??? .. why does anyone care, here or there ... this hero (whom I watched!) Isn't that so talented and not so brilliant and, of course, not so sexy ??? <br /> <br /> Until my father saw this star and asked me to pause at any of his close-ups, and after he looked at his face a little ... he told me very definitely: "This is not Bruce Lee "so I'm too confused to ask: who is this stupid guy? <br /> <br /> It was 2001 ... 2 years after my first entry into the IMDb database .. so I immediately wanted to know who the hell this person was ... and I learned the truth. .. he is not Bruce Lee .. No, my dear friends .. he is Bruce Lee !!! <br /> <br /> And what a huge .. such a huge difference !! I just want to know who can love this bad clone ?? Or God forbid .. I love his disgusting films .. I watched 2 of them and could not bear the end of the third! <br /> <br /> After that, I ignored all of our video stores, because this is a cheap trick (on the posters it’s written that THAT is Bruce Lee! ??) .. and I have the original .. The only Bruce Lee that is really a great star, and Oh, BOY, he certainly had the right to immortality ... and no less.
