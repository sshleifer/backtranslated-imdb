I have to agree with the previous reviewer. Although Kristin Erickson played the obsessive girl well, I seriously do not think that Isabel, the character she played, was obsessed. I saw people having psychotic disorders due to sexual abuse, and they never made it clear whether her father really abused her or not. I also had to look at some parts of it again to understand what was written in the letter, what the names of the characters were called, and I still do not understand what happened, whether it was real or not. I am trying to find the “original” story on which it was based, in order to compare the facts, but I cannot find anything about it on the Internet. <br /> <br /> This was not a bad movie, but some dialogues were incredibly cheesy. Wise special effects, the film was not bad for class B, in large part, and those obsessive scenes made it all worth it ... that is, if you have nothing better. lol
