A rather awful venture suggests that a Welsh artist is an infant, helplessly drawn to the cruel environment that he knows best, but is unable to resist the senseless developments rooted in banal fantasies. The first story is a pointless crazy fist with the sci-fi premise of a B-film. The second reaches a certain acuteness, but only through an indignant excess of humiliation, which is attended by its central character. The third and most risky seems to be seeking to be a misaligned continuation of the Children's Game. The direction is invariably ignorant - all the spinning sound and fury, a slave to extremely unpleasant environmental conditions; panting in a poorly chosen musical score and in an indifferently luxurious game. This is pure nonsense, disguised as partisan sensitivity - as arbitrary and empty as the abstract images linking the three sections.
