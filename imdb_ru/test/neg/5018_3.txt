Nice concept. I wish they took it in a different direction. This is a film that is trying to be interesting, shocking you with bestiality, from the very beginning, which works for most people (goody with a weak stomach). But other than that, thereâ€™s not much in this film. This is not funny and not romantic, so please, someone will change this label, and since I already knew that atrocity is actually the legal majority of places and industry for a million dollars, I was not shocked. But most people are not aware of this, and I thought that how the film developed after the mystery was revealed was simply disappointing, because it could be one of those shocking eye-opening films that would teach the ignorant of fetish, very real for (yes, I did my homework) to hundreds of thousands of people. So, if you like to watch bad movies, you can dream about how you could make them better by watching them than you are sure to have fun doing.
