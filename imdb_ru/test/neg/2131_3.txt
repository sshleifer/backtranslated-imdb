I wish I could say something more positive about Devil Fish, but I honestly can't think of much. I can't even think of many such “bad, good” moments. Devil Fish is just an old bad one. The plot is completely derivative (jaws, anyone?), The game is wooden, the characters are uninteresting, the special effects are bad, and the score is annoying. Add to this the seemingly inept direction of Lamberto Bava, and you will have one nasty movie. I think, however, that the biggest sin of the film is the lack of a budget. It seems that with Bavoy was a lot of work. By 1984, was the Italian film industry in decline? especially as regards genre films. The funding available to Bave was probably very meager. The film is similar to Devil's Fish, which relies on special effects, just never had a chance to be good. This is not the only Italian film that has experienced this fate. There are a number of Italian films made in the mid-80s, whose ideas and concepts far exceeded expectations that anyone could really expect, given their budgetary constraints. <br /> <br /> However, having said all this and noting many of the shortcomings of the film, I cannot bring myself to rate Devil Fish lower than 3/10. I even rated it higher, but I can't, because I understand how bad this film is. Why I do not rate it lower? Well, it's hard to explain. Despite the many problems found in the film, there is something in “Fish of the Devil” that I inexplicably like. It can be as simple as my love for low-budget, cheesy, Italian films. Maybe my taste in films is horribly distorted, but I like what I like. <br /> <br /> Devilfish processing in Mystery Science Theater 3000 is actually very enjoyable. I rate Devil Fish 4/5 on my MST3K rating scale. The guys are great at making fun of the many shortcomings of the film. One very insightful observation appears at the very beginning of the comment, when Tom Servo notes: “The fact that you can edit does not mean that you should do this” ?? highlighting another one of the many weaknesses that can be found in Devil Fish.
