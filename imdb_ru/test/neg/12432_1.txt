It begins as a very serious social commentary that quickly makes one think about other films about Clark, such as “Children”, “Hooligan”, etc. Who is the main character? Is this a serious movie or some kind of Gregg Araki-Esquire over a stupid movie? Is this a skate documentary with inserted dialogue moments? I have no idea. I found myself looking at my watch and am surprised when this turd is over. I continued to think that there would be some big shocking climax that would never come. I cut a good 20 minutes from the movie, rewinding the meaningless skate scenes. Yes, this illustrates a change in landscape between those who do not. I understood it from the very beginning. The children and Bully were made in such a way that I really felt that I was watching the realities of this group of friends. Vassup felt very staged, poorly constructed and worse acting. The teenage caveman, whom Larry did not write, but did the director, was terrible. But at least it seemed like a horrible film that didn’t take itself seriously. Wassup Rockers was just bad.
