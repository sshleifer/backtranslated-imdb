When I first saw this movie, I said to myself: “Hey, why the hell does it sound like a good movie, why not rent it?”. So yes, I rented it and returned home to see it. When I inserted it into my DVD player, I was shocked. <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, nobody told me that this is a Mexican film, and it is spoken in Spanish, it’s good that it has subtitles. <br /> <br /> SECOND, it was nude, nude nude! Since I have no experience in Mexican films, you could see my shock when I saw it. * GASP! Covering virgin eyes, NOO * <br /> <br /> THIRD, predictable, to say the least, but in fact its predictability did not justify me in pretty films, because it seems to me that it doesn't matter if it is predictable, just the way up. <br /> <br /> Fourth, as Heidi and Kike reunited, so stupid. <br /> <br /> Fifth, how the movie ended. It was a bad, bad end. How suddenly Van der Linde approved the election of the mayor, because her daughter knew how to arrange a party ... BLA, Bla. I hoped that it was not so easy for him to accept, perhaps the director just hurried. <br /> <br /> After all the beatings of bad things, good things are here to come. At some point, the film was quite funny: Maribel was clumsy in the kitchen and all that, Heidi’s attitude to Valentina was poetic with words. What I really like about it is the song that Valentina wrote with her friend. That's all, and for other things that I did not mention, they were just so-so.
