A woman as rich as she is, insecurity, has a history of alcoholism and nervous disorders, which undoubtedly is helped by a carefree gigolo husband who openly cheats on her. Naturally, no one believes her when she claims that a giant man who came out of a giant satellite turned to her. Much to the delight of her husband, this may be the case that, after all, removed her forever. <br /> <br /> From the very first scenes, with a ridiculous broadcast of news and a ridiculous collision with a satellite, you will probably see that the only value of this film is that it is so bad that it is funny. Although not too far from the goal, this is definitely not true. <br /> <br /> Unlike most films of this genre, in fact, this is not a science fiction film or a horror film, but a serious drama that intelligently includes a science fiction script in the script. This is not a good or even mediocre drama, but it will exceed your expectations if you did not expect any legitimate drama at all. The game is surprisingly good for such a low-budget effort, and, most importantly, it is well edited and has an excellent pace. It's never boring, and he manages to arouse more than a little interest to see what happens next. Nevertheless, this film is still intended for those who cannot miss the chance to see a 1950s film with the title “Attack of the Woman 50 Feet”!
