If you are a fan of either of the two franchises of origin (Aliens & Predator ... duh ... and even if you liked or disliked the AVP movie in 06), you HATE this movie. Countless holes in the plot, trashy and incredible human characters, terrible special effects and even worse directorial and fighting scenes make this film one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> *** SPOLIER *** One of the hundreds of huge holes in the plot included a Pred / Alien hybrid coming from a chest with chest to an adult villain in seconds (he takes off on an onboard ship that kills predator, and destroys the Preds ship even before the ship breaks Earth's orbit.) AS IF. In the first AvP, we saw how the ship of senior hunters landed three hunters on minors, going on a hunt "earning in strips", and then finally saw them pick up the "deserved body" of a minor, remaining at the end of the film. Do we expect to believe that hybrids with one ribcage killed all these older hunters before the ship went into orbit? In addition, (and this was Extremely Cheap Production Cost on the Director / Producer’s Part) the face banks and vessels somehow magically appeared on the Pred ship, although the entire temple complex and the Queen Alien were destroyed in the film AvP. These face hugs end up playing an irregular film role ... of course. And how about all these people becoming adults in a few days? Well and a joke. Although there were still many holes in the plot, I do not think that IMDb would be grateful that I filled in their servers by writing them here. <br /> <br /> As for unreliable and incredible characters, well, where should I go, boys and girls? Where to start ... almost all these crazy jokes are cliches of people from other movies or TV shows. Urban bad guy who left to avoid imprisonment, but only shows up on the day when everything happens to save the day ??? Where have I seen it? Oh yeah, last season on Jericho! Then there is the 20-year-old city sheriff (himself a former problem maker) who was once best friends with a bad guy. Where did we see it? Oh yeah, Jericho and Walking High! Then there is a patrimonial soldier (without rank), returning home from some kind of ancestral front of the war, who is not met as a long-lost loved one and hero at the airport or at the bus stop, but her OWN front door has her daughter and husband soldier? What did she do in the army / aviation / marines / in the navy / in the coast guard? We do not know, because the film never tells us. But ... Dun, Dun, Dun ... she was a kind of soldier / pilot / marine / sailor / coastline who knows how to drive Stryker infantry and ... in a magical way ... HELICOPTER !!! This character is just a common copy of every employee “coming home” ... except that she brings home a set of night vision goggles for her daughter, which cost a FEW dollars. This is what soldiers should sign up for and not just “bring home”. Ugh! <br /> <br /> Special effects and fighting scenes - that's what offended me. These are the things that I liked the most in the first movie ... watching the movie "Pre and Aliens"! However, as it was filmed, the action sequences were so dark and filmed so closely that you could not understand what was happening. You could not see who did what and what happened when they struggled with it. In general, these hundreds of items will kill this franchise and fanchise. No one else will care to see their favorite monsters in science fiction films, and can only guess that the series will come out of here, because the producers will not like to dig millions more dollars for the sequel.
