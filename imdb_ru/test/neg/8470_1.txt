Forget what I said about Emeril. Rachel Ray is the most annoying person on the Food Network And on all television. If you have never seen 30 minutes of food, then you can not understand how incredibly annoying it is. I really did mean that you can't even be amazed by her until you look at the show once or twice, and even then all the words and reasonable thoughts will let you down. The problem is mainly in her manners, you guessed it. Ray has a dull mouth and often imitates a parrot. If you like something or think it's “cool” (the word she uses about 87 times for a TV show), just say it. And she constantly uses horrible, unfunny phrases like “EVOO” (olive oil!). SHUT UP! Worse, Ray has two other shows on the net! I think this is some kind of complicated terrorist plot that drives us crazy. Give me more Tyler Florence! Ray is limping.
