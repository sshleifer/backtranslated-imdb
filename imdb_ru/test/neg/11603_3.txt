Perhaps the most daring feature in Alfred Hitchcock's career is the straightforward comedy car of the director, connecting Carol Lombard with Robert Montgomery, since the couple who discovered the mistake made their marriage invalid. Where do they actually stand with each other? <br /> <br /> Contrary to what others are saying, there is an element of uncertainty here: the idea that these two unfortunate people can run away from each other, freely causing someone their own terrible other, unworthy friend. <br /> <br /> It's funny to read the comments here about how the unfortunate Lombard Ann Smith plays in this film, because the role of Montgomery is the same heel. He addresses Ann, glances at the witnesses, speaks briefly about clients - just one of those lawyers who badly call their profession. Of course, Ann is also powerful; such a wife, who holds her husband hostage at work for six days because of a petty quarrel, picking up such things as what he did in Paris when he was 20 years old, and not even met her. "I forgave you this!" she speaks as if it was a big one of hers. <br /> <br /> For David, a broken marriage is an opportunity to get some illegal pleasure from his “mistress” before tying a knot forever. For Ann, this is an attempt at premarital sex, which should be reflected in the head with a bottle of champagne, and then expelled from their apartment and her life. <br /> <br /> Acorn does not seem to fall far away from the tree, like Ann’s mother is shocked by the apoplexy when she finds out that David was trying to pull out: “Oh, my poor child! Thank God, your father is dead! ”<br /> <br /> This is a rare good trait in this laugh, an incredible comedy. <br /> <br /> You can call this an example of the “re-marriage comedy” in which the bonds of marriage are disputed in order to be confirmed. You can also call this an example of what Roger Ebert calls the “idiot plot”, in which the storyline depends on the main characters acting as idiots. Hitchcock seems to laugh at obstinate American morality, but in fact can’t do much more with it than a jokeless scene when an elderly couple are shocked by the sound of loud plumbing. <br /> <br /> Lombard died in the year the film was released; This was her last film, which she lived see. What a shame it could not have been any better! She was domineering in My Godfrey, but in such a pleasant way you didn’t just have to go with her you wanted. Here she plays for a laugh, which is not there when sadistically breaking David's chops over and over. Montgomery rolls his eyes, like Groucho, a study of complacency. <br /> <br /> The only really decent thing in this film that lasts more than a few seconds is Gene Raymond, like David's lawyer Jeff Custer, who makes play for Ann and acts with honor and decency. Raymond emphasizes his many reactions and even a drunken scene, and all this gives a good effect. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER *** Such a decent guy, Jeff, that Ann refuses him for not having fought David after she pushes him into confrontation, calling Caster a "piece of jellies." Jeff leaves the stage, leaving Ann and David together for their future suicide. Here is one Caster, who managed to avoid massacres! *** END SPOILER ***
