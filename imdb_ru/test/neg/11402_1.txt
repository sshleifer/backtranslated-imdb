One of the movies that I just don't want to watch. I got it in the preview, but damn it, the game was very bad! At the end of the film (I'm still surprised that I watched the whole movie ..) I wondered why I was watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Also here in the Netherlands, the author of this film (he was removed from the Book of Gifarte) thought it was very bad, and was disappointed that his film was released like this. The next time he wants to play a role in the choice of actors.
