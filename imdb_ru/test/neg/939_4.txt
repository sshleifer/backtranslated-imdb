Fast, fun matinee prank in adulthood, appealing to minors in each of us. In fact, he works as a medium for Justin Long, who later appeared on our screens in the fourth film “Die Hard” with the help of PC vs Mac, Dodgeball and The Break Up. He is funny, serious and young - in front of a big career. <br /> <br /> Urban amateur students find a fake website that Bartelby (Long) created to fool their disapproving parents and go down to college as it was a short party on Facebook. Lewis Black summarizes the anarchic philosophy as a replacement for Dean - Long’s lawbreaking friends support the ruse and, as a result, turn to the great traditions of education and friendship (Adam Hershman deserves special mention for his never-seen farsing contribution). Well executed, pleasant and easily forgotten. 4/10
