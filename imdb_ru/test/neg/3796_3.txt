... a good script or director could not fix it. <br /> <br /> The original Poseidon Adventure was a story of human courage that triumphed over terrible chances and personal tragedy. The survivors were led by a charismatic figure who possesses tremendous spiritual power, who could accept everything that God had thrown at him. <br /> <br /> The following action attempts to recreate the mix, but without success using a template script and pedestrian direction. Irwin Allen may have been a great producer of disaster films and did a great deal with action movie directing at Towering Inferno, but he just can't bring human depth to his characters. If the characters are not credible, any danger they face also falls. <br /> <br /> The script also clearly tries to copy the original. So we have Peter Boyle, who makes Ernest Borgnine tough and unpleasant (but he has a tender heart); Karl Malden - moderate influence of the Red Buttons (and incurably ill for good measure); Slim Pickens makes a comic relief for Shelley Winters and so on. <br /> <br /> To make history more modern, we have a crook who is ready to deliver weapons-grade plutonium to the highest price. Really unpleasant work that ruthlessly throws wounded men (the actors playing his minions were supposedly paid extras, because they seem to have no lines), and the woman is shot in the back - what the hell! Thank God, the French rescue services made a hole in Poseidonâ€™s body twice as many as in 1972 (and on the other side of the drive shaft) so that he could get his goods. And while we reflect on how they delivered the boxes * to * ... oh, forget about it. <br /> <br /> I actually paid good money to see it when it was released. Given the current reputation of the film, it may seem strange, but at the time it received rather mixed reviews. Some said it was rubbish, others said it was just as exciting as the original. No matter, no one can be right all the time.
