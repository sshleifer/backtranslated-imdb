I was at Wrestlemania VI in Toronto when I was 10 years old, and the event that I saw then was quite different from what I saw on the Wrestlemania Collection DVD, which I had just watched. I don’t understand why wwE doesn’t have rights to some of the older pieces of music, since most of these songs were created by WWF, they don’t need to worry about license and license fees that interfere with shows like SNL, the release of the season kits. It's pretty silly to whine, but for me, when I heard that Demolition was released on their thematic music on Wrestlemania personally, it was a memory that I never forgot, and it was not on this DVD. What is the point of even having the rights to this huge video library, if they have to edit it so radically to use it?
