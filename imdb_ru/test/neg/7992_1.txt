This film is recommended only for insomnia patients: it will save them from being put to sleep. Five-year-olds will love it too. But for someone else (including fans of the genre), what a bore! The “ancient” plot resembles “The Return of the Dragon”, and this film is just as inept, but Nero is not Bruce Lee, so “Enter the ninja” is even worse. So far, this is the second (insulting comedy "Bachelor Party" was the first) film, which I gave 1/10.
