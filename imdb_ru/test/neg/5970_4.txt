My mother and I went to watch this film, because my brother serves in the US Peace Corps in the same region where it is installed. Halfway through the film, I decided that, given his inability to match what he claims to achieve, the title is pretentious. The subject he deals with could be a great documentary, but because of his poor performance, he left me much less aware of this problem than I had hoped to become. I agree with Laura-Jane from Canada (“Powerful message, but out of focus”). I also agree with the user who commented that the director’s style without narration is the opposite of Michael Moore’s style, but I do not agree with the fact that he represents different points of view and invites the viewer to make a decision for himself. I agree with the comment of one user that “the lesson is better learned when we ourselves draw conclusions”; nevertheless, our conclusions can be nothing but poorly substantiated if we are given little relevant information from which to extract them. <br /> <br /> The main points of the documentary film appear to be as follows: 1) Africans who live near Lake Victoria are very poor and suffer greatly. 2) The introduction of perch to Lake Victoria by Europeans has destroyed its ecosystem. 3) The communities surrounding Lake Victoria are financially dependent on the perch economy. <br /> <br /> The best thing I can say about the film is that it tried to reflect the views of average people in sub-Saharan Africa, which, unfortunately, is an anomaly among the films, and that it tried to portray poverty as a result of a dysfunctional economic system, rather than a universal, inevitable phenomenon. I liked the irony, which she captured in a huge amount of fish leaving the country in the face of hunger. I highly appreciated the image of how the team from the USA, assigned to the region, had no relation to people. Like almost all documentaries, in the title of which there is no word “women”, this film does not cope with the work, reflecting the voices of women - most of the conversations made in the interview are men. <br /> <br /> Maybe I need to watch the film a second time to catch some key points I could miss, but I couldn’t find the theory of Sauper about the connection between introducing perch to Lake Victoria and unfair living conditions for Africans living near the lake. In addition, I could be wrong, but it struck me that Sauper could succeed in improving his interview skills. Not only did the questions he asked and the answers he included seemed arbitrary, but he seemed to have a real opportunity to make the interlocutors awkward and uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The most convincing event in the film is the proposal that perch export currently functions to disguise the import of weapons, and that the real economy extending to Tanzanians is war, not fishing. Unfortunately, Sauper avoids thoroughly exposing the idea (or at least extending an interview with a reporter who seemed to know what he is talking about in relation to the import of weapons) and copes with the “decide for yourself” approach. <br /> <br /> If Darwin's Nightmare was to dispel the myth that third world exploitation in the third world gives them a “chance for a better life,” it did not help. If it was intended to show how the weapons industry in the United States and Europe was responsible for a big armed conflict around the world, it did not help. If it was intended to portray what drives people to prostitution, it did not help. If this was to shed light on the inability of the United States to fulfill its mission, it did not help. If it was assumed that the meager income of Tanzanians derived from the perch was not worth the human cost of messing with mother nature to create a profitable product, it did not work. If this meant that Tanzania would be much better if Europeans never came, it would not help.
