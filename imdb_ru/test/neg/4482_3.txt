Today, on President's Day, my wife and I recorded a DVD with the Notebook in our local library. This is a film released in 2004, which turned out to be outside our radar, since we are big fans of cinema. I am a published author with the hope that my first book will appear on the screen. I noticed references to Notepad in reviews of other films, so I talked about how we look, and this morning provided an excellent opportunity. We both really liked it. It made my wife cry; we could connect many things with our own, continuing love love, and even I resisted, gasping. <br /> <br /> This afternoon, after many troubles, work in the yard and food, we decided to actually catch the matinee. When we got to the theater, after seeing most of the current batch of films, we decided to watch “Victoria Day”, which for some reason was not in the theater, although IMDb and my telephone films showed that he plays there. So instead, we looked at the “Dear John” poster and wrote it by the same author as the Notebook, which made it an obvious choice because we liked so much “TN”. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment! First, the characters did not have the same believability or empathy as "TN"; and we kept commenting on all the similarities — two dozen or so — quickly making us realize that this film was nothing more than, as another reviewer noted, the Poor's Note Book! He had a real “cash cow” feeling, meaning that Sparks simply combined a story based on the exact “TN” pattern, just to make money quickly. Not only that after the monstrous "dull eye" incredibly "Dear John-John" for a cancer patient wimps, we made fun of the film with each, skipping a soapy stupid line to the very end. At that time, at 4:45 pm on Monday, there were only about 6 people in the theater, and my wife even told me to suppress him, so that I would not spoil him to others ... it was so bad. <br /> The vision of this on the heels of 'TN' ensured that tearing off the resemblance was clearly recognizable, and Sparks sparks an obvious cheap attempt to write templates. We just wish we could see Victoria Day instead ... no matter how bad it could be after watching this bad movie entrance. And oh ... for the last 30 minutes I kept repeating: "... don't give this cow a coin ... don't give this cow a coin?"
