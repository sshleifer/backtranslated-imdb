"The Camals Are Coming" is a rather disappointing 1934 British comedy. I bought it because I like adventures in the desert and on the box it is depicted that this is a drama. Of course, it is not. <br /> <br /> This is a couple heading to Egypt to catch some drug smugglers in the desert. <br /> <br /> It would have been much better if it had been done in a drama instead of a comedy that brings it down. This is pretty silly piecemeal. Despite this, there are several good action scenes and locations. <br /> <br /> Starring Jack Hulbert with Anna Lee in the role of love interest. <br /> <br /> For this movie, one viewing is enough. Overall, disappointing. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 stars out of 5.
