In this film, there is a free story about a man (Bardem), who wants to receive funding for her construction business and marries a woman he does not like (with wide eyes Maria de Medier). He maintains his passionate relationship with his first and true love and ultimately becomes entangled in his own romantic web. He will never give up his juggling until the three main characters come face to face. The results of the film are boring, with a lot of free sex (well, both girls are really good), all the reactions in the film are absurd, incoherent and, of course, too stupid. None of the characters is believable, which makes the film a bit annoying. In any case, acting is surprisingly good for such a bad directorial film, which makes it a bit interesting, but if you can, watch another movie, please!
