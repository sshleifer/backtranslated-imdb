It was one of the most mixed films I've ever seen. Everything in the film seemed attached to justify some other element that was glued. There is even a talking bison who wants his wet nose to rub, so that the magic happens. Even the cruel father seems to be stuck to give the children a reason to fly away in a cart. It was funny, but inconvenient because of serious subjects that seemed to be used only for plot preparation.
