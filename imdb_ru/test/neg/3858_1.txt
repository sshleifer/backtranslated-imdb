There is a famous short story about a man who becomes a prey for a safari hunter who has lost interest in hunting for anything but humans. This is pretty good, and it has been done and redone in movies and on television many times. Some are noteworthy, but this urbanized version, which introduces weary old themes of racism, just stinks. The farce of the Leguizamo is almost as weak as the unfunny script. Chaplin, this guy is not. There must be people who find a dwarf who can't stop dancing funny, I mean, I suppose it's funny in a pathetic, bizarre manner, but it's just not enough to carry the film. You have an ordinary Nazi relic or a neo-Nazi, whatever the hell we thought, such as a villain, whose son is of course gay, German accents ... understand?
