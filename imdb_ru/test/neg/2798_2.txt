Dark Harvest is a group of friends who go to the farm (it belongs to one of friends or relatives) for a holiday. But frightening killers are hiding there (there was also something with a curse there, but I forgot what it was about). <br /> <br /> The scene in this movie is terrible, I don't know what the director thought when he was casting actors and actresses. The script is the same story as the acting “horror” (this statement is very obvious, but ...), if it were the best game and the best script, it could be “good. <br /> <br /> The director is smelly too, I don’t see any potential in the future of this guy. After all these negatives, this film still supports the “funny” factor, which increases it to two. Last plus - they do not use CGI! My general thoughts about this film are bad, very bad, but so bad that it is “fun,” so it gets 2/10
