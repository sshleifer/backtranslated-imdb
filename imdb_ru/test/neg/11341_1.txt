Racing enthusiast Fabian (as Tommy Callahan) smokes, drinks and suffers darkening while juggling with feelings for charming brunette Annette Funicello (as Francie Madsen) and blonde Diane McBain (as Annie Blaine) Ms. Funichello Warren Berlinger (like Eddie Sands) and her father Ian Murray (like Pete Madsen), who encourages reckless drivers. The performance of Funichello with cow eyes is sometimes pleasant; However, her drunk driving scene is frustrating. Thunder Walk provides a little more excitement for NASCAR than its predecessor, Fireball 500 (1966) *; Be careful, it is not so much. Low zest movie - a wild party with a little striptease.
