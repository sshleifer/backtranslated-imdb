I would be one of the few people who own a copy of this classic. But I have not only 1, but actually 2. This is good. <br /> <br /> Well, when I say good, I mean bad. But I will try to do a thorough review. I even watched “Born Ninja,” who was mentioned by one of the other reviewers to compare this with this. And being born a ninja is actually worse, but not so funny. <br /> <br /> And it's always funny. ALL about this movie is bad. EVERYTHING. The plot is absolutely crammed (note that "you will need to support me alive if you want to know where to find your wife"). EVERY sequence of actions is also full. Our hero Danton is more than a hero; he can hit people with branches, take 3 bullets in the heart at a distance of 50 cm without bleeding and tie a rope to a tree, which, when an enemy strikes him, ties a knot around the enemy's foot, picks it up, and throws it 50 meters into a pile of thorns. <br /> <br /> The game is so bad that it is impossible to comment, but it should make you roll, especially jumping dantons from the ground and growling at the bad guy. ” Oh, and the bad guys: for some reason, it seems that they revive themselves 5 times each in the film. Perhaps just the actors were not enough, but in a film of this magnitude? I doubt it. <br /> <br /> “The plot” about how Danton was a soldier in the Vietnam War, and now his colonel hunts for real people to train his mercenaries. Just Colonel takes Danton, then Danton resists. This is just a reason for clone Rumbaugh, most of the film - the killing of soldiers by Danton. And I really can't explain the plot anymore, because there’s nothing else in the film. It is still swinging. <br /> <br /> What else could be wrong, you ask? Do not start me. Hand grenades, which actually break down at the feet of the actors, because the explosion is the size of a match. The scenes where 5 people chase Danton, then the camera cuts back and forth, and there are 7. How each time Danton loads a grenade launcher against his background, although he is in completely different places. And worst of all, when Danton pushes plastic boulders on enemies, and one of the enemies is completely untouched by boulders, so he doesn’t know what to do, so he dies half without even touching. This is ridiculous !!! <br /> <br /> But funny. Very, VERY funny. This is one of the few films that I can recommend to everyone, because if it's not funny to you, you are 1 in a million. And for the rest of us, this is magic.
