The protagonist is a tearful, irresponsible study of how to arrange a miserable party. She loses it in the blink of an eye, behaves pitifully, is schizophrenic and makes me wonder why on earth she does not understand why her “friends” have not called her for three years. (Get a hint, sister - you are a youthful mess!) I could not stand her, nor my friends. I never felt connected to any of the characters. To make the entire film even more unbearable, someone tried his best to film the most disgusting collection of knitted and crocheted hats in the world that has been around for all eternity (this alone should ensure that someone will be put on trial period ten years)!) The game was not terrible, but not too believable, and in the end, the only thing that bothered me was two hours, which I never intend to return. Do not waste your time - go to the dentist's appointment instead!
