Always enjoy Classic Horror films, however, this film was a real waste of time, and if it were not for John Carradine, playing a crazy doctor who is able to control people through his experiments. This film was made during World War II, and John Carradine was a German Nazi working to find human weapons against the whole world. Bob Steele plays many roles in the role of a cowboy or gangster, and in this picture Bob seems to be sick of his role in this film before he dies, and he behaves as if this is his first film. Mantan Morland (Jeff) gave an outstanding performance with great comedy that helped attract the attention of the audience. I hate to criticize the film, shot in 1943, but this is really a big disappointment. If you like John Carradine and the roles that he played as Count Dracula in many films of the 1940s, you might want to see how John does his best.
