I bought it out of curiosity. How did John Carradine (who died in 1988) and Cameron Mitchell (who died in 1994) appear in a film shot in 1995? Thanks to the miracle of the unused film, you can shoot footage, which probably sat on the shelf for about ten years, that's how! You can say because the filming used to shoot their scenes is not the same as the movie used to make Jack-O. The curse of Ed Wood lives. The good thing for both Carradine and Mitchell is that this is exactly the movie you expect to find in both your films. The same goes for Screen Queens, Lynn Quigley, Brinke Stevens and Dawn Wildsmith. <br /> <br /> The Okmur Crossing Halloween Scene, and some kind of curse is released when stupid, beer-hungry teens destroy the grave. The result: a clumsy killer with a scythe and a large plastic pumpkin on his head! He (this?) Stalks Kelly's helpful family for the sake of revenge (and kills others who interfere with it). Father opens the Ghost Garage for the neighborhood kids. The son (Ryan Latshaw, the son of the director) has one continuous bewilderment on his face for all his scenes and one funny dramatic scene lying in the grave. At least he is a child. Mother's eyes get out of her head while she stiffens to read her dialogue. There is also an annoying woman who appears to explain things that seem to be trying to phonetically utter her entire dialogue. <br /> <br /> So what about the names of the actors? You see Stevens, Wildsmith and Mitchell on the TV screen (they are used to count time). Linnea plays a big role as a nanny, and she does exactly what she can with her. Her enthusiastic performance helps a bit. There is another unexpected laugh when an ultra-conservative couple who watch clone Rush Limbaugh on TV bite him. A woman puts on a rug and strikes a toaster with a knife. She is electrocuted, and the end result looks like a fried Muppet. <br /> <br /> Everything and everyone, quite entertaining things! I was not bored!
