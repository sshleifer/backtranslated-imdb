Well, I'm usually pretty unbiased about movies. Usually I see a good side of the film that is completely indulged by others. This is an exception. <br /> <br /> I will not spend a lot of energy trying to tell you what is going on, but think about how Bill and Ted meet the worst movie from the police academy of all, and you won. ” Not far away. <br /> <br /> What really interested me in this film was the silly purine racism that was evident everywhere. The overall theme of the Latin American guys = cool, white guys = lame is a bit funny for the first couple of jokes, but when the same joke was repeated for the 500th time (by the way, not exaggeration), it becomes tiresome and offensive. <br /> <br /> I spent months waiting for the laws of Karma to return to John Leguizamo for this film. I almost lost hope when the “My VH1 Awards” was broadcast in the UK. This was followed by Mr. Leguizamo, who accomplished the rare feat of a bomber on stage. You must be a complete sadist to laugh at him. Um Ha! Ha! Ha!
