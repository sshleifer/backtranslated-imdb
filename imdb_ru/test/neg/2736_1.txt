This film was so terrible that I donâ€™t even know where to start ... The only thing I can say about him is that Luke Perry gave a good idea. The whole film was everywhere, there was no explanation as to the cause (only theories) of the eruptions, or the rationale for their decisions or why this would work. That was funny! All the characters and the relationships between them were so stupid that you just want to laugh !! They just had no background. The love relationship seemed to be added to the script, it was so awkward. There is an army man; a big black general with a standing cigar in his mouth, with "AaarrrGH! I'm a man!" attitude, such a pathetic bad guy. Two bosom friends, who must be geniuses, behave like two 16-year-old fraternity boys. And then, in order to create some kind of action, they decide to throw a stone on someone's shoulder, and during the rest of the film he coughs, as if he is dying of pneumonia or something else ... and then plays a hero the scene of all !!) help the plan, which should do, who knows that ... it will never be a good sign when you find yourself laughing out loud in the middle of the dramatic scene ... in a nutshell; do not waste your time!
