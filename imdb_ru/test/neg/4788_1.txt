With a lot of repetitive and derivative sitcoms jamming autumn, summer, winter and spring compositions, it's nice to see a show that stands out from the lot in more than one area. <br /> <br /> Earl takes an unusual approach. This is not about the "daily reflections of an eccentric family" (zzzz ..), nor about the other boring things that you see throughout the sitcoms. The show tells about this little white vor-scavenger (Erle), who tears down a lottery card and wins a lot of time. At this point, "Karma" took him from him. Over time, he learns that this unusual incident occurred, probably because of all the bad things he did, so he goes on a mission to correct all his mistakes, and he writes down all his affairs on paper. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliant premise for a sitcom. Fortunately, he fell into the right hands. The performance of the show gives extremely satisfactory results: you get an innovative comedy that is really fun and really touching many times. You can’t help falling in love with Earl’s sincerity and fortitude, Randy’s simple mind, kind heart and life observation, Joy’s wild, bright personality and Darnell’s soft, frightening behavior that really makes you sympathetic. <Br /> <br /> When you combine innovation of the show with its genuine humor, kind heart, interesting characters and well-written dialogue, you really have a keeper. With such shows (and the incomparable "Office") NBC, obviously, is up to something. Have they finally vacated the cab or two for quality assurance? Will hope. And let's hope that better shows like these will take turns; a show that will make us viewers and NBC executives stop crying because of NBC's golden days long past (Frasier, Seinfeld, Friends)
