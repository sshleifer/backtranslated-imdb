for people who absolutely have no idea what a comedy is. This includes not only the people who liked this film, but also the people who made it. What could they think about? Madonna plays Judy Holliday? Please, she cannot even play in Madonna (if this is really Madonna). I hope Griffin Dunn was well paid. He deserved every penny he received, because if it didn’t kill his career, nothing would come of it. I’m sure that the few people who actually paid to watch this movie left the impression that their pockets were chosen. Madonna, obviously, has gone through a sense of embarrassment from her almost complete lack of talent as an actress, but you still can't help but feel embarrassment for her. She has no connection with the other actors; it seems that she appeared on the set and said: “Well, I'm here, I embarrass myself, making absolutely the worst impression Judy Holliday, who anyone has ever seen, now stay away from my path” this. I know that the phrase "Madonna's rotten cinema" is superfluous, but it is certainly appropriate for this. It is painful to observe how the completely inept and incompetent “actress” fools herself, but apparently this does not bother her, since she does it again and again. <br /> <br /> The only remotely funny thing about this “comedy” is that she really managed to find the people who gave her the money to do it. Now it's funny.
