Imagine if you want: four teenagers were assigned to spend a night in a haunted house in St. Francisville, Louisiana, to check for paranormal phenomena. If you watch it in the dark and late at night; perhaps the hair on the back of your neck will go up a couple of times. Otherwise, this fake documentary is a very lazy excerpt from the BLAIR WITCH project. What should be a dialogue is very lame, and the actors look quite nice, but they seem to lack a real identity. It seems to be an eternity, before something really like a ghost happens. This film is great for “off-frame” when you both have bare eyes open, and all yaks and snacks.
