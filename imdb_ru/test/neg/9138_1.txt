I saw all 3 now. I just can't believe how bad Nakokatsi is. Not in comparison with others, but simply because of their own merits or absence. <br /> <br /> I cannot understand how the average rating of this film exceeds 6 out of 10. I gave the first 2 films 8 out of 10. They were provocative and perfectly executed. I gave this film a rating of 1. If it were available to 0 or a negative number, I would give it this rating. What a waste of time it was to watch this movie. After the first 30 minutes, I thought I should turn it off, but then I decided that it was just a (very) slow start to the movie. I thought the same thing after 45 minutes, then after 1 hour, etc. Then I realized that it would not be better. <br /> <br /> Looking very boring and without any redemptive qualities. Do not take my word for it, see for yourself. Be sure to watch the first two films before this. If you see it in the first place, I can guarantee that you never want to see the first two, but they are definitely much, much better than this “work”. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is when the role of credits is at the end. That's when your repentance on this earth is complete, and you can give up 89 minutes in purgatory for the suffering you endured while watching this “film.” If God is truly gracious, he will be more generous.
