After writing this review, I hardly try to figure out what to write about. Nothing special happens in this movie. The storyline is a South Asian woman who falls in love with an English Londoner. The problem is that he and his friends were racist. At the same time, her friend at work unknowingly refers to the fact that she has sex with her brother, and this is only getting worse. The problem is that this film is very predictable. As soon as all this happens, everything becomes pretty standard. It pulls a bit, although it's only about 90 minutes. This is more Chick Flick than anything else. So if you are a man, I do not recommend this film to you.
