“Bloody Birthday” is a strange and at times humorous low-budget horror film of the “Miki” type or a less intelligent version of “The Good Son”. <br /> <br /> Set in a small California In the city, three babies are born in the midst of an eclipse, where planetary alignment means that they are somehow born without emotion. Ten years later, our three little psychopaths start killing, killing parents, brothers and sisters, teachers and everyone who annoys them. Only one teenage girl knows the truth to be able to stop them. There is no explanation why children around the world born at the same time are not equally twisted, but you go! <br /> <br /> For a slasher film, he is very tamed from the point of view of violence and bloodshed, which I believe that the problem of turning children's characters into killers comes to the fore, since you can expose young actors to only a few. Instead, it is fun and a little anxious to see three-ten-year-olds plotting murders and fulfilling their plans using weapons, knives and crossbows. The main reason why this does not turn out to be completely ridiculous is that child actors very convincingly play their roles in the way they slyly act out little innocent people in front of unintelligible adults, showing their dark side to a girl who knows the truth. <br /> <br /> “Bloody Birthday” is a rather mediocre horror film, with a small amount of scares and a small amount of blood, but since it has a shock factor when children become killers, it is a bit unique in that sense. , One to see if there is nothing else.
