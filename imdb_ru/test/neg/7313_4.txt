Titles at the end read “ALL directors of Shigeru Izumiya”. This is the appropriate way to express it, because it seems that the footage from several projects was somehow combined, without even trying to do it all in one consistent work. It was more like one of those music videos that are sold as feature films to earn on these commercials, just here we don’t have commercial music and live performances, except for one scene, which can also be sold as a strange music video in Japan. Whatever. <br /> <br /> It makes no sense. Visually, this is not very special, although it has its own moments (for example, a female being with “powder of death” who is tied to the base of the bed and a bit of morphite throughout), and it certainly has an industrial feel to it. Usually I would call the effects amateurs, but what this film offers in this regard is confusing more than anything else. Do you remember those cheap video effects from 70s and 80s music videos that make them look as outdated as the picture in the picture flying through the screen? There are quite a few of these effects, and for no apparent reason. The greatest half apparent effort is manifested in the form of a collage. Pictures look like album covers. Anything. <br /> <br /> I don't know what happened to the subtitle version I saw. Chinese (or whatever these hieroglyphs) sometimes appear when nothing is said, and English often appear without Chinese. English submarines talk a lot about life without death (is it possible?) And about the mind without a body, which provides what comes closest to the understandable conflict between the characters in this film. One guy (scientist dude) says that life without flesh is death, while the other guy (metamorphic dude), who claims that his mind is outside of his body, now that he has got the "powder of death" blown up in his face, and that now he knows the secrets of flesh and whatnot; dude metamorphosis is clearly visible due to the scientist dude's claim. Whatever it is. <br /> <br /> Uh, End - all is written by Perception of Ambiguity
