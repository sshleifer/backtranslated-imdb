I love this movie, and I've watched my copy twice since it was purchased a few weeks ago. But you have to look at it in the right context. <br /> <br /> I didn’t check the dates, but I bet that this film came out after and, of course, at about the same time as the popularization of Collier and Walt Disney. space flight vision promoted by V. von Braun. This is reflected in an attempt to appear actually correct and scientific. However, while some ideas are presented (for example, stepped amplifiers) are approximately correct, other things are funny wrong. <br /> <br /> For example, we are told that a rocket rises to a height and then turns ninety degrees. to enter the space ... how to reach the top of the stairs and turn on the landing! Then we are told that when turning in the direction of the Earth’s rotation, the total speed of the ship increases accordingly. <br /> <br /> This is a ridiculous misunderstanding of what is actually happening. Most space launch centers are located as close as possible to the equator, where the Earth and everything that is on its surface rotates at a speed of about a thousand miles per hour, including any rocket flying out into space, eastward (just like the rotation of the planet) . Of course, if the ship turns around and flies westward in space, its speed relative to the surface of the Earth will be higher, but this will not change anything to the actual speed of the ship. Described in this film as "air speed"! <br /> <br /> Similarly, we are told that travelers feel free-fall or “weightlessness” when they reach several thousand miles from Earth, outside the gravitational field of the planets. Again, comically wrong. Most spacecraft with a crew move no higher than a couple of hundred miles upwards, but as long as they (and their contents, including the crew) move at an adequate speed so that their momentum outward balances gravity inward, they will orbit in free fall. Of course, the journey is far enough from Earth, and even a slow object will go well beyond the Earth’s gravity, but in order to go out of Earth’s orbit (for example, to the Moon), you need to reach an “exit speed” about twenty-one thousand miles hour. Thus, by definition, the ship will already reach "orbital speed" (and "weightlessness"). <br /> <br /> But the movie is much more fun than this one. Someone decided that it would be more fun if they miss the moon due to a technical problem, fall asleep for a few days, and then wake up and find that they accidentally went to Mars! Then the captain reflects on the fact that this must be a divine intervention! At this moment, any pretense of being scientific is torn into small pieces, such as confetti, and thrown into the wind amid a merry dance of an increasingly crazy plot. <br /> <br /> The strength of such a film is in fact illustrating how far we have come. Not least in relation to women. Patronizing chatter, piled on a female member of the crew, both fun and shocking. I think that such relationships were quite recently "normal." <br /> <br /> As I said in the beginning, I find this film very interesting as late at night, as in the last days before it actually happened, the romance of space travel breaks out. The antidote to the cold routine of space flight as it became in the twenty-first century. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the ending. It is a bold and shocking film with such vintage and character.
