I must have not seen the same movie referenced by the comments. First of all, I think they should have serialized Ghost Story, if they were going to shoot it at all. The truncated version they came up with was awful. I felt that the performances were mannered, and so much was excluded from the history that the performances of such masters as Aster, Douglas, Houseman and Fairbanks seemed like Hammy. Alice Kriege was as gorgeous as Eve. Craig Wasson is a good actor, but he was only adequate as the main character. The decision to play Patricia Neil and cut her role was not successful. Imagine what Ann Bancroft would do with this character! I blame the script that was bad. Production figures were dark and the pace was slow. Disappointing pedestrian efforts. <br /> <br /> This book is one of the five greatest novels about obscurity / horror of the 20th century, IMHO. But the film was a disappointing, albeit a great introduction for Krige.
