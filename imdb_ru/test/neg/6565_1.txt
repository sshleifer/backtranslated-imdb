I know there are some fans who might like this movie. I know that the idea of ​​“seeking God” may seem interesting to some, but I’m really bored. <br /> <br /> The film is just boring. When it gets a little interesting, it becomes stupid. Come on ... Kirk wrestles with God and wins? How low can we get? The only good role in the film is a place for camping in the first 5 minutes, which is really great, but after that the movie becomes boring, annoying, with nothing more than good music. <br /> <br /> Thank God, we have Star Trek VI. (Oh, Kirk defeated him).
