An ordinary horrible movie ... I won't bother you with a brief summary, just compile "The Core", Armageddon, the evil planner officer and one or two "Nuclear all-nuclear weapons", and you will have a film if I So. <br /> <br /> Seriously, nuclear weapons in such films are more useful than “Swiss Army Knives”: <br /> <br /> Is Big Is Near? Nuclear weapons in some places, and it's over ... Tornado wants to destroy "Enter the important name of the city here"? Nuclear bomb "Insert here another important city" ... volcano erupts? Nuke it! Is a nuclear bomb close? Nuke it! Is coffee cold? Nuke it! Didn't you like Transformers? Break yourself, but I can't be sure that this will fix everything ... <br /> <br /> In the end, how many more similar films can you make before they start copying each other? I doubt that there are still many things that can be blown up with nuclear weapons ...
