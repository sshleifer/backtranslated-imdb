Just what the world needs is another surface cookie, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. This film distributes horrible messages to girls everywhere, complete with stereotypical experiences of "junior classes". They make learning anything seem completely taboo. I hate fake French accents or those guys on mopeds who end up “falling in love” with twins. Why do I put everything in brackets? Because everything is stereotypical. Twins even complain about the lack of a stereotypical grandfather. They should be happy that they even have a grandfather. How does this fit Mary-Kate / Ashley form? This time they restore one guy who (choking !!) NOT THEIR FATHER !!!!! Yes, guys, they really have a mother who appears for a full five seconds. I have not even spent thirty minutes of this, and I can already say how it will end. This film is so pitiful that Miss USA looks like an academic bowl. Indeed.
