Usually for film reviews I try to be constructive and objective, but there is only one word for this “movie”: sucks !!!!!!! The dialogue, the acting, the special effects, the plot, the scenery and the characters seem as though they were made by my potted plants. I do not see this for the sake of all the good and the right in this world! :)
