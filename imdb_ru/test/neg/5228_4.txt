Based on the novel by Stephen King, NEEDFUL THINGS provides intrigue and aspiration to keep you in place. A mysterious man (Max von Sydow) comes to the city and soon becomes the most discussed citizen. Could it be that the devil himself opened an antiques shop in a small town in Maine? Von Sydow masterfully and dynamically copes with this role that dominates the screen. Also starring Ed Harris and Bonnie Bedelia. Harris is balanced, and Bedelia deserves your attention. Also in support of J.T. Walsh and Amanda Plummer. Not the best and not the worst adaptation of King's horrors on the screen.
