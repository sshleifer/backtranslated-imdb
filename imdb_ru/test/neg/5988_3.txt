SHRIEKER - full moon setting. I knew what to expect (of very poor quality), but I didnâ€™t expect it to hurt as much as Shriker had to look. <br /> <br /> This is just awful. Bad behavior, confusing script and direction. Annoying characters I wanted to kill. All this was probably done in one week. I saw CHARMED episodes that were more complex and convincing than this cheap one. <br /> <br /> He looks like an orphaned episode of a poorly thought-out television series that no one has ever seen. It was hard work to watch, and I felt that my thoughts were getting dimmer and dimmer by the minute. Watching a movie should not be so hard work.
