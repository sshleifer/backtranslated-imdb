This is a mercilessly stupid, boring, unimaginable, lazily folded piece of garbage. When watching a live video slash, it's fair to expect the film to be cheesy at some level, but this goes beyond the cheesy frame. It's just awful at every level, using a cliché screenplay that manages to be both incredibly stupid and incredibly boring, with no name cast on the actors and some of the worst special effects I've ever seen. Even fans of slash movies can’t find anything here that would make this movie useful in an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The story focuses on your regular group of young people who decide to spend a weekend on a remote farm in West Virginia, which was recently inherited by a member of the group. Unfortunately for teenagers, the inherited land once belonged to a farmer who made sacrifices to help grow his crop, or something stupid in that direction, and now some evil stuffed animals are going to kill everyone. I do not know anything about the director of the writer Paul Moore, but I assume that he is more than ten years old, and therefore he should be able to come up with something more original than frightening killers. Fair. <br /> <br /> Special effects, animating stuffed, ridiculously scanty. They often look almost like Haloween costumes on sticks. Special effects like these might have been considered rather meager twenty years ago, but by today's standards they are just confusing. <br /> <br /> This is a complete waste of time for all viewers, regardless of whether they are in horror films or not. If you need to watch a slash movie, rent any of the films Friday, the 13th or Halloween. Most of them are not very good, but definitely better than this shit.
