Sometimes, when critics criticize a movie, you just need to watch it to see if it’s really as bad as a complaint, well, in this case, it was. I believe it was a sexy comedy, but it was neither sexy nor funny. I think I once laughed when Johnny Vegas failed to break through the roadside fence, and that was it. <br /> <br /> The film tells about the life of four men who supply potatoes for life, each of them has a problem with their sex life; Dave left his wife and is looking for an old fire that once invited him to a troika a few years ago. Ferris lives with her mother-in-law, who treats him as a sexual object, Tolly is obsessed with engaging strawberry jam in his meetings. and Jeremy claims to be in a love relationship, but in reality is pursuing a poor woman. <br /> <br /> The tone of the jokes varies from tasteless to “I do not believe that someone could write this,” for example, the last one, when they tell a small child that his father died in a car accident and then in a highlight when a boy asks how his mom is, they tell him that she is in a coma. The blame for all this lies right at the feet of the screenwriters, the actors obviously made a bad choice by agreeing to act in this film, but I did not think that their acting was so bad ... not that it was so good, Amazing But for a rather messy movie about sex, there is no nudity, and sex is never erotic. <br /> <br /> I, of course, do not recommend watching this for any reason other than painful curiosity, although judging by other reviews it seems to be whether it is love or hatred for the film, I suspect that it would be better to watch after several bottles of beer and with your friends.
