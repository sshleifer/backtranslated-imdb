This can hardly be called a good movie, in fact it is not even close. But I have to say that there were a few things that made me ... not laugh, not giggle, but something like that. The parody of Resovoir Dogs was one of them. The rest are not so important to be remembered. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this film has disappointed me a bit. The plot sounded like an idea, but quickly fell to the ground. The whole thing was just dirt and actors, where itâ€™s not good for the characters; most of them just beat. There was also a whole series of unclassified episodes, it was a waste of the film. I really understand that this would make the film about 20 minutes shorter, but it would only make it better. <br /> <br /> Now that everything is well and poorly built, let's come to the conclusion: two of the six toilet seats are for this.
