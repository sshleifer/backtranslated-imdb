I knew it would be a bad movie when I rented it, but I was hoping for a good bad movie. Oh, well, it was fun to make fun of the endless wandering through the sand, there is camel dung (well, in fact, eggplant) and strange grimaces from the actors, I think it was about five actors. The DVD needs the director's comments so that I can find out what he was thinking about ... or was he at all. I can not believe that they actually went to England, Austria and wherever it was filmed ... it could ALWAYS be done. It would be better if they could undress her. The best line of the movie? "He is waiting for his updates." "Yes, still waiting." Now it was funny! If someone had more than 3 pages of dialogue (except the narrator .... CLOSE ALREADY), then I will look at it again.
