An annoying film, quasi-old-fashioned playful chatter, created to demonstrate the comedic qualities of the singing star of Madonna. She really does go very far in the well-known part, playing here an extremely lively parole, trying to prove that she was set up for murder (the body was found in the trunk of her car after she ran into the red light ... big laugh). After an energetic animated sequence of titles - which is much more fun than the rest of the picture - we have nothing to look at except for Madonna’s black mascara and red lips, distinguished by her platinum hair and pale complexion. What else is there? Griffin Dunn seems to be defeated, playing goalkeeper Maddie, while the supporting cast of the unfortunate choice struggles to laugh with lousy dialogue. This is an unfortunate blow to the talent of director James Fowley, who unwisely allows his star to run insanely in the spirit of films about crazy films of the 1930s (but even Katherine Hepburn had a human side in “Raising a Child”). Unhappy. * from ****
