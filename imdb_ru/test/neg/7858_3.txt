Henry (Don Amech) appears at the entrance to hell and tells the story of his life to His Excellency (Laird Cregar).

This is a sentimental story of one person’s life and very boring. I watched it with my girlfriend and my father, and we all thought it was rubbish, despite the touch of Lyubich. I yawned more than 15 times. Hugo (Charles Coburn) is good when he is on screen, like a grandfather, and there were some funny moments of dialogue.

In the same form as “This is a wonderful world” and “You cannot take it with you,” and therefore, not surprisingly, he was nominated for an Oscar. The story of ordinary people, none of which is interesting and does not have a plot line of any interest. The boring, sentimental and biggest wet blockhead ending I remember ...
