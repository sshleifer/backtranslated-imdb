This piece of garbage is in the basement of some moldy old mansion, where he will never see daylight again. The only thing that is scary in this junk is the price of admission. I was just amused when the opening credits began, and I was free to leave the hall. What an endless bore; a complete waste of an hour and a half. When I die, I pray that I may return as a ghost and cause a fever to the idiot who composed this nonsense.
