I bought this film on DVD for 4 pounds, but it was a waste of time, the film is very bad. The plot is your average monster movie in which several people are killed, the mayor / chief does not believe in it, and at the end they fight. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the quality of the film is very good, and the situation in New York is impressive for a budget film - unlike a small coastal city. Acting is also reasonable. <br /> <br /> However, the special effects, the main roles in the monster movie, are ridiculous, and adding the random bus load of children to the plot halfway becomes just strange. The ending is just bad. <br /> <br /> In general, if you have a chance to see it, do not - something will be better. <br /> <br /> RTC "Real horror movies does not have a PG rating"
