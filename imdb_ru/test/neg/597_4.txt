I gave this movie a four-star rating for several reasons. First, I felt that this film was definitely preaching, and I hate it. However, it is my fault that I watched a Christian film. <br /> <br /> My friend and I shot this film because it sounded interesting. The back of the case said something like a spiritual battle, someone opens up some kind of border that lets demons into our world and the like. Something that really interests me, really. This movie almost hit the mark. It was more like the edge of a target, more like a tree than the very goal ... <br /> <br /> The main plot of this film is two pairs stolen by a group of terrorists who are victims of experiments. However, since their experimental serum was obtained from a research scientist who claimed to be able to bridge the gap between the physical and spiritual realms, male couples can now feel, smell, hear and see the demons of the spiritual world. In this sequence. Apparently, in this world there is no taste. <br /> <br /> This movie is very cliche. They took the title seriously, as the men chained to the beds require their women to look after them, because there is something there. <br /> <br /> Although it would be nice, I think the special effects were done much better. In short, a demon scratching a woman was hilarious. The wife was disgusting as hell, and everyone in the room was almost happy when she died. We all hoped that another woman with a chair would beat her. <br /> <br /> This is a message that I don’t want to comment, except that I think Christian directors should have done this. found the best remedy for this. <br /> <br /> And so I give him four stars, because it’s not the film’s fault, I’m not a Christian and I don’t like this type of message, and I enjoyed making comments everywhere. My friend and I watched this movie, it looked like an episode of MST3K.
