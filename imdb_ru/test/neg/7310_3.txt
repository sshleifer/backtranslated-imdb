It was a film that could be great if there were not so many unnecessary historical inaccuracies, and if the actors were chosen or invented to look a bit more like real people (not very difficult). Sissy did not go to Mayerling to see her dead son; she also did not die on the street; they carried her to the boat and then back to the hotel, which was much more substantial. I'm not sure about the wedding night, but I find it exaggerated that the maid of honor undresses the empress and leaves her completely naked (and this is in the 1850s) or that the emperor will very proudly declare: "Yes, I finally put her" in the court As far as I know, it was done right away on the first night, and no one rewarded her as if she were a street walk. The saving grace of the film is Stefan Odran, a great actress and loyal to the heroine.
