This is probably the most annoying show I've ever seen in my whole life. This is indescribable the most annoying and idiotic show I've ever seen. Everything about it is just bad. <br /> <br /> Summary: Every week, the parent faces a different situation to cope with their children. <br /> <br /> I could not understand what kind of idiot happens. This mess is first of all not to mention several seasons. Is the script bad, very bad ?? it has both gaiety and an unethical joke, which you usually see in movies with an R or NC-17 rating. Especially for a youthful character, where everything he does is enjoyable, is this what they call family with humor? Casting is also terrible, because everything that you see is really BAD actors, period. <br /> <br /> Last word: this show is a real torture !! This show gives an idea of ​​what an irresponsible parent can be (using power incorrectly, not understanding). This is millions of times from reality. Listen, Kenny Ji would be a god send compare to this. Watching the rotation of the washing machine doesn’t hurt your eyes as much as this show. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0/10 (class: Z) <br /> <br /> Note: the show is very bad It is even the mother of the actors to get her daughter out of the show.
