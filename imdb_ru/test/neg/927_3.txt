The third film based on the play by Charles Belden entitled “The Secret of the Museum of Wax Figures” (1933) is focused on the X-tasy generation. Twin script writers, Chad Hayes and Carey V. Hayes, spend more time developing the main characters than other slasher films are a promising start. Their condition guarantees a reliable point of view. The role of Page (Paris Hilton) was not such a stretch for the beloved heiress of the world. She looks through "In Style", strip boys, chatting and getting annoyed due to ill-conceived pregnancy. Her usual routine was altered without possibility of recovery. Hilton reached the peak of her performance - not so hot - during the parody of "One Night in Paris" (2004). While pimp-my-ride is in motion, she jealously “looks for lip balm” on her boyfriend’s lap (Robert Richard). Finally, the “actress” redeems the use of the word “N” on the sex tape. Directed by Jom Collet-Serra makes his view on the twin, contrary to the theme of the past. Each of them then possessed opposite characteristics, whereas today in the womb a pair of good or bad can appear. However, the latter does not exclude the first. Childbirth is a lucky draw. Spectators can hardly think of Vincent (Brian Van Holt) as a modern Quasimodo. Of course, the hermits have some common features, such as artistry, disfigurement, humility and murder. However, one small variable between them matters. Vincent is even worse inside than outside. The House of Wax Colle-Serra pays homage to the actor Vincent Price from the first remake in 1953. The film leaves Van Gogh’s obvious puns for the viewers ’imagination. However, the choice to divide the antagonist into two parts precludes a lively turn at the end. The denunciation of Professor Henry (Vincent Price) Jarrod gets second place, but the worst in the history of horror films belongs to Lon Cheney in The Phantom of the Opera (1925). As for the new applicant, the consequences of the separation operation reduce the effect. The surgeon should know, operating with Siamese twins, their scars - physically and psychologically. Their father needs to call a couple of colleagues - Dr. Phil to consult and Dr. McNamara to nip. Despite what trailers said, “Wax” is not forever. In fact, you can get rid of it by burning it.
