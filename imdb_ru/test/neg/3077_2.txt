I usually start my reviews by explaining how and why I watched the movie being watched. With this, I just can not explain. I had to get up early for work the next day, so the last thing I wanted to do was to watch a movie about which I knew nothing. But something kept me glued to my comfortable futon as I watched this machine Heather Graham. Oh, that's right. Boredom. <br /> <br /> Graham plays Jolene, a bohemian asylum who seems more obsessed with her marriage vows than the guy she married (played by Luke Wilson). When her hubby decides to go in search of better things (work, women and scenarios, apparently), Jolene begins a fanatical search to find her husband and free him from his "spiritual wheelchair." It sounds like I’ll make this up, but unfortunately not. In fact, for Graham, this is nothing more than an actor's exercise, since she playfully gives Phoebe a friend to this role. Yes, and Goran "ER" Vishnich is also there for some reason. <br /> <br /> In the television programs it was comedic, but I could not find a single laugh anywhere. It struck me that it was a personal journey for Lisa Kruger (director and writer), in the same form as “Girl Interrupted,” but even this caused more laughter than that. Graham's character is simply too selfish for viewers to take care of him, and I felt sorry for my beaky husband who was being smoked when he bravely fought for his freedom from his obviously mental wife. Very little of this film made sense, as the characters simply appeared in the story, as if they were standing around, waiting for Graham to appear as extras in The Truman Show. In fact, the only positive comment I can make from my writings was: "Heather Graham - good backups." And not because I'm too tired to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> In truth, it’s very hard to think of anyone recommending this film. Graham's purists (a VERY small number of movie fans, I think you will agree) will have to devote themselves to watching this dross, and maybe hippie students who collect Native American dream catchers will get something from this. I was amazed that the average rating (at the time of writing this article) was 5.0 - that would make this film as good as “Die, but not the day” and “Gothic” in my book, and this is simply not correct. “Devotee” is an unusual mess in a film that does not entertain or illuminate. It is difficult, meaningless and just too boring for my tastes and, probably, for you too. Don't even think about looking at it.
