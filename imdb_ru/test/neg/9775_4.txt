This horror story takes place in the Namib Desert in Africa. Canadian systems analyst Zack Straker (Scott Barstow) is sent on a business trip to a diamond mining company. Although he hates field work, he finds himself in a truck with a rescue party in the open desert, struggling with sand flies and whipping, blowing sand. Four diamondbearers found ... well, what's left of their scattered bones. During a long, cold night, a changeable monster appears in the desert. Zack and his colleagues are scared when their truck is stuck, and the squad members die terribly one after another. No character development; not to mention the dialogue to talk about. The desert is beautiful in its own way and giving nothing away ... the creature is as old as the sands of the desert. Also in roles: Rachel Shelley, Warrick Greer and Patrick Shay.
