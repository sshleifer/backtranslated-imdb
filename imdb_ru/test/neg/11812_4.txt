If you think it’s nice to be obsessed with someone you are in love with, then I can imagine to give him a good rating ... but I can't imagine that this topic is obsession and little respect for others (for example, the attitude of Poly) teachers who are trying to help her) - this is all that you would like to teach your children. Yes, it’s as bad as Victoria turned to Paulie, but guess what. That's life. Is this not a more important lesson to learn how to overcome these disappointments and make the best of your life? Or falling from the roof is the best lesson for our children? Secondly, when Mary’s father did not appear at dinner, and Paulie helped Mary to release her anger, Mary even said that she would like him to die ... For some reason, I also don’t think this is a good message with which you deal your frustrations from anger.
