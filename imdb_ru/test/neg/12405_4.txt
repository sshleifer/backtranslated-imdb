Your ability to enjoy Ash Time may depend on our expectations before entering the theater. It seems that even the most ardent supporters agree that the audience can be divided into two parts in their assessment of this unique film. <br /> <br /> Unlike most HK militants, battle scenes keep their distance from curiosity. When they happen, they are displayed in a sharp style, in which it is difficult to pinpoint what is happening on the screen. Dramatic scenes can be extravagantly beautiful, with the participation of Maggie Chung, Bridget Lin, and the capture of the main acting talent of HK, chewing on the landscape. As with some of Wong Kar-waiâ€™s early works, the dialogue could be more precise. <br /> <br /> In short, Ashes of time require a forgiving attitude. Released at about the same time as the stunningly successful Chongking Express Wong Kar-wai, it becomes clear that the director is not so confident in working with elements of a martial arts movie. Anyone who is looking for intense action may be disappointed. But those who are intrigued by the aesthetics of the director, are likely to find this a unique experience.
