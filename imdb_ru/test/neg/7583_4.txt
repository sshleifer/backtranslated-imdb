Roger Spottiswood is not the worst director, and he did a good job on the underrated sci-fi thriller “The Sixth Day” (a.k.a. “Mr. Schwarzenegger’s Cash Regress). However, Air America should be one of its most inept projects. <br /> <br /> This fusion of drama, comedy and war film is not a very convincing mix. In fact, I believe it is overbearing. <br /> <br /> Robert Downey Jr. (during his heyday) plays the role of a pilot hired by a completely secret CIA organization that operated during the Laos during the Vietnamese era. Mel Gibson plays his co-pilot, and he learns that they are exchanging drugs and what not. <br /> <br /> The film was promoted during the release, because it featured two famous faces, and Aerosmit re-recorded the classic Doors "Love Me Two Times" for the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The replay of the song is rather meager, which is suitable for the film.
