This show should be titled “When bad writing happens with good actors,” considering that most of the players showed tremendous talent elsewhere, for example, Andre Brauger in killing: life on the street and David Morse in St. Friend. I hope that the frantic pace of the show adjusts as the series progresses, along with the obvious cliches and dialogues so absurd that I wondered how stupid the writers were the mainstream audience. We hit on the head with the main points of this show, instead of being left to gradually figure it out, almost as if the writers felt they had to explain that the main character is a kind of angel-avenger, sentenced to self-restoration from sins, like ordinary as well as mortal, through driving in his taxi pays a lot of work. Viewing the premiere required detachment from disbelief, since the fare for Mike Olshansky would have poured into him so quickly, and he would feel the need to intervene in the life of completely unfamiliar people. That he possesses these "super-police" abilities, to be everything for everyone, an expert on weapons, a martial arts master, a psychologist, a confessor, locksmith, and so on, ad infinitum. Pure bum fantasy. What of the recent television shows in Philadelphia, it seems that they are all saturated with a vile ex-wife and a very disrespectful stupid child? Overcooked. I really enjoyed this show, but I did it because it had a background that was a little different from many of the clones appearing in the fare this season, and some of my favorite actors were in it. But I am afraid that this is just another good idea, destroyed by careless execution.
