I entered this movie with very little in terms of expectations. I went with my girlfriend and two friends, and none of them could explain to me the story of Grudge 1. Well, if the first one could not leave an impression on them to explain the plot, then I doubted that this would be better. <br /> <br /> Let me briefly state what trailers told you: the Asian lady is returning and Sarah Michelle Gellar. Fortunately for her, she is not very long. This decision could save her career. <br /> <br /> There are three storylines in the film, and none of them makes sense. And what's worse, none of them are designed. You almost begin to understand, and then someone dies, and the story is left behind. Okay, killing people can be scary, but I was more embarrassed by the attempt to develop the plot than I was scared. They jump back and forth between all three storylines that are not connected ... OR THEY?!?! * SOUND EFFECTTT * ~~~ These three stories are biased, and you can tell at the very beginning that the film will have a turn at the end. BE READY. Oh wait. Sorry, this is not a quality turn of Fight Club or Vertigo, you can see that it comes from miles. And probably assumed the VERY best turn in your head ... they should have hired me. Instead of the girl looking “amazing,” maybe it could be Michael Jackson? This part of Scary Movie 4 scared the hell out of me. <br /> <br /> The consequences of the murder were terribly committed. Unlike the horror films of the past, where the killer jumps out of nowhere, for example, in the closet or behind the door, and everyone in the theater jumps (and later the fat guy behind you spills popcorn around his neck) - there was no frightening UPS popularity. They focused on where the random Asian woman or child would appear, and you knew exactly what was going on. Instead of getting the music really loud, then quiet, and then popping out of your head, the music actually gave you time for a scary scene. If I know that this will happen, it will not frighten me. <br /> <br /> The film began with an explanation of what Malice is; when a man is killed during a fit of rage, a curse is imposed on the place where he was killed. So why does an Asian lady, cursed by her mother, have any meaning for this story? And why is malice now moving countries? This movie was just awful. <br /> <br /> All he did was make me jealous of my friends for making me leave — we had to watch one of these animated Pixar movies. It would be worse.
