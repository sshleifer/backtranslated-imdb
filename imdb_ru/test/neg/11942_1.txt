I remember, many years ago, Michael Douglas wanted his wife, Catherine Zeta-Jones, to be in a romantic film, because he felt that his wife had all the goods. No doubt she does, but NOT in this film. Colossal waste of time, neither history, nor character development, nor chemistry, nada. It was not the car that we all hoped for, that this film would be a boring and HUGE disappointment. Even the movie did not watch, torture. Catherine Zeta-Jones, obviously, was trained on how to work in the kitchen, move around, present the dish, but it was not a food chain, did not know anything here, and as soon as her colleague appeared, supposedly there was a romantic interest in chemistry. The poor whore on the second floor of her building is trying to connect all the tricks and no character development there. The loss of her sister was badly played out because someone knew that it was an affinity. The sister's daughter just got here and there with something that should have attracted you, NOT. Just a waste of movie time. Promoters have certainly done their job to show this film without any splendor in all networks, seducing you with all sorts of teasers. Unfortunately, do not spend a penny.
