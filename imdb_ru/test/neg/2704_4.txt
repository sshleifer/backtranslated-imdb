Although this film is generally inaccurate, there are some points that may be true. Of course, he was a wild character in his youth, he practiced jokes at his fellow cadets at West Point, was excluded several times, finishing last in his class (out of 34), and often recklessly led during the civil war. br /> <br /> But the story may have made him the scapegoat of the Indian wars. Of course, he did his share of cruel things, but how much was he on orders? In addition, there is evidence that he testified before Congress (at great risk to his commission and command), that he argued about the fairness of breaking contracts with the Indians and that if he was an Indian, he would also fight, and not live on the reservation ! <br /> <br /> As one of the characters in the 1776 play said when asked what would be said about the British about losing the war of independence, he states that “history will do what it always does ... she will lie. ” Who knows how bad Custer was. Of course, he was not a sympathetic character, portrayed by Errol Flynn and then Ronald Reagan. But I also doubt that he was absolutely evil, as he is portrayed later.
