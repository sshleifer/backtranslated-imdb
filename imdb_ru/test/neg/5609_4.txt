Romantic comedy films, of course, the most fruitful genre for films "below average" and a source of frustration for the audience. This is an excellent example that has won a place in my “top ten worst films”. <br /> <br /> History is far from being creative, and jokes are weak. I haven't found a reason for a single laugh throughout the entire film! The characters are simple and performed by the actors and are just as good. The story develops slowly, tediously and predictably. The end is also predictable and covered in sugar. <br /> <br /> These are films that you watch on a rainy Saturday afternoon, when, in my humble opinion, you have nothing to watch.
