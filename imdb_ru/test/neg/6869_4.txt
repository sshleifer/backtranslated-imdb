Visitors are a heavy, heavy film for enjoyment. He is so slow and lead in rhythm that sometimes I get distracted from the film. I would add that it was around 11:00 on a hot sunny day, and not at midnight on a cold winter evening, so you get an idea of ​​how slow this film is. <br /> <br /> Strange, but it is not. long. 100 minutes is just ten minutes longer than the average right on the video, and only fifteen minutes longer than the superior Dark Wolf, whom I happily watched the day before. It just pulls a lot, enough for you to lose interest in him. <br /> <br /> If you are not mistaken in designing S-L-O-O-W for the atmosphere, Visitors are good enough in action to make them almost justify how slowly everything happens. While memories are cheap and annoying as a way to round out Radha Mitchell's boat-woman, stalking / aliens / whatever is actually quite creepy and effective, especially when her suicidal mother appears and starts moaning at night. Full marks for not squandering makeup around the store too. A boat for one person is a terrible place, and sometimes the film uses the full power of the location and the desert sea to scare you to hell. <br /> <br /> However, it is difficult for me to recommend Visitors. I came out of this not only because I felt that I had just watched a 4-hour film, and not from a 100-minute film, but also because I was somehow deceived by offering many explanations of the persecution (Mind Games? Real Ghosts? Space aliens?) Visitors do not choose uniquely. All these observations of Radha Mitchell are talking to her cat and Dominic Purcell, smoldering for no apparent reason of some inexplicable horrible event in the past, for nothing? Tell me what you like about Shyamalan, but at least he will tell you what happened, no matter how crazy / stupid you might think. If you don’t watch a lot of these films, your fresh look may improve the situation somewhat, but I found it slow, boring and very derivative. If you want to scare yourself silly, there are much better places for this, if you want a clever thriller, there are a lot smarter.
