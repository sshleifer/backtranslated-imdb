I saw this DVD on sale and bought it without thinking, not even suspecting that it was released, since this is one of my favorite books of all time. As soon as I got to the house, I rushed to see it, but found myself completely disappointed. Although it is true that this film is based on a book, this is where the similarity ends. The characters are changed (i.e. E. Finney seems to be a more pompous jerk than anything else, while Jean seems a bit awkward) lines / thoughts missing. The film is really trying to portray some feeling that the previous lacked, but it was done in a sluggish way that makes a flat boring movie. It is the depth of character and feeling that makes a book so classic, and this film takes these things and completely destroys them when rewriting.
