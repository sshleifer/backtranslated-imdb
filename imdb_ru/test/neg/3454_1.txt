After seeing the first scene, I realized that the acting was so bad that it could not be continued later. Superficial and artificial, with frequent attempts to look professional through technology references as the five-year-old tries to portray it as if he knows what he is talking about. <br /> <br /> The plot line from the second to the half is completely unrealistic, and almost every decision made by the screenwriter was what you expect from a junior high school student. The overall storyline was as unoriginal and predictable as a flock of sausages. Those few attempts to make dialogues sounded reasonable, limited to neurotic, apologetic behavior. A ten-year-old may like this. But it will take five years to accept the lack of realism; How does the advanced cell function allow someone to bypass a code lock, touching it as if with a magic wand, choosing one of hundreds of voices through the ventilation system (thereby lifting Superman), and repairing a home computer, just feeling that it’s wrong instead of troubleshooting? In fact, this scene is a good example: the error was that one of the cooling tubes (aluminum bands) on the processor was broken, as it would look if the exhaust pipe on the V8 engine was blown off. This cannot happen, and if this happens, it will not interfere with the operation of the computer. An electric current does not pass through this tape, but when he (without doing this himself, his hands worked as an autopilot, because the cells in his body were very effective), he inserted a pushpin into the gap, an icon appeared on the desktop. Screen immediately without loading. <br /> <br /> And so on to the end. For example, when he escaped from the interrogation room at the headquarters of the NSA, he lit a lighter under the fire sensor, which opened doors throughout the building. Naturally, the NSA did not predict such an ingenious approach to escape, nor did they place any guards outside his room (or anywhere else) to guard a living, walking breakthrough in military nanotechnology. So he went out and took a taxi. There are not only many examples like this, in fact there is practically no single scene that makes sense. <br /> <br /> In addition, the so-called gorgeous effects were terrible. He threw a basketball to a child in the park, and the child was thrown horizontally 20 feet into the tree. There is no acceleration or deceleration, but constant speed and height, like a motorized cart. I’m sure that if I paused and searched for cables that retained this child’s posture as soon as they did, they probably didn’t know how or didn’t bother to erase them at all. If someone was thrown so far into a tree, they would at least say “oh” (or rather, they would be hospitalized with broken bones), but the child was just confused and amazed. <br /> <br /> Moroni. This word is for every creative decision made throughout the production. I'm going to put the name of the director on my personal blacklist, someone as poorly prepared as he cannot improve. I feel I am demanding compensation for having spent 45 minutes of my life watching and the time it took to write it. Despite the fact that it seemed to be therapeutic, it was very hard to understand how little it takes to get pilot approval. The only excuse that a slightly intelligent person could watch this voluntarily is imprisonment or lobotomy.
