Truly a terrible waste of space. My friend and I tried to watch this film before its completion, but I had to turn it off about 30 minutes after it ended. And I can count the films that I turned off to the end, on the one hand. <br /> <br /> The script and the directorial work are lead and very boring. I would not be surprised if they find the script in a bunch of abandoned 1983 scripts. For example, an annoying scrotum threatening a real estate agent from his home phone. I mean seriously. The police will beat his door in a few minutes. Scenes and events just wash you like poop in a river. It is difficult to understand the real thrust of the film. The narrative moves between the characters in a seemingly random fashion, disrupting the pathetic attempts at creating characters. Oh, and what kind of "characters". The main character, played by Rourke, is terrible. He could just send himself a cardboard and stay in bed. After about 60 minutes of the film, I had absolutely zero affection for this character. He is neither sympathetic nor hateful. Just a mutilated store window mannequin, missing through every scene. His motivation cannot be distinguished from his generally accepted and insensitive behavior. He is happy? He's sad? Angry? No idea. Only those very dead eyes look at you from a mutilated piece of flesh. And the theme of American Indians is just awful and meaningless. <br /> <br /> Good guys are unlikely at best. Dumb white collar stereotype and simplified neurotic stereotype of the former wife. The cue archetypal wife with a shotgun faces a bad guy, “you are not going to shoot me,” which is tediously unoriginal and annoying. <br /> <br /> At first, Richie’s character seems interesting, but soon turns into an annoying one-sided psycho character. Which seems to contradict the seeming intention of getting the bad guys to sympathize in some way, or at least realistically motivate. <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson's character begins with some promise, but soon turns into a disgusting and childish parody of the gangsters of the chickens from Jackie Brown. Do you really want me to believe that her character was SO attracted to Rourke? Or, worse, is she just a slut who sleeps with everything that moves? Realistic FTW female characters! <br /> <br /> The result is a complete mess of the movie. Hopeless performances and performances. Lead and battered scenario along with uninspired manual. And ultimately, extremely boring. This is not even a comedy. Laughing at Roerks, the haggard face becomes rather old after the first 15 minutes of an agonizing film.
