Naach A more detailed overview can be obtained anywhere on the Internet. This is a good image, although I do not quite agree with that. The ram is a commercial guy and, therefore, looks only from his point of view. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma (RGV, seemingly a political party) created a miracle at Rangel, so it looks like a pale reflection of it. one in some parts ... I'm not even going to compare Urmila and Antara ... both are good! The first is better acting talent, although the second is good. <br /> <br /> In any case, I like the character of Antara. She is faithful to her art, not touched by any unnecessary emotions and definitely not very practical. She is a scholar in the field of dance, in fact, she is so confident in her theories that even comparing her with a scientist will offend her. Hi .. Donald Trump .. maybe you should quit Melania, here’s Antrara, and you’ve already built the Taj Mahal ... isn’t it so easy? Abhishek, on the other hand, is a practical person who wants money, power, fame, etc. Therefore, these two, although they fought to break into the film industry, cannot get along, given their different styles and approaches to life. This is very typical, but what I like about the film is that he says what Abhiman would have said for all the time he was performing, in one scene! What's new? This film looks differently at the film industry and how different people get into it. There is always something different in RGV films, this one is different too, it is too slow for its standards. In parts, it pulls a man almost to sleep. <br /> <br /> Visibly Difficult to notice anything other than Antara in the first half of the film. I think this skin show was necessary for the dance sequences involved :-) Also, it seems that Antara is a yoga professional, she’s too flexible, almost like Prabhu Devi. Aby Baby develops as an actor with every movie. I’m sure his movie star’s blood brings big dividends. The title track was really good, the music was generally above average.
