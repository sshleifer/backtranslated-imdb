I spent a year in Iraq, and among the hundreds of films I saw here was this little gem called Vampire Killer. Judging by the cover (an African American with corn rows with a curved blade, leather coat and a tease manner), I was expecting a robbery of the blade. Fair <br /> <br /> So I shoved him and saw a border overweight black without a blade, without braids and, well, nothing at all but ... I don't know. If you read any of these other reviews, you'll get the essence of a click. It sucks. Bad. Really bad. <br /> <br /> I don’t know if it was the Highlander-esquire lightning after killing an immortal vampire, or the sound effects of karate punch to increase the camera, or a budget of twenty dollars for props, or “OK, we have 90 minutes to shoot this movie before we get caught in the parking lot of Johnson & Johnson ”, or martial arts that are just as exciting and fast-moving as two older people having sex, or 7th grade acting talent, or eccentric Asian The master who is either crazy or acid or something else e, but the movie manages to make you doubt your existence. And this is awesome. <br /> <br /> Not many movies can be so bad that your head will explode like scanners. If you quarrel (or MST3K) with your friends, this is a click for you. I have seen it three times already, and I think that this could cause irreparable harm to my psyche. If you still have no idea about the quality of the film, people tried to distribute it for free, and no one would take it. Even by force. <br /> <br /> In short, look. Either as a masochistic pleasure, or as a punishment. It will shake your skull (and for the most part for all the wrong reasons).
