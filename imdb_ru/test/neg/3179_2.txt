I like Wes Studi and especially Adam Beach, but this is a film of pretension. Heavy slowly. Too mysterious to such a degree of confusion, not because the plot justifies it, but because there is almost no plot. Even less on the way characteristics. It's almost like one of those raspy old puzzles of Charlie Chan (cheaper versions of the Monogram studio) with lots of red herring and strange characters (like the old ex-senator with a colorful past who is now a recluse) and a lot of people killed you would not have looked twice at the mall. Great landscape though. Beautiful red hair, too, although I did not understand what she was doing. My wife couldn't either. Damn, at least the old bi-films were decent enough to be short.
