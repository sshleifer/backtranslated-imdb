First of all, let me say that I live in South Africa, where rugby is our biggest sport to date, and our national team, springboxes, won the Rugby World Cup twice, so this is a pretty big deal. I’ve played all my life and I’m shocked by the poor attention to detail in this movie! At first, I thought he had the potential to be a great movie, given the cast of Neal McDonough, Nick Ferris, Gary Cole, and Sean Astin for God's sake, but it turned out to be a mockery of sports. They basically mixed it with your regular daily American football movie. <br /> <br /> My first problem is that this film supposedly reflects the values ​​of rugby, but discipline or, I must say, the complete absence of this during the games contradicts this. In the finals, this is more like a game in the NFL with Penning, who repeatedly decided with the ball before the judge ... this would immediately lead to a pair of red cards, because a foul play like this one will never go unpunished. In this judge, in this I can assure you! You also cannot find a coach in the world of rugby, who will have so little control over his team. Any coach can hit the player’s head if he deliberately puts his hands to the opponent or doubles him, as in the final ... red card and some suspension, with a full stop. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it is absurd that the coach will take a new player who has played his wing all my life, which I collect, will transport him to a prostitute, who is a highly specialized position, and say that it is for the benefit of the TEAM ?! What kind?! A hooker is a highly specialized position in the first row, where you should be able to grab the ball very well and, preferably, be able to throw the ball during a linear exit, which Penning NEVER does for one reason or another. Moving the wing to a prostitute without long, long workouts will, firstly, lead to the death of your team during the fight, and secondly, the poor child will probably break his neck! How good is it for the team I ask you about? Finally, the overall emotional intensity of the film is too great because, although rugby is a great sport, and it creates excellent friendship and team spirit, it is rarely out of control. I saw a real football drama with less emotion than in this film, and it turned out great, but in this, Shawn (Penning )’s acting skills are dragged out too far, and the film’s attempts too strongly force the emotional response from the audience that sometimes turns out to be boring and difficult to watch. <br /> <br /> Hollywood has made some great sports films over the years, but the next time they run the risk of a sport that just recently appeared in the states, they I should try to do my homework and possibly bring some experts to scramble <br /> <br /> RIGHT OR DON'T DO IT!
