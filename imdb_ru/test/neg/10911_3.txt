and absolutely not a scary movie. Characters are not interested at all, and most of the time is spent in the car. The dog is ugly at best, never scary. To be interested, you would need a more menacing threat, at least a few people you care about, and some emotions that you have. And, importantly, something interesting is about to happen. Something unexpected. Like this, this film just stretches, and it seems forever. Maybe Saint Bernhard was not so smart to choose him as a terrible threat to life and society? <br /> <br /> In most scary movies / thrillers / mysteries, in any genre, there must be characters that are of interest and interest in you. I want to know what is going on. Here you really don't care, you just wait for it all to stop, and you wonder if it would be better to see something else. One of the weakest adaptations of the king.
