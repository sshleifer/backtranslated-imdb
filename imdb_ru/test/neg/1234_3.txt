the photo is good, the costumes are good, but the editing is bad. Different scenes are cut or stopped at the wrong time, and conversations are very boring and tedious. This slowness continues the whole show. This is a very tiring show. .. I think that more scenes SHOULD BE ADDED, but that would make it a longer show. It is very slow. Script writers should have done this just a show for 1 night, and not to prolong our agony night after night. There is nothing else, otherwise I would change the channel (first night). I feel bad for the Indians of that time, and Iâ€™m angry with white people for what they did to the Indians, but this is our story.
