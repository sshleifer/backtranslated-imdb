I was looking forward to watching this film, and therefore I was extremely disappointed when I discovered that it was full and complete trash. The direction of Ackerman is tough and cliché (how much cliché can you get more than Paris at night?). The male cast seems to have been chosen solely for their resemblance to the passionate self portraits of Egon Schiele. However, the themes of jealousy and betrayal, which were supposed to be the focus of this type of film, have hardly been explored. What remains is a tight melodrama that requires age to begin and end even longer. The only advantage of this film is that it allows you to understand how good Goddard and Truffaut are.
