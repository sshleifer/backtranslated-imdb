This film is trying to say something deep; I'm just not sure what it was. Too much remains unresolved in the end, so that I can understand the main thing. A couple of scenes really make me think about what's left on the cutting floor. I do not think that the wall was very well developed, I did not understand what was actually happening there. When the mother finally reveals it, I simply could not connect with the boy’s silence. What is the point of not telling the boy? Was he just nonsense or did he acquire some kind of power. What was the scene with the burned girl? Another power the boy has or what? I do not understand how it developed any character or moved the plot. I got a little bully, but what happened to the dog? The dog returned or did the mother somehow get rid of Fido forever? <br /> <br /> There were a few additional plot elements that were more erratic than their use. Like a radio talk show in the background, discussing the war in Iraq. I think it should have created some kind of comparison with the grief and uncertainty that the mother and Addison felt, but for me it distracted and strained. I did not really buy the link. I also found that the teacher at Addison says that he doesn’t say too much "here" for roll call. Mom to see the doctor was meaningless, how did she serve the plot? Was it to show how desperately the mother hurt, or was it something about a medicine that I did not receive? Is dad back to the last scene or just some guy? So, did the work on the wall work? What happened to the dog?
