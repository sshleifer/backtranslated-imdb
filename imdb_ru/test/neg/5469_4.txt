While walking to buy cigarettes, professional dancer Daniel (Tom Long) was kidnapped and forced to have strange sex for three days with three hooded women. When he is released, the director of his company, Isabel (Greta Scacchi), has already replaced him in the play, and his girlfriend accepts him coldly. Excited and humiliated, Daniel leaves the dance company and travels to find the kidnappers. Daniel has sex with many women who he suspects may be kidnappers. <br /> <br /> “The Book of Revelation” is a fantastic film with a promising start that loses its original strength and becomes a kind of too long erotic soap-opera or soft porn chic. The production is cool, the DVD cover is awesome, but the characters are not very well developed, and Daniel’s injury seems excessive, since most men will fantasize with the sleep situation that he presented? become the sexual object of three sexy women. Melodramatic development with Isabella’s disease adds no value to the plot; open withdrawal is very disappointing, and there is no explanation for the woman’s motive or name. It is quite clear that the script about the feelings of a man was written by a woman. It was nice to see the still beautiful Greta Scacchi again, and her makeup was impressive as a result. There is a saying in Portuguese that can be translated into English as follows: “If rape is unavoidable, relax and come.” Daniel had to do this and save me from viewing almost two hours of meaningless history. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): “O Livro das Revelações” (“Book of Revelations”)
