I am not at all a fan of school comedies, they are highly dependent on bad sense of humor and rarely go far from clichéd plotlines, characters, and frankly boring dialogue. However, I got my share of pleasure, especially when I was in high school. Seeing how well-known figures of teachers hit their legs, always encourages me, and casual laughter can also take place. These films work only if at least one of the characters is instantly liked, this does not apply to "Cheats", especially to the main character. Of course, it didn't help that the actor in the game was one of the most annoying, mediocre, arrogant children I ever saw in a comedy. <br /> <br /> Acting in a comedy is not a joke, it's hard to be funny: the delivery must be correct, or the material is wasted. In this case, there were not so many good things to begin with, and the jokes, which were half funny, were professionally spoiled by the actors. <br /> <br /> This film lasted 3 hours, the director never heard of the steps obviously. Stay away from this, there are many other nice youthful comedies, such as “10 Things I Hate in You,” “Who Is Your Dad,” and “Superbad.”
