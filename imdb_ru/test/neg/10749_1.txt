I disagree 100% with a reviewer who disagrees 100% with a reviewer who gave an F rating to this short film. The burden of political propaganda only hides Joe Dante’s inability to pull out another howl from his bag of tricks. The Masters of Horror series was a phenomenal collection of truly horrific stories, with the exception of this episode. <br /> <br /> Despite the recognition of those who want to promote his political bias, “Returning Home” is the least effective episode of the Ministry of Health. first season Unlike the rest of the series, Dante's entry is a parody of a genre that does not stand up to horror or humor in his ridiculous supply of a battered political point. <br /> <br /> Dante really can only be blamed for pulling this smelly one off the shelf, since it was not his creation. The zombie subgenre is very popular this decade, and among the many predictable tributes and empty fantasies of George Romero there are a number of works aimed at spreading political or (and) religious messages. Such works are not written and are not intended for real fans of horror. Maybe Dante really is not a Master of Terror. After all, what did he do after The Howling? <br /> <br /> If you want a sucking anti-war zombie film with a few links to pop culture, which is a show of humor, Homecoming can be your favorite affair. If you're a horror fan looking for something masterful, pick up ... almost every other episode of the series. My personal favorite was “Jennifer” Dario Argento, based on the classic comic strip from Bruce Jones and Bernie Wrightson - really creepy.
