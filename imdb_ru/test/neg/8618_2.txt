This movie "Vampires: The Turning" is not even worth 2 out of 10 that I give him. The film is very predictable from start to finish, when our hero kills the leader of Vampire Slayer. The use of music in this film was even bad, it continued to play as if you expected something significant to happen at any second, although this did not happen. The acting was B-Rank at best ... And the film was just boring. The only reason I give this film 2 out of 10 is that this story had the potential, although it was not able to reproduce. Oh, did I mention the wardrobe? The wardrobe for this film was obviously cheap, in order to “not exist”, because our hero and his girlfriend (whom he tries to keep throughout the film) wear the same outfits throughout the film. I would suggest this film only if you are really bored and you do not have a good wall with fresh paint to look dry. ~ Dave, Horror Cowboy
