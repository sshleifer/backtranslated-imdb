Evil never looked so bad. They meant it. <br /> <br /> When my buddy took this DVD at the bookstore for half the price, I didn’t know what to expect. I mean, based on the title, I knew it would be worth it to laugh, but I didn’t understand how ridiculous it would be. <br /> <br /> For the first time, I missed some dialogues (if you can call it that) because we were all too busy mocking the plot of the film. It seemed like it was written in the film in less than a week, and they didn’t have the budget to come back and fix some minor flaws. Wait, did I say underage? I meant the exact opposite. For example, the main character is credited as “Ken”, but several times throughout the film he is called “John.” <br /> <br /> If you don't like plot holes, take a look at the game. No one seems to be too concerned about the zombie raids in their state, including the main character's mother, who went missing for several days while she sits in front of the fireplace and reads a book. <br /> <br /> Budget limits puts the film on the same fun. Perhaps they did not have permission to shoot, wherever they were, because during the BIG SCENE FOR A MOBILE MOTORCYCLE, the characters follow all the rules of the road. Zombies who have just killed about twenty people actually stop at the stop sign coming out of the parking lot. I don't even do that, but again, I'm not a zombie biker. The end of the film looks like they just ran out of money. It ends so suddenly that it leaves much to be desired ... Thinking, it all ends pretty soon. <br /> <br /> So if you want to have a good time with friends, look for this movie. This is a great unintended comedy.
