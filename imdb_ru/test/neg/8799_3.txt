Too many shots (almost a third of this 53-minute film) really slows it down. It is assumed that the plot is that John Weston (John Wayne) is sent by Marshal George Higgins (George Hayes) to participate in a fixed rodeo (say, Ro-DAY-oh), but character development and interaction are sacrificed. The relationship between the Bad Girl (usually Latin - even in the great "Duck Soup" [1933]) and the "heroine" Polly Ann Young, similar to Loretta Young (hey! This is her sister!), Could benefit from more screen time. The happy ending is too harsh - although this time John Wayne actually kisses the girl. <br /> <br /> The most interesting footage was a long rodeo parade with real Indians, squashes and Papuans. But when the best part of the film is the trick of the Mighty Yak Yakima Kanutta, which gives us the opportunity to jump from one horse to another and perform several different jumps on a horse, you understand that we have problems. As others have noted, the last battle with the villain is very bad. <br /> <br /> My copy of “Platinum Disc Corporation” contains an added, rare, ill-suited (pseudo-classical) stereo musical composition. it destroys the authenticity of the original film. (On the DVD box was "enhanced audio 5.1"). If you are going to modernize and color it, you should add a “western” sound with acoustic guitars, “klip-klopping”. hooves, harmonicas and harmonica. <br /> <br /> Finally, we have to say that this is one of the weakest actions of the Lone Star.
