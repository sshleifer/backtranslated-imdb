My take: usually a routine and a lazy direct attempt at a video from Disney. <br /> <br /> Disney must have fallen in love with the family movie tradition - the family dog. Many films are devoted to stories that focus exclusively on the best friend of man. Disney themselves made a handful. They also made a handful of those literally dogs. Add this to this bundle. <br /> <br /> I haven’t seen the original for a very long time, so I’m probably not the right person to judge whether this direct sequel is better. Anyone over the age of seven is not suitable for this either. Perhaps only the youngest of young people will want to see the LADY AND BUTTERFLY II: THE ADVENTURE OF SCUMPS, and even they will grow up and say that this is not the best family entertainment they have ever seen. I think, to be honest, I can say that it requires a lease, but it is not so much to say. <br /> <br /> This sequel largely raises the pieces left over from the original often-called classic, Lady and Vagabond now has the trash of cute Croker Spaniel puppies ... and one mischievous mongrel named Scamp, who broke away from the old block. Instead of the house boundaries, Samp wants to escape with other city dogs, unknown to his father's past as one of these mongrels on the streets. To capture the charm of the original, he adds the same love story of a poor dog / rich dog, on the contrary. Scamp falls in love with one of the landfills named Angel (and who will not be with that name and voice that sounds like Alyssa Milano?). Que Replay of the famous spaghetti scene! In addition to the “nice” factor, in this lazy video work there is nothing left for any audience. Stick to the original. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of 5.
