The other day I showed my boyfriend an excellent film “Stand By Me”, a film that I showed to many people, and they absolutely adored him, but for some strange reason he did not like it. He loaned me a movie called Backdraft and said that he showed it to many people, and they liked it, instead I hated this movie. I don’t think I hated the movie for so long, because this movie even has a rating of 6.6 above my understanding. I could not keep up with five million stories: Billy Baldwin becomes a fireman, random rivalry between brothers and sisters, random love stories, arson story, an investigator, a fire having a personality is his own. My problem is simply that this film cannot keep up with all these stories, they are not balanced enough to make the film interesting. I would prefer that this film tells you how to become a fireman or an investigator, and how he became one, or what he exactly does and why. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of a group of Chicago firemen, two brothers. Stephen "Bull" McCaffrey, the elder brother, is obsessed with a victory over the lights with which he is fighting. Brian, the younger brother, dropped out of fire academy school a few years ago, then embarked on a series of other unsuccessful careers before returning to becoming a firefighter. His older brother looks down on him, who expects him to fail in his newly chosen firefighter career. Donald "Shadow" Rimgale is an arson investigator who is dedicated to his profession. It is caused because many fires that have occurred have several similar links. Martin Swayzak - Elder City Council. He has obvious hopes of being elected mayor, but he had to make several budget cuts to the fire department. Many ordinary firefighters believe that the cuts inflicted on them endanger the lives of firefighters. However, Swayzak initially succeeded in portraying a firehouse that was bloated and ineffective after firefighters were repeatedly killed in a flame. <br /> <br /> I just could not get into this film, I do not know how someone else can, it was incredibly unrealistic and the firefighters portrayed everything wrong. I liked that they have all the action cliches in the book to fit this action. I just felt that a huge talent was being spent on such mediocre roles, Donald Sutherland, a great actor, but such a strange role that a lesser-known person could play who had talent at that time. I know that Ron has great quality, but I think he played such huge actors in small roles, which was a mistake for this film. I even had to joke when I watched this movie, commenting on what kind of doctor in the background was Kevin Spacey. The fire was so unrealistic, and the film was just like that, I did not get pleasure from it and honestly would not recommend it to people, I will stick to the recommendations in my relationship from now on. <br /> 2/10
