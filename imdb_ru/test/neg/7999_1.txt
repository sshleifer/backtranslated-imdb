Anyone claiming to be a classic ninja movie should have seen this movie until the mid-nineties, or was less than 10 years old before he saw it. Otherwise, I can not explain the name of this "classic film ninja." <br /> <br /> The fight scene in this film is unbearable. Instead of calling Franco Nero ninjas, they could instead hire an experienced martial arts master. In any case, acting is irrelevant in such a film. Nero's combat abilities are not some kind of street fighter in a bar. His punches are limping. <br /> <br /> Enough old militants with a good fighter. It is just a waste of time.
