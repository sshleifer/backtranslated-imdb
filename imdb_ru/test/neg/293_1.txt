Like a terrible cancer pouring from the sky, I wandered into this marathon on some movie channel that night. Being a fan of bad movies and actively participating in the purchase and viewing of this bad movie, I was intrigued by the idea of ​​a really awful looking action movie that came from modern times. After it passed, I found that my hands inexplicably turned towards me, clutching at anything within reach and striking my head and neck. Something ominous was in this tape ... uh ... where I was ... in any case, this place is among the most terribly bad fragments of the film that I encountered. William Forsyth can not play more than one character, and this character is always a joke. Even when he gets into a comic background and gets things to say and say they need to be funny (ala Deuce Bigalo), he laughs wrong. Erika Eleniak is in many ways similar, having starred in her share of horrible films and having done terrible work in all of them, she did not fail to help to make this film. The classic villain guy in the b-film Andrew Divoff does a respectable job, but hardly has any landscapes to chew on. Daniel Bernhardt, even a reliable reserve for militants, can not put something that borders on entertainment. As for the film's own merits, the plot is unconvincing, the script, as well as the action and movement of the plot, is boring and ... well, stupid, because of the lack of a better adjective (the lord knows that they didn’t think why should I do this?). <br /> <br /> Anyone who has seen enough films, has seen bad ones, and anyone who has seen enough bad ones can learn to appreciate them, but there is simply nothing here. have fun if you are not one of the worst people who tolerate a movie, and just feel so inclined to try your hand. But before you do this, take it from me, this film is not so terrible that you can enjoy it (unlike, say, some of the most ridiculous Italian zombie films). An action fan with a b-movie would be much better off checking out most of the other Bernhardt films or anything else that has ever been filmed on this subject. It seems that America is simply not a place for action, especially now. If you have a craving, watch some of the seas, films like “Heroic Duet” or a slightly less normal “Hackyder” (along with anything else in Keita Amemia’s stunning cannon) will provide much more fun and much better than your find elsewhere, especially here.
