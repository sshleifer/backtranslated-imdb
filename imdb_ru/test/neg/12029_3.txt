Detective Bert Williams has been on the trail of the infamous Po's murderer for almost three years. Berthaâ€™s daughter Chris Williams, the FBI's murder investigator, and his partner, Sean Michaels, take over. Bert reluctantly retires and retires. For the next seven months, Killer Po continues its frantic fury until Chris discovers that the killer uses Internet chat rooms to seduce his prey. She logs in as Annabel Lee and is quickly captured by Po's murderer. The time has come for Bert to find the sadist and free his daughter before it is too late. An amateur and highly insane horror movie with no expectation and a bit of an unpleasant smell. The game is terribly awful, the characters are painfully stupid, and the killer is not formidable. However, I have seen the worst indie horror movies .3 out of 10.
