If you like The Three Stooges, you will surely enjoy this 17-minute short walk. There were certainly some funny moments in it, but, like in all the works of Stoj, it revolves around their particular style of farce comedy, and I must admit that for some reason Stuogi simply never did it for me. Their farce always seemed evil, not funny, and, although it was obviously fake, their antics always seemed more painful than laughtery. In short, the farce revolves around trying to find Schempe (who is a music professor) as his wife, because he had just inherited half a million dollars under the condition that he would marry within 48 hours of reading the will. One of his students became interested, but as soon as it became known about the inheritance, a long list of potential brides unexpectedly appeared, and a rather good cat fight broke out between them. Stooges fans will enjoy. For me, it has all the elements that drive me crazy. 4/10
