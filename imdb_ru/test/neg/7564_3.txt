This film is really a low-budget production, but I will not talk about it anymore, since it has already been covered. I gave this film a low mark only for this story, but I met the director that night when I saw the film, and he gave me one more reason not to like the film. He asked me how I liked it, and I told him that it was not so easy to love. My main objection was the lack of grounds for the relationship between the two main characters, I was never convinced that they were close. I also told him that the scene where the main characters were presented as children becoming friends was too late in the film. <br /> <br /> He told me that the scenes with memories were not in the original script. That they were added because he felt that I did that the two main characters did not seem close. He went on to explain that these scenes were not filmed to his satisfaction, as they were without money. I agree that they did little for the film. <br /> <br /> Another fact about the film, which I did not know about, is the actor who led the main role, wrote the script based on his own experience. This is usually a bad move, as some authors do not take into account the viewer's emotional reaction. This story is so close to home that the author makes too many assumptions about the reaction of the public to his own tragedy. And the story is tragic. However, it did not work for me, since I never cared about any characters, especially the main roles. There were two evil men who made money in any way, regardless of who suffered. When Ms. Yang's character decides to abandon evil ways, it seems that she does this because she is ineffective, and not because she knows what she is doing wrong. If there is a message in the film, then I suspect that only the author knows about it.
