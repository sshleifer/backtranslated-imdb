This film made me want to bang my head against the wall. It is difficult to compare such bad things with anything, but some say that watching this movie is like bleeding from under your nails. And this comment comes from the writer's cousin. This film was so bad that it made Hulk (the second worst film in history) look like “The Departed” (one of the greatest films in cinema history). If you like boring family films with predictable storylines, then you will definitely like this movie. If you have a brain, then you definitely will not. When I shot this movie, I actually fell asleep while watching. The next day I finished from where I left off, and this was the worst decision in my life.
