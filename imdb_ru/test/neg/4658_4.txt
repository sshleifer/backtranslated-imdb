I have to say that I had low expectations from the film before watching it. Everyone around said that it was great, but I knew very well what they liked. They like the song Aerosmith, which is really gorgeous, they like amazing special effects that sounded very good, they like the comedy side of the film and, of course, many girls who love Affleck, who, in my opinion, is really a bad actor who did not try to be alone , failed, and now it is nothing. And all these things, as well as the reviews and ratings I read on the Internet, gave me a hint that the film would be a big disappointment, as I am a big fan of movies. Well, I was right, but at least I was ready. <br /> <br /> The film is really commercial. That was said, but I will say it again. We have over 100 million budget funds, we have an affair with Hollywood stars Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler, as well as with many other well-known actors who like the fact that they rarely agree to become actors in a commercial film unless their names are written in capital letters on the screen. Such as Billy Bob Thornton and Steve Buscemi, who are very respected actors who I also really like. They can play many characters in a variety of films. They could improvise, they could turn tasteless lines into funny jokes. In general, they could turn small films into really interesting, funny or dramatic movies that people love and will love forever. For example, Fargo in the case of Bushemi or Simple Plan - Thornton. And, frankly, I am very disappointed that they took part in Armageddon. Thornton plays a smart and sophisticated person involved in politics, if I remember correctly. Buscemi is one of the members of the deep column drilling team, which aims to save the world by destroying an asteroid that is going to disappear in the world. <br /> <br /> What I didn’t like - well, I think, I already understood. I pointed to the bad factors. The story is boring, unsophisticated and stupid. It is so obvious that the film depends on the effects and the dramatic ending that it is ridiculous. At least in films such as Deep Impact and Godzilla, there is something special that can be considered art. At least not so obvious that the film was made for financial purposes. In addition, bad performances of all the huge stars. The jokes are not funny, the lines are absurd, and sometimes they do not make sense at all. In fact, I recently read that on the stage Ben Affleck asked Bay whether it would be easier if they taught astronauts to drill than drillers to turn into astronauts, and Bay’s answer was simply "Shut up!" This is a really funny story that beautifully shows the despair of the creators. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I will explain why I give 4 films. Well, I like “I don't want to miss the thing,” and I was impressed with the special effects, which are obviously the only good thing in the film. The first scene is catchy. These are the only two good things that I liked about the film. Michael Bay is an average director, but The Rock and both Bad Boys were a hundred times better than Armageddon, which was, is and always will be one big bad movie.
