Bronson took the money and ran with this film; he must have a payment at home like me! This low-budget film, shot in Mexico, reminds me of several Italian vultures from the seas. I heard, I do not know if this is true, but companies make these films in foreign countries for tax purposes. I believe in it, because why else they have not shot this film, he definitely did not earn money. We had a lot of these nasty Canadians, because the government gave tax breaks to create the film industry. I wonder if it paid off in other countries, for example, in Canada. Anyway, back to the topic, this film is poorly made in all aspects, I think they grabbed Charles Bronson to sell this filth; this corpse at the end looks very fake. 3/10
