It begins in Pennsylvania in 1913. A group of children are killed in the explosion of a mine deliberately provoked by the mine owner. Transition to 2006. The recently widowed Karen (Laurie Heuring), her teenage daughter Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and the little girl Emma (Chloe Moretz) move to a remote house located next to this mine. What they do not know is that the ghosts of small children pursue the forests and kill everyone who is near them after dark. <br /> <br /> Slow and boring horror movie. The premise is obvious and has already been done to death. Also in the story there are huge gaps in logic. It was never clear why these children just kill someone or why they eat bodies afterwards (yes, this is shown). They are already dead - why do they need food? And why didn't they get the main villain in the story long before that? He was around the area. Why choose this time to attack him? Also, the characters are not at all cute. Sarah is facing the worst. It has several saving graces. The place is beautiful and at the same time terrible, some of the killings were VERY bloody and cruel, and the children themselves looked frightening, silently walking through the woods at night. But, in general, I was bored and I struggled not to fall asleep. You can skip this.
