The man was dragged from London street and taken to another country, where he was tortured as a terrorist suspect. A boring, trite film fucking bored me. More idea than movie. I was halfway through this 77-minute film when I realized that I had no idea who was on the screen. As if they had taken any other similar film, pulled out all the ideas and put them in one place without a real idea of ​​the character. Of course, it worked well with passion, but there is no emotional center, there is just a man of any kind, whom the filmmakers consider sufficient. Is not. And although the story presented as theoretically important as a warning, the film is too boring to convince anyone of this, especially if one has seen another, better films of this kind (for example, Reese Witherspoon)
