I was watching TV once with a friend, and we caught Goan Bananas for the last twenty minutes. Believe me when I say that was enough to get a good picture of the movie. The first scene I saw was a monkey, a kid, a fat guy, and a black guy like Dave Chappell who flew in a dusty field for thousands of years in the air. While everyone else was solemn on this journey, the monkey seemed to be on some kind of narcotic snack, where he kept shouting out something resembling an English word. Then they landed on a twenty-yard pier in Africa. After the heart was forgiven where the monkey was crying (hahahaha), the "villains" of the film appeared. They tore a full ass in their old Cadillac, when an evil monkey jumped from the Jordan from the jetty onto a boat that floated on a clean 40 yards and forced them to plunge their beautiful car into the Pacific. After watching this movie, I had a new goal in my life; find the dwarf who played the monkey and stab him in the eye with a fountain pen.
