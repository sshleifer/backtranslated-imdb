Many people stand in front of the house, and some women cry ... Men stand in tight groups and speak in a low voice ... a couple of guys come, and they discuss how sexy a daughter can look like today ... soon you will find out that someone died in the house ... The dead man's wife is worried about preparing food for so many people, her friend sitting next to her gives the idea of ​​easing things, preparing a simple roti-subji ... One son of the deceased speaks with someone a mobile phone, her daughter is busy with her makeup ... her mother suggests that she should wear sa lwar kameej, but the daughter is more interested in looking good when so many people visit their home and therefore prefer jeans and a t-shirt rather than Salwar Kameez ... another son asks her mother to finish all the kriyas, as well as indicates to her that he should not come early from the office ... Then the camera slowly focuses on the dead man ... the white cloth covering the face has slightly shifted because of the wind, exposing the face ... This is Anupam Kher ... suddenly the alarm is heard and he gets out of bed ... Is this his dream or a flash back? You won’t get an answer until the end of the movie ... Well, this is a comedy for director Dibakar Banerjee's !!!! !!!! You will find out later that this scene has nothing to do with the real film and, therefore, makes everything obvious, that what was described earlier was a dream. Is this a comedy about a movie? Well, he must belong to this category ... But in reality it is not so !!! There is nothing that can be remotely associated with a comedy in the film !!! Moreover, the director makes it clear that no one will get justice from the police !!! so everyone should cheat cheats !!!! or forget about justice !!!! The music of Bapi-Tutul & Dhruv Dhalla is fine ... Nothing special can be said about other sectors ... A bad script destroys everything ... even the performance of Anupam Kher does not make him at least a wizom ...
