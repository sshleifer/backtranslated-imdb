***** Spoiler ahead ***** <br /> <br /> I believe that you should not expect much from the one created for the television film, but this one was especially bad, the plot was a good idea, but poorly done the game was not particularly good. And the ending of the movie was just awful. The main character was completely normal throughout the entire film, and then suddenly, when we find out that she was a murderer, she just turns into a mentally ill psychopath. This is completely pitiful. <br /> <br /> There is only one reason to watch this film, Yasmine Blyth, although haven't we all seen her in a swimsuit before? Don't even watch this waste of time. If you want to watch a film about a beauty contest, then watch “Drop Dead Gorgeous”, it’s only an infinite number of times better.
