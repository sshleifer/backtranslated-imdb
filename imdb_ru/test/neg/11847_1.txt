This film is an unsuccessful, stillborn attempt to put together a few bad films and make something very bad. It doesn't even help, because there is too much “conspiracy”, and not enough stupid puppets and ridiculous blood. Seriously, the puppets are cute, and the guys in suits give me a good turn. The performances are, at best, C-class, and ubiquitous, with special requisites for a specialist who spoke some strange east coast / Venus dialect that was almost impossible to decipher. It’s not that you really care about what he says, because only curse words are different. Cinematically, this is not insulting, almost the same as what you would expect from inexpensive video by-products (like the script). The fact that New Concorde used footage from the films "Carnosaurus" is offensive and rather confusing. Shame on you, New Concord. Shame on you Carnozavr is one of my favorite horrible films, and they somehow screwed up and made it almost invisible. Watch the movie "Carnosaur" if you want to see the boring mess of dinosaur. <br /> <br /> I give him one star, because I really like the movies from which he steals, and also because the scales have no zero.
