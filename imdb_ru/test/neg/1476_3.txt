The concept of this film is unique, but its performance is less than special. When I came to the cinema and realized that there were only about 15 people in the crowd, I thought that I had made a mistake. However, the true mistake was revealed in shocking detail when the film ended, and I knew that I wasted two hours of my life. <br /> <br /> Without the cruel recordings of an old man and a stupidly funny friend, this film would get 1 out of ten rating. <br /> <br /> This film is special, special, because it is probably the worst film that has ever been presented to the general public. <br /> <br /> is also the question of whether you can call it a movie or just an advertisement for the probably disgusting “Northwest.” <br /> <br /> If you think about watching this movie for the plot, humor, filming, place, then do not. On the other hand, if you like to experience both ends of the film production spectrum, then just take a book, or a small game, or just some new item.
