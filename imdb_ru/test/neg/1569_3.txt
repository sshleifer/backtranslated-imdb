George and Mildred - the film lacks the talents of his television writer John Mortimer, which led to the fact that George's class war with the Furmil is alive and close to the end. <br /> <br /> The plot is cut from standard side fabric. - hired killer / wrong person - and has as much tension as he laughs. The producers had to pick up a piece of “Rising Damp” (also 1980), which was also bought on the big screen after the death of the television series, and most of the story was kept in a familiar setting. <br /> <br /> Yuta Joyce died in 1980, but she should not be remembered for this squeaky work, burdened by her illness. Mildred lacks the poignancy of his television incarnation; removal and wilting seems to be largely aimed at the lack of libido in Georges. George's St. George distrust is also lost in wider sets. This does not mean that they had a lot to shout about. The budget for this film looks pathetically small; The restaurant they go to is obviously a new half-starred house with Christmas lights adorning the front door. <br /> <br /> For fans of the 70s British comedy or those who just want to return to their old television companion from their youth, this film can add nothing to the experience, and they should just stick to the first four TV shows on DVD.
