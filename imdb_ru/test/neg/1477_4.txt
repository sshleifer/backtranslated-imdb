... And this is not a very good documentary, or the American MOVIE seems to have embarrassed some people, considering that this is a documentary film of deception ("Mockumentary"), and even some newspaper TV shows describe it as such. I will not laugh out loud at this because this documentary is easily confused with one big surprise. THIS IS A SPINAL MAP <br /> <br /> What seems to be confusing is that the documentary centers around budding filmmaker Marc Borchardt, who ... How can I say that? Rather, self-deception? Yes, but this is not necessarily bad, because if we didn’t have dreams, we would all live in caves, and the fact that Mark is obsessed with horror movies should not be taken as criticism as Sam Raimi (yes, that) , and Peter Jackson (yes, that) both started making horror comedies with low budgets, so again this is not a criticism. No, just Mark Borchardt (yes, that) - a parody of an American trailer <br /> <br /> Remember something about MA RY Ben Stiller throws up a cunning traveler (“Come to my office because you are fired”) ? This is what Mark and most of Jerry Springer’s guests are like, so it's easy to see why some people think this is not a real documentary. This is also not a very good documentary, as Mark and Co. gives me goosebumps. Did you know that someone thought Mark would grow into a serial killer? Does anyone else think there is enough time for this?
