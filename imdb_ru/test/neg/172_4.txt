As noted in other comments here, camera work is ridiculously bad. I am tempted to say that the director of photography is 7 years old, but it will mean 7 years. <br /> <br /> Okay, what about the item? You know, Mondovino, I was looking for information about the state of the wine industry all over the world. The film tells about a very narrow look at one intrigue in this world: the struggle between Mondavi and the French and Italian wineries that they would like to buy. There is no enlightening narrative that would put the whole thing in context, so we stayed in the director selection process and interviews with various characters in this little psychodrama. There is no shortage of despicable characters or even despicable dogs in sight. However, there is a lack of impartiality. <br /> <br /> Is the director a Marxist? I was wondering, trying to keep some sort of focus when the camera was sinking, turning, and growing in a chaotic bloom. Small producer in France: good. A huge producer in the USA: very, very bad. Forget about hundreds of small wineries in North America, Australia and South America. Here you can kill a dead horse for more than two hours. <br /> <br /> To learn more about this intrigue, it is better to read about it somewhere else. In this case, you can taste your favorite wine without feeling sick. <br /> <br /> I offer a new award in Cannes for the best diatribe in America.
