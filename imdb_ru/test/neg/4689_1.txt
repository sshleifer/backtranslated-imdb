What a terrible movie it was! I did it in about 50 minutes and started skipping chapters to the end. The plot is nothing special, and the dialogue from the film deviates so much from the main story that your head will explode with rage. Many useless minutes were wasted just listening to the characters chatting about something unrelated to the plot, AND / OR something that could be said in a shorter time. The camera work is wobbly and grainy. It seemed that Mr. Milligan needed to remove his finger from the zoom button! I also noticed that in some moments of this film Andy had convulsions and he was uncontrollably shaking the camera. The splice between the scenes was nervous and not flowing. The scenes of the killings were not something special - incredibly and ridiculously false. Hardly blood, as the name implies. This film lasts about 1 hour and 20 minutes, and the murder scenes take about 1 minute TOTAL of the entire film - if so. What a pathetic trash was this movie. Andy Milligan is in fact probably one of the worst directors who has plagued humanity with his talentless directing and camera work. I can usually make horror horror movies and laugh at it later. Bloodthirsty batchers, however, I can not. I'm just angry, I wasted half an hour of my life watching this (which I wouldnâ€™t do to get it back). Take my suggestion and DO NOT watch this movie unless you plan to fall asleep. FEARFULLY.
