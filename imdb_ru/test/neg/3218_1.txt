What does all these ethnic criminal groups have to do with copying films related to the Italian mafia? We all know the Godfather, like Don Vito Corleone, now we have this Mexican, which is just a pouring copy. I cannot understand why other ethnic groups should imitate and imitate Italian gangsters, but this makes them look stupid. Looks like they are Italians. I would prefer the Mexicans to speak there with their own ideas and would like to see their culture and how they do it, instead of copying ideas from the Godfather trilogy. In addition, the film was disappointing, to see Mexicans playing and trying to be Italians is not mine. After watching, I'm going to watch “The Real” Godfather so that this film can be erased from my memory.
