After about 5 minutes of the movie, you get into this cruel cool novel about cats and mice between the two main characters, and this only gets worse. The biggest problem is the characters and their incredibility. This is what 50-year-old producers and Hollywood scriptwriters believe that life in stone looks like itâ€™s as if they donated a little pot to Friends. Soft, boring, annoying and completely unreal. I despise this movie.
