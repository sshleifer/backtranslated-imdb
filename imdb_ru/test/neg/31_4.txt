It was painful to watch this movie, it really is so ... I wanted him to like me, even entering. Filmed clearly for very little money, I looked past and told myself to appreciate the inspiration. Unfortunately, although I appreciated the film at this level, the acting and editing was terrible, and the last 25-30 minutes was a serious problem. 95-minute film should not pull. The ratings for this are good, but I'm afraid that friends and family could have a voice in it. What happened to these transitions? Dear Sir, have you just purchased your first copy of Adobe Premiere and made it your main goal to use all the stupid transitions that come with this stupid program? Anyway ... some better actors, a little more passion, and a bit more attractive editing, and it makes a decent film.
