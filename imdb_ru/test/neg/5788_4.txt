Someone noticed that Charlie Sheenâ€™s character should be tried for doing everything he wanted. You may be right, but this is really what SEAL is. I worked for a few months on the SEAL team in Norfolk, Va. In fact, I must say that they used our ship to turn around Europe for several months. I was a mail clerk on board, and every day these guys tried to get their mail. Since only one person could receive mail every day, we issued one pass to one person. Every day another PRINT appeared, pretending to be someone else. Well, after the third time, I said no to them, until I had proof of who they are. They went nuts! I thought they would punch my cage, shut my mouth and steal mail. Fortunately, on my side was not only the president (fleet), but also the federal government (US post). This was the only time I saw that the cats no longer had what they wanted. They were allowed unrestricted access to the shore, where we had to return to the ship at a certain time. They killed and tortured a woman in France, and two fur seals were detained on the ship for 1 week, while the sailor was caught stealing a bottle of wine from a French wine shop, and he received a military court. Is it any wonder why the retention rate of SEAL exceeds 85%? Like a SEAL, you are a god. Thus, this film rather accurately shows how PRINT works and how it thinks ... unfortunately, it is so incredible to normal people that it seems fake.
