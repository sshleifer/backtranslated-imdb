How does a film become a biblical epic? Just quoting a couple of Scriptures and using some of the Bible names for your characters? The only thing that was biblical in this epic is the names of the characters. Oh, I almost forgot that the 3 kingdoms, Israel, Egypt and Sheba were also used. Where did King Widor get the rest of his story? This is definitely not from the Bible. It was complete nonsense. If you want to read about the reign of Solomon as King in Israel, read 1 Samuel 1-11 and 2 Chronicles 1-9. You will even meet Adonius in 1 Samuel 1 and 2. The Queen of Sheba (which does not appear until King Solomon is king for about 20 years or so, which, however, long after Adonius and Joab had dead) can be found in 1 Samuel 10 and 2 Chronicles 9. The first thing Solomon does is get close to Faroah by taking his daughter. <br /> <br /> Yes, King Solomon was indeed associated with the worship of false gods â€” that is why after his death the Kingdom split, and the Temple was not destroyed by lightning. In addition, I think that Solomon was too busy marrying and giving temples to the false gods of his 700 wives and striving for his 300 concubines to fight Egypt, not to mention the dead brother. <br /> <br /> As I said this film was complete nonsense. If you are not going to use the story in the Bible, then call it something else. It could just as easily be called "Romeo and Juliet" or "Sid and Nancy". <br /> <br />
