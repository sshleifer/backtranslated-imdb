I can't believe I bought this movie on DVD. I don’t even remember it being shown on TV last year. Why in the world could they not make a real sequel to one of the best Christmas movies? Hell and Randy Quaid seem to be taking the same drugs as Jerry Lewis. I did not know about this film until I bought it tonight and did not think that I would check it on IMDb and see how it is evaluated. Boy, I made a mistake. If you are reading this review, be careful, stay away from it and just stick to the first Christmas holidays. Well, at least I didn't pay more than 10 bucks for that. Maybe I can exchange it and return half of this to Tower Records. Then maybe not. PS I haven’t watched it yet, my DVD player is out of order today, watching another great movie, The Chronicles of Riddick (Directed Without Stars), damn it.
