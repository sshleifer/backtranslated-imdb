One of my favorite "stray" actors, C. Tom Howell, is filmed in this cool remake of WOTW. He runs around a lot, while the CGI-generated machine that looks like a spider kills everyone. The budget for this was obviously quite low. It was also one of the works of The Asylum. Have you seen any of this? Clap! I'm not sure why anyone would have done it, while the high-budget version of Spielberg was killing them at the box office. And if to tell the truth, none of the versions is so hot. The George Pal version of the 1950s remains the best presentation of the novel by HG Wells, primitive special effects and the rest. Perhaps because Gene Barry was much more convincing in leaders than Howell or Tom Cruise.
