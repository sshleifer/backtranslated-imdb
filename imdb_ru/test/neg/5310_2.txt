This film, albeit with minor flaws, was completely interesting. About half an hour later in Be Cool, I started having memories of a Hollywood murder. But guess what? It's worse. Even the dance number is bad. I like most of the actors in this film, so I feel bad because I write a negative review about him, but I feel obliged. Rock, Andre 3000 and Vince Vaughn were in the comedy. No one else seems to have decided which movie genre they are shooting. I feel bad for Travolta, because he brought the same Chile-Palmer from Get Shorty to this film. He was completely consistent in the role, but this film is so different from the original that the character sticks out like a sore thumb. I was going to give this film 4/10, because I really like the actors, but the film talks about a certain song that is so pure that I could not believe that the performers really said that. If you want to go to the cinema this weekend, there still must be some Oscars. It would be a much better way to spend time.
