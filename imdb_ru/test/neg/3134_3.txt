Bardem is great. The actresses are great. But Amenabar should not have done so. It is normal that he defends his position on euthanasia, an extremely sensitive issue. But in doing so in this way, he loses his point of view: the film is false, offensive to the intellect, full of tricks, and even sometimes extremely boring. Some scenes are promotional material, not a film. Women are incredibly attracted to this sick mind by a man who wants to make someone kill him without understanding the consequences of this. It seems that he does not care about anyone and thanks them for their care, love and attention. I think that Amenabar could have made people think about this problem differently, but I think that he decided not to. He could have made his point of view more powerful, exposing the other side of the coin without mocking her.
