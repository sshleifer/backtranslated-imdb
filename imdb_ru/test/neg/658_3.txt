Compared with the recent film “HOSTEL”, which I was very reminded of this film, I would say that See No Evil is a little better, but not much. A very complex plot involves several offenders who are sent to clean up a worn hotel for a shorter prison sentence. Children soon end up being killed by an awkward religious psychopath who clears them of their sins (I guess). The only thing I was most afraid of before I saw it was that the WWE wrestler Kane was looking at him. He ended up doing a decent job, considering that in the film he had only two lines of one word. There are a couple of pretty creepy moments, mostly related to squeezing eyes, and a rather memorable scene in which a girl is squeezed in her throat with a mobile phone - probably the most effective death in the film. <br /> <br /> I can not say that this film really shows us something new and is definitely far from great. Can't recommend it.
