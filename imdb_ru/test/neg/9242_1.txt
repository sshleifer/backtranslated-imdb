I watched this film, and all I can say is ... I am not a student of the film, and I am not some clever intellect who is trying to find a deeper meaning in everything that I do not understand. However, if I did this with this film, my thoughts would be ... <br /> <br /> Yes! He's on drugs and I can imagine it now ... he stumbled one night and sat around with his buddies, laughing and saying something like: hey ... wouldn't it be funny if nuns really could fly? How, if someone just drops out of a plane and falls free for a while, bounces off the ground, gets up and leaves? * giggles * or buckwheat porridge gave dad a bath? My God, I break my head, just thinking about it! Dude! We have to make a movie about it! And then he tells his friend how he laughs ... Oh, and wouldn't it be fun if people loved it and called me a genius for it? For me, this is what happens when a guy takes too much drugs, writes a script and makes a film. Do I have to do LSD to understand what this guy thinks, so that I can laugh too? Because I have to tell you, I did not laugh. I yawned and checked the time. <br /> <br /> I think that everyone who struggles to find a deeper meaning is hysterical. I never heard of this director until I came to read reviews, which I did because I was angry that I had lost the last 2 hours or how long it lasted (it felt like 12 hours of my life), and I can anyway, ever get back ... I read that this guy is a heroine, and he wanted to die for art ?? what the heck is that? So my point of view seems to be proven. This guy is not all there, he is an addict, and his film is proof of that ... So please stop trying to find a deeper meaning for this. If someone really wants to understand everything in this film, throw a little LSD, sit back and relax, then it really can make sense. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of the time when I watched “The Last Days” by Gus Van Santa, another film I’m crazy about watching. I can't help but wonder what the ratings for this film would be if the same people who watched this film watched it. It seems that if the director of the film is completely out of his taste, or if it is a French film with sex and subtitles, or if it is a cartoon, he will receive excellent reviews, hands down, everything else is boring and has already been done. BLA, bring boring, please!
