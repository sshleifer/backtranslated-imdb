It was a crappy movie with terrible action, based on sublimated male fantasies. It is a pity that it was founded in Texas, otherwise an excellent state. I would not recommend this film to anyone and would like it to never come to my mind, as I am now so irritated that I wasted my brain cells, even paying the slightest attention to it.
