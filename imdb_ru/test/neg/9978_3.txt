I rated this movie at 3, and it was generous. The landscape is heavy and tasteless, for the most part acting is terrible. I think Peter O'Toole did a good job (Tiberius), but he must have been upset when he saw the final version of the film. John Gilgud, no matter how short he appeared in the film, still played the role of Hamlet. The hard core parts of pornography were neither erotic, nor did they do a lot for the rest of the story. Well, Malcolm McDowell had a good butt, and the guy who played Macro was handsome. The guy who played Claudius was more like the traditional images of Nero and, of course, not at odds with Robert Graves' picture of Claudia. The climatic (?) Murder of Caligula, the wife and child is inaccurate in the sense that it shows that he lay on the stairs after his death when he was actually killed in an underpass on Palate Hill that passed along the front of Domus Flaviana which still exists today. In this film, there are places where almost everyone distracts my attention - merciful distractions. If you want a story, read Suetonius or Tacitus, if you want pornography and sadism, watch Passolini in Salo, but by all means keep away from this film.
