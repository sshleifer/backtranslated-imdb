Well, it's terrible, and I mean terrible, easy to make out this movie. Come on, what do you expect from the title, resumes and starring actors such as Carol Gilley, Ralph Baker Jr., Dorothy Davis, Bill Thurman and, my personal favorite, Roger Ready. Yes, star B John Agar is here as sheriff to rid the Texas landscape of the ape-like monkey from NASA's failed experiment. The film has terrible acts, terrible scenery, terrible special effects and terrible lighting. I really can't find a lot of good things to say about it, except for bad movies, you could have done a lot worse if you found something terrible to survive. It is tolerably short and has many moments of unintended humor. Missed remarks, fake jokes, horror behind the scenes, an incredibly meaningless account, and, of course, John Agar, who is struggling to become the main one in a film with a serious performance in the midst of this nastiness. The beginning is the hardest part to survive, as it seems that these two teenagers need eternity in order to get an opportunity to travel through the woods along Texas country roads, where the great monkey soon smells of its revenge in its own horrible way ... Yes ! Night fear! Bah!
