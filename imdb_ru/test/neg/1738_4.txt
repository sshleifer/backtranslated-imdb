This film began as a fairly decent film, but it never began, but became predictable and even a bit silly. Some scenes were pretty well made, the photos and frames used in combination with sounds and the like made it more interesting to watch, but since the story was rather slow, she could not keep the interest. And more importantly, it's not at all scary! It should be a horror movie, but there was not a single scene that was scary or even exciting. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the actors were not that good either, no bright characters. You will remember for the rest of your days. <br /> <br /> In general, you can watch a movie, but it doesnâ€™t add anything, and as soon as you finish watching it, it will not last long until it is forgotten. <br /> <br /> The reason I looked at it was that I read a review and gave it the highest marks, but I disagree, and I would rate it 4 out of 10 instead. If you still want some Japanese horror, I would suggest you watch Ju-On instead! <br /> <br />
