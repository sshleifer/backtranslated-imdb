Favorite tale of the hero "Benji" ("Higgins" dog), which is a lot of different things for many different people. On his busy day, Benji takes breakfast at the home of two young children, talks to a law officer, pursues an old cat and reminds the aging cafe owner to start a special day. Helping some, entertaining others, he is a companion for everyone. <br /> <br /> Problems arise when his young friends are kidnapped and taken to an abandoned mansion, which he calls home. From this point on, we know that only Benji can save the day. <br /> <br /> The plot is a routine from writer / producer / director Joe Camp, and he usually makes slow motion effects too often. However, it will be difficult for the audience to confront a cute little puppy, and children of all ages will definitely adore him. Cast has never been anything but the background "Benji." <br /> <br /> Not what you would call inspirational, but a fun family fare. Oscar nominee for “I Feel the Love” by Benji. <br /> <br /> Saturday July 13, 1996 - Video
