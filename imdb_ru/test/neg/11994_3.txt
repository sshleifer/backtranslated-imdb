Glenn Ford, a New York boy who saves his money, thumbs, and vagrants on the way to the Arizona ranch he bought, where he hopes to find HEAVEN WITH A REVERSED WIRE. The script and story of Dalton Trumbo, filmed by the extraordinary villain Ricardo Cortes and often filmed by Glenn Ford and the restless Richard Conte, simply should not be so damn cute. Although the system, which is usually considered as mean policemen, railway bulls and real estate fraudsters, is as terrible as you could expect from left Mr Trumbo, every proletarian is so cute, sweet and salt the earth that feels nauseous the cute blonde who is an illegal refugee from Spain Franco is annoyed both by the scenarios and by the action. <br /> <br /> So why watch? Richard Conte, in his first role, already has his person and a pretty good role. And there are moments from the left camp of the 30s that are pretty amazing. (Did Dalton really have to play the main role in the film “Russian Worker”? All that was missing was a portrait of shining Joe Stalin!) Besides, this is the first lead role of Glenn Ford (although his performance is not very good). <br /> <br /> Why not see? In essence, the film offers a hollow vision, is tied to a political point of view that is risky, and the two roles have made films much better. In addition, the strengths of Dalton Trumbo as a screenwriter are nowhere apparent. Instead, we get a film that the Coen Brothers Barton Fink could write in an instant (and avoid this infernal duel with the writer block).
