Being in the post-apocalyptic future, the new Highlander is a small effeminate moron named Quentin MacLeod, whom the new Ramirez teaches, while his younger sister pursues their desire to prevent the evil immortal master. To do this, Quentin must master all the knowledge of other immortals before this sovereign, Corton, does this. <br /> <br /> In short, this is pure nonsense, very similar to the continuation of Highlander. Quentin is a rather stupid character, constantly whining, moaning and whining in the spirit of “woe is me, because I am a reluctant hero,” and he never realizes that he is immortal and cannot be killed, even if not easily. It would have been better for Ramirez to leave him and prevent Corton himself.
