My Take: a routine political thriller with mediocre action scenes and predictable turns. <br /> <br /> A rarely occurring political thriller that gave a very bad box office response, I only now managed to catch the “SHADOW OF CONTRIBUTION” on TV, and although I was glad that I was satisfied with my curiosity to see this rare film, I was not completely felt that this film was special. Taking into account the box office reaction, SHADOW CONSPIRACY is not as bad as the critics, and the public reacted to this, but still not very well from the very beginning, and everything, from scenario to direction, is quite predictable. Charlie Sheen plays a presidential aide who is caught by hired killers and harassment (many of them) when he discovers a deadly conspiracy that is hiding among the White House staff. After the murder of Professor Shin helps with the help of former reporter Flame Amanda Givens (Linda Hamilton) to uncover the traitor and uncover the plot of the title. <br /> <br /> But this script, written by Adi Hasak and Rick Gibbs, is pedestrian along the way, not much different from the other thrillers of the White House conspiracy, as in “Absolute Power” and “Murder in 1600”. Some significant talents (Donald Sutherland Ben Gazzara and Stephen Lang) try their best in the routine scenario, but rarely save him from the predictability of the scenario. Not to mention the ridiculous scene in which a toy helicopter is involved, which seems too stupid and inappropriate in this “serious” political thriller. Shadow Conspiracy has its moments, I'm sure some of them are very undervalued (directed by George Pan Kosmatos takes several decent chase scenes), but none of them raise this routine thriller, which has no particular benefits or surprises. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of 5.
