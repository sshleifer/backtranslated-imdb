I once heard this film described as "you will love it or you will hate it." Reading some other reviews and ratings, I would venture to say that this is true. I put myself in a hated crowd. I have seen some really bad movies, boring movies, and even low-budget movies. This film is bad in all three directions. <br /> <br /> Exeter of this island of the Earth (Jeff Morrow) returns to his roots of a science fiction film under the name of Dr. Les (without a prosthetic giant head). The doctor and his assistant Arnie (George O'Hanlon - he is the voice of George Jetson), along with the assistant Les Vera, are watching the meteorite. This is the essence of the cast and it's almost a double date. Lesia has Faith, and Arnie has “Suzy” (Synchro-unifying synometric integrative equitensor is a computer). Let's just say that the relationship between George and his robotic maid, Rosie (and his relationship with Suzy) is more plausible than the cold, mollusk-like feelings that Vera feels towards the Forest (and vice versa). However, all their interests are not an ordinary meteor. This is really an alien device for energy storage in the Art Nouveau / Art Deco style, which moves like a three-legged dog. There is also a small alien "energy" that controls Dr. Hubbel (he is the main scientist). Alien clearly and from the very beginning, angry and angry. Is this the science we are distributing? No wonder Explorers aliens were afraid of us. From watching some of these films, we shoot first. There is no need for questions after this. <br /> <br /> The whole film is synonymous with watching really boring scientific experiments, such as boiling eggs or adding food coloring to celery. It is not a fact that it is a low-cost sci-fi film or it is a bit silly and outdated. It is really very boring. The whole film is about trying to understand what is happening. That's all. Most of the things we learn about what is happening are monologues and dictation. Now add a cheesy dialogue, a cardboard game and cheap sets, and you have ideas for Ed Wood's clone (by the way, Ed also made some really boring movies - please avoid Orgy of the Dead). Dialogue ... oh, dialogue. Jams such as: <br /> <br /> "... from 2 miles from the ocean? <br /> <br /> Why not! He went through a billion miles in space." <br /> <br /> or <br /> <br /> “Do you think you can respect a husband who is probably always interested in science?” <br /> <br /> This film is obviously trying to attract the Forbidden Planet, this Island Land, the Magnetic Monster, or in the same light as the Outer Limits, the Twilight Zone. Namely, a low-cost science fiction film (or a television episode) that is convincing enough to overcome technical difficulties and strange situations. In fact, these films are enjoyable at some level (history, primary meaning, or simply the comic nature of the dialogue or situations). This movie is nothing of this. This is just 90 minutes of boredom. I could not even enjoy it at the level of Ed Wood. I definitely recommend skipping this and watching one of the films I mentioned above. It's so bad that if I was called Dr. Forrester, I would never have thought to show this film to anyone ... except Frank, maybe.
