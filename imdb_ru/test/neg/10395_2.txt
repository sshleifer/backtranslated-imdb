I just rented an exorcism at Blackwater Valley because the cover and photos looked awful, and I usually don’t watch movies that automatically go on DVD, but it looked so interesting and scary! I was very in the mood for a good scary movie, and for me obsession is one of the scariest things to watch or study. Just look at the "Exorcist" or "Exorcism" Emily Rose, both amazing films that made breakthroughs not only horror, but also history. <br /> <br /> “Exorcism in Blackwater Valley” talks about the girl Isabel, “Go-Go” is automatically obsessed, so we cannot even tell what kind of person she was to begin with. But the former beater of his wife was a priest in the case of a gardener ...? I know, I know. Then they tell a few other stories about the priest and Isabella's sister, and the priest hits her sister and contacts Isabel? I'm not sure, then we fall into the story of Isabelle's father and his doubts about his wife's loyalty. <br /> <br /> I mean that the story just goes in too many directions and was not well developed at all. Not to mention that exorcism did not seem at all genuine, but rather just scared your pants with a film that I didn’t like at all, because I couldn’t take it seriously. Whoever sent and wrote it clearly, had no idea where to go and how to properly direct the story, so I would not recommend it. <br /> <br /> 2/10
