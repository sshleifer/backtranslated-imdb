I had to rent a couple of films for my cousin for the New Year, and she chose the Swan Princess: The Mystery of the Enchanted Kingdom and The Little Mermaid 2, and we just watched both films while she was sleeping, I thought I could get a couple of comments. :) Although this is a very funny cartoon, in fact, everything was not so bad. You have to admit that for children, these stories are new to them, and this can be a great introduction to these stories for them. <br /> <br /> Odette finds out that Derek secretly keeps Rosto's magical secrets and she tells Derek to immediately destroy them, but being a guy, he usually does not do this and tells her that no one can achieve magic without his help. When a witch named Zelda pulls them out, she discovers that Derek has ripped off the last words of the spell she wants to use to destroy everything, and kidnaps Odette to get this information. <br /> <br /> Swan Princess: The mystery of the Enchanted Kingdom is stupid and predictable, but for children I would honestly say that it is successful. Very rarely do we have these clean-cut cartoons, so I'm going to weaken the movie a little. It was just strange to see how all the voices suddenly change, I grew up with the first one, so I think it just stuck in my head. <br /> <br /> 4/10
