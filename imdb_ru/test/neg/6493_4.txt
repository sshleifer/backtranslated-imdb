This is a very mediocre film about Jackie Chan, and one of his worst James Glikenhaus films ruined him! All the characters are decent, I think, but the story is that, but Jackie Chan is still amazing in this, even if he looks bored. Jackie and Danny Aiello had no chemistry, and it was very boring many times, but the final was above average, and he managed to be quite interesting, and he had some good tricks! I have not seen the Hong Kong version yet, but I am sure that it is better than this fool, plus the turn is very predictable! It’s really lifeless and soft, and I don’t blame Jackie for not looking happy about it, and if he hadn’t starred in it, it would be unbearable and completely unattractive. The opening should be memorable, but I have never seen anything like this before and did not do it better, and I thought that the whole film was rather lazy and could have become amazing if Jackie was controlling it, plus I really didn’t support any of the characters . This is a very mediocre film about Jackie Chan, and one of his worst James Glikenhaus films ruined it! The direction is terrible! James Glikenhaus does an awful job here, with extremely soft camera work, poor viewing angles and keeping the film boring for the most part everywhere. Acting so-so. Jackie Chan is AMAZING as always, however he is not his usual energetic personality, and he looks bored and Ps * ed throughout the film, had no chemistry with Danny Aiello, and I really don’t blame him either! (Jackie Rules !!!!!). Danny Aiello is fine, like Jackie's partner, but his character is a bit of an ass, and he didn't have chemistry with Jackie, he is fine, I think. Roy Chao is decent, as the main villain, but only went through the movement and was not so formidable, although he is still damn cool. The rest of the cast are on average at best. In general, not worth your time or money. * 1/2 of 5
