If you watched Pulp Fiction, do not watch this movie. This movie is NOT funny. This is the worst parody movie. This is a failed parody movie attempt. <br /> <br /> The cast is bad. The film is bad. This is one of the worst shots ever. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend plump fiction. I prefer the original Pulp Fiction by the great Quentin Tarantino. This is one of the worst parody films ever made. <br /> <br /> Plump Fiction is not a very good movie. It's not funny. It is so stupid and vulgar.
