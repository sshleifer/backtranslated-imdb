Can someone please help me, I missed the last moments of watching and I don’t want to pay money to see the whole movie again. I got to the place where they are in the train, and she says: “What about this drink now?” and smiles. what happens after that? is there a dialogue or action? doesn't it really end there? I was a little bored in the film, and I continued to hope that he would get better. I love Kristen Scott Thomas, does anyone remember the British TV series, in which she starred about some nuns? I want to know the name. Sean Penn was great, Madonna ate your heart! the rest of the film is actually a bit predictable, it was a “movie star”. the finale took me by surprise, I really thought she burned her boats ... if you are a fan of a star, you should see.
