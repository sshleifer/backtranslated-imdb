This movie was terrible. Too much attention was paid to Eddie, Clark Griswald's son-in-law. Eddie works much better when good tips change, such as Christmas Holidays and Vacations. <br /> <br /> I really donâ€™t understand how a film like this would get a thumbs up. Don't get me wrong, I like Randy Quaid, but I felt that this film was completely unsuitable for him and for the character as a whole. This film leaves much to be desired and really needed famous actors.
