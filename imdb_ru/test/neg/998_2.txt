Starting with a tear poem and images of American missiles, starving children and disfigured Palestinians, I quickly realized that this would not be an objective documentary. The 5 young people convicted after the riots in Gothenburg give a very confusing explanation of why they had to destroy the city center, and then (oh God) actually pay for what they did. I continued to observe, and many questions were raised, was the trial conducted correctly, and did the police have the right to do what they did? Many questions were asked ... and then they fell. No interviews with judges or review of documents about the trial ... nothing. <br /> <br /> In short: nothing new from what every Swede has seen on TV a hundred times is just bad propaganda.
