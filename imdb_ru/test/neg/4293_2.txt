I saw it as a child before being pulled out of rotation, and even then he left an unpleasant taste in his mouth. There were some well-crafted jokes, but the creation of farce villains from American citizens who were interned in the camps, strictly because of their race, was surprisingly tasteless. <br /> <br /> Mo himself might want to bury it. He was a liberal guy. In his autobiography, he talked about visiting the city in the isolated south, where he saw a black man coming off the sidewalk to avoid passing too close. Mo went outside to show that this was not a problem, and the man returned to the side of the road. Then again. Finally, the man nervously told Moe that if Moe did not stop trying to share the sidewalk with him, he could lynch them both. <br /> <br /> One more thing: there are ostrich blasted eggs, but there are no oxen in the film, so in fact the name should be (if someone doesnâ€™t care) "The yolk is on me."
