This one is not even lively enough to be fun. Something is wrong, snatching people (off-screen) after a spacecraft crash (off-screen), while government officials are investigating (off-screen), and bad actors say stupid lines (on the screen), including a guy who looks like Jim Carrey with a hangover. "Monster", when it is finally shown, looks like an additional one from "Robot Monster", but in any case it is missing. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it is quite short. Skip this if you don't want to be bored out of your skull with it.
