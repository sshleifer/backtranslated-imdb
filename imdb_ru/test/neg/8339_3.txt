When I saw this film, all I could think was: what a disaster! No, I'm not talking about the volcano, but about the film itself. I've seen a lot of movies, but this is definitely one of the worst ever. I do not care if the volcanic eruption is possible under the center of the city of Los Angeles or not. It may not be so, but even this could be a good film ... but it is not, and I will explain to you why. <br /> <br /> I don’t know how many lava flows are from an ordinary volcano, but I know for sure that the volcano in this film makes Vesuvius, Etna and Mount Pinatubo together look like a small barbecue. I don't think there ever was so much lava flowing from a volcano that we see in this film. I'm sure the director had a lot of money to spend on his film, but I really wonder why he spent everything on special effects, and not on the script and the actors. I'm not saying that he should have hired the best actors, but this is really the opposite of what I would call a good acting game. Their performances are so incredibly bad that it makes the whole movie worse. <br /> <br /> And what's wrong with the script, you probably ask yourself. Well, can you tell me who comes up with the idea of ​​people standing a few yards or even a few feet from the lava, without being burned or having to hide behind the wastelands? Or do people drown in the ground when the lava flow does not even reach two feet in height? <br /> <br /> I’m sure that I wouldn’t be proud if I wrote such a script, but obviously there are writers in Hollywood who don’t care about the credibility if they pay good money! VERY good money !!! <br /> <br /> When you watch a movie, you will probably agree with me that this is one of the worst Hollywood films about a disaster that costs no more than 3/10.
