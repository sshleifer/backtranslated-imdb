Seagal was far from the goal with this film. I am a fan of him and I expect cool battle scenes and sharp plots, but in this film there was nothing like that, instead there were injections and trashy music. Even if you are a fan of him, I strongly recommend that you stay away from this film and watch it under siege or even on a deadly land.
