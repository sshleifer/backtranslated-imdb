I am almost embarrassed to admit that I have seen CALIGULA twice. Production problems are almost too numerous to mention. The scenario does not meet the standards (it is easy to understand why Vidal tried to refuse it). The direction is worse. Most of the film consists of long shots among the section with close-ups interspersed with cuts of mostly non-erotic porn (more common apparently in the "uncut" version). Cinematography, in particular, is not quite high-quality, which gives the whole performance a cheap blurry look that undermines some of the carefully designed scenery. The film was supposed to look much better. The overall concept of nominally casting in what could easily become an X-rated film (Guccione called it “paganism”) is depleted after the first hour after Peter O'Toole and John Gilgud leave. Bob Guccione obviously spent a lot of money on it, but it all seems like a big waste. If you want a much better understanding of the Roman Empire in the 1st century BBC production clock in I, Claudius middle 79 instead ... and if you want porn, jeeze-Louise, look somewhere else.
