This film is dated in many ways, it is sensational. You can laugh at it or shake your fists in rage. <br /> <br /> This film tells about the many problems of American history, but about the typical paternalism of white men, Christians, Americans: the main character is one of those that I can do it all, and you should love me for this kind boyfriend He is so pompous and cannot be taken seriously. What a terrible creature! His wife is a weak little woman for the first part of the film and is still very deplorable, but stronger in character at the end. It is a pity that she still forgives his audacious acts after he left her the second time. Just sad that the character has not changed at all. Although in the end she must portray a strong and independent woman, she is consumed with anxiety about her husband, who is looking for adventure. So, 2 out of 10 points from feminists among us (and this is only for good intentions ...)! The problem of the suppression of the Indians is solved quite well, but there is also the fact that it is necessary to tell stories again. And the fact that all African-American characters are typical stereotypes makes the film even more hypocritical. I was so furious most of the time! So, one remark (for the attempt) from the civil rights movement. <br /> <br /> I know that the film was shot at another time. I love old movies, and I have a lot of patience with some of these outdated points of view. But it was just disgusting! <br /> <br /> What saves this film is the role without the main character. Mr. Dixâ€™s actions are too smug. Maybe that's why his character is so unpleasant ... I liked the performance of Mrs. Dunn, although her character sometimes infuriated me. <br /> <br /> But I must say that the famous land rush scene was incredibly made. And the way the Oklahoma settlement is depicted made the film worthwhile. It is amazing how civilization rose from the mud and dust of the 19th century. And I do not understand the problem that some have on this church scene. I thought it was pretty funny and funny. Maybe it shouldn't have been, but I liked it. So, 9 points for these scenes and an impressive story about the development of Oklahoma. This is about 4 points overall!
