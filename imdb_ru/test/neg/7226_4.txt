There are really good music and performances; Kid Creole and coconuts, James White and blacks, DNA, tuxedo mun, plastic, Mel Mel, Vincent Gallo, Lydia Lunch ... and so on. But, besides this, there are not that many. The dialogue, especially the narration (Saul Williams), is actually quite good, but all the performances are rather soft or frankly bad, no matter how many hipsters are added; Debbie Harry and Jean Michel Basquit (the latter of whom plays the main role), both still do not have enough cultural prestige to keep this film from being a novelty. This refers to the lush spontaneity in the style of Jack Kerouac, but he does not have the understanding to keep moving forward, and this is where the band’s performances begin. I think it’s pretty balanced in this respect between great music and bad play, and I, I really enjoyed it, but I expected more. Although he has a fabulous ending.
