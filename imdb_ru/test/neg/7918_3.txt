If you just watched All Dogs Go To Heaven and found out that there is a sequel, don’t watch it. It's horrible. This is absolutely terrible. They rush characters to evolve. Sasha, for example, begins to sing about how it can be considered love. And, in the end, it’s more like a drama novel than a comedy-adventure film. They pull Charlie from his character and replace him with a soft, soft, but still rebellious option of himself. <br /> <br /> Carriff’s character’s humor is simply completely lost. He is a completely different dog. He no longer has a cold voice, he is not the villain you love to hate more, he is just a wimp, voiced by none other than the Little Mermaid from Sponge Bob. Speaking of voice actors. <br /> <br /> Charlie has a completely different voice. And although it is not terrible, I do not like it. This is terrible compared to the excellent work that Burt Reynolds did for the character in the first film. Dom DeLuise is as beautiful as it always is. This character remains true, and therefore this film gets 3/10. Clean, because House Deluxe was still voiced by Itch. <br /> <br /> Yes, and my last complaint. I know that the film Anne-Marie was shot and left, she now has parents, and so on. But did Charlie completely forget about her or what? No mention of her in the second film. I mean, even a small mention from Zudi would be acceptable. (ex. "Charlie, we must return. You cannot care for every child who needs salvation.) Or something like that. I mean, he died while living with her, she deserves some mention. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this if you are looking for a wonderful sequel.
