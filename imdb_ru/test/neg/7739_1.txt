Every boy, in the end, learns a lesson: if a girl is good-looking, it does not mean that she is good. Well, I tell you, at 19, the lesson is learned. It's hard to say which is worse: Katie Ireland's acting skills or her ultra-high voice; one that sounds like a helium mouse scrape scratching his tiny claws on the board. With an incomprehensible plot set in outer space with dwarves who want Katy Irelandâ€™s bones for some obscure reason, this film is simply wrong on many levels. If there had ever been a candidate for the revival of Mystery Science Theater 3000, it would have been him.
