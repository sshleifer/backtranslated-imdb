This is a typical "perfect crime" thriller. The crime was committed, and the police investigator, ignoring all the evidence, will immediately find out who is to blame. The audience must wait throughout the film for the perpetrators to be caught. The result is similar to every episode of "Colombo" or "the murder she wrote." The director himself refers to the story of the hack, showing the policeman who watches the episode with Matlock! This story is barely filled in 90 minutes, but the director insists on using all 120 minutes filled in by every cliche in the book. Skip this one, you missed nothing.
