In a not entirely successful attempt to take seriously and move on to “adult” films, Mr. Hughes gives us this film about a young married couple. True, it has all the clichés in the book, stupid fantasy things and all that, but more importantly, it is Elizabeth McGovern. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the best actress who ever appeared in the movie of John Hughes, she gives her weight, which sometimes raises silly material. Kevin Bacon (and his hair) is pretty good as her husband, but McGovern steals the film with its quiet true moments of honesty. The “teen film” fun that worked so well in other Hughes films didn't work — like a favorite uncle whose jokes made you laugh when you were 9, but keep telling them when you are 15 and you want him to find some new material, but I keep going back to the McGovern's speech, because it is really touching. Mr. Hughes, in the most interesting films for me there are real actors (Some Kind of Wonderful, Breakfast Club), and when his material is faced with a real talent, some amazing things can happen. If he only believed that this should not be related to silly fantasies.
