The most common surface level biography you can hope for. Busey imitates Holly exactly, but who wants to hear Gary Bucy singing "Maybe Baby"? As a rule, members of the Hollies are used for comic relief and melodrama (Smith and Stroud, respectively), and not as people or even characters. When Holly uses the string section, the old guys, who look like Jews, tell him that he uses the same tricks as Mozart does. Such a bold statement makes such biographies of films (like Amadeus, about the aforementioned Mozart) so useless. Some entertainment can be obtained from the superb Holly styles and songs made in the B-variation.
