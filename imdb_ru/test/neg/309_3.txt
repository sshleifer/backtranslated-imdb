I agree that this film is too pretentious, and it is not easy to know where it is going. I have been teaching literature and films for years, and I believe that this film is one of the most overrated, according to some of the previous reviews here. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, let me remind you that this is the same director who has L'ora di Rel√© on his list. <br /> <br /> He tried to beat 81/2 Fellini here ???? The scene with dogs, which was also indicated, is absurd and excessive. just one example. Others would take up too much space, and some reviewers have already tagged them. <br /> <br /> In general, the most unpleasant and annoying experience!
