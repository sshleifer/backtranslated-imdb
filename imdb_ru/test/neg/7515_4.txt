I did not read the original book and did not see the earlier film, and, really, without knowing anything about the plot of this or that film, I came to this film without prejudice. <br /> <br /> It's really hard to know where to start commenting on a movie, because it all seems so confusing. It seems that there is some point in the film, a message or something else, but it remains completely unclear. <br /> <br /> The effect was fantastic and very well priced. The idea was formulated very well with a clearly defined motivation for time travel. However, from here everything was downhill. <br /> <br /> All time travel seems to have only a weak connection with the quest that was set in the beginning. There are some good ideas, but they seem to be isolated instances that don't really flow and make the film seem disunited and lost. At some point, one wonders if the main story in the film is the fate of the moon. <br /> <br /> When Hartdegen arrives in 802.701 AD, the film becomes very frustrating, as he seems to find nothing important about Eloi, and although it seems obvious that there is something that needs find out that it remains annoyingly elusive. This is a rather strange change from the previous examples of time travel, and the question arises why all this was suddenly abandoned because it seems like a completely new story. So much is happening that there must be an explanation, but there is no discovery. I really, really wanted to know that the film "received", that it was necessary to open, but to no avail. After reading a brief summary of what is happening in the book at the moment, it seems that a very indecisive attempt was made to reproduce it in the film, but it was so simplified and “stunned” that the meaning and context was completely Lost. <br /> <br /> As we hope to finally find out what this all leads to, the film unexpectedly undergoes another significant change in direction and becomes a thoughtless action film without any real action. As if by this moment the director had simply ceased to take care of giving the film some meaning. To date, countless significant things are happening without any explanation. Hartdegen cannot seize the opportunity to return to the past twice without a reason, and then suddenly loses all interest in time travel without a reason. The film ends suddenly when Hartdegen decides to stay with Eloi. <br /> <br /> In general, after a good start, the film is very disappointing. Too much time is spent on the adventures of Hartdegen before arriving with Eloi. However, the worst part of the film is what I consider the most important part: creating the situation with Eloy. The whole point is completely missed, and it undermines the rest of the film. After that, the film concentrates too much on the effects and actions, and all attempts to return to the meaning and essence of the film seem forced and inappropriate. With so many things going on without explanation, the film just gets lost and loses direction. However, the finale, where Hartdegen decides that he is no longer bothered by time travel, is the most inexplicable of all. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the entire film looked like a collection of unrelated incidents. The meaning and context were lost, although the gaping hole where it should have been was very obvious. What was so frustrating about all this, however, was that there was so much potential here: it was not a bad movie at all, it could just be a lot better. The start was very promising, the journey through time looked fantastic and would work if it didn’t go on tangential, and Hartdegen’s experience with Eloi could have worked so easily if a few more correct questions were asked and if there was no such temptation stupid "and simplify. I would just like to have a time machine so that I can travel through time and advise against mistakes made.
