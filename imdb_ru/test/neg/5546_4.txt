This sequel, “In the Heat of the Night,” will suffer in inevitable comparisons with its infinitely better predecessor. Instead of looking like a theater film edited for television, Mr. Tibbs looks suspiciously like a television film edited for theatrical release, with a grainy photo, funny intro headlines and decorations that look like they are made of plywood. The sequence of murders has a clear continuity error: the camera shows two hands strangling a girl, then a picture of a hand reaching for the figurine, then a picture of a girl strangled again with two hands, and finally a figurine going down for a fatal blow. It should be easy to solve the case: find the only guy with three hands! But poor-quality production values ​​can not completely hide the essential advantages of this film: namely, the performance of Sidney Poitier as a tough detective who decided to follow the evidence, no matter where they lead, even if it concerns a friend. Martin Landau is also convincing as a preaching activist who is suspected of having brutally murdered his prostitute. In addition to the fact that Tibbs frequently visits him, he is in conflict with his home life, but the problems of race and the barely hidden feelings of Tibbs’s social outrage are absent here. So the complicated murder mystery that made “In the heat of the night” so compelling.
