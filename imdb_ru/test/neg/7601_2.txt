No wonder many of us hate classical music; and what do children think? With such an “educational” PR, serious music will soon slip from life support to the morgue. Children know when they talk to them, and this is no exception; why can't someone make a good film about classical music for children? I must confess that I liked the actor who played Beethoven, he enthusiastically and the sharp balance of insightful and humorous aspects of Beethoven's character took on the role; he obviously did his research. Otherwise, this is the third step of rehashing the old ABC Afterschool Special format, in which there is not one random charm that these short films have had. Sorry for the rant, but this is an important topic for young people, and it could be done well; I wonder if the musicians or directors were responsible for that? Anyway, kids are cooler than you think guys ... <br /> <br /> Medtner
