I check myself to watch 3 bad films in a row to see if watching 3 bad films in a row can cause amnesia in me. I am dubbed in the English version of this film. Now let me lower the scores. Music Score: bad quality, but at least it is suitable for Story: this is a guy who goes to the city and meets his brother sheriff, and they fight for the land of the farmers from the major, and he is allies with the Mexicans to drive them, and Trinity and his brother are trying to teach them to protect him - the final climate battle scene will confuse anyone who is #### good guys. Conclusion: better than I thought, but I need to continue, Iâ€™m going to watch the next film by Dolph Lungren and Jean-Claude Bath Damme "Soldier of the Universe", pray for my sanity
