What can be said about this independent effort, in addition to being filmed by television cameras, and whether it was due to vanity or budgetary constraints, does not make it easier to observe this variation on Romero. I was constantly reminded that I was watching someone's school project, at best a derivative, at worst cheap. <br /> <br /> Scriptwriter / director Georg Koshulinsky (who also appears in the film) does some interesting things with the help of video material, but it speaks more about his editing style than about his style of directing, which consists of close-ups with TV cameras that made me think that I was watching a public access television, and not a real, honest movie. <br /> The story copies and inserts fragments from various sources, including the aforementioned trilogy of the DEAD Romero, ROAD WARRIOR (dig frames with a “future” that looks like the past) and BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. <br /> <br /> What are the results of zombies tracking and eating people? (Ok, the “people” are clones in this case, but that doesn't change anything. It's the same menu.) <br /> <br /> The year 2031, and the first group of people, cloned nineteen years ago, began to crash, especially in the field of nutrition. Of course, when clones deteriorate, the first thing they have is human flesh (or, in this case, cloned human flesh). It is not safe to be indoors, it is not safe outside. It’s just a matter of time when the ghouls that feed on flesh devour our heroes. Have you seen this before? <br /> <br /> I don’t mind people ripping off Romero if everything is done well, but there’s no new territory in this film. NIGHT OF THE LIVE DEATH MEETS BLAIR WITCH PROJECT filmed by television cameras. What is especially disappointing is that the DVD cover looks like it was removed from at least an 8 mm film. This would not be a problem for me if the story were not so cheap. The film offers a dark vision of the future, in which technology has evolved to such an extent that human cloning is possible. Should we continue to clone our favorite movies?
