On the recommendation of a friend and my admiration for Philip Baker Hall, I rented the first seasonal film, The Cycle. This is a typical TV comedy with all the clichés that the genre uses with a wacky intriguing brother (Sally) “ditzy” blonde (Lizzy), a sign of unanswered love interest (Piper), a sarcastic Asian assistant (Darcy, who reminded me of Arliss as ANYONE needed to be reminded of THIS show). The plot deals with various setbacks (usually Sally) that happen to Sam, who puts his work on the plane at risk, only to save the day, with the “fun jokes” that arise in the middle. I have not described a specific episode. I described them ALL for T. Therein lies the problem, since the fact that it seems that it can even be tolerable entertainment at first simply becomes uselessly outdated when watching episodes in a row and becomes boring to incredibility with endless repetition. Sally will do something "stupid", Mimi Rogers will say something frankly sexy, Russ will tell about her gay son, Darcy will imitate Sandra Oh on Arliss-bla-bla-bla-bla-bla. The only positive is the absence of annoying track of laughter. But don't let this fool you, thinking it is good. Go see where the best comedy is. The arrested developer, “Always sunny” in Phyllidelia, two names from the top of the head. Surprised that this is still on the air. Oh, right, Fox cancels only good shows, I forgot. Needless to say, I no longer trust the taste of my friend in the show. <br /> <br /> My rating: D +
