“JB” (Jack Black) runs away from home after his father spanked him (meatloaf). Years later, he finally gets to Hollywood and is confronted with the greatest guitarist he ever heard, “KG” (Kyle Glass). <br /> <br /> After a little quarrel, they decide to unite and perform at Open Mic Night in a less popular bar. To their shock, they do not do it well. <br /> <br /> Back in their less impressive apartment, they try to figure out what rock legends they don’t have, looking at some old magazines. Only then do they understand that the guitarists on the covers have the same pick. <br /> <br /> Trying to find such a mediator, an employee of a music store (Ben Stiller, also an Executive Producer) tells him the ancient story of Pike of Destiny, to which they aspire. This employee, who has long gray hair and thick glasses, also tells them that a pickaxe made from a satanic tooth is included in the history of the rock music museum. <br /> <br /> Now two losers who smoke marijuana with delusions of grandeur go on an adventure filled with music to steal a pick. <br /> <br /> Let me say this in advance, if you are not a fan of Tenacious D who gave us comedian Jack Black, then you should skip this. I am not a fan of these two, and just watched it because it was suggested by Flixter.com. <br /> <br /> Jokes, for the most part, produce silence more than anything else. I laughed at three jokes and laughed at several others. Tenacious D only for a specific audience, which I am not. <br /> <br /> This film lags behind in many places, and this is where the worst jokes appear. And let me say that when Black and Glass do not work with each other, they are completely lost on the screen. <br /> <br /> All the songs in this movie belong to Tenacious D. Many of the songs are great at promoting the storyline, describing your adventures at the time in the movie. However, I felt that the songs sounded too much like they could not be told separately. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this film is that language distracts many people. There are many four-letter words in this movie. There are also some references to drugs. I would not recommend this for children. <br /> <br /> In part, “Tenacious D” has what you have black and Glass for the most part remains in its shadow. That's how they are in this movie, and it really doesn't work. It was probably part of the act, but I felt that Glass simply did not want to be there. In one scene, he performs his (background) lyrics at a party, and he just can't work alone. <br /> <br /> Tenacious D is supposedly rock fans in real life, and there are maybe two legends of rock in the film. I lost count because I was so bored with this film. Personally, I would like the film to have more legends and icons of rock music. However, we do not understand this. <br /> <br /> What we get is a film filled with totally unconvincing jokes, a lot of obscene expressions, a dull script. You also get a terrible game and a non-original story. However, you have some pretty good songs that sound about the same. <br /> <br /> The story could be promising, but many scenes were added to the film at the last second. It's a bit like the Blues Brothers movie many years ago, but the Blues Brothers had many more followers - and two songs on the Billboard music charts. Tenacious D has only a small number of fans, with a few HBO specials under their belt. And, unlike The Blues Brothers, the comedy is not quite thought out. <br /> <br /> If you are a Tenacious D fan, then I advise you to check it out. However, like most movie viewers, when this movie was released in theaters, I would say, avoid it. Save your money on this, folks.
