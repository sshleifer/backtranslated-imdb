Do not believe deception. If you have high hopes or expected this film to some extent, you may be disappointed. Even a cheerful and talented Steve Carrell cannot save this poorly written, too long stupid spy movie. For purists (fans of the original series), this film has little resemblance to the original characters and influence. Agent 99 and Maxwell (except their names) simply do not match the characters. There are several separate references to the original, but not enough to convince this fan that this is more than a bad shadow of the television version. For those who are not familiar with the original series, you may not be disappointed, but most likely you will be bored. There are also some cheap Hollywood political shots (really pretentious and oh so typical of the election year). We left after the first hour and were not alone. Some left after 20 minutes.
