I just finished watching this movie, and I have to say that it was a good movie, I liked some of the good guys, and I liked the killer robot, but there were some holes in the movie. <br /> <br /> The name of the people in it was kind of ... stupid ... I think people should sue the creator of this film for the way he was lame at the end ... the first half hour was good, but then they just dragged on I was happy ... it's over ... but I still liked the killer robot and some of the good guys in the movie. <br /> <br /> I think it was the best two dollars Iâ€™ve ever spent, because I like stupid bi-films like this, and come on ... these are all bi-films.
