The plane carrying some scientists and a prototype of a DNA machine, a powerful and revolutionary invention, falls in the jungles of the Pacific Ocean. The insurance company is sponsoring a rescue expedition led by Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen), the owner of a huge corporation that owns the prototype, and the father of one of the scientists. There, the group finds the remains of an airplane five miles from the intended location, as well as a car and human remains. In addition, they understand that Sasquatch, a kind of Big Foot, haunts them. This film is so ridiculous that I do not know what I am doing, I spend time in this garbage again. The direction is terrible, the actors and the lines are terrible, copying parts of the Predator and even the Blair Witch Project. Summing up, how bad this film is, its best scene, when Marla Lawson, Andrea Roth's character, is injured, and the expedition's leadership says she needs to be vaccinated against tetanus. Andrea strips her jeans, and the guide says, "Good butts, but the shot should be in your hand." Funny! My voice is two. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): `Sasquatch, O Abomin√°vel '(` Sasquatch, The Abominable') <br /> <br />
