Jack Higgins unique thriller about how an IRA bomber was forced to perform "one last job" (where did I hear this plot before?), Getting a strange attitude from cult director Mike Hodges. Micky Rourke with anxious red hair is recognized by all the priest (Bob Hoskins, of all people), who happened to witness the shooting. Church rules do not allow Father Bob to speak, but then Rourke falls in love with the priest's blind niece. They are related in the church organ. What kind? Actually, this is the plot. Alan Bates is known as the main thug who calls the shots (literally), and he seems to be the only actor who understands the joking tone that Hodges is aiming for. Bates is all set to do some sort of HONOR OF USA PRIZE, but no one, including the charismatic Liam Neeson as an assistant, was informed.
