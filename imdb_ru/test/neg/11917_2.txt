In fact, you should not reconsider, but I believe that I must warn you all, especially since there are some pretty good reviews about this Canadian bomb floating around there ... Bad behavior and slow moving, absolutely terribly boring 'age , in which 3 boys live, turns upside down when a fugitive appears at their club in the forest. At first, the boys deal with the offender and at some point even consider him as a kind of role model ... However, all this changes ... and you will still not care. You will recognize Chris Penn, whose greatest cinematic influence is Corky Romano, and young Devon Sava, whose career has reached its peak at Casper. I was hoping for “12 and Holding,” “War,” or “Lies,” and everything I received was a waste of time. This film struggles to keep the attention of its audience and never influences or supports the note of something remotely interesting.
