The seven collaborations between director Joseph "von Sternberg" and star Marlene Dietrich were so different in appearance and tone and so different from everything that happened at that time, they seem to be almost their own genre. Like any genre, they have their frank masterpieces, as well as absolute turkeys. It's time to send Blonde Venus back to the farm. <br /> <br /> After the dark, seductive hits of Blue Angel, Morocco and Shanghai Express, in which Miss Dietrich created an image of her screen as a cabaret singer-singer, Paramount decided it was time for Marlene to play mother. There is nothing wrong; as an actress she was up to the part. Just nothing more about the format has changed. It's like a blue angel plus baby. True, the story of a woman who drags her child in her scruffy adventures is a reasonable prerequisite for a tragic drama, but this is not how it is played out. Dietrich's journey is played as an adventure, using her wits and accomplices to stay ahead of the law. Is this not some sassy example of pre-libertarianism ?? it's just weirdly unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Although we can admit that Marlene is an adoring mommy, we absolutely cannot buy Sternberg as a director for cordiality and sharpness. Despite the fact that this is one of the few paintings for which he also took over the handwriting, Sternberg simply can not understand the storyline. It is assumed that the emotional reward of the film is a possible family reunion, but even at the very beginning it is not considered something worth returning to. As usual, Sternberg's interiors are dressed and shot to look like brothels or insane hideouts. Faraday’s house is actually a rather creepy, dirty environment, and surprisingly, little Johnny didn’t wet the bed or ask to sleep with the lights on. <br /> <br /> But, as everyone knows, who is familiar with them. The essence of the picture of Dietrich / Sternberg is to make Dietrich look incredible, and in this respect, at least, Blonde Venus is a success. Marlene emerges from the forest pool in a bright, shimmering close-up, and even when she turns into tatters, the camera still loves her. The same cannot be said about the rest of the cast, which Sternberg is inclined to regard as moving scenery. Usually the pretty Herbert Marshall here turns into a moody grunt hiding in the shadows. Even the courteous and lively Cary Grant becomes just a boring background spot, and it seems to Dietrich that he is not so interesting to run away with him. <br /> <br /> The only outstanding moments in Venus Blonde are Marlene's songs and dances. especially the famous Hot Voodoo room, where she parodies her surreal scene persona as she leaves the gorilla clothes. But even they feel cut out from another movie. Sternberg fans may welcome this as another masterpiece, as they usually do, but for the average player this is a huge disappointment. The audience at the time did not accept the fact that she had her earliest hits, and this marked the beginning of the end for Marlene's heyday. In a year, a new queen will appear in Paramount. Mae west.
