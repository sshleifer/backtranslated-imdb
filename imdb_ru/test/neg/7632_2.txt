Sorry, I could not have been more expressive in my resume, but these two words seemed to perfectly describe the film. This is not only a bad movie, but also a bad movie with a bad game and plot that will not matter to most viewers. <br /> <br /> See it only for nude Rebecca De Mornay, tied to the fence in the form of a chain and moaning from ecstasy; presumably "erotic", but actually fun. <br /> <br />
