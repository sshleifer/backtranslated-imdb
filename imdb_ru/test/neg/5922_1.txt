I mistakenly thought that this Neo-Noir effort in the Buffalo-Niagara Falls region could be something else. Unfortunately, I was wrong. There are a lot of problems with “The Falls” that really have nothing to do with low-budget video production. Immediately the question arises, why all this constant narration? I have a feeling that if you have a decent script, the audience will follow, without the need to insult the voice for telling stories. Acting is very amateur, which is not unexpected, but simply adds to the problems. Finally, all this is annoyingly filmed, as an MTV music video, which I consider completely unacceptable. Narration, bad behavior and annoying video effects are all good reasons for avoiding it. - MERK
