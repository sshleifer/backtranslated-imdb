I was looking forward to see this movie, but when I finally got the chance, I was very disappointed. I had to stop halfway (or was it a quarter of the way?) Due to a bad script and direction. Not to mention the bad cast! Josh Hartnett - the only one who can act, and he is much more suited to become the hero of this story. <br /> <br /> In general, the story of a free girl from a country that cheated on her for a long time. A decent guy just to have meaningless sex with a spoiled rich guy. This film did not cause me sympathy, even when the writer was going to. I wonder where moral values ​​go? <br /> <br /> The actors are so tough that when I resume the film (a few weeks after it was interrupted due to its boring nature), they still couldn't get me to pay attention. A spoiled couple can only hate me! What movie! <br /> <br /> I think that all the people participating in this performance should sit down and watch it together so that next time they do not repeat the same mistakes. And next time they may consider Josh Hartnett the main character ...
