I enjoyed the beautiful scenery in this film when I first saw it when I was 9 years old. Dunderklumpen is pretty cute for babies. He reminded me of HRPUFFINSTUFF on Saturday mornings, his Swedish backgrounds lighten his eyes. Do not expect older children to be interesting, because live action / animation is far behind the times, and most older children will be bored. This is definitely a movie under 10 years old and pleasant memories for those of us who were small children in 1974.
