I just don't understand. Why call it a continuation of the movie “American werewolf” when he absolutely DOES NOT have anything to do with him? The first movie was funny * and * scary with amazing special effects. (If memory serves, the Oscar category for special makeup effects was * created * for this film). "Paris" is not one of these. Terrible effects and much more. I do not see this movie. Borrow the original "Werewolf in London." You will be much happier.
