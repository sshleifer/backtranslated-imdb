I give show six because of the fact that the show was actually a platform for Damon Wayans, like the Cosby show for Bill Cosby, it dealt with many problems with humor, and I felt that it was really just to get a laugh, not a joke on the character. <br /> <br /> Michael Kyle An interesting patriarch and sage. He is a PHENOMENAL in the movie, but in the series he was there for the sake of wisdom, and although I liked it, I felt that laughter was more important than truth. <br /> <br /> Jay Kyle, I loved her since “House Party” and she liked School Daze and Martin, it was a great role for her, and she made an excellent choice by choosing this comedy film for filming. I also feel that Jay and Michael were more equal in the show, but Jay was more of a woman who fed her crazy husbands with lines and stuck to his way of unorthodox discipline because she could have felt it worked <br /> <br /> ml. Just stupid, his character had to be well developed, and although he does have moments of greatness, we return to stupidity, as if he had learned nothing that drives me crazy !!!!!!!! Not to mention the fact that most situations (in the episodes that I've seen) seem to be centered around him. <br /> <br /> Claire An attractive sister who met a Christian, I discovered that her boyfriend’s character was more interesting than she. (she would be better off sticking to the cinema, the authors should have done more to show her mind, but this is not stereotyped enough) <br /> <br /> Kadi Lovable and youngest daughter. I think the authors established her character most on the show except for parents and Franklin. <br /> <br /> Franklin. I LOVE this character, and I think they took him from the Smart Guy (T.J. Mowry), which lasted only one season. They did a great job recruiting for this little genius (if the younger one was smart, but he would have done his best, but he would have the minuses) <br /> <br /> In general, this comedy series is a wonderful thing, and Tribute to the Cosby Show, well done, I love the show and would like it to last longer. I can't wait to see the series finale
