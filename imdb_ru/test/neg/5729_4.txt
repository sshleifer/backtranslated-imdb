“Red Sonya” is flawed, weak and lacking. Even the camp is not very good. <br /> <br /> In the “Red Dream” there are only two good things; Costumes (even though Red Sonia's costume is ridiculous. The irony is that a girl who is even afraid of being touched by men because she was raped, still prefers to wear so few little clothes, even when it rains.) Morricone. However, the film is somewhat watchable, but definitely not recommended. <br /> <br /> The story is very simple, and they have not even bothered to make it interesting. This story could be forgotten if there were some good sequences of actions and a little humor, both are present, but in many respects have serious flaws. The film takes itself too seriously and tries to impress, but fails. <br /> <br /> Bridget Nielsen is a terrible leading lady. I do not know whose accent is worse; Her or Arnie and to top it all; She can't act. There is also absolutely no chemistry between the two characters, which makes the love story absolutely incredible. Even worse was Sandal Bergman as the main villain who acts worse than a paper bag. Ronald Lacey was somewhat good at his role, but oh, he looked terrible, he had changed a lot since his (only known) role in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Could it have something to do with his illness, which claimed his life in 1991? And, by the way, what happened to all these actors of the Raiders of the Lost Ark in this film? Next to Ronald Lacy, Pat Roach, Terry Richards and Tutta Lemkov appeared in the role, it was like the reunion of the Raiders of the Lost Ark. <br /> <br /> The only moments when the film becomes a bit interesting during fights (with swords), although some of them are useless and weak. <br /> <br /> Only really watchable for fans of the fantasy genre. <br /> <br /> 4/10
