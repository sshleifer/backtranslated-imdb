Like many people, I loved the original; “American Graffiti” was one of the great films of the 70s. The sequel "Another American Graffiti" - a terrible, depressing mess in the film. It was not funny, wide eyes, pleasant characters became cynical and exhausted, and the stories were invented (for example, the character “Laurie” had another brother, because Richard Dreyfus did not make a sequel and “Terry Toad” and “Pharaoh Joe” like- they manage to serve together in Vietnam). They even have a policeman named “Falfa” (Harrison Ford’s character in the original) who makes a “cameo”. He doesn't even look like Harrison Ford, who by 1979 was too big a star to even worry about this garbage. <br /> <br /> The working word here is “funny.” This film is not even funny. Debbie (Candy Clark) - a stripper, mixed with a bunch of drug addicts, robbing hippies and trying to rescue their boyfriend dealer from prison; Steve and Laurie (Ron Howard and Cindy Williams), lovebirds in the original, have two children and have become an annoying, quarreling couple; Charming little bitch Carol (MacKenzie Phillips) has become a "rainbow", another hippie child. John Milner (Paul LeMat) is a loser-racer whose fortune was predicted at the end of the original. Even Wolfman Jack, whose voice was such an integral part of the original and gave him such a big flow, is heard only from time to time. <br /> <br /> Perhaps these were different writers, a different director, and the complete absence of a cohesive storyline that makes this film such a dismal failure. <br /> <br /> Episodic charm and genuine nostalgia for the original are nowhere to be found in the sequel. It was a film that didn’t have to be made, and it’s best to remember what the great American Graffiti film is, and avoid the movie with “More” in the title.
