I would not recommend it at all. It was like getting stuck in the middle row in a theater, so I couldn't leave, and watch the porn movie part (except for the fact that they do not take their clothes - this is body language and, of course, language). I have to say that I was confused. Shooting was very low-budget, without a good dialogue. Ugh. The actors are smelly, except for the two best heroes who were killed (?), And these were David Carradine and Dennis Hopper. It was like Kill Bill and that old movie with two guys eating dessert on their helicopters. If you know what I mean. blah blah blah. The filming was grainy and just of very poor quality. There was no one in this theater who loved this film, and the people around me were younger and tattooed.
