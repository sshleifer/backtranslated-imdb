Do not rent this movie. I ended up buying the "previously viewed" tape of it for $ 4.00. It was close to the rental price, so I thought that I could buy it. I throw it after I finish this review. A film featuring Low is a music video with several lines of dialogue, slow frames and a poorly edited montage. I thought that I would see a meaningless fighter, what I wanted to see, I did not even understand it. This film is an exercise in slow shots, without a script, close-ups, badly edited and poorly designed plots. I can't believe that this actually ends with a scene in which they think that viewers care about characters. By the end of the film, we still donâ€™t even know who they are. Believe deception, stay away.
