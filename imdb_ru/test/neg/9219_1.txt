Since I don’t have a TV and I’ve never heard of this mini-series, I didn’t know what to expect from the Second Coming, and I hired him solely on the basis of a brief summary of the story that sounded interesting. <Br /> <br /> Dear God! (Each pun intended.) If someone told me that it was written by a thirteen-year class who was given the project of turning the second coming into a school play, I would not be surprised. <br /> Why, oh, why did they decide to portray Jesus Mark II as equivalent to an idiotic scholar? Is there anything in the Gospels to suggest this? Good, ordinary guy, but the Great Northern moron. I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Apparently, all that Jesus did to impress people was his miracles, because, according to this, his preaching, like hell, never impressed anyone. Of course, without the nightly stunt, Mr. Jesus Eccleston will roam without a canoe, paddle or any other followers at all. <br /> <br /> And a strange little cheerful controversy will be misleading, without rhyme or reason. Except, of course, Russell is waving his QAF fans. Jesus appears in the pub to recruit "disciples" (the more ruthless northern losers and, of course, in anticipation of a gay writer - a female harpy, grumbling, grumbling). The rights of gays are drowned in his throat to nothing real, almost the same as Russell thought he “was obliged to guys” to put Jesus in place. <br /> <br /> I can't see the real Jesus, who says, "Well, personally, I have nothing against it, mate." Only someone really mean and clumsy could imagine that Jesus is so wet. <br /> <br /> And don't start me in the final. "Please come and eat rat poison, because the only way we can be truly free is if God dies." <br /> <br /> It was like Eddie Izzard sketching about God like Bill Gates. "Hello, I am Bill Gates, and now you have indicated to me that my global dominance limits your style, I am going to give all this to you, my clients." And, of course, eat rat poison. <br /> <br /> IMDb ratings often harass me, but the high rating on this is sponge cake. <br /> <br /> Never mind the head of Jesus for the new millennium - this is Jesus for brainless guys from MTV. <br /> <br /> May God help us all.
