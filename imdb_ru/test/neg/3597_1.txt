I do not understand the humor in this film. I also found it offensive to the way Koreans were depicted in this film, despite the fact that in fact itâ€™s just a caricature of Koreans in these areas. First of all, the actors are Japanese, and they make the crudest expressions of Koreans in this film. I hate how these people put it. I felt angry, just watching this scene, and how they were so poorly dismantled in the film. Humor lasts only one laugh, and then you do not understand why it is even funny. This is rude humor with the most disgusting presentation of society there. In general, I discovered that this is an offensive film ... Maybe just because I never lived in the "hood" and did not see any films of the "hood", but I'm not going to either.
