For science fiction fans, this will be better than anything that can be played on TV at any given time; this is the best thing you can say about it. Good moments; in such films, the repertoire and sense of humor are less boring than usual, the plot is consistent and does not use any magical mystical revelations. Bad glasses; the authors try to do good science, but it falls in the direction and production (for example, a drilling rig using equipment for drilling hot rock, pulls out the surface under water without a visible bubble or boiling boiler), the characters are clich√© and the plot unfolds a fairly standard flow. Good for too tired to do anything else evening type; but do not expect any serious edification or even talk.
