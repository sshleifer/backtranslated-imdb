It's terrible even for a television movie. I can't believe it took three people to write this movie. I am not familiar with the novel on which this film is based, but it must be better than this one. I'd rather have watched the Full House Marathon than this stupid movie. I gave him 2 out of 10 stars just because he was made better by advertising.
