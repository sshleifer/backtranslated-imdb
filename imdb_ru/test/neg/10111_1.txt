Where the hell can I start with the mess that Dark Hunters have? First, the script is one of the worst that has ever appeared on a cinema or television screen, and can only be described as Stephen King's plagiarism. At some point, the fearful dark hunter Jack claims that Carol, the girl who helps a man who is being pursued, is annoying, like "a gherkin in a hamburger." I would laugh if I thought up, BUT I DON'T! Likewise, Carol originally came to be able to see people die. The cat gave it to her when she held him during the car accident in which she was a child. WHAT ???????? <br /> <br /> Secondly, there is no tension or threat for a horror movie. This may not help the fact that all the action takes place in the harsh, broad daylight. Not very atmospheric. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the acting is really terrible, Pinion again proves that he needs to speak his native language in order to be at least a little believable. Jeff Fahey is obviously on autopilot, but how can he be blamed when he runs through the sad imitation of Humphrey Bogart in the role of Barlow (Marlow-Barlow? We understand that this is simply not funny). We must pay tribute to Susan Paterno, an actress I didn’t know about, she does her best with the terrible role she has and makes others more experienced actors dishonore. <br /> <br /> In no way did it even explain how the character MAN can understand what the character Van Husen says to her. She obviously has some degree in perverted alien languages. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, one good point is a car accident involving Susan. SFX is quite plausible, and if it were not for the fun storyline along which it happened, he would have been welcomed. <br /> <br /> All I can say about dark hunters is that British horror will never recover from its endless recession if such films continue to be filmed and shown. Avoid this movie like the plague, although the plague will be much worse. <br /> <br /> Dark Hunters 0/5 <br /> <br /> p. insinuations in other reviews that the film remains too clever for some are honestly ridiculous. This is a weak defense when some claim that “you didn’t like it because you didn’t understand it”. Letters after my name make you a fool, not me.
