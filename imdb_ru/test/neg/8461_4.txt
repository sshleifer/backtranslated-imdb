Perhaps the target audience of this television film on the Disney channel will be pleased with this, but if the parents watch together with the teenagers, they will clearly see what has “fallen” written throughout this production. Obviously, no one dreamed of making this film; rather, it was coined somewhere in the conference room, and then produced with cold efficiency. There is some talent among actors, but actors like Debni Coleman and Jay Thomas have little chance of showing off their talent. Impossible, dear Elizabeth Harnoy is engaged as First Daughter, but Will Friedl is again stuck playing another stupid character, although he is not as moronic and annoying as in his role as “The Boy Meets the World”. The background for this film is Washington, DC, and the White House, but there is no real “presidential” feeling in the film, and the Secret Service looks a little better than Keystone Kops when it comes to performing its duties. The Disney Channel presents a variety of original television films, and most of them are better than this.
