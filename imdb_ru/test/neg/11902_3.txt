This is a bad film, as its central message is very confusing, and the plot seems to have been the result of the merging of several separate scenarios. As a result, it often does not make any sense at all and, of course, is not a film that Miss Dunn or Mr. Houston should have been proud to shoot. Nevertheless, the film is worth seeing if you are a fan of the “Pre-Code” films, because it shows a surprisingly messy plot, which firmly states that cute girls really leave the game - even if they are not married and even if their partner THERE IS !! <br /> <br /> The film begins with Miss Dunn as a social worker who helps troops heading to Europe for the First World War. In the process, she meets a bastard (Bruce Cabot), who eventually convinces her to sleep with him. She becomes pregnant and he moves on to the next unsuspecting woman. However, Miss Dunn does NOT want him to return, because she understands that he is not worth it, but later her child dies at birth. While all these highly controversial plot elements are used, they are always referred to — almost as they wanted the adults in the audience to know, but hoped that if they formulated it or removed it correctly, the children in the audience would be ignorant ( After all, films were not rated, and children can attend any film at this time). <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, this whole story with the participation of a stillborn child and Cabot ends about 1/4 of the way the film. and is never mentioned or mentioned. As if they were shooting a part of the film and abandoned it - attaching it to another movie. In the second stage of the film, Miss Dunn suddenly starts working in the women's prison (although in fact we never see her doing something there). What we see are innumerable horrific scenes of cruel bullying and torture, which were probably intended to tease. And, as a result of all this violence, Miss Dunn goes on a crusade to clear the prison, and becomes a reformer and a famous writer. <br /> <br /> But then, out of the blue, another type of film appears and the business of women's prison reform goes to the background. Dunn meets the judge (Walter Houston), who is married, but he desperately wants her. Now throughout the film, Dunn is portrayed as a very nice girl - even though she had unmarried sex with Cabot (she was more or less deceived). But now lonely Irina, a tireless reformer and a good lady, begins to sleep with a married man. He tells her that he and his wife are alienated and married only by name, but she never thinks to investigate whether this is true and, with his confidence, takes off her clothes and they are in the business of making babies! BUT, while she is pregnant with his beloved child, he is charged with being a pervert judge. He assures her that he is innocent, but he is convicted, and it sounds as if he is a scoundrel — using inside information from people who came in front of his bench to accumulate a fortune. Then, in the last moments of the film, Miss Dunn tries in vain to free him and vows to wait with the child until Houston is released. Then the film ends. <br /> <br /> So, we have three separate films. And a strange idea of ​​the beginning of the 30s about what a pretty girl should be. I realized that she must be a strong working girl who instantly becomes an idiot in her personal relationship! It really destroys all the positive traits of Dunn’s character, and it’s hard to imagine who likes the movie. A strong advocate for women's rights can easily be offended at how weak-minded and needy she was, and religious people can consider her completely immoral, or at least morally suspect! With a decent census, this could be a good movie, or at least an interesting one, like an obscene and indecent film, but he could not decide WHAT he wanted to be, and was just another boring movie before coding.
