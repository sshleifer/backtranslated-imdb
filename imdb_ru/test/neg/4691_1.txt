Not many people remember The Carey Treatment, and I cannot say that I blame them. <br /> <br /> Blake Edwards did this in his lean years (that is, between the Pink Panther films). The story of the doctor who became a detective (Coburn), working on the disclosure of the murder in his hospital, in fact it is quite easy to forget. <br /> <br /> Coburn, as always, is reliable, and O'Neill is beautiful, as always, but it seems that something is missing in the process. The plot twists are not very interesting, and even the climax, which is supposed to be nervous, turns it on its stomach instead. <br /> <br /> In general, the missed opportunity is also unfortunate, since it was based on the book by Michael Crichton. <br /> <br /> Well, at least, Crichton did not write a sequel to it. <br /> <br /> One star. "Carey", Coburn.
