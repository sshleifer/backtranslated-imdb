This movie is not worth the time required to install it on a VCR or DVD player! Michael Dudikoff and Lisa Howard are two lovers of bounty hunters, but they are completely opposite. She is ambitious and organized, while he is serene and completely reckless. <br /> <br /> In this film, the bad guys chase Bellini Jersey (Dudikov character). This opens the door to bad impressions of the Godfather, ridiculous battle scenes, and Tony Curtis plays the most effeminate mafia boss I've ever seen! The ending should be the most ... incredible scene that I saw in the movie for a long time. I believe that the Terminator, even the Matrix, is more likely to be truthful than this end! This movie just smells cheap. The script should have seemed completely ridiculous to someone. However, the green light was given so that this piece of manure was made and released to the unsuspecting public. I watched this movie with several other people who all agreed that we were deceived. No one in the group could say anything good about the film, except that it was finished.
