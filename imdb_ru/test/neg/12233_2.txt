One would think that, since this film has a bad reputation, I would exaggerate when I say that I hate this film. But seriously, this film was just so stupid, so unfunny, and such a waste of time. in the first 30 I had a severe headache, and the smile on my face (which was mainly going to laugh) was erased. When this film ended, I was very happy, and therefore I had high hopes that it would be funny. I was very disappointed. The acting is not great, the comedic moments are unconvincing and unconvincing. This is not good, because I laughed at, perhaps, in two parts. Overall, it's so boring, and I can't say how terrible it is. I think this can be used as a suicide method. I mean, I donâ€™t think that some of them are even watchable.
