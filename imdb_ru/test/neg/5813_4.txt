I adore Hedy Lamarr. I think she was significantly undervalued as an actress in the 40s. She was Nastasia Kinski of that era, and critics did not take her seriously. Having said all this ... this film is BORE. When I watched it for the first time, I was shocked by the lack of continuity not only in the plot, but also in makeup and costumes. Makeup Hedy varies from shot to shot. Just like the length and hair style. The reason: this thing had so many writers, and it went through so many stops and launches, itâ€™s just amazing that they let her out at all. Her "Lady of the Tropics" began to take off AFTER how this one began, but she was released before "I take this woman." In fact, at the time, it was known in Hollywood as "I will take this woman." That should tell you something. I'm also a fan of Spencer Tracy, but he is HORRIBLE here. I read in different stories of the film that he absolutely despised Hedy Lamarr, and this looks quite obvious in the film. NO chemistry at all. The story wanders behind the coil behind the coil and, finally, just ends in a strange way. I can't recommend it at all.
