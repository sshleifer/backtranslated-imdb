It is truly a shame that IMDb does not allow you to vote against. This is the most terrible horrible show ever imposed on the American public by our usually pretty neighbors in the north. Parents - troglodyte and neurotic witch. It is as charming as a well-used fire hydrant, with the same hygienic standards. She is a wax museum, programmed for more neuroses than the whole cast of THE VIEW. Children are not entities if they are women, and disgusting if they are men, especially the main character. The boy is a serious contender for the most insanely smug, smug, arrogant and vain male character on Disney who says something. This show, obviously, was conceived as an anti-BANDY BUNCH, but it looks like an anti-CHRIST. And why is the photo so dark?
