This film demonstrates every imaginable Greek stereotype. In one particularly unpleasant scene, the tycoon says: "I am just an ignorant peasant." As a grandson of Greek peasant immigrants who passed on a legacy of wisdom and love to their children and grandchildren, I found this film despicable and odious.
