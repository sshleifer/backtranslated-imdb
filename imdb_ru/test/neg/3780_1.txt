This is a result of the fact that the city of Milpitas, California, made a home movie and subjugated it to the rest of the world. Legendary in some circles as the biggest cinematic turkey, this film is considered to be a bad film. Partly comedy, partly a giant horror movie with monsters, this film is full of non-acting actors. the plot has something to do with a giant monster made out of garbage and pollution in this area and rampaging. The monster, which we do not see until the last 20 minutes, looks pretty cool, but not so cool to justify watching the preceding hour of boredom. To be honest, even the seasoned bad movie lovers will have a hard time getting to the end. This is a stinker.
