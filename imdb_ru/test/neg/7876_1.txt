I had to watch this film for professional reasons and can only say that it is a waste of time. While running, Baldwin looks like a monkey, the characters are boring, in other films the same story is told 1000 times better. I think everything was said about this movie, but IMDb requires me to write 10 lines. So: Boring and trivialBoring and trivialBoring Trivial trivial trivial TrivialBoring and TrivialBoring trivialBoring and trivialBoring and trivialBoring and trivial
