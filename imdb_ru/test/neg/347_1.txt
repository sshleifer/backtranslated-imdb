I watched this movie only because I got the impression that I was going to persuade me. I mean, look at the line: “They are people turned inside out! And what's worse ... they are still alive! ”Doesn't that scream a raw horror movie? And then there is the name itself - “Screamers”. What a good name for a horror movie, I thought! Unfortunately, I did not know that the real name was correctly translated as “Fishman Island”. <br /> <br /> About an hour after watching, I realized that this was not a bad horror movie. In general, it was a funny "adventure" story about slimy fishermen from Atlantis. "Men turned inside out"? Not. There was nothing like this. I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Damn it, misleading slogans! I want to return these 81 minutes of my life!
