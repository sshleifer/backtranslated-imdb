Sorry, after watching the credits, I thought it would be, at least, a worthy tribute to the retiring SF actors. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. The pic is terrible. I have never been so offended by the production. <br /> <br /> I respect and love many actors of this “film” very much, but I must say that they were deceived. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this debacle, do yourself a favor and stay away. These are not only two hours that you will not return, but they will also destroy your respect for some of the actors you once liked.
