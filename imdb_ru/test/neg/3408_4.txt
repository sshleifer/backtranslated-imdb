Solange is not a great Italian thriller. Get ready for a spoiler - the main suspect, a professor, did not do this. But is it really a spoiler? No, because you know that he could not be a murderer from the very beginning; he and the student witnessed the first murder. Thus, there is absolutely no doubt as to whether the professor is a murderer. There is a long, tedious construction before the final explanation of the mystery. The solution is interesting, but it comes from nowhere. The rest of the film (and this is not a short film) is simply not so interesting as to interest you. Even in the tradition of “blaming the wrong person,” this is not possible, because the police never seriously accuse the professor, and the murderer never persecutes him. Boring, boring, boring.
