In this film, Ben Kingsley starred in the role of Frank, the assassin of some Russian gangsters from Buffalo. He is also a violent alcoholic, and this has led to a decrease in his work. After he fell asleep in his car during a possible strike, his uncle, the mafia boss, sent him to San Francisco, where he must attend AA meetings and get a job as an assistant undertaker. If you think that there is absolutely no point in this, you are not alone. <br /> <br /> It gets worse. Well, it actually gets better, but not before it gets much, much worse. Frank suddenly becomes the main undertaker, despite the complete lack of training, but his reactions with people in the funeral home and the AA meetings are interesting. The viewer begins to root for him when they notice positive changes in his life. Luke Wilson is a welcome addition as Frank's sponsor, although he has almost nothing to do (his character tells us that he is gay, but in the end it does not matter). The film is immersed in idiocy with the introduction of the character Tea Leoni. She is completely unrealistic, and her role as a love interest causes Frank to flounder, since the two actors do not have chemistry together. Around the time she appears in the picture, Frank becomes a much less attractive character. His characteristic at first glance is random; there is no consistency in his behavior. The comedy is modest and only occasionally amusing, especially disappointing, considering the comedic genealogy of the actors. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of problems in this. Kingsley's accent is terrible and inconsistent. It alternates between Italian, Russian and Latin American languages. Throughout the film, Frank tells numerous people that he is a hired killer (including the whole AA group), but nobody cares and he doesn’t want to do anything about it. The film relies on a cliché to bring it to the end, especially when the intolerable character Leoni is chasing Frank at the airport, just at the moment when he is about to take the flight back to Buffalo. <br /> <br /> Although this is a strong premise and an interesting first half hour, the film quickly turns into a complete disaster and turns into complete nonsense. At the end of the film, Frank celebrates a year of sobriety. I hope to celebrate for many, many years without seeing "You will kill me." <br /> <br /> My rating: D +
