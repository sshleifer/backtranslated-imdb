Lika! Antoine Monot, imitating Silent Bob, imitating Kevin Smith, continues to ask for it, but writer / director Christian Zubert never listens. Zubert just can't say no to a joke, however cheap it may be. The best in this film is its soundtrack. Of course, Joey Burns of Calexico and the divine Jonathan Richman, the understated bard of the old school of fame "There is something about Mary," will embellish any history of dropping out of a small town. In visual charm, Stefan (Lukas Gregorovich) looks pretty cool when he rides his six-row, tanned BMW in a six-door BMW, in shades of an aviator and not going anywhere. True, he * accidentally * sleeps with his insane bohemian younger sister (Maria Zelke), but who will not? You should also pay attention to how it becomes black and white from the liberal dose of the mysterious substance they call zero-zero, but if you are looking for a slightly more serious idea of ​​what intoxication can do for you, I suggest you check “Fear and hate in Las Vegas. ”
