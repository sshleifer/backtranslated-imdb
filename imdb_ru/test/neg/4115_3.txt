In the future, when an industrious travel agency uses time travel technology to send rich clients back in time to explore the dinosaur era, the future inexplicably changes when one of their clients breaks the cardinal rule of not going astray. In an attempt to fix the damage done, an experienced time scout (Edward Burns) teamed up with the inventor of the technology (Catherine McCormack). <br /> <br /> The premise is pretty good and attractive. Perhaps there are several flaws in it, but it can still be an interesting film. Unfortunately, "The Sound of Thunder" can not really catch the audience. He suffers from a number of problems and takes himself too seriously, so it's really hard to have fun while watching a movie. Personally, I thought the script was the biggest problem of the film. There were more holes in the plot than expected, and the film was lazy in explaining. I was hoping for a more in-depth study of the “butterfly effect”, but the film was more exciting than anything else. This is normal for me, since 90 minutes of mindless fun is still a good way to spend the evening. However, all the entertainment this movie offered was unintentional and inconclusive. There were a few scenes that kept me from having fun, but I was pretty bored. <br /> <br /> The game is not much better, as most of them seem to be more interested in salary than anything else. The only person who gave a good performance was Ben Kingsley. He left the first half of the movie enjoyable, and he seemed to have a lot of fun too. Edwards Burns was rather pale and soft. I do not think that he has what it takes to become a leading person. However, he could have made a decent supporting actor. Catherine McCormack was just very annoying and not very believable. I really did not see her in anything else, but she could have potential. The rest of the actors also give bad performances, although most of them are relatively unknown, so this should not greatly affect their careers. <br /> <br /> When looking at bulletin boards, most people complain about special effects. There is no way to embellish them, and they are terrible. All dinosaurs look very bad. Gibbon lizards (partly monkey, partly dino), although they are a creative idea, become obsolete after some time, and they most likely encourage laughter, not fear. Working with a green screen looks just awful and unprofessional. I was really wondering what director Peter Hyams was trying to achieve here. He is unable to convey tension, action and thrills and makes this film a long sitting. Although for the most part the film is quite harmless, and it is far from the worst film of 2005. I hope they will remake this film in the future. There is potential in this project, but so far this is the best we have received. After all, if curiosity does not overpower you, there is no reason to see "The Sound of Thunder." Rating 4/10
