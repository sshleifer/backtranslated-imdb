I think it would be a more appropriate name for this film, since it was added to the devil and returned with a stock of videos of various beetles and animals. I recently found The Prey in its original VHS “big box” form and was very excited. I just LOVE finding old slasher movies on VHS, because the cover is fantastic. However, it usually turns out that the film itself is less than fantastic. The Prey is one of those movies. <br /> <br /> To be honest, it all started well when the killer hunted down teenagers in a cliché in the woods. Used heartbeat sounds are a great effect that makes you tense while watching. This film, in fact, is a big bold cliche, and when the “Campfire Stories” section appears, the film takes on a new direction and spends almost half of the time on the background of the killer. I really thought it was a rather original idea. However, the prehistory suddenly ends and shows us some shots with a burning forest (the lack of a budget is really starting to manifest itself now). After that we return to the blunt teenagers who are caught in the forest. The killer himself is not shown to the end, which is a shame, because he actually makes the killer look spectacular. It seems like Kropsi from The Burning, but better. As for the blood, there is not so much here, although in the end there is a good wet face. <br /> <br /> In general, I would not recommend this film to anyone other than the slasher-polistists - this is really a big mess.
