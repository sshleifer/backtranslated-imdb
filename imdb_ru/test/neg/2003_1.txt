Very rarely does a movie appear that is so useless that I allowed the use of negative marks with IMDb. In fact, I remember this film and really can not remember the film in which so little went. Acting: joke right. Direction: None. Plot: No This film gives nothing if you take it as a serious film, it often happens in films of this genre, but most films of this type can be watched as if they were a comedy, and you can laugh at how pathetic the characters and situations are and you almost won time. This film is so empty that it is not even suitable for this purpose. I have to give it a -1/10, three points lower than any other movie I've ever rated. I really feel that the staff involved in this film have to pay me for the 83 minutes I spent watching it. I have no words to describe how bad it is. No one should ever watch this for any reason again.
