The only reason I didnâ€™t fall asleep during this movie is that the seats were not so comfortable. Hannibal is boring> boring> boring and boring !!! This film is just awful, not because of any violence or graphic injuries. It is actually quite boring in this regard. The story moves with the speed of a lazy snail. I have a feeling that director Ridley Scott just called. The actors are fine, they just needed some direction. The music is also very annoying. This is especially noticeable, since so little happens in the film. It looks good, but there are not enough reasons for this. By the way, did I already say that this is boring? <br /> <br />
