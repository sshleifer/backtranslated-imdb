Wow .. where do I start. I rented this film because it sounded like something that I would be interested to see. With a name like Val Kilmer, starring in this film, I thought how bad it could be? It must be the worst movie I've ever seen with such a big name. I wondered why he slipped through the cracks, and I never remember hearing anything about it when he first came out. It starts quite well, and to some extent resembles the opening sequence in Bourne's identity, but after about 30 minutes it gets worse and worse, and then goes to the WTF land. If you haven’t seen it, do yourself a favor and don’t rent it / don’t buy it if you are not a masochist or do not want to watch every Val Kilmer movie. There are still many titles that deserve your time. This film (if you can call it that) is a real waste of time. I want my 82 minutes ago.
