I am a big fan of the works of Deepa Mehta, especially the “Fire and Earth” of 1947. Unfortunately, in this film of hers there is no _all_ that is necessary for a good film. <br /> <br /> The film attempts to demonstrate the plight of widows in India in the early 20th century and a new wave of rehabilitation ideas around the same time. Shown with a child widow as the main character, although the plot is too banal from the Indian point of view, it could still be a very strong film. Alas! The film lacked both the sensitivity of Fire and the intensity of emotions on Earth in 1947. <br /> <br /> Even if we assume that the story is a given, although there are hundreds of things that I would have liked about it as well, making a film is especially unfortunate. All said. Everything is shown directly. No sensitive implied sentences. Lack of things remained unsaid. I just could not believe that it was a film about Deep Mehta. <br /> <br /> There were some very standard Hindi film characters - for example, an old widow with selfish interests or a father who has high standards of double standards. Is it possible to write a script without having these traditional Indian heroes of the film in the old style? <br /> <br /> Many people praised Deepa for making a film and proving his point against Hindu fundamentalists. Well, I agree that she took a bold step, but is it not worth worrying about the quality of the film or is it a controversial end in itself? Obviously, if you start with a story, as in Water, you will end up feeling the widows' pain in consideration - this does not require an experienced director. And there was nothing more than that in the movie !! So what is the contribution of Deepa to the film? <br /> <br /> And talk about acting, etc. - sorry !!! Lisa Ray has a beautiful face, a very beautiful face - but that’s what it ends with. She cannot speak Hindi; it can not be an emotion John Abraham is no better. Most widows seem unnatural. The grace of salvation is Sima Biswas and a young girl. They are incredible. <br /> <br /> And it was a historical film, but the dialogs in Hindi sucks. Even there, saying is as unnatural as it happens. No rustic accents !!! No local slang. There is nothing. The only thing that was right was probably shooting at places. I thought that the vidhwa-ashram set was quite real. A common blue tint throughout the film is also appropriate. <br /> <br /> But, in general, do not watch this movie. You will not get anything. There is nothing in history or direction. If you need to watch, see how the little girl plays.
