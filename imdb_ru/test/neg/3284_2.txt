I cringed when I heard the first canned track of laughter in the first few seconds of the show, but still I gave him a chance. You KNOW when someone offers a line that is just a little funny, and you hear a clearly fake track of laughter exploding with loud laughter that this show is aimed at morons who need to say "yes, it's funny, go and laugh" . /> <br /> Ugh. I could not stand this show because it showed itself. I can’t speak for everyone - after all, some people really like this “Stacked” Idiotic show (which makes me want to vomit). I can imagine that those who like “Stacked” can really love this nonsense. Some people still enjoy the old gag "pull my finger." For me, this show is just as witty - and about as original. <br /> <br /> The themes were old and weary. The jokes were lame and beaten. Those were the characters we saw before - and the worst of all you can imagine. <br /> <br /> So ... if you like words like belching and neighbors that say "pull my finger" .. you really might like this show. Otherwise ... pass by. This is stupid - and not in a clever or original way. This film is as old and tired as any show at its premiere.
