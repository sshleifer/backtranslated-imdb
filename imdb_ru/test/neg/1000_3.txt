First of all, I would like to say that I am a fan of all the actors who appear in this film, and at the time I was shooting it, I liked it. <br /> <br /> I think the main reason I was so disappointed was because the boxing promised me a thriller with an uncertainty. In my opinion, the alarming thriller for British films is similar to something from the novel by Ruth Rendell, in which there are many dark twists and turns that leave the viewer with a final that is unlikely to be forgotten soon. <br /> <br /> This film began with the promising note of being such a film. We have our main character, who suspects a man who does not like him, in participating in the attack, which killed the husband of one of his servants. His ideas are true, but the idea that his wife may be involved does not occur to him until she confesses to him that she was part of a crime. <br /> <br /> At that moment there were elements of a good action movie, but from there I felt that the film went in a different direction and became almost a kind of soap opera about who wants to be with whom and in what love of a real relationship. The film could have given me pleasure if the outer box spoke of a twisted lover's triangle and was not marked as an unknown thriller. It was more like a story from a soap opera, and the initial production seemed slightly distracting. true movie content. I felt that this film could have been much better than that. I felt that this continued to guide the viewer to a great event that never materialized. Therefore, I must give him a lower rating than I would like, and say that he did not live up to my expectations.
