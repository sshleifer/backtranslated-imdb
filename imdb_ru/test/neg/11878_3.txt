The latest Wesley Snipes movie right in the video is a tangled mess terribly reminiscent of Steven Seagal's latest work. The script is badly written and does not take into account the small budget and tries to be too smart for their own good. Unfortunately, Snipes fell into the trap of the fact that the voice of ADR doubles most of his dialogue, and the whole story that comes from time to time through the moments in the film. It is sad to see that the guy with the talent of Wesley Snipes makes trash like this film, and produces a tired and obviously bored presentation, barely bothering to create his own dialogue. It was a bit of a joke with Steven Seagal, the fact that he does not conduct his own dialogue, but this is not what I expected from Snipes. Perhaps this has to do with producer Andrew Stevens, who previously worked with Seagal, or with director Po-Chi Leong, who is responsible for the epically poor Seagal Out Of Reach. <br /> <br /> In the story involved dubious government officials, terrorists, who are coach of football teams, CDs with incriminating evidence and a hefty piece of missing money. Oh, and biological weapons. Now, how they are connected, I don’t know, but what I can tell you is a diabolical scenario, which is quite difficult to understand, and, like many of these DTV films, he likes to include one twist too much. The plot is also uninterestingly told, playing his cards with people who have dark one-on-one offices in dark alleys, etc. It's all like, "let's sit down and pick up some plot points for the sad bastards watching this movie!" the film itself suffers because, despite the drama of the performances and the storyline, there are some good scenes in the film. As an example of how the DTV film successfully showed the plotline of a twisted character, I will give Dolph Lundgren's directorial debut, The Defender. This film had its zest and excessive complexity, but in the film the last hour was almost entirely an action game, with Dolph in the siege of terrorists. The plot points are told in the context of the action, in motion, while avoiding death. The film does not stop to tell us what is happening, it does not break the tempo. Thus, although the plot was a bit confusing, it was more excusable, because the action never stopped. “Detonator,” like many of these films, stops everything, to give us a tangled walk about who is bad and who is not, before inevitably shifting this round in the extracted rear-end turn at the end. These films often suffer from career problems. <br /> <br /> Snipes himself, as I mentioned, is rather soft here. At first he puts on the identity of the camp, as he works undercover with some arms dealers. Initially, it seemed that he was enjoying himself, but, unfortunately, the rest of the film sees him and his random voice with double sleepwalking through the role. Snipes comes to life only when his name is kick ass. There are some good actions here, with some quick and crisp martial arts and good sharp skirmishes. The film also shows a decent car chase. Sylvia Kolloka is one of the main roles, and she doesn’t really look like an actress, but she’s gorgeous, with a costume that screams “Look at my splitting!” The rest of the cast comes in with cliches and uninteresting roles. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Snipes has the best projects lined up. He has another team with Mario Van Peebles who is called “Luck”, then he will play “Chasing the Dragon” from director Chris Naon, who starred in “The Kiss of the Dragon” by Jet Li. Finally, Snipes appears in the biographical series Toussaint, directed by Danny Glover. For Snipes, the future is getting brighter, but let's remember that he was very well paid for DTV films, about 7 million dollars for a film, perhaps even more. It’s also funny to think that of all these gods DTV Dolph Lundgren shoots the best films, directing himself, with a pleasant Defender and an extremely cruel and well-made Russian Specialist, and, moreover, he makes them into the budget share these devilish offers from Wesley and Steven Seagal produce. * 1/2
