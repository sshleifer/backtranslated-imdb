There seems to be a whole subgenre of cheap, tired old sex comedies that say the same thing about middle-class couples. Kind of like friends, but with softer porn and no wit. This film is no exception - he had such familiar situations that I died from deja vu. People sat on couches, spinning clich√©s about sex and relationships? Check it out. Monogamy or fraud with a woman / man who in reality would never look at another woman / man twice? Check it out. PORN villains !!!! 111? Check it out. Some guy / girl in him who turned out to be the only reason you are watching this garbage? Check it out. The lesson seems to be that when in doubt, you will make a weary old sex comedy about people that nobody cares about to make some statement that everyone has heard three thousand times before. This will make your movie. It won't even attract some comedians to anyone in a bad wig!
