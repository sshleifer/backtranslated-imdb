This movie is slow. This movie is cheap. This movie makes Friday the 13th look like a nomination for the best photo. Acting is shit. The special effects are crap. No one dies for about 40 minutes, and all people behave badly. The only thing that saves him is the ability to laugh at all this nonsense. The funny thing is to watch the heroine "discourage" the attacker. She must be trained, but fights like a 70-year-old. They conduct meaningless scenes on people who do not die, and on people who die to such an extent that even you do not know why they die. I love slashers, but this is just crap.
