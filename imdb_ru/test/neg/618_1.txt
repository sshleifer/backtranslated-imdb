Lance Henriksen is able to play the main role in the B-film, even in this case starring with Charles Naper, Master Control and Jo Don Baker. As always, he copes well with the role of the bad guy, but the plot is just bad (don't even tell me about the ending). And the editing is so awful that it can actually be beautiful. Is it just me, or does Joe Don Baker seem to have been included in the movie at the last minute? Also, every time the glass is broken in this film, editing is so anti-phenomenal. Finally, after watching it, I believe that David Warner dies for Tron 2.0 to finally get the green light. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Feloni, this will be the third film I rate 1/10, joining Iron Eagle IV and No Grace.
