The game is awkward and creepy, and not in a good way ... in general. Writing, dialogue and chemistry between actors is terrible. Nothing makes sense, and each close-up of an actor's expression or reaction lasts 3 or 4 seconds longer, which resembles a Mexican soap opera (telenovella). Everything about writing is unrealistic, and all the actors involved make it a lot worse with their obscene interpretations of the original. Am I the only one who sees this ??? Using the word cheesy to describe this Canadian catastrophe would be an understatement of the century. The director generally watched the final movie before being broadcast ???
