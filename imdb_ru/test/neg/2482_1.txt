Wow ... not in a good way. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that people are digging this garbage. Most television broadcasts are pretty bad, and for a while this has become a trend - they are only getting worse, but Las Vegas definitely takes them home. What a terrible show ... <br /> <br /> The actors are a bunch of C + losers who haven't gone anywhere (except for James Caan ... who knows what he was thinking about when he signed up for this post) so this is not their fault that this show sucks. They just can't help it. Blame producers and writers. I can't believe they shot it and were actually proud enough of their work to show it.
