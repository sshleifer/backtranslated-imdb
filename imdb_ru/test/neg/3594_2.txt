The "threat" is not funny. He tries very hard - too hard. but rarely causes a smile. There is no acting skills, just rob. One of the main characters wears a silly grimace on the face of the entire film. Without a doubt, since the less talented brothers of Vayana were filmed, wrote and produced the film, they were completely blind due to lack of talent. <br /> <br /> The threat consists of a series of unfunny parody jokes. The highlight can be seen a mile away, but you have to wait until it unfolds. No lightning quick line-ups or instant dialogue here. Just one scene after another, before the joke. The jokes themselves are minors. Lok Dog (the one with the perma-face) talks to a beautiful woman - but then she has ... bad breath, and then she picks her nose and then waits for him (remember that you should always know) farts! How funny is that? To ten-year-old boys it may seem ridiculous, because they would not have heard these jokes many times before. Alternatively, if you like to watch movies completely drunk or stoned, you can watch them and even find it funny. The task will get drunk enough to reduce your mental state to the level of the film without losing consciousness.
