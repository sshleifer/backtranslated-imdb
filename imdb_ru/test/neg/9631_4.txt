By 1971, it was becoming increasingly clear that Hammer’s film studios were going out of the game. The hands of the spine - this is the case when even the idea smacks of despair - the spirit of Jack the Ripper has his own daughter! Yes, well, no one expected a documentary, but this plot seems to be scratching the bottom of the barrel because of the stupid premise, and you wonder why the hell the producers brought Jack the Ripper into the story. Was it to give the film a quick title? <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are not impressive, and cinematography gives the whole movie a feeling of cheap TVM, but you know that you will not watch the classic Hummer horror as its name begins, because the music is ridiculous inappropriate I think the composer tried to make the melody pursue and touch, but the music resembles something from a juicy romantic film. I will pay tribute to the actors, as they take their roles in the film, which is far from serious, seriously. <br /> <br /> I didn’t like this movie very much, and he immediately reminded me of “The Ghostly Crimson Blower from the City of London” of two Ronnie, whom I laughed a few weeks before I saw it
