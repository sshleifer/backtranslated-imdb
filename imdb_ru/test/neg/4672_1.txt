I like action movies. I have a softspot for "B" movies with a bad dialogue and a wooden game. So, I puzzled over to come up with one of my wine pleasures, which was worse than this blockbuster. I can’t make it harder for you to put together a bigger piece of cr * r than this Bruce Willis car. <br /> <br /> Armageddon is the story (and I freely use this term) of the “Super-Drillers” team. “Fly away to destroy the asteroid before it destroys the Earth. Realistic? Actually, no. But who cares? It's a fighter. I’m not undermining the premise. <br /> <br /> Minor spoilers: <br /> < br /> The film begins with a couple of scenes intended to represent the threat and characters. Bruce Willis is a tough team leader and spends his first time on the screen chasing Ben Affleck with a gun for the unforgivable act of sleeping with his daughter. For some reason, this it didn't make me laugh. It was forcibly, like everything else in this film. <br /> <br /> The team is called because they are the only people in the world who can drill an asteroid. Well, I’m ready to accept this premise if it pushes us into action — the film’s intended meat. More humor attempts, with each character doing that crazy, crazy before exploding. Lame again. Finally, they take off. That's where the movie really offended me. They arrive on a rock and get to work. Do you believe that nothing is working correctly, and everything has a countdown timeout! Whoah! Ten, nine, eight ... one - Oh, an amazing surprise, we saved the day again! <br /> <br /> And don't even get me to shoot. When I saw it in the theater, I thought I would be sick. I can only assume that they were trying to hide the gigantic holes left by tasteless performances, cutting out a new picture once every few seconds (and this is from someone who picked up on MTV - Mr. himself a little attention). <br /> <br /> Just when I thought that it couldn’t be worse ... wait - this is the finished tear-off finale that was so attached to him that the rest of the film became a virtual citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Summary: Wit was not witty. The plot is - well, I said I would let it go. The game was bad. Really bad. Even Billy Bob could not rise above the script, which was worse. Camera work is bad again. (I did not even mention the most stupid love scene in the history of cinema - think about crackers with animals). <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10. (I give half a point to Steve Buscemi, who makes me smile against my will and another half point for the time when I was able to look at beautiful Liv Tyler and try ignore her acting game) This is the worst movie I've ever seen in a theater. .. ever.
