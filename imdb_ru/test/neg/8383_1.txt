This film is a nightmare! The feeling that you feel when you wake up from a nightmare is the same as mine, when I finished watching this movie: "Uff ?? OK, it was all over, what a relief!" It was painful to watch this movie, so bad! This is an inexpensive B series film, that's for sure, but I think this is no excuse for being so bad! I watched brilliant inexpensive films, with good plots, good staging, good acting and, most importantly, with some content! This has nothing! The plot is funny, it looks like “an American guide on how to turn ancient Chinese mythology into a funny teen movie, in which some children play with the occult” ?? I do not know if the real Chinese fairy tale is in this film or not, but if this is so, then the “damage” is even worse! Production is just awful, just zero (what are these “special effects”?). There is no waiting. Estimated voltage scenes are a total failure. The game is no better; What about conversations? Oh my God! The film, in which several times there are dialogues like: “I will pass there later, okay? Is that good? ”Good, good. - Good? I am sure that it does not deserve more than 1/10 points! <br /> <br /> It is a pity that this is true!
