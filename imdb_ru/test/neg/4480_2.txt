Well, it's watchable if you are sick in bed or you have nothing else to do. The suspension of disbelief required for the passage of this film is significant, though. First, do you think that in today's modern society, college students get IT from someone in such a short period of time, even if you are a “virtuous” Habitat volunteer who likes autistic children? And the two-week novel flourishes in exchange of letters, which leads to John’s “conflict” about whether to re-record immediately after 9/11/01 ... REALLY? He asks her what to do? Every guy we know was NOT going to sit away after those Towers fell (my husband was one of them, and I love him and am proud of him for leaving). John has such a flat character. He is almost indifferent to the whole movie. He looks good, but not Spec Ops ... he seems insecure, insecure, quiet instead of raising hell, without tattoos, engaging in a “fight” with neat guys who are really nothing but a match ... walks around almost without a cover on the head almost the entire film ... and everywhere there are military-technical flaws (epaulets upside down?). The scenes of the war are stupid ... John and another guy go alone ... huh? your back to the shelter ... it's a firefight for God's sake, you will not stop fighting until the end ... damn, I wanted to shoot John in the back. Returning home when the truth is revealed, and she pours wine ... we hated her for taking off his shirt ... WTH? break his heart and then tease him in adultery? She is a trollop from the head case. The best part of the film is when he leaves from her ... at least he felt there with respect and honor. In general, an incredible story and we do not care about these characters or their love. Gloomy!
