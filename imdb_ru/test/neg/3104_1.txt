the worst movie I've ever seen, I didn't even watch it all, I just quickly sent it to pieces by Bert, and then the end! he is the only reason to look at it !! I have to admit that I own a copy, because I am a HUGE fan of Burt (stop laughing), and I needed it for my collection. I wouldnâ€™t care when this movie came out, I had a horrible rental, as there were only 2 copies in my local store and fans of all the stars always beat me there, imagine my disappointment when I sat down and watched this movie !! ABOUT THIS FILM IS NOT ONLY PROFITABLE QUALITY !!! Absolutely NOTHING THAT SO EVER LIKE ABOUT THIS FILM !!! this film was a joke between me and the worst comrade bert !! Rob Lowe's worst worst hour and half my life
