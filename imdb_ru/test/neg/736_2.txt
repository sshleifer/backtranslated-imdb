I saw some horrible book adaptations to the film on my day, but this one surpasses them all! The strangely unattractive cast cast off the story, which in itself does not fit the book. Mr. Tilney does not look beautiful; As for Catherine Morland, a rat-like appearance makes this character difficult to sell to a sympathetic audience. Isabella is not at all like Aphrodite, which is read in the original text, and James Morland appears in the film too little for the viewer to at least somehow understand his important role in the story. In addition, as others have pointed out, this novel was intended to satiate the gothic fascination that was common in Austin's time, but it seems that this film of “soft horror” was designed and intended to be serious. I’m sure Jane Austen turns in his grave every time one of her fans is disappointed with this horrible interpretation of what was supposed to be a joke.
