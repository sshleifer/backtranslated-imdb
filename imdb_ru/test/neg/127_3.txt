I love science fiction and am ready to put up with many things. Sci-fi / tv films are usually underfinanced, undervalued and misunderstood. I tried to love it, really did, but it is for good science fiction, like Babylon 5 for Star Trek (original). Stupid prosthetics, cheap cardboard sets, unnatural dialogues, computer graphics that do not match the background, and painfully one-dimensional characters cannot be overcome with the help of "science fiction." (I’m sure there are some of you who think that “Babylon 5” is a good science fiction television. It’s not. It’s cliche and boring.) While US viewers may like the development of emotions and character, scientific fiction is a genre that doesn't take yourself seriously (cf. Star Trek). This may relate to important issues, but not to serious philosophy. It’s really hard to take care of the characters, because they are not just stupid, they just miss the spark of life. Their actions and reactions are wooden and predictable, often painful to watch. The creators of the Earth I KNOW that this is rubbish, because they must always say "Gene Roddenberry's Land ...", otherwise people will not continue to look. Roddenberry's ashes must be spinning in their orbit, as this boring, cheap, badly edited (viewing it without advertising breaks really brings it home), trabant from Trabant show, jumps into space. Spoiler. So kill the main character. And then return it as another actor. Jeeez! Dallas again and again.
