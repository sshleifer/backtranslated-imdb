I did not think that this film was very good at all. In fact, they took a few lines from various Shirley Temple films, put them together, and Orr behaved as if Shirley Temple was acting on the screen. "Oh my God!" It has been said quite a few times. If you are familiar with the films of Shirley Temple, you will learn a few lines from her films. The trouble is that Orr says this in Shirley’s daily life. In the end, we get the jumble of newly created Shirley Temple films, and not some real look at Shirley Temple’s life. Rid yourself of the hassle and rent Shirley Temple movies, it's much better than watching Orr try to recreate Shirley's playing style.
