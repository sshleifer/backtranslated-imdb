Was it a film based on a novel written by a modern literary god, who is Kunz? I refuse to believe that the studio bought the rights to this film for anything using the name Genius Koontz. Since my vision has become so bad that I needed a large print, I could not read this book, since I had read it at least twice a year since its first reading. I missed the book a lot and could not find it in large print. <br /> <br /> I hoped that by renting this film, I would at least enjoy my Deputy Observer, but this film was a travesty. Because of the subtle plot, I believe that not one of the books of Mr. Kunz or the most worthy authors in this regard can be squeezed into a movie in 1-2 hours. <br /> <br /> It will be a wise network, through a cable or other channel that buys the rights to this novel and makes a film of several parts, that is, a mini-series, from this book RIGHT! <br /> <br /> One star out of five - if I could go lower ...
