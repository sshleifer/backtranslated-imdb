Look no further, this is the worst movie ever made. There may be others that are related, but not worse. It can not be. <br /> <br /> I found this film on a laser disc with a sale for 3.25 dollars and thought that no film with these actors could cost such a price. It turns out it costs three times as much - at the very least that they had to pay me to watch it. <br /> <br /> I’m pretty sure that the girl in the picture on the cover of the package is not the girl in the movie, they replaced someone else, someone younger and prettier to make it look more attractive. Whatever the “plot” was, it was about three minutes of a real film, the rest is filler. And I do not mean that type of filler, which, as you understand, is a filler when it is finished, or it is a kind of candy, which you do not mind, I mean a filler that makes you think about your shopping list. I think that "music" should have been written by someone with a friend who had a radio that he listened to once. It's horrible. <br /> <br /> If there was a beautiful mountain, river valley, forest or something else in the frame, there would be something positive in this film. No Even with the speeder button on the remote control, even at the maximum speed of the laser disc, you can’t get it done quite quickly. <br /> <br /> After many years of thinking about commenting on films, temptation, but not registering with IMDb, I finally hacked it because I had to do my part to minimize the user rating on this stinker. <br /> <br /> The guidelines suggest “focusing on content and context.” I can not Insufficient content on which to focus, and this is my point of view. Sometimes bad is just bad, and this film should be much better than trying to be just that.
