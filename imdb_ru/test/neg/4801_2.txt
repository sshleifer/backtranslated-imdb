This is the film that interests me, why someone would decide to do it from the very beginning. This is such a film that I cannot understand how people invest money in it, how a rental store can put a DVD on its shelves. This is a movie in which I blame myself for shooting it. <br /> <br /> There are good films of class B, and I do not refuse the genre. When they are good, they show an interest in the action, they have well-written characters, and they acted well enough for you to take care of them. The effects in some of these films support the film in many cases, and you might like them for their originality. Almost nothing is true in Coronado. The theme and script are at the level of cheap comics - just a cliche. The effects are cheap — and I don’t care that a movie is low-budget — you can do a lot with a small budget, but you need talent. There are so many continuity and other directional mistakes as in ten other films. You are not interested in characters, you are not laughing, and at the end of the film you ask yourself whether the parody was intended or not. The only quality I could find was landscapes, there are some good places worthy of a much better movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10 on my personal scale. The worst movie of the year.
