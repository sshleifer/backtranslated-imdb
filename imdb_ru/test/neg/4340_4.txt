The only thing in “Sudden Death” that exceeds the number of non-stop actions is an incredible number of holes in the plot. As with this, and a huge number of tricks, can hardly be called what remains of the storyline. To say that the script is borrowed from the premise of "Die Hard" would mean making the most blatant understatement in the world! <br /> <br /> Here we have a restless hero working on a huge indoor rink in Pittsburgh as a fire marshal. On the night of the seventh game in the series of finals, he receives tickets so that he can carry his alienated children to the decisive game and, of course, spend some time with them. Also catching the match, but for political reasons, the vice president of the United States (Raymond J. Barry). When a group of incredibly well-organized mercenaries seizes the vice-president’s box and demands hundreds of millions of public money, our hero Darren McCord is more than a little upset about his plans. <br /> <br /> Every time a new one, these formulas are created in such a way that it seems that everything we get on the path of innovation is nasty bad guys and more and more spectacular and disgusting ways that good guys get rid of them . Director Hyams and his screenwriter went up (not that it was original sin), trying to make us hate evil terrorists. Terrible villains go on to shoot the security services, security services and civilians (both old and young), leaving gays without special attention to the relative threat of each victim. <br /> <br /> Van Damme does a lot of punching handcuffs and shootouts, heroics and deadly tricks. The script asks a little about a muscular European. Almost everyone has postings, with the exception of Powers Booth, who seriously overzealous in his written, petty role as the most cruel, meanest old ring leader of all who has ever existed. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of smart cinema and an explosive enough special effect to keep someone awake. But in fact, this is all that this action movie has, action. Although there are some elegant sequences, nothing can be called insanely brilliant. <br /> <br /> Saturday, February 10, 1996 - Grand Union Melbourne
