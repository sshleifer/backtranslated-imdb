Well, in the episode I just watched, the eldest “Gastino Girl” whined about why people keep mentioning her husband (Mr. Gastino, apparently, a famous American football player). It seems that she does not want to admit that he is the only reason she does not throw up hamburgers, she married someone famous, and therefore she has cameras aimed at her. <br /> <br /> When the interviewer asked me to explain what she was doing, she gave an amazing reason why people should pay attention to her: “I work a lot on my reality show.” Then she said: "I am not a celebrity ... I am a person." <br /> <br /> I’m not quite sure who this series is for, with the exception of people who have all their intellects removed. This, of course, is not a role model for anyone except gold miners, since the two stars do nothing but spend money, and all that they say about rich people is that they have no problems with money.
