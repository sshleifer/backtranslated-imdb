I know that we should not expect much from a low-budget indie film. But the idea is justified: an attempt to open the eyes of America to the pleasant relationship between the government and the journalists who need to follow this. But somehow the documentary aspect of this takes away his drama. The protests during the Republican convention in New York in 2004 were not so compelling as to make a documentary about it. Such convincing protests date back to the 1960s. <br /> <br /> It would be better to stick with the dramatic format. Perhaps the slow build-up, when the eyes of a young journalist gradually open to conspiracy.
