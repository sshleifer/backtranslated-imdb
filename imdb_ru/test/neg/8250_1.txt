So many fans, so few to show it. I know, I know, these words will find me in the overwhelming minority. Many really liked the goodwill hunt. But seriously, please, the great film making is not even close, and let's put the blame on where it belongs ... in writing. <br /> <br /> Now I know that they won an Oscar for it, and the boy made it look good on the screen. But Good Will Hunting is a after-school gambling game with a lot of curses and a bit more budget. <br /> <br /> What this film shows is the magnificence of Harvey Weinstein and Miramax Pictures. Mr. Weinstein could take the manure, feed him and make you believe that you are eating bon. And this is exactly what the studio did to the film. They created such a big faluttin buzz around them that people believed and so much wanted to believe it - that they saw brilliance where it was not there. <br /> <br /> Now I know that some people think that this is a great movie, I don’t think this is a terribly bad movie, I like to compare it with other movies in the middle of the road, as well as with some great movies “Made for Television” (although not HBO movies, HBO movies are unusually better than the Goodwill Hunt someday.) It's just a good little movie, with some good ideas, Robin Williams was not good at it, they just gave Oscar to him, because he was impatient to do it for a while. And, of course, the public relations machine Miramax provided Ben and Matt with their screenwriting Oscar ... but people will come ... there are better films than GWH.
