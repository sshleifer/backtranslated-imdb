Just saw this movie at the premiere. I read some other user comments that convinced me to go see it ... I must say, I was not impressed. I'm not so impressed that I feel the need to write this comment to save some of you some money. <br /> <br /> First of all, “The Messengers” are very predictable, and simply are not a thriller. It may be scary for someone under the age of 13, but it really did nothing for me. The climax was ludicrous, and most of the audience went before the resolution of the film. <br /> <br /> In addition, the game was a bit superficial. Some of the emotional disputes between family members were less convincing than irregular waiting scenes. <br /> <br /> If you saw the preview for this film, then you saw most of the best parts and gained a strong understanding of the plot. This film is not worth watching in cinemas.
