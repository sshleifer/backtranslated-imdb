The subspecies is set up in Romania, where two American students of the college, Michelle (Laura May Tate) and Lilian (Michelle McBride), come to study local folklore with the help of a local girlfriend, Mary (Irina Movila). There, they rent rooms in a hotel and begin to be interested in the mysterious ruins of a nearby castle. It turns out that there lives a powerful and evil vampire named Radu (Anders Howe), who stole the Bloodstone from his father, King Vladislav (Angus Scrimma). Radu is fond of three girls and starts drinking the blood of Mary and Lilian, and Michelle falls in love with a guy named Stefan (Michael Watson), who, as it turned out, is Radu's brother. Michelle and Stefan decide to unite and rid the world of evil Radu ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Ted Nicolaou, this film seems to be very much appreciated among fans of the genre, and although it is not terrible, I certainly will not I would say that this is very good, and I do not see anything that could be worried about. “Subspecies” is a rather slow film, in fact, not so much is happening, and although he tries to keep closer to certain classical knowledge about vampires, there is all this nonsense about the Bloodstone and some small monsters that for some reason grow out of tips of severed fingers Radu. A subspecies could be a half decent movie, if it were not for that boring movie, I really can't remember whether this is good or bad. The character is fine, but some dialogues are stupid, and there is a scene that scared me at the very beginning, when the girls are standing on the ruins of the castle, and someone says they have to go, because it is getting dark, but it's still the middle of the day . very bright. There is also a scene in which one of the American girls finds a coffin in the attic of the hotel and it seems that it does not bother him, I'm not funny, but some guy, in whose house I stayed, had a coffin in the attic, I would be very, worry very much if you know what I mean. I don’t think I’d ever want to see it again, there’s no real threat, the plot is weak, which mixes classic vampire themes with silly scenes, and all this has obviously not touched me. Not the worst movie, but not the best. <br /> <br /> The film looks good, with good locations and local landscapes, although you feel that the appearance is limited by the budget, and the creators are not trying to authentic. There is not much blood there, except for decapitation and broken fingertips. For no apparent reason, the creators have added little-looking animated monsters to the game that really do nothing or make a big difference to the plot. <br /> <br /> Filmed cheaply by the director of "Full Moon" Charles Band. The company in Bucharest in Romania, production values ​​are in order and better than those of many later Band producers. The acting is not very good, as many actors play below the nominal level, while in the ordinary Angus Scrimma genre there is a small cameo in the beginning. Sometimes there is a bit of style, with several scenes that strongly resemble the original Nosferatu (1922), in particular, a fragment showing the shadow of Radu, descending the stairs with his long claw, like nails. <br /> <br /> “Subview” is a film that many people like for reasons that I don’t quite understand, I thought it was, at best, too average and generally rather boring. This is followed by “Bloodstone: Subspecies II” (1993), “Bloodthirst: Subspecies III” (1994), “Subspecies 4: Bloodstorm” (1998) and the film “Vampire Magazine” (1997).
