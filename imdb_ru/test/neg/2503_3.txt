Wow. I felt like I needed to take a shower after seeing this, but there may have been other reasons that I leave to your imagination. I felt used and humiliated after fooling around, I mean watching this movie. Hairy chests, thick mustaches, and also, hairy everything describes this porn / horror movie, but hey, it was 1981, you can't call it “porn” in the 70s and 80s without hair. <br /> Like a horror movie, it bites. But as part of the exploitation / porn with rich cinematographic Historico Italy, this certainly takes place in my library. I have a copy in Italian with English subtitles. I wish he had really badly duplicated English, I think it would add to the awkwardness factor that already existed. The only white guy filmed in the film is “Mark Shannon” - he is dressed in a mustache, with a muscular hairy torso, who really tries to come out every time he “approaches a beat.” It was at the end of an era when porn producers were actually trying to do something artistic. Nothing compares to turning the camera from a tropical background to a hairy man engaged in doggy sex with a woman. I can not stop laughing. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films about which I pray that my future wife and children would not be found.
