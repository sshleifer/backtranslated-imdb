When choosing the voting option, there was no 0, so I was forced to use the next available digit. <br /> <br /> This is a sad day for Bollywood, when such films, in which there are actors of star composition, nothing more. This is not just an acting game for minors, but a terrible scenario. <br /> <br /> This film is far from being a clone of Hitch. Salman Khan with his usual theme “take off your shirt” and Govinda with his ridiculous laugh. If someone had said 2 decades ago that I would write a commentary to Salman (after his success at Maine Pyar Kiya), I would have written it off.
