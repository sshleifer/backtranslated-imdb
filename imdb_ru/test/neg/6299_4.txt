This film tries hard, but fails. Perhaps for a non-Australian audience this may seem like a journey, but for the natives it is simply tiring. <br /> <br /> Anyone who lives here knows that Broken Hill is a rough, tough isolated mining town. If a pair of battered fruit turns out to be a drag, itâ€™s all so predictable. Where have I come across this worn topic before? Oh yeah - Urban Mouse and Rural Mouse. Spare us <br /> <br /> I continued to hope that this would improve, but after the scene at Broken Hill, I saw where this was going, and so I turned off the TV and went to sleep.
