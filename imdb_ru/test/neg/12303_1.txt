Shame Shame Shame on UA ​​/ DW for what you do! <br /> <br /> I was terrified. <br /> <br /> DO NOT take children to watch this movie. Humor is absolutely not suitable for children - besides, they will be bored and disappointed. Of course, * we * all * read Theo's wonderful children's book, and, of course, we have expectations ... but this is pure rubbish. Dr. Suze would be embarrassing, and he certainly would never have thrown his “thumbs up” with such a mean attempt to capitalize on the classics. <br /> <br /> What a pity. <br /> <br /> Spend your money on a book. If you have a copy, buy a book and donate it to the Toys for Toddlers program. This movie is NOT worth the "free" viewing of tickets. <br /> <br /> Stick to the book. The TV animation version works well, if you want a visual image - save your money ... seriously. SAVE your money - they will be on a telegram to the day of St. Patty. <br /> <br /> Shame, shame, what they do !!
