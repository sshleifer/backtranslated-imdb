I really love the first three films, they were great! Once I caught Part 5 on VHS 10 years ago, and I was disappointed. But maybe it was because I never saw the fourth, because they were killed back to back. but after watching the copy today, I have to say that it was no better than number 5. My expectations were not high from the very beginning, but this is cheap material for live video, not even a horror film, this is PG-13. The acting was not convincing, the story was rather stupid without any excitement and there were not many effects. But the main problem is that there were no murders or bloody rushes (an annoying child who is killed in his car should have been the main point, but come on ..) <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, but also parts 4, and 5 were directed by sequel director Jeff Barr, who gave us a great stepfather II and Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. I liked Puppet Master: The Legacy, even if it was nothing more than a tribute to the best scenes from all the films. <br /> <br /> In general, Puppet Master is very similar to Hellrahâ€™s TV series: a great trilogy, but forget the rest ..
