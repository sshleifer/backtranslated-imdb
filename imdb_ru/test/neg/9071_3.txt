The cast of "All That" returns in good spirits to Good Burger, a place similar to an old-fashioned fast-food restaurant. The comedy is awesome, the fun is non-stop, and, although cliche, this is a passage for a children's and family comedy. <br /> <br /> A film for all ages, this film is intended to enjoy, laugh and beautiful. Too lazy movie for a rainy day, because this is what I would save this movie, a rainy day. The USA showed it today, and since I know that it has the cast of All That, I thought it might be something like a torch of laughter, but in good entertainment, like Keenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell (maybe , one of the best young duets of that time) were amazing together, the pieces came together, and it all worked, and it turned it into good family fun along with some lazy day work to get out of a bad day. <br /> <br /> Can I take your order?
