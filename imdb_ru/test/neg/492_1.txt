Well ........ how and where should I begin to describe this complete nonsense? Imagine the morals of an obscene Hollywood western, add a generous portion of the most banal soap opera storyline and try to fool the children, thinking that this is cool by putting them into something “modern”. This film is a complete package and absolutely no substance. <br /> <br /> It begins with a promise ...... young people who dream of becoming rock stars and engage in excessive worship of heroes that everyone can laugh at. After that, everything goes down ... faster than bobsleigh without brakes. The scene with the first concert with Steel Dragon is one of the most miserable plays of “cinematic kitsch,” which I have seen in a long time. The singer appears on the stage for his debut and falls down the stairs ..... he will get up and sing ??? ...... or he will stay there on the floor and will not sing ...... who cares ?? The situation is worsening, but I do not want to tire myself, remembering this in all its painful details. If you watch it after this review, it's your fault!
