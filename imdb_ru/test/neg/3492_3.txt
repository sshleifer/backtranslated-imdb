Given the incredible reviews of this film, I was expecting something really exceptional. This, of course, begins well with a witty and sharp dialogue and precise overlay. A series of intertwined stories in the style of Robert Altman stuns the viewer with breathtaking scenes. I found this exciting entertainment until the second half of the film, when, unfortunately, it collapses like a deck of cards. A series of ridiculous coincidences and plausible messages develops until I remain deeply disappointed and wonder what all this noise is about. Paul Haggis took up the theme of the Los Angeles race, and that alone seemed to take this film to a new level of interest. Given that the majority of Academy voters live in Los Angeles and are to some extent faced with racism, this film is bound to affect them. This means that the Oscar for the best picture will go into a racing movie or a gay movie. Hopefully, this is the last, because Brokeback Mountain is a true masterpiece that deserves recognition.
