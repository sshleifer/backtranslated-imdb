Watching the exorcism of BLACKWATER VALLEY, I ran into incredibly bad scripts and dialogues, and I was convinced that it was supposed to be a comedy. Several options for dialogue worthy of lively laughter: "I ate a rabbit." "I told you she was obsessed!" “Are you telling me that the devil is in my daughter?!” <br /> <br /> There are many, many, but you have to discover it for yourself - if you dare. <br /> <br /> the story unfolds in all directions, and things happen that probably should not happen, and everyone seems to be a pervert or a psycho in some way (even the Priest). And I didn't even get into a bad game. The most famous guy in this area is Isabel's father. The director must have just told him to act like he has the remorse of conscience @ $$, because this is a general impression that you can get. <br /> <br /> I don’t want to divert anyone from exile from the Black Sea valley, because there is entertainment value that you need to have ... for all the wrong reasons, but if you are looking for a decent horror film that makes sense really scary ... well, run, do not walk.
