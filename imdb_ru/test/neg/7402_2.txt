Dresden had high expectations because of its exciting theme and its high budget. I was really looking forward to it, and I really wanted it to be good ... but it’s not. The only good thing is the special effects that are very well done, but, like in a really bad Hollywood blockbuster, everything else is missing. <br /> <br /> Badly written, the script tries to match the genre rules with standard elements of obscurity / love story, but there is no depth or originality at all. This is far below average. Next thing: this is also badly directed. He has this uninteresting style of a television director with a lot of close-ups and a desire to be a great action thanks to quick editing, where there is virtually no action or expectation. The actors are not bad, but there is not a single touching performance. <br /> <br /> I don’t know ... they are obviously trying to make a typical television film, not a film for a movie where it’s always good to have some edges and a clear visual style. But why are they trying to follow typical commercial Hollywood rules? it really looks like the screenwriter did a lesson in class with some American screenwriter guru, and then delivered this mess. Is there no producer who is in charge of a project who is interested in dramaturgy / visual style or just in these magical cinematic moments that make some TV movies gorgeous?!? Do they think that the television audience is stupid and does not need a quality movie? “The Fall” was a very good example for a good television film, but perhaps there was some manager or producer who knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on this, remove the "fall" instead of ...
