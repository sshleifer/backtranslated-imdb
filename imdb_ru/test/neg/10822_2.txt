A mixed group of “experts” (researchers, divers, and scientists) runs the risk of walking a mile underground and going another 2.4 miles under water to a place more remote where they find salamanders, giant albino moles (??) and some large, razor-covered fangs, winged computer creatures lurking around. The cave is captured with rockfalls, and then the monsters attack and start killing everyone when they are looking for a way out. And this is all she wrote with the help of this low goal, which does not even combine action, science fiction and horror at the most elementary levels. Imagine if someone gave the guys on the Science Fiction Channel $ 30 million to make a movie about monsters. This is exactly what CAVE looks like; sometimes almost striking in their inability, full of cliches and almost completely dependent on special effects for fun. The only difference is that they had more money to create the scenery, more money to polish the monsters and more money to hire supposedly professional actors, who in any case give terrible performances. Otherwise, it is business as usual. Some of these films are still fun to watch. This is not the case, and there are many reasons why: <br /> <br /> 1.) He takes himself too seriously and has no sense of humor. Thus, you get a completely non-original and predictable film that does not even recognize how non-original and predictable it is. <br /> <br /> 2.) The opening sequence does not make sense except to kill a few minutes and add redundancy. <br /> <br /> 3.) Unusual CGI-creatures do not impress anyone this day and age. <br /> <br /> 4.) Using shakycam and fast editing for your horror movies is just a lazy, unimaginable film making. And why even darken the action by making things too dark And adding annoying distractions, such as fire and a burst of bubbles? This makes these scenes not only difficult to view, but also impossible to enjoy even at a simple level of action. <br /> <br /> 5.) Although he wants you to take him seriously, the script is full of cliché, the dialogue is terrible and there are no attempts to give a characterization. Using 25-year-old models in the role of brilliant scientists and rude veteran researchers can bring some joy, but it completely kills the credibility of the film, which otherwise plays out completely straightforward. Sorry, you cannot have both. <br /> <br /> 6.) There were two exceptions to the model rule, since they decided to play the old guy and the middle Joe. These were the first two killed characters. <br /> <br /> 7.) For a little variety, they also squeeze a black guy and a Chinese. Oddly enough, none of them got a big voice in this film and mostly stands in the background, as Whitey discusses what their next move will be. Insult <br /> <br /> 8.) In addition, how many films need to be made when a black character sacrifices his life at the very end, just so that the Hot White Female Leader and the Hot White Male Lead come together at the end? Ugh. Give me a break. <br /> <br /> 9.) Most of the acting skills were HORRIBLE. Cole Hauser’s speech was ridiculous. The other male character looked as if he had just left the set of The Soap Opera and used the patented smiley-dimple-making-everyone-offended technique, which is the PG-13 gender switch, equivalent to mine. The technique of “big breasts makes all the guys faint”, often used by women in films rated R. In any case, his performance was fully voiced. Daniel De Kim (from the series “Lost”) and Piper Perabo also stunned the room with their delivered monotonous line. <br /> <br /> 10.) Was the end a joke? Absolutely awful. Lord, we do not need a sequel to this garbage. <br /> <br /> So basically, I wouldn't worry about it, if only you had never seen a movie about monsters before or if you just really despaired and the only thing that is on “Simple Life”. The sets were good, everything was in order with the blue-tinted photo, and some of the actors (Lena Heedy, Marcel Yurese ...) tried their best, so I decided to raise the rating by one notch to 2.
