The trio sits down at a table in a restaurant and silently looks into space. Later they lean on the railing and look across the channel to England. A person is constantly working with a hoe in his garden, only his head and upper body are visible on the screen. A man and a woman watch another man urinate against a stone wall. Each of these silent shots lasts about one full minute. Absolutely not reported any information that can not be provided to us for about a quarter of the time. The editor must be half asleep. I know that was. <br /> <br /> The film opened with a striking picture of a raw vagina of a clearly dead body. The gorge rises. But then the policeman (Shott) exchanges a few words with the next couple and begins to rush after them, and the matter is forgotten for the next half hour, while Shott and his friends exchange unfriendly insults with each other and with strangers. In the end, the thread of the case is taken again, but it goes slowly, almost aimlessly, in accordance with the style pattern already established. <br /> <br /> Sometimes in such films, shooting using a location creates an atmosphere that compensates for the dullness of the story, but not here. The houses of the French village are interconnected in long rows. Facades of the house adjoin the sidewalk directly, without steps. The facades are practically not decorated and practically indistinguishable. Flat farmland faceless. What could have been one of the most interesting episodes — a visit to a stone fort on the coast — tires the trio until they start behaving like snails and are asked to leave. <br /> <br /> Actions are minimal, No one seems to be particularly eager to say something. No joke. Nothing funny happens. The cop face is almost as interesting as Randy Quaid's. The baby, a tall, hefty blonde, looks like a pusher of a kernel on steroids that East Germans used at the Olympics. <br /> <br /> I spent more than an hour before leaving him. Maybe I'll use this another time. If I haven’t missed something or until it turns into some kind of crazy Monty Python routine by the end, I don’t think you’ll get a lot of rent.
