Legendary turkey Cameron Mitchell about the actor / makeup artist, who burns the head of the studio when he is thrown a drink when he lights a cigarette. Mitchell works at the Wax Museum in Movieland. He also kidnaps and kills people, using a solution that paralyzes them so that he can turn them into displays. A genuinely weird bad movie that defies description. Watch as various wax figures try not to move, watch how all the tobacco released for several southern states is consumed - watch how things get weirder and weirder. This is a terrible film crash, and you can't take your eyes off the screen. A classic bad movie that will hit you, even if it leaves permanent scars on your psyche.
