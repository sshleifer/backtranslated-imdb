You could place characters on the island for any reason and get the same movie. The first had the original story, the second was stolen from King Kong, and at the end (I hope) of this trilogy, the story seems to have been completely bypassed. Leave some people on an island full of dinosaurs, and watch them run after their lives. It was about everything that happened before. The special effects were decent, but not worth $ 8. If you have a discount cinema in your area, wait and look at it for a dollar. I would not even rent it. It would be too much money for this terrible thriller.
