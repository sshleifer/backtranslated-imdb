I would call it a terrible show, if not for the fact that it is on the same network as Arrested Development. Because it is on FOX and updated until AD is canceled. <br /> <br /> It’s absolutely impossible to say how terrible this show is. But let me try to describe it. Take Archie Bunker with a very low rate and ask him to throw out a humor that would be outdated if he were on "Married with Children." Then take the wonderful storylines from AD (the son has an ugly, boring girlfriend) and muffle them so that the idiots who watch the sitcoms can understand them. <br /> <br /> If you watch this, I will completely lose respect for you, as well as for your family. However, if you are a fan, you should like the new FOX comedy “Til Death”. It looks like a real funny, cutting-edge material. I mean, couples don't get along ... brilliantly.
