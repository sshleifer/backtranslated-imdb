No no no. This is my advice if you want to watch this movie. Anthony Perkins is the only and only Norman Bates, like Janet Lee in her role as Marion Crane. It just looks like a colored version of Psycho, with a few slightly different strokes added for more modern appeal. Vaughn is boring, like a sick Norman, and Sam Loomis from Viggo Mortenson seems too cowboy compared to the original. Please guys do yourself some justice. Do not worry about that. One can only be surprised that Mr. Alfred Hitchcock and Mr. Anthony Perkins will be thinking right now ....... <br /> <br /> * of ****
