A friend warned me that this is the worst movie he has ever seen. I was curious because he had a cult status. I like a lot of weird indie cult movies, so I tried. I have to agree with my friend. This is a steaming pile of dung. I'm sorry about people who love this movie, but I can recommend much better things if you want to watch a twisted indie-cult movie. Try "The Dead Alive" Peter Jackson (aka Braindead), Graveyard Man (aka Dellamorte Dellamore) or Modern Vampires
