This film was a waste of 3 hours of my precious time. The first 10 minutes I was already annoyed, since I am familiar with the real version of the story on the Torah (5 books of Moses) ... but I decided to see what my money was worth, and see how bad it sucks. Well, it sucks .. much more than I thought it would be. First, and for most, let's start with the script and characters of the skeleton, which forms the basis of the film. If you study the Torah at all, you will see that everything is wrong in this story, here are some of the terrible mistakes: Moses does not perform slavish work, because he was in Levi's knee, Moses does not kill anyone on Mount Sinai. But still, the film shows how Moses is beaten, and Aaron and he himself kill people ... but no! When Moses speaks to a burning bush, he knows who speaks, but because of the movie Moses looks like an idiot, he declares that he does not know who Bush is in the bushes ... whatever it is, Aaron knew his brother Regardless of whether their distance grew, Aaron was known for his calm, serene peaceful nature, but in this film he is depicted evil and arrogant. Moses looks like Jesus in this film ... how ridiculous ... the pharoah was real and the ugly dwarf who sat on the pyramid of the stairs so that he could appear bigger than he was and Moses was over 10 feet and in the movie pharoah is taller than him and he is hot with bright eyes! A woman from Israel (the nation of Israel) covered herself, meaning her hair and body, and they didn’t dance and sing in front of men, they didn’t participate in the golden calf, so they definitely wouldn’t dance with a man in public, as the film depicts. Moses' wife, Zipora, was married to Moses, and therefore she covered herself and, being modest, did not embrace and did not hold hands in public. Batia’s daughter Faroah (one who adopts him and rescues him from the water) actually converted to Judaism and, therefore, would be proud of Moses when he said he was going to free his people. a time with two sets of tablets ... written in gibberish language ... at least place the inscriptions in holy language, Hebrew or English and put them on one tablet, not on two sets. and all the characters are wrong ... basically EVERYTHING is wrong in the movie ... Old is also inaccurate, but more realistic, and their actors are believable. I am Israel Tea!
