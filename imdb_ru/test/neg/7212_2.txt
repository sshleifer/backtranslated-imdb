Well, let's be honest. Following iconic classics such as Road House is no easy task. Now subtract Swayze from the equation and you will get a monumental task. So with Patrick, who is not on board, whose idea of ​​the devil was to continue and make this piece of garbage anyway? I'm going to blame the director who didn't even give 5 minutes of decent video during the entire movie. I was shocked that they forced Will Patton (Armageddon) to jump on board. Jonathon Shek coped well with lead, but the letter was terrible. The refusal of his partner-brunette brunette (Crystal Mantecon) in the first 5 minutes of the film made me want to throw it right here. But I was stuck in the film, hoping to catch a glimpse of this wonderful funny humor that worked so well with Double Duece. There is no such luck. The DVD cover is funny, these two blondes are depicted on them, which appear in the film for 10 seconds. Costar Ellen Hallman actually shows decent results. But again efforts are useless in a shred of garbage and shame like this. Did Jake Busey ever do a decent movie? Couldn't they have attracted at least a few actors from the first film for some kind of cure for nostalgia? Even one of the old bouncers or two, or Jeff Healey for a performance would be good. Remove this movie from the queue. -LostFlix
