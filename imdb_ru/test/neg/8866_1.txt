I never understood this type of fake movie. You get some serious / semi-serious film that everyone knows about and which extracts seriousness from it through immature jokes and the like. We have seen it many, many times, and it has never been funny. In my opinion, this is just an easy way to laugh at what you do not understand. It seems that this is one of the most obscure and less beloved genres, although I, frankly, see nothing much worse in this than in Spy Hard or Hot Shots. This film, as the name implies, concentrates on making fun of children's reading matter. This is the main reason why I decided to watch it, because I found that this film is too indulgent of Tarantino’s sore mind and highly overrated. I was hoping for one or two good jokes, making fun of the excessively cruel and senseless type of film that “Pulp Fiction” was in all aspects, in my (anything but) humble opinion. I was very disappointed. The plot is largely a plagiarism of the Tarantino film, with several scenes that fake other, often better films, just as childish and without humor. The pace is weak, and often you will sit there, being able to guess the outcome of each scene, predicting every joke, often thinking of the best in place, bored in your mind. The game is bad. Characters are clichés and stereotypes, and they are deliberately subtle to make fun of the characters on which they are based ... the problem is that it does not work. It just makes the movie much harder to watch. Humor juvenile and lame. The only positive thing I can say about this film is that they managed to find some actors who looked like the people they were supposed to look like. The film is a terrible waste of real real actors. Perhaps a little interesting for fans of typical films about the deception of the same kind. I recommend this to people who really hate Pulp Fiction, or fans of Zucker parody movies. All others: avoid. 1/10
