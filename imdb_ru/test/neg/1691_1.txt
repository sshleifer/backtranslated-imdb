The classic author S. S. Lewis once wrote an essay that says that no children's story is worth reading, browsing, and so on, if only children can enjoy it. I would say that this film is easily supported as an argument against his argument. <br /> <br /> At the age of five or six I liked him, I only tracked him down after three or four years and he was wet, poorly animated, stupidly and embarrassedly written, with sadly repeating and terrible songs (I look at you, hi-cacharum), showing a statement aimed at joyous stupidity and whimsy, but the result was an ugly Twi, a frustrating mess. <br /> <br /> In any case, show it to your child, but I would sincerely recommend you not to buy a copy and not try to sit on watching. If you want something to happen in the same era, but with true charm and wit, choose “Oliver Twist” or the brilliant adaptation of BBC “The Box of Delights”.
