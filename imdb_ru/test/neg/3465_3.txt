How many times do I have to write words boring and not funny on this page until I get to ten lines. George talks about the original actor Lucerne from little scammers. Although this is probably minor for alfalfa. How many times have I made my way into these overpaid actors with shitty films before I found out that there is only one law in the film industry. Take the money and make a movie - even if it's crap. They spend millions on making this movie, but they can't spend a few minutes to see the final result. And Renee GoAwayZigger must stop taking illegal drugs that she takes and seek medical help for problems with the person with whom she plays sports. At least, I hope that this is a drug, since it is completely unattractive while it speaks on the lips. This film was neither funny nor dramatic, and these hacks should just stop doing this shit. George and Rene, you should be ashamed of yourself and stop stinking greedy.
