Se7en is naked and not suitable for cleaning shoes. The word “predictable” should be coined for just such a case as this. Lambert, as always, is wooden (his “emotional” moments are as ridiculous as his accent). The “climax” is not at all, because we had so many signals, and by the end we are simply invulnerable to flesh, decay and so on. Overall a real mess.
