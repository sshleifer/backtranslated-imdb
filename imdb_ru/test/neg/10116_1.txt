This is hard, and I did not expect it ... But this is really the worst film that my wife and I have seen. Horrible dialogues that inexplicably expand in time for no apparent reason, except to fill the time. The narrative does not go intelligibly clear way ?? all mess. Action and dialogue appear when jumping. Most of all I was upset that Dominique Pinon was one of my favorite French actors. uh ?? I don't even know how to describe this without being polite ?? The rest of the actors where the poorest. Susan Paterno made a terrible interpretation of her character, making an expressionless performance. Bad special effects. I don't think it was a complete waste of the film, but is it close to ?? If I say, I would advise everyone not to watch this movie. I think it will be a waste of time. Sincerely, I never, although I would say something similar about the film, but ?? always for the first time
