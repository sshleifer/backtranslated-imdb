I almost laughed out loud when, during the commentary, the director said that this film is original with a strong storyline. There is not one ... repeat one original storyline or special effect in this movie blah. <br /> <br /> The Crows .... Hitchcock did it great before CGI, and even with CGI this film did not cope with a well-made attack scene. A creepy creepy boy ... Anger did it and made it better. Psycho ... done at Cold Creek Manor just recently, however it was done to death. No pun intended. An unrelated / rebellious teen that no one is listening to ... about a dozen films have used this film right up to Beetlejuice. A slug from the basement ... can you say Amnitivill Horror? The doors open imperceptibly ... What lies below made it with a much greater talent. A spooky farmhouse ... too many to mention. <br /> <br /> The background of metaphysics, which was supposed to be the center of attention, is lost when you understand what is happening, which, by the way, is quite early. <br /> <br /> One In the film (in fact, many) they donâ€™t even try to explain how they explain to the police that their attacker sucked mucus in the basement, so they really have no body. <br /> <br /> Overall ... not necessary
