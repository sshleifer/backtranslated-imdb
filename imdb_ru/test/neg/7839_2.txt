This is not a very good movie. <br /> <br /> I can usually watch a Van Dam movie if necessary, because they tend to laugh a little and do not require much thought. It has no redemptive features. <br /> <br /> It clearly lacks a plot, humor, acting, directing, etc. This is a stinker at all levels. <br /> <br /> I never left the cinema during the film, although I was there, damn it. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
