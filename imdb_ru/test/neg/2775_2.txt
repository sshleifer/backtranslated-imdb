This is a cheap film made by Al-Adamson - a man who may have been the worst director in history, perhaps even worse than Ed Wood Jr. Adamson specialized in extremely budget horror films and skins in the 60s, 70s. and the 80s and with names such as FIVE BLOOD OF GREVES, BLOOD OF HELL, GARDENS OF SATAN AND LASH OF LUST, it is obvious that he did not do Shakespeare !! All of his films had rotten production values, sensations, blood, and amateur acting. <br /> <br /> There are several Adamson actors in BRAIN OF BLOOD, such as his wife, Regina Carroll, Zandor Vorkov and Angelo Rossitto. the trip appeared in Adamson’s previous film, Dracula AGAINST FRANKENSTEIN. It was lucky because the previous film was so terrible and so poorly executed on each level that BRAIN OF BLOOD could not look good! Of course, make-up is ridiculous, the plot is dull (it includes the ubiquitous brain transplant scheme) and acting skills at level Z, but this is STILL better than in their last movie! <br /> <br /> The only positive aspects of this film are that the actor supporting aging, dwarf Angelo Rossitto actually had a better than usual part - with more dialogue and a more important role in the plot - and sometimes There is some sense of danger and tension. As for Ms. Carol, she still looks like a stripper and the rest of the cast is limping through this silly click. However, it’s bad enough that it’s good for bad movie fans — you just have to see the make-up of the guy with the acid burns, as well as the ray gun, which seems to be made from an old tail light!
