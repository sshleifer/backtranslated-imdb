The best thing I can say about this porn horror film is: boobies, boobies, boobies <br /> <br /> In addition, this film is made by some Hindu / Indian guy with some background in porn movies or such <br /! > <br /> The plot: the talk show host and his girlfriend are pursuing a psychopath who is angry because of the plight of the homeless and resolves them, you guessed it, beautiful ladies from a real estate agency! (Such films are why the slasher films of the 80s gained the reputation of a woman-hater). <br /> <br /> This film is not really Slasher, but with the same implausible and stereotypical views: stupid cops, the villain is an old white man, and women are busty babes. <br /> <br /> If you want porn-horror, this is your movie, otherwise stay away. (Adrienne fans will see her sagging breasts for a second or two)
