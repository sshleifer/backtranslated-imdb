This is more than just an adaptation of Bond: it's just a breakdown! With mediocre sketches of characters that Ian Fleming would not approve, this film is considered to be the worst movie of 007. An older (even exhausted) Connery is trying to survive his last 12 years later. The result is a tasteless, tasteless version of the classic hero. Give me Roger Moore any day!
