I just finished watching one episode (S1- # 5 Boy in the bushes), so maybe my review is not very fair. <br /> <br /> But based on this episode, this is a very bad version of CSI, shit action. The protagonist, the doctor, whatever her name is, is so fake that it really hurts. I would not leave her to do a surcharge on dog food! <br /> <br /> Another offensive thing is David Boreanaz from Angel, a good actor who does a great job, but wasted this womanâ€™s idiotic play. <br /> <br /> The supporting squad is fine, but everything is ruined by this stupid game of Emily Deschanel. <br /> <br /> A very disappointing version of CSI, very sorry to see it appear in the filmography of some of the potential talents involved in this. <br /> <br /> This woman is really a fool, at least in this episode. But based on this one view, I will not even invest in watching it, even if it was shown on the elevator screen.
