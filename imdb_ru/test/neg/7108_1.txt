My poor tank girl, they were all great ignored. Why is it as little as possible related to comics? I would have liked the movie that followed the plot, or at least the characters would be right. <br /> <br /> WHY WAS A TANK A GIRL American? She's an Australian, damn it! And she does not live in the post-apocalyptic war zone, she lives in the outback with Buga, like a savage. She does it because she wants to live like this, and not because she needs it, because Malcolm Mac Dowell plays this scab. And why does she look after these children? The only children in the comic books end up cruelly choking her, it's terrible that they turned her into a lame mother figure. <br /> <br /> And my poor girl Jet and young girl! In the comics, Jet is a sarcastic wizard, and a Sub-girl is another sarcastic wizard with a strange sense of humor. In the film "Jet" - this little mouse, and "Sub" - this thoughtless middle-aged witch. And the Buga does not look and does not behave as it should. Although, maybe, hot love / human love was too big for the US box office? Humor was also so lame. What happened to everything about the Smiths and that brilliant slang they used all the time? What is the line "it will take a lot of time? I do not want to miss Baywatch." Even programs for young children can come up with better material than this.
