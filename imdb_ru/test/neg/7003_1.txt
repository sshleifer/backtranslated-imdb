It's hard to believe that a movie can be so bad, but you live and study. What is more surprising is the fact that the people who collected this thing probably received a higher education. Meanwhile, the fruit of their labor exposes a view of what a group of five eighth-graders may have invented. On the other hand, (if there is one) the soundtrack has some pleasant moments, which is another reason for asking why the rest of the film can be terribly bad.
