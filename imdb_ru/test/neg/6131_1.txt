My God, what the hell happened here? This is one of the most boring films I've ever seen, how it is possible that they messed up such a great idea for a movie. To tell you the truth, I was so much promoted for this, even though I looked like Blair the Witches, but the real alien creatures were chasing the cameraman. Damn it, I was shortened to quickly send this pile of shit, and I never do that while watching movies. The high IMDb rating makes me believe that real aliens give 10 points for this piece of shit. <br /> <br /> An invasion is good, an invasion. The film begins with the fact that everything you are going to see is real, blah blah. Then they go and tell me about the special camera system used in cars, as if I had to believe their nonsense in order to enjoy this film. The next thing you know, I see the most boring car driving ever taken, in the forest at night, notice. Is this a movie or a Disney theme park? The first 20 minutes is a boring dialogue between the police when they see grass and one straight road with a flashlight. Where the hell were the aliens ?! They slept of course! Then we learn that a bad acting game is not only about school games, because the policeman behind the camera gets out of the car to find the missing person who was “night fishing” and came across a mysterious meteorite. I wonder what happens to him? From nowhere we see the night fishing guy walking like a zombie. The policeman is clearly too stupid to notice that something is wrong with this person. Obviously, he was really stupid, because the zombie / alien guy introduces a kind of alien parasite into the policeman's ear, turning him into an alien. Then the policeman / alien returns to his car, looks for a young couple who had sex some time ago in the forest, gets to them, turns the guy into an alien, and then the girl runs to the policeman's car and runs away. If this quick introduction of the plot did not occur to you that this film is bad, then the next 40 minutes will be. Watching this movie is as painful as cutting yourself with a plastic fork. The script, although it may seem interesting on the back of the DVD box, is badly aimed and, unfortunately, we still have another boring DVD straight to the crime. <br /> <br /> The only thing that kept me awake was the constant blinking and loud sound effects (regrettably). If the same forest trail is not enough for 63 minutes, we have to endure cheesy blinking methods to “frighten” the viewer and constantly cry about a bad actress who is aging and annoying pretty quickly. <br /> <br /> If you feel you need to rent this, I am telling you why? There are the best movies about SciFi / Horror. Even the scary remake of The Invasion of the Body Snatchers is more interesting than this one. For the love of all good, don't worry about his shit. My eyes were bleeding, and for the first time I wanted to commit suicide. 1/10, avoid it as a disease.
