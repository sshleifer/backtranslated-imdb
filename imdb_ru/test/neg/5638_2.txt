Come on. How did all these talented actors / actresses end up in this mess? Was this some kind of blackmail / losing bet situation? Vinnie, you're a muscular man. Be who you were born. <br /> <br /> Scene with jacuzzi? Scrabble scene? I expected to hear the “needle over the record” at any time. <br /> <br /> What about when he carried Dickens's invaluable manuscript with him? Let's see, I'm drunk at the bar, why not pull out Dickens's priceless manuscript? I'm going to meet some dubious goons on the edge of the Thames, why not take my precious Dickens manuscript? <br /> <br /> Crapola. <br /> <br /> Awful. Avoid.
