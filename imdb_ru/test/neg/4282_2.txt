The animation is great, I'll give it up. But Disney perpetuated every stereotype that we, Alaskan, have tried to overcome in the past two generations. And the names, I mean, come on ... Sitka, Kenai, Tanana and Denahi (Denali's cheesy rise) ?! These are real places where real people live! And the real people to whom these real places were named are probably struggling with the Earth in search of revenge for this banal click. Disney, you live outside of California and Florida, right among the rest of the states that still treat us like a foreign country. If you cannot adhere to what you know, at least hire and / or work with people who know what area you are trying to build a caricature. Maybe then it would not be so insulting! :(
