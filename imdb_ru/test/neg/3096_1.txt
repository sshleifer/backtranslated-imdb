I'm not afraid of bad movies. I like bad movies. I like to mock them in the company of my friends. In fact, we are all pretty good. In doing so, let me tell you how much I hated this movie. <br /> <br /> For starters, it was incomprehensible. Rob Lowe attacks some people, they capture him, but he escapes in this big skirmish. There is one singer whom we consider dead, but she did not die, if perhaps there are several of them who all act and look the same. Kyi Burt Reynolds to enter and interrogate the singer. He looks like he just wandered into this movie from the set of “Walker, Texas Ranger”, and hell of a mess. Then Rob Low dies, only he does not ... And, worst of all, there is not enough dialogue or action that does not include killing people or even trying to laugh at this movie !! And don't even get me on a random chihuahua. Then there was the fact that it had to be about the old power structure in Eastern Europe, which is decaying. We didn’t know where we were, all the accents were apparently “Eastern European”, and what did Burt Reynolds and Rob Lowe do in the first place? <br /> <br /> I desperately wanted to tell people in Blockbuster what I thought about this film and to get my money back, but since I received it as special (only $ 0.99), I decided against it. However, I want to know HOW THE DIRECTOR GOT GREEN LIGHT to make this damn movie, and what did the stars think when they signed ???
