Get a CD instead. The show is manual, and editing sucks. The crowd gets too much time on the screen, like Till Lindemann. The cameras spend more time with the same child, shaking their heads in the same way (which makes me believe that this is the exact same picture) than during Richard Kruspe's solo in Weisses Fleisch. Scenes change so quickly that it is impossible to determine where the camera is directed, and repetitions are simply redundant. Not worth the tape on which it is recorded.
