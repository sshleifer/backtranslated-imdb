I'm a big fan of Patricia Hodge and Mariam Margolis, so I watched this show when it appeared on A & E a few years ago. The show was at least strange, but I gave him a chance, because I liked these actresses. This must be one of the worst shows I've ever seen. I would not watch it again and, of course, would not begin to spend money for purchase of video. The plot of this TV version is funny and just stupid! A “kicker” (intended for a pun) appears when Ruth has surgery on the bones of the legs. Such nonsense refers to films about James Bond and fiction. If this version is correct the book, then I will not check the book from my local library! The American version came out a few years after I saw this original. To my surprise, this time the Americans got it right, since their version with Meryl Streep and Roseann was played for a laugh and quite funny. When played for laughing, the storyline works.
