I can't say simpler, it's a terrible movie. I worked in the industry and made some (short) films myself, so, well, my standard is quite high, but seriously, I absolutely hate this film. I have not commented on IMDb before, but I hated this film so much that I literally had to come and warn others. This is a piece of shit. The writer / director is an idiot who just doesn’t know how to make / write a good movie and has the skills to write a teenage teenager. The characters are unrealistic (the leading woman doesn’t think of taking a policeman’s gun, but is ingenious enough to improvise the Molotov cocktail? I don’t understand what the director was trying to do with his idea of ​​a village demon, but it looked like a sloppy writing and comfortable nonsense without any real thought this. This is officially the worst film I've ever seen all year. Congratulations, Shiban, now you are standing there with such great personalities as Michelle Bay in the prestigious club "you can’t be allowed to spend millions of dollars on created e film. "I hope you are reading this, I really do. And 163 idiots who rated this film, 10 of 10 BWAHHAHAHAHAh my God, I hope that the demon redneck will comfortably behind you and torments you.
