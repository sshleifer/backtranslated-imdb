The books of Frederick Forsyth are always so intricate, with twists and turns, and, as a rule, a great unexpected ending. This adaptation had nothing of the kind. <br /> <br /> So much of what was great in the book (the story of the Monk and the loyal agents; the conspiracy to influence the outcome of the Russian elections) was completely absent from this. device. Instead, there is a completely new story about biological weapons, which was onlookers. <br /> <br /> Forsyth’s main characters have always acted in the shadows, forever, a little beyond the reach of the antagonists. The joys of his books have always been the machinations of their mission. From the very beginning this film put up with gunfights and car chases. <br /> <br /> Monk Swayze could just as well hang around the neck a sign saying “I AM A SECRET AGENT” for all the attention he drew to himself during the film. And with all this attention it was amazing how long it took the bad guys to catch up with him. <br /> <br /> Of course, there was some energy in this film, so I give it to “3” instead of “1”. It was also great to see some underused professionals such as Patrick Bergin, Ben Cross, Michael York and Barry Morse. <br /> <br /> I hope that someday someone will again pay tribute to the adaptation of the movie Foresight, such as The Day of the Jackal.
