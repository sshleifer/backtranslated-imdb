Hi, today I watched this movie because of the average (5.6) IMDb rating. I thought it was worth a look. In addition, the comments here were pretty good, but after starting to watch this movie, I quickly realized that this movie is not close to 5.6 anyway! It's just boring. You can describe the movie in a few words, and this is just a standard horror movie story with all the standard horror movie scenes. I donâ€™t know why people still like these films or why they vote for such films better than 1-3 in IMDb. A few examples. <br /> <br /> A bunch of people arriving from somewhere or traveling to any destination. They somehow meet strange people on their journey, but maybe they are just lovely, so hang out with them. Then a very important scene for each horror movie, "Oh, my cell phone is not working, oh, oh, my, too ... it's weird, but we don't need them, so enjoy our trip ..." Uhhhhhh, our weird man is weird the psychopath is better we will all sit down and scream until he starts cutting off parts of us or killing some of us. After a while, a group of victims gets a weapon or a chance to escape, they never think about running away or even killing a psychopath, if they have the opportunity to simply talk about what to do until the psychopath returns their weapons to someone from the handful. the standard tricks they got in those films and they all ran as usual ... shouted ... else to kill ... oh, and in the end it did work out, sometimes the bad guy won, sometimes some victims could run away wow great movies. ... Well, if I have never seen such a film, I would say that it is a film that can be watched, but if anyone has ever seen any film of this kind, it will be just a boring waste of time, because you know almost everything in the movie before you even watch it, because it works like a standard Shematic horror movie every time. .... um, can there be a program for windows there? Horrormoviemaker 2.0? You can simply press a few adjustment buttons and get a new movie such as Shuttle, Saw45674, Jeepers Creepers.
