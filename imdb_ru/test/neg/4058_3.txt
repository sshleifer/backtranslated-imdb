"Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver" is a very bad rehearsal in creating a sequel for one year. The first film was cute, pleasant and charming. The idea of ​​a dog playing in a basketball team was pretty contrived, but he pointedly did enough tricks to save the concept. Even human history had some explanation for this. Josh's father died in a plane crash, so he is sad. And the public becomes emotionally involved. <br /> <br /> Now for a badly done sequel. It's horrible. This is the worst kind of bad sequel that changes good ideas and turns them into bad ones. The one who changes the main plot plot, this time K-9 plays football, not basketball. No wonder how much time is spent on thinking about matter, benefiting from doubts, a frank look at your attitude to such a film, there is no positive thinking when it comes to properly creating a bad movie. br /> <br /> A sequel plays Kevin Zegers as Josh, who is in eighth grade. He lives with his mother and younger sister in a Seattle suburb. In the first film, a human story told how he lost his father in a plane crash that the public might encounter, most people know what it is like to lose a loved one. <br /> <br /> In this film, the emotional plot is a bit more complicated. Josh's mother is dating again. He and Buddy, his dog, who knows how to play basketball, does not like it at all. What for? If I were in his place, I would like to have an extra parent in my life, especially such a sweet one. This man's name is Patrick Sullivan, and Josh's mother, Jackie, met him when he became the local veterinarian for Buddy. <br /> <br /> The story with animals is too simple. Josh was influenced by his best friend to try himself on the school football team, Timber Wolves. The team itself is similar to something from America’s funniest home videos, it can even catch the ball without stumbling or falling over each other. Therefore, when Bud appears once, he proves that he can play for them, and, without a doubt, the best player on the team. <br /> <br /> Buddy is very cute in her football suit. Oh, it is enough to melt the heart. The dog is also the best in this film. It is a pity that he did not do enough tricks to divert attention from the fact that no one ever asks questions about a dog playing on a school football team. <br /> <br /> The story of Russian circus performers who like to steal amazing animals, of course, they are trying to catch Buddy. But their vague minds are controlled by animals and ultimately do for them what looks like the “Home Alone” scenario. <br /> <br /> “Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver” is much more stupid than the first, the Russian captors add a handful of lame shard, which, I must admit, made me laugh at the stupidity of all this. There are too many episodes in which the nature of the worms is described in detail, and too few scenes in which the true reason why people see this film is depicted - to see how the dog plays football. <br /> <br /> The speeches were also quite embarrassing. I liked the presentations of Gregory Harrison and Robert Costanzo, but a general assessment of acting would be equivalent to D +. Kevin Seghers and Cynthia Stevenson were absolutely pathetic. <br /> <br /> Toward the end there were a few funny moments from several football announcers, but this is not even worth mentioning. Will children like this movie? Perhaps, but even they will tire when the heart feels that the discussions are getting too long and deep. They will surely complain that the dog didn’t have enough time to screen, and they hate the fast-changing scenario, protest boring ideas and claim that this film is rubbish compared to Ori Air Bud origami, as I did. <br /> <br /> I suppose they will think the dog is charming.
