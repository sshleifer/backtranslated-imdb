It must be one of the most annoying, arrogant, troubled films I've ever seen. What a waste of budget and actors. Angelopoulos has reached a new level of pretentiousness. It is clear that there is practically no plot, even if this part of Greek history is material for great films. He just had some supposedly symbolic (actually shambolic) scenes, and he built a whole movie around them. Death is the main theme and is repeated to nausea, along with litany, processions, etc., which should only be a means for the film, but, unfortunately, this is the film itself. A completely incoherent result that can make you say “eh?” Or “oh dear” every two minutes. <br /> <br /> There is no character development at all, nada, zilch. I usually complain that in some films there are two-dimensional characters, but, oh God, he managed to create one-dimensional characters. It annoys us and is humiliating for some actors. He even managed to make one of my favorite Greek actors, Giorgos Armenis, appear wooden. <br /> <br /> And closer to the point of filming Angelopoulos: No, we are not idiots. We do not want to chew food. Please, someone will say this guy symbolism should be subtle. Teo, do you really underestimate your audience, or are you just incompetent? Personally, I think he was trying to make the Greek "Metro". No matter how hard he tries, he cannot get to Kusturica. <br /> <br /> Only saving grace: photography, costumes and music.
