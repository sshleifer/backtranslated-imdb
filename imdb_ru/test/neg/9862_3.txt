I am writing this note as a chess player, as well as a film viewer. I watched the Kasparov-Deep Blue 1997 games on the Internet. I know something about the issues that have been raised. Other chess players will appear and will want to know whether it is worth watching / buying this film, and I mostly talk to them. However, I will try not to ignore those who are not “chess”. <br /> <br /> This film tells about the 1997 match of Garry Kasparov with the computer collection Deep Blue. However, the first image you see in the film is not Kasparov or a computer, but “TURK”. This is an “automaton”, which was built in Europe at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries and played winning chess against everyone. I put the word "automatic" in quotes, because it is, as everyone now knows, fake. There was a man in it. <br /> <br /> If you don’t like to watch “TURK”, you will not be able to sustain the film, because “TURK” has as much time on the screen as Kasparov, maybe more, both in modern frames and in b / w frames from some old movie. The re-emergence of “TURKEY” every few seconds emphasizes the accusation of Kasparov that “Deep Blue” had human help - that it was (to some extent) a fake computer that IBM had deceived, that “the person inside” worked behind the scenes to help him to win Not only Kasparov believes in it, but the directors also seem to believe in it. So this is not exactly a film about chess games or about programming chess computers. This is a propaganda article about a large corporation allegedly abusing a helpless grandmaster. In fact, this is very similar to a negative advertising campaign, as it is full of sinister music, evocative camera work, eerie sound effects and insinuations (“we never figured out what was behind this locked door”) and the omnipresent “TURK” . <br /> <br /> Most of the people in the chess community are pretty much convinced that IBM was not deceiving and that it was Harry’s paranoia at work. To begin with, in order for a person to help “Deep Blue” defeat Kasparov, it may seem that you need a person who would be better than “Deep Blue” and better than Kasparov. Since there was no such person, the idea itself is a bit suspicious from the very beginning. In addition, by the time this movie was created, computer programs capable of defeating strong grandmasters were already working on your computer. Today, much more than in 1997, we take for granted that a computer can do what you do not expect. And we are less inclined to take it as a monumental human tragedy when a computer beat a guy in chess. (And in fact, the point is that Kasparov beat himself with two gross mistakes, including abandoning Game 2 in a drawn position.) <br /> <br /> As for chess games, there are actually very few of them. . There are a few comments from the masters and commentators, who briefly talk about how they went, but in fact you are unlikely to see the strategy or tactics in general. Naturally, as a chess player, I consider this to be a serious drawback, but I think that it’s not the players who are also cheating. For example, imagine a baseball movie in which you can hardly see any game - just a commentator tells you that "in the fourth game, the White Sox won the Astros with such and such a score." No one will make such a film. But here, for example, we are told that Kasparov made a grave mistake in opening the decisive game 6, but we are not shown a position on the screen, or are not told why it was a mistake, or what he should have done instead or something. We just see how Kasparov holds his head in his hands for a few seconds, and then more atmospheric sound effects and camera work. <br /> <br /> (As I saw it on a DVD, let me warn chess players about the DVD as well. The jacket promises you that Extras includes “analysis” games. Can this grandmaster analysis that people like us? NO! This is an automatic analysis of a voice synthesizer from some version of Chessmaster, which tells you when a piece is attacked and the pawn is isolated, and that you are in the “main line defense” of Caro-Kann.) br /> <br /> Someone can then come and say: “Well, clearly, this film is intended for t wow, to dramatize a match for non-player players, and therefore it's not fair to be impatient with this. But in fact, he doesn’t cope well with a non-player player - he misses some points that a true newcomer would really like to explain. For example, he says that Kasparov could have received an “eternal test” in the second game, but does not explain what it is (or does not show how it would look on the board, which would be interesting). He breaks out in the matches of Kasparov-Karpov, but does not explain why there were two of them or who organized them, etc. I don’t need this information myself, but I am familiar with it. If you do not have the experience of playing chess, there are places where you will be confused, and this is just a drawback of the film. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, I cannot recommend the film, which, like TURK itself, is not what it is (documentary), but rather a stage illusion.
