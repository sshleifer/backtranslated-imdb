The only thing fuller than the premise of this film is its script. Flatliners is the perfect showcase for Joel Schumacher’s glorious, bright, arrogant lack of talent. The plot is absolutely illogical, but super false, and all this is directed at art an inch from his life in the brightest, overheated way. I like that the med school opening room is a cave vaulted marble mausoleum lit in red with huge Rembrandt paintings hanging from the walls. I love how Kayfer Sutherland drives an army jeep on a canvas. No one in the films of Joel Schumacher lives without an eccentric way. It is always an alternate universe, where all are young and painfully hip, but the hip is strictly and obsessively in accordance with the idea of ​​a middle-aged billionaire male hip. And holy crap! The part where Baldwin's brother No. 16 dies and comes back to life, and then he is followed by all the women he slept with, who say “I will call you” and “I just need a little space” - this is the funniest damn thing in general . the universe !!!! What kind of world do we live in, where does Joel Schumacher continue to make people throw money at him? "Flatliners" made me want to revise all human creativity solely for the type of high-quality jokes that are contained there.
