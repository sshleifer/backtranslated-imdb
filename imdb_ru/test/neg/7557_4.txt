Ken Harrison, a young sculptor at the age of thirty, was seriously injured in a traffic accident. The end of the story. <br /> <br /> “The end of history”, that is, “the end of any physical action”. Not in the sense of "the end of the film." Ken's life is saved, but he is paralyzed from the neck down. When he discovers that he is unlikely to ever restore the use of his limbs, he decides that he wants to die, and asks the doctors to stop the treatment that supports his life. The rest of the film is, in fact, one long argument about the rights and shortcomings of euthanasia and the right to die. <br /> <br /> Ken’s main antagonist in this debate is his doctor Michael Emerson. Although the case of euthanasia is often presented in religious terms, here it is presented in purely secular. If Dr. Emerson has deep religious beliefs, they are never expressed in a film. However, he passionately believes that death is the enemy against which he, as a doctor, is obliged to fight; effectively allowing the patient to commit suicide would be the surrender of this enemy and failure to fulfill this duty. Therefore, Ken finds himself in a Catch-22 situation. He must be able to show that he is sensible and reasonable enough to make a decision to commit suicide. Emerson, however, believes that the desire to die in itself is indicative of insanity and irrationality. Ken's dilemma can only be resolved by hiring a lawyer who will sue the hospital. <br /> <br /> Richard Dreyfuss in the role of Ken and John Cassavetes in the role of Dr. Emerson skillfully and sincerely expressed their point of view, but this cannot hide the fact that "Whose is this life?" just doesn't work like a movie. Once shot versions of stage plays were made similarly to theatrical productions, but by the seventies and eightieth years this was often perceived as unsatisfactory because of the differences between the two media. Therefore, when the plays were filmed, the general tendency was to “open them” by filming on the spot as well as on film sets, taking courage with the text of the playwright, often making significant changes to the plot and even introducing additional characters. br /> <br /> I have never seen a play by Brian Clark, but I suspect that this story will work better in a theater than in a movie. There are very few physical activities; Most of the action consists of long discussions around a hospital bed, in which the main character is paralyzed. Such a plot does not give in at all to the “opening” device, and the resulting film is very static, it is dominated by conversations due to the action. Although it is well written and there is a good game, I am surprised that the film was ever made on such a non-cinematic subject. 4/10
