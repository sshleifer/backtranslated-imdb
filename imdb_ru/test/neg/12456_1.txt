I'm not even going to spend more time describing how bad this movie is. Bottom line: it was awful, it had huge holes in the plot and it went absolutely ANYWHERE. The only good thing about this is the description that my digital cable gave for the film: "A married man with a difficult business communicates with his secretary." Yes ?? The wrong film seems to be, although it could have made things a little more interesting if any description were true. <br /> <br /> Shelley
