it quickly collapsed due to the poor quality of acting, cinematography, numerous meaningless scenes and a terrible villain. Well, let's see, Joe Estevez is bad (as usual), but he's not the only problem with casting, writer Vivian Schilling is not a great actress, in fact, well, she sucks. Her script is not so bad, he is just a bad director. In fact, if the director were better and if the best actors were shot, it could be a really good movie. <br /> <br /> But alas, with all these problems, “Soultaker” cannot even be kind of tolerable, like a horror movie, plus the storyboard is also terrible. <br /> <br /> The MST team had fun with it, but it was definitely not their best effort. 5 for this, nothing for the original.
