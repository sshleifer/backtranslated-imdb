The incredible happened. First witnessed this a few years ago, I had a film that was my standard of horror, and this film was called McKinsey Island. The family adventure film with Hulk Hogan and Grace Jones (I don’t make this up), he plunged into the new depths of film making and is still the only film I’ve seen that made me think about what else the budget of the film could be on. Like new schools or cancer drugs. However, for a clean and clean shit level, any film will have to lower its standards even lower if they want to beat Guest House Paradiso to become one of the worst films I've ever watched. <br /> <br /> This film, based on the children's but amusing TV show "Bottom", introduces us to two of the biggest losers you can imagine. Richard (Rick Mayall) is the manager of the hotel, as unfriendly as any other you can imagine, and so perversely depraved that it almost oozes with mucus from every action. His friend Eddie (director Adrian Edmondson) is an alcoholic waste of human life, and together they are trying to manage the worst UK hotel located on the cliff top next to the nuclear power plant. Between them, they regularly indulge in cartoon violence (with sound effects), steal something remotely valuable or interesting from the fools who stay there, and look at any woman with anguish. The plot, as it is, includes the arrival of the legendary Italian goddess Gina Carbonara (Vincent Cassel), who runs from her wedding and tries to lie down at the Paradiso Guest House, much to the surprise of Richie and Eddie. And ... that's all. <br /> <br /> I used to think that the films “Carry On” reflect all the bad things in the British film industry, and God knows, we spent so much time and money trying to get away from this god. terrible legacy We had films like Trainspotting, 28 Days Later, Four Weddings and a Funeral, and the brilliant Shaun Of The Dead (also starring Simon Pegg), but this ... these films screaming and hitting back when Sid James and Barbara Windsor take off with a bicycle whistle. "Guest House Paradiso" is so low in its ambitions that it offends you as soon as you watch it. I continued to watch, waiting for the jokes to start, but they never came. Just an endless stream of sharpened pens, unimaginable scenarios that defy explanation, a little funny violence with pans and refrigerator doors and almost nothing that raises just like a smirk. The first commercial break came (it was on TV, you know), and I was ready to turn it off, but my faithful duties to you, my readers, did not give me rest. “I watch it so that they don’t have to” became my mantra, so that you guys better remember how much you owe me for it, because it was as much fun as sand slammed into my eyes and force-fed dogs. <br /> <br /> Believe me, I loved the TV series "Bottom." The combination of Mayall and Edmondson's suitable dirty play with youthful humor OTT worked ... half an hour every week. Of course, not for an hour and a half, as Edmondson and Mayall indulge in their little personal joke, tire and oppress the rest of the audience. Honestly, because of this, “Dead Fred” Mayall looks like the “Godfather,” and if you happen to meet one of these two people (who are largely responsible for the chaos on the screen, posing as a film), feel free to quickly deliver the boot to the testicle area. They will probably like it. Pegg and Bill Nyei (both as guests at the hotel) are flooded with this sinking ship, but at least they survived. Mayall and Edmondson should not be so lucky. The film is equivalent to Chernobyl and should be avoided as such.
