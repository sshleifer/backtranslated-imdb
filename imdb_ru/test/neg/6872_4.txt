The jealous husband holds the showroom hostage, and Williams burdens the viewer with his worn-out wrapper at every turn. Yawn. <br /> <br /> Paid canal, cartilage. Unusually bad scenario in combination with the less than convincing Robin Williams in the role of clever chatter, a car dealer in Queens, who was in a situation of a hostage crisis. No laughter, the message (s) or morality is simply wrong, and the film cannot decide whether it is a comedy or a drama. They played pretty well, acting rather badly. When a movie gets old so badly, you become ugly. There is nothing more to say, except perhaps to be avoided at all costs. Mediocre cinema textbooks like this are actually more tedious and less pleasant than supernatural bombs.
