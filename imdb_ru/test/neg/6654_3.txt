Well, the plot is interesting, but it is full of a fool. To summarize, the cop / dad really wants to save his son from cancer, but the only way is to get a transplant from a criminal (Michael Keaton). <br /> <br /> Well, the criminal agrees, BUT ran away in the hospital while the transplant was going on, and the police and the police are not allowed to shoot at the criminal in order to save his son. (dead offender - no transplant - dead son). <br /> <br /> The police in this film have no brains, if they have never heard of TAZER, in order to bring down the criminal without killing him. The end of the film, everything is so simple. <br /> <br /> But this is when everyone is crazy and stupid, including the death of 2 cops and a few doctors burning quite badly.
