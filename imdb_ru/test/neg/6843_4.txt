The most prolific man in Ireland revolves around Iamon Manley, who is 24 years old, and he is still considered a virgin. He lives with his mother in Belfast. He is also a very shy guy towards women. With Iamon, everything changes when a woman seduces him (as far as I remember a neighbor). This is not because he loses his virginity, but he discovers that he has a superpower. Despite the protection, this neighbor will become pregnant. The doctor told him that he had a very high sperm count. His mother brilliantly advances an idea that makes us see children with a red-headed head at the end of the film. He begins to help women on both sides of Belfast to conceive children. At first voluntarily, then with the help of his colleague runs the business of this. The Fertile Man himself in Ireland has his funny moments, but they had to come up with the best jokes and the best script. I couldn't help but think that it impressed me like a television sitcom, not a movie. Chris Marshall is a different name on a silver screen, but it does not shine like a star. It's more like the guy you saw in such and such a movie. As if he was in love. Actually (I think he was very funny about it) .. Well, it was normal to watch, but from time to time I could not sleep. ** outside *****
