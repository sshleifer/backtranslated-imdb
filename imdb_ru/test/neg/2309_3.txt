In the preface to my remarks on the film, I know that the topic is terrible, and the words cannot adequately express the compassion that any decent person would experience to people dealing with the post-horrors of the atomic bomb dropped next to them. <br /> <br /> However, this film is not related to a horrible way, except for the first 10 minutes. Some of the images are terrifying, and they should serve as a reminder of what can produce destructive nuclear weapons. Seeing burnt people wandering aimlessly around, or combing hair, falling hair bunches, etc., is not a very pleasant sight. <br /> <br /> But after the first dozen minutes, this Japanese film is about people who dealt with the consequences of Hiroshima in the mid to late 40s. I actually discovered that the story is quickly turning into a boring soap opera. <br /> <br /> Almost the whole story takes place five years after the bombing and is mainly devoted to the problems of one family at that time. That is why it became a melodrama rather than a shocking history of nuclear catastrophe. It's just a story about how these people continued to live since 1950, was one of the women permanently damaged, and if so, should she get married? <br /> <br /> This could be a real spectacular film, but he did not go in that direction.
