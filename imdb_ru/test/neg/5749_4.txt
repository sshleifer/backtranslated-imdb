A wild flower is thrown into the sea and dreams of a pirate fantasy like a girl in love with a student of a pirate. Energetic and good-natured, perhaps, but a crappy business; the disastrous musical ensemble "The Pirates of Penzance" with cheap, belated feeling, pale songs and constant, wicked replay. The Kristi McNichol motion picture film afterwards received real success, while leading man Christopher Atkins cannot cope with any particular emotion, his voice fluctuates in search of a suitable tone. You have to wonder if this is the best name they can come up with, what will be the level of wit in the real scenario? The love of music, similar to the film "Lubricant", does not turn into an addiction to the farces in the style of "Airplane!" For the most part, this is embarrassment. * 1/2 of ****
