This film begins with the main character lying in a coma in the hospital ward, in the presence of two orderlies. The main character is unconsciously heard in a voice, saying that the orderlies are gay. Kissing orderlies. I watched it in the DVD version, and I have a suspicion that it must be funny ?? In the end, the DVD says “comedy,” and so it goes. If I had seen it in the cinema, I would probably have heard some of the audience roar with laughter, because it was so funny, and because they had to sit in a comedy. Although it is fascinating to think about what is funny and what is not, this film, unfortunately, only gives arguments about what is wrong. <br /> <br /> Brilliant brains can DO No matter how funny people like Ernst Lubich, Billy Wilder or Mel Brooks have proved this fact. But you should know the mechanics, I suppose. The director and co-writer Dani Levy does not care about this mechanic, he believes that some things are ridiculous, for example, the fact that two orderlies are gay and kiss a person in a coma, for example. Do not misunderstand me, some people may make it funny, Dani Levy cannot, in any case, not for me. <br /> <br /> The main problem I faced in this film is that I see no reason for how the main characters behave. I could not understand why two brothers, one orthodox Jew from West Germany, the third cool copy of Fast Eddie Felson from former East Germany, didn’t like each other so much. They are both rather soft characters. Their children are boring, apart from the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other (well, now one lesbian, but raising a daughter, which she has, with a cousin). But even these incestuous relationships ?? if something bothers them - just excuse me, because the writers could think of nothing better. <br /> <br /> The game is not bad, Udo Semel, I really liked it, although he reminded me rather of former Chancellor Helmut Kohl (lighter version) than a respectable Orthodox Jew. By itself, the direction is not so bad, but maybe Levy should do directing films, leaving the script to someone else. Now I heard that he made a comedy about Hitler. Oh, wai!
