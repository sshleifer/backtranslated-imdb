I really could not get into this movie. The plot: some old woman tormented someone for so long that he freaked out. She dies, and he is left in the basement to starve. Months must pass, and the family moves. The daughter is blind because of the accident caused by the father. Well, anyway, this guy in the basement, who for all rights must be long dead, is still there. He eats the cat and now the superman. Now he wants to eat people and have sex. And when the prostitute dies, the father gets the blame. I always dislike films that someone else is accused of killing, because you always see the typical lines “I didn’t do this,” “I could never do such a thing,” blah blah blah. And the family storyline can be the plot of a lifetime.
