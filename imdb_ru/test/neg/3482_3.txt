I am surprised at the main comments on this surfing movie. It really comes from a California dream school on beach antics and is not very believable. The idea that the lead child learns to ride so well on a board in a concrete pool that he beats real surfers in their game in the real ocean is just silly. In Australia, where most urban teens surf, this film laughed at the audience, who took it all with a grain of sea salt. Made in the 80s, but with a heart of the 60s, it's nice to look at, it looks and sounds good, but it is not a classic at all. Even the actors did not survive it. We are seriously in the LIQUID POWER, or RIDING ON WILD AREAS, or the BEACH BLANKET BINGO. Oz stars, such as Occy and BIG Wednesday hero Jerry Lopez, are meant to add a nod recognition to the wave mastery of our farm boy, but this only made the crowd in the cinema annoyed. This is for 10 years who do not ask a lot of questions. It was not even IN THE GOD'S HANDS, and that too was stupid.
