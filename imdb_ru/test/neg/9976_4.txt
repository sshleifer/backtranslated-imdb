Comrade Giallo-fanatics: be careful and / or act with caution ?? because this film is not exactly what it seems. This, of course, is similar to Giallo, with a juicy VHS cover (featuring a busty nude girl and a large bloody knife), a rhythmic title and the names of two Italian veteran actors in the cast (John Phillip & Fernando Rey), but this is mostly erotic Thriller without a special plot. The version I was watching was allegedly subject to strict censorship. with a duration of only 77 minutes, but at the same time there is still a lack of time, character development and, above all, sadistic (and, as a rule, Giallo) slaughter. “Eyes Behind the Wall” can be briefly described as a collection of perverted characters and an extensive description of their sexuality problems. Despite this, this is an interesting effort, because writer / director Giuliano Petrelli (his only film) clearly tried to do something special, but the overall result is unsatisfactory and regrettably tamed. Inspired by Hitchcock's “Rear Window,” the protagonist is a disappointed elderly writer in a wheelchair. He and his much younger lover receive sexual blows from spying on a lonely man living across the road. The tenant, respectively, likes to do gymnastic exercises around the house while being naked and clearly has bisexual desires. The guy in a wheelchair sends his wife and they have sex. In addition, there is Ottavio, the butler, who repeatedly rapes schoolgirls. Are there any normal characters in the story? Well, no, of course not! The film benefits from a continuously ominous atmosphere, with a capricious soundtrack and elegant photography, but none of this ever leads anywhere, so all this is just meanness and sex without meaning. At the end of the story there is a really strange twist / revelation, but it comes too late and too random to raise the overall quality. Not recommended to fans of horrible / cult Italian cinema, but perhaps this is a great viewing for psychology students to analyze characters in the style of Freud.
