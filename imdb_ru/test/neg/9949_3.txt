When I sit and think about Fairy Fat, I realize that maybe I won’t be honest with the film. My rating of 3/10 may be more related to my disappointment in the film than to its real quality or entertainment value. Based on the plot description, IMDb reviews and IMDb rating of 7.6, I’m sure I stumbled upon a little-known stone. Unfortunately, for me it did little. For some reason, "Fairies Poison" almost put me to sleep. <br /> <br /> “Poison for fairies” - the story of two young girls in Mexico in 1965. One of the girls, Veronica, an obsessive cheater and tells her friend that she, Veronica, is a witch. The other girl, Flavia, is so gullible that she believes and is frightened by everything that her friend tells her. This is really about it. In fact, nothing much happens, and the film is delayed when Veronica tries to terrorize Flavia and dominate her. One IMDb commentator called it "the worst movie in the Mexican cinema of the 80s." My comment ?? If so, then in the 1980s there were not many horror films in Mexico. Another commentator wrote: “Look, if you want to get scared.” My comment ?? are you sure we're talking about one movie? My opinion is diametrically opposed to my examples. For me it was boring, boring and badly acted. The framing of the scene is especially annoying, since director Carlos Enrique Taboada never shows the faces of other characters. Veronica and Flavia have long protracted conversations with their family members and their teacher, but we never see the faces of these people. This is an annoying trick.
