I actually looked at the entire set of reviews in search of those who gave this film less than 5 stars. They were few and far between. Which is completely confusing! Yes, I know that this is a Disney movie, and not directed by Christopher Nolan, but a kind lord. This is nonsense, leading to a bargain. They should be done with this and revive the damn thing. <br /> <br /> And what's even worse is that IMDb won't let me just finish my rant, because my review should be longer! <br /> <br /> “Stunning” in-game pictures from the camera are ALWAYS taken from the Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf on the Playstation, the plot of the plot resembles a stupid schoolboy, a multiplayer character and the development of a plot that is already damaging Weak conditions, and the grand finale is just boring . <br /> <br /> In addition, it was truly the best film I've ever seen in my entire life. <br /> <br /> Good-looking, authentic costumes, kits and sports equipment. There I said it.
