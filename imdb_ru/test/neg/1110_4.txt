First, I'm a horror fan. But this production of "Tobe Hooper" (come on, man from the original Texas Chainsaw and Poltergeist !!) was below the standards, even for fans. The game was not bad at all, some of the characters were incredible, but with the leading girls everything was in order. This story was something that we have already seen a hundred times, without any unexpected turns or anything else. Never exciting or intense, and do not count on any special effects other than blood spatter. Scary zombie kids - white, pale faces with dark eyes, that's all ... It might work in the early 70s, but not now. Directed by Yu.S. Cardon did not cope well with the situation, halfway there is a risk that you fall asleep. My voice is based mainly on the leading role, but it could easily be called "Children of Corn 8: from corn fields to mines."
