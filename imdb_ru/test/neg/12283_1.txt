One of the worst films I have seen this year. Everything about the movie screams "AUGER". For a film shot in the 1800s, everyone says it is as if it were the 1990s. The game, especially people playing white slave owners, is terrible. About an hour later in this film I went out. What a waste of time and effort. For a much better film on this subject, see Steven Spielberg's Much Better Amistad.
