Whoever brought to mind this stupid idea of ​​making and making a film in Himesh’s head, which is always hidden under a cap, covering almost half of his face all the time? I hope this is the first and last, for God's sake! From Assalam Valecuma to the Gayatri Mantra, Himesh tried his best to create an aura of his so-called singing talent, which is nothing more than a cruel pronunciation of words like Tanhayah that completely kill the beauty of the terms that are so often used for love. songs. Why is not Himesh smiling? Just because he does not use toothpaste Close Up! Now his friend is there, tracking him everywhere, and this lawyer is the number one in the city, who should be swaying sexually and trying to seduce Kimesh, of all the beautiful German people she could meet earlier, perhaps, male lawyers in this part of the world can curse your fate for being able to cope with the harsh, unattractive party every day! Action scenes are so funny shot, like an event planner, attacked by a thief, cars driving in cars, and so on and so forth. The bride's father seems to be in a hurry to get rid of his daughter by marrying her so that he would fly here and there. Most hypocritical, he praises HR for spreading love among the people of the world, as if they were sweets, and on his back he reads his daughter’s lecture about these people in show business in cold blood. when Himesh turns out to be innocent, he again unceremoniously throws the other guy, as if it were a game in a musical chair! I didn't even see the face of the poor guy, did I? Khansika as Ria looks as if she needs to check her eyes so as not to strain her eyes! The guy in the role of a friend is good, who acted quite naturally, and should be in the best films, such as Sharman Joshi. Children's artist in a short appearance Trisha is sweet, but wasted. It seems that today's younger generation has gone mad, as they prefer this kind of mockery of lyrics and musical scores and associate gossip with it, for example, if you sing ek bar aaja, the ghost will come. it has a strange taste in music and is quite funny. I am surprised how such classic lyricists as Gulzar chose Himesh from all people to give music. In Panchantra there is a story that a crow attaches so many peacock feathers to look beautiful and attract birds; but in the end the feathers fall, and the real dark crow opens! I hope that Khimesh will hint and refrain from the production of such nonsensical things and in vain spend the precious money that he earned by taxing his short nose! His friend tells him if your nose is cut, how will you sing? Thank you for showing us Germany, Himesh, for a reasonable fee for renting a DVD! and correct these spelling errors, okay? extra e in the film, not e in love! There is also a famous number from the old movie “Shuli”, Mehuba, in which Mallika Sheravat moves again, but this time with Himesh, winking at her, and conveniently, Ria, his so-called true love and his new bride are not around! Now it was very clever, Himesh! At least one thing in this film that you did intelligently to justify the presence of Sherawat. But doesn't she look a little confused?
