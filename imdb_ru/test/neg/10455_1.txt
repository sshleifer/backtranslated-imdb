This film was just awful, it was acne for the film industry. I know that every film may not be a hit or even an average, but the responsible parties that came together for this epic game should have seen that they had a time bomb in their hands. I can not help but think that the actors will gather between the scenes and console each other for the fact that they are in such a huge pile of manure. Now I hear it: “Are you paid?” “No, you?” I understand that this click was more than likely with a shoe budget, but even with that in mind, it could still be better. You are waiting for the monster / creature to appear, and when you finally see it, it's a big yawn. I am so angry with myself that I spent 1.07 on this bitch !!!
