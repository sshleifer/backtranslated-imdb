I was so “impressed” by Tim Kinkade's MUTANT HUNTER that I tried. This is the near future, of course, post-apocalypse. A wandering fighter named Neo (no, not that Neo!) Joins a group of similar fighters to challenge the Dark One and his subordinate Valaria. Along the way, they encounter mutants, crazy women, sewer worms, a big spider leg and some clumsy robots. Oh my God! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the ROBOT HOLOCAUST hardly rises (or falls) to the HUNT level. The time is 79 minutes (90 is written on the box), this is one cheap click. The sets have all the elaborate carnival haunted house design, and the costumes prove that in the near future everyone will dress like John Travolta in the final dance number STAYING ALIVE. Atomic wasteland is a combination of old buildings filled with rubble and Central Park. The Dark Headquarters is ominously called the Power Station and looks, well, like a power station. The game is bad everywhere, with the exception of Angelica Yager as the evil Valarie. Jager is a whole “bad level.” Feeling sick Sherman, she gives such an amazing performance that it becomes the only reason to recommend this film. It also delivers the only nudity of the movie in the "pleasure camera" section of the movie. Ed French once again delivers the effects of robots, but they are not as slippery as his work in MUTANT HUNT.
