My old school teacher boasted that he had seen every movie he ever made, so one day my friend and I decided to make a film called Pacific Inferno. We later argued whether Carl Weathers or Billy Dee Williams played the main role. Our teacher found the argument interesting, so he approached us and told us that Jim Brown played the main role in "Pacific Inferno". We thought he was trapped in a lie, until we went to the library and found that “Pacific Inferno” is actually a real film. This incident made me make a movie ... it's terrible. Our fictional movie had a better plot than this part. The weather and Billy Dee would be much better in the picture.
