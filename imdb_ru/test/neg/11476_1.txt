The five guys who were together in the cub reunited a few years later to go camping. If they were faced with opponents in childhood, and also escaped convicts in this supremely unfamiliar supposed comedy. Most of the actors are content to just make a phone call and don't seem to care much about the film. The screenwriters were so lazy that the names of the characters are, for the most part, the names of the actors who play them accordingly. The trouble of Richard Lewis is getting really old, REALLY fast. Even the late great character actor, Brion James, cannot save this git. (Despite the fact that he is one of the few actors in the film who does not completely embarrass himself) I barely smiled, much less had something that would be reasonably interpreted as laughter. Awful. <br /> <br /> My rating: F
