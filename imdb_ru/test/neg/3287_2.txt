This show is just another bad comedy that will probably be canceled in two seasons. It's not just that sexist / racist / homophobic jokes, they are also not funny and clichéd. In the first episode, Father said something like: “I would like women not to go out and get a job and have the same rights as men.” Then he laughed at his son, saying that he was strange. What parent says their child is weird? So overall, this show is boring, unoriginal, offensive, cliché and most of all NOT FUN. Yes, the American father is touchy. But it also makes you laugh and obviously accepts mickey. This is the difference.
