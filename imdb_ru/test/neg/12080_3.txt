<br /> <br /> This film was shot and released as the successor to the scary, though quite popular, California beach comedy called “Solids”, but it has little or no connection to the earlier film, and its better evaluate in full. own the right. This is certainly better than that of “Solid I,” and is more closely associated with films such as “Venus” and “Summer Lovers”, which were also shot in the summer on the Greek islands. The combination of blissful beaches on blue bays with beautiful bare sinuses makes for seductive viewing, but (with the exception of travel specifically designed for planning your next vacation), even such films require an adequate storyline if they want to attract viewers more than a very few minutes. Venus was reinforced by the legend of the reincarnation of the goddess, and the Summer Lovers had the vitality of “controlling the trio” as its theme. In my opinion, both of these films were much more successful than Solid Bodies II, which have a very meager storyline and are too dependent on the simplified comedy “Halftones”. Using slapstick quickly becomes tedious, usually leading to a series of very short, self-contained episodic episodes that are difficult to integrate into a continuous storyline. Mel Brooks achieved this brilliantly with Silent Movie, but few other films have succeeded in the same way, and Hardbody II, unfortunately, not. There is also the problem that the episodes of farce are not combined happily with the idyllic and peaceful scenario in which the film takes place. The final episodes at the airport were undoubtedly intended for the fun ending of this film, but, in my opinion, they are an example of the worst type of replayed pseudo-comedy of farce. They are also very long, so I left the movie with a bad taste in my mouth. This is a film that could have been much more successful with a stronger storyline and with most of its farce sequences, which are very heavily cropped. Since it was released, it certainly does not guarantee the audience a rating higher than 3. <br /> <br /> In the acting game, little is remembered, but the actors are doing everything possible within the limitations imposed by the meager story line and poor guidance - exactly These latter areas fail. <br /> <br />
