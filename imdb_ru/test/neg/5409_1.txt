If you want to get some fleeting glimpses of a split in some attractive women, you might like this movie in a second or two. If you like to see poorly thought out and performed “battle” scenes, there are a lot of them. If you are both blind and deaf, I still advise you not to show this film in your presence. This is definitely the worst or very close to the worst film I've ever seen. And it seems that some money was spent on it. Talk about throwing out money! As an editor, I would hope that the “editor (s)” of this “movie” would never be allowed to edit a movie, book, or even a post-note. As a writer, I would hope that the author (s) will never again be allowed even next to a broken pencil. You might think that I would not recommend you watch this movie. Not this way. Tape it (so you can stop your pain when you need it) and find out how bad a movie can be.
