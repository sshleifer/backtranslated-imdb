I am not a director, not a writer or something related to a film. But watching more than 1 movie every day gave me an idea of ​​whether a good movie or not. So, here it is: Fast and Undead is the robbery of the Fast and the Dead. I thought it might be a bit of a parody of a cool movie with a lot of starts in it. But no, I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Simply put, the movie sucks. I'm a big fan of horror films, but this film gives you blood here and there, but they are not so consistent. <br /> <br /> But I have to give them their due in creating terrible characters that gave me a little shorter. <br /> <br /> If you’re a big zombie fan, watch this. If not ... better look for other zombie movies.
