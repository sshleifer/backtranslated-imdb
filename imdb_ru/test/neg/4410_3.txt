** May contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> The South Sea looser was executed by other (Caucasians-like) locals after he became friends with the scientists Tod Andrews and Tina Carver. Terrible scientists dig him up and discover that he has taken the form of a humanoid tree. He wakes up and goes into a rage and is pretty sure that the boogie from the fifties, the atomic bomb, is to blame for this delusion. To claim that this particular monster is walking as if he has a stick would be superfluous. Suffice it to say that the creatures, like the film itself, huddled, throwing their enemies into some comfortable quicksand and giving the main characters one more thing to make silly comments. Paul Blaisdell created the costume of wood, and this is hardly his best work. Over the years, this film has been subject to many comments, such as "To hell with that, it can go!" Personally, I think this is the best walking movie I've ever seen.
