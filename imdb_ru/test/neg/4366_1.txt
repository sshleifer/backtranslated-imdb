In Killjoy 2, there is a fantastic song that clowns are usually very cute and funny, but Killjoy is a killer. I do not remember the song in the first film, but when the singer Olympia Fernandez sings “Killjoy, yes Killjoy 2”, it sounds like 2 were added for this terrible sequel. The film is much worse than the first film, and it was really bad. At this time, the cast, including, as a rule, excellent Debbie Rochon, refused to attempt, and the director Tammy Sutton does not create tension and is just a boring and steady film. The full moon shots made it during their “City” phase, none of which were very good, but not as bad as here.
