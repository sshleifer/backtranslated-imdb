It is very curious that Nichols and Hanks will unite for this, obviously, they believe in it. Strange, because it should be called "Charlie Wilson's War - Lie". <br /> <br /> How could the timeframes exclude the real story, when, freeing Afghanistan from the Russians, the CIA supported the Taliban, and today's World of terrorism. In 1990, bin Laden returned home to Saudi Arabia as a hero of jihad, who, together with his Arab legion, "overthrew the powerful superpower" of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. <br /> <br /> In order to avoid any connection with Osama bin Laden, it must be said, Hollywood cares little about historical truth. Charlie Wilson, a patriot, is hardly more like a congressman.
