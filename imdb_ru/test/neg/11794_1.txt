I just watched this movie with a few friends, they said that I had to watch it, but from the very beginning I knew that everything would get worse and worse. Thus, I can only give this movie 1 because the effects used were so poorly used and thought out that anyone can see that there were no “real” ghosts. I feel the worst part is that this so-called “old haunted house” contained a whole bunch of new items and several “conveniently placed items”. I could come up with effects that would look much better than a chair, an inverted invisible ghost (or I should say, a wire). Then, when they look at the ribbon of the chair, it turns over differently. Oh, this is a big error of continuity. If it was a really good movie, they would have caught it and all the other items of the “old house”. This film is like tearing down a house on a haunted hill, and the project of the Blair Witch is all in one poorly-designed and collected film. I would be ashamed to lay out something with this bad acting game, effects and cheap video snapshots of chests for girls and how comfortable the camera is when something “paranormal” happens. This film insults people who are actually looking for ghosts and take real shots with ghosts on film.
