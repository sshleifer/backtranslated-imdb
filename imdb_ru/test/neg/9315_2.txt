Historical films are always taken for freedom - conversations are invented so that no one can know what was actually said, customs are adapted for understanding by modern audiences, etc. However, historical films about real historical characters must at least make a minimum bow of history. This movie is not. The only scene that I really remember is when our hero surprises a murderer who creeps into his room at night. He confronts a dangerous attacker: "I do not remember being sent to a room." The main value of entertainment lies in its harmfulness; I recommended that my local video report put it on the "Turkeys" shelf.
