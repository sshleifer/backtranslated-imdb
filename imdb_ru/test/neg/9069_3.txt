The 70s were, without doubt, the golden age of horror "for television." This is one of those who probably was released as the ABC film of the week. This is an old story about a house and / or ghost belonging to one of the new owners. The film has a promise, but it is never realized. All too quickly. Tensions and tensions take time to build and grow. And this is nothing new. We have already seen all this before and even better. <br /> <br /> And one more final thought: I don’t understand why Robert Wagner’s character fell in love with a long-dead movie star when he married Kate Jackson for God's sake! !!
