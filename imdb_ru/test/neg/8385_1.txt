This film was very bad. If someone who starred in the film reads this, including the director, I HATE YOU! LOL, that blond woman who ran away screaming in the forest. At least shout and not shout and keep doing quirky heavy breathing !! and, oh my god, if it was a director who sorted out the cameras on this, then go back to normal work. No one wants to look at the chin of a scared woman all over it. Hell, don't even think about renting / buying or even having a copy of it within a radius of 100 meters from your house, as this can be harmful for people who like good movies ... When I got home, I thought that I made a great film in the image and style of the camera.
