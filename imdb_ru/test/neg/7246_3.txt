I accidentally saw this movie this morning at TCM. Very bad game, low budget and bad plot - the impressions that I felt while watching a movie. The only event in the film was the observation of the tender young Rita Moreno (23 years old), playing a young Indian squash, in love with a man over 50 years old. She reminded me of an earlier version of Sue Lyon as Lolita (1962), only the more innocent Lolita. She bounces up and down like a tiny 1950s bopper, almost as if you were expecting her to chew gum, dropping all over this old man, wanting to give him something, as he plays along with her, as if she is stopping him. Any man in his 50s who had a beautiful, virgin teenage girl who wanted to do ANYTHING for him and be his bride would be insane not to use her to their advantage. It is unfortunate that the censorship advice, when this film was released, did not allow for more character expansion, such as Rita Moreno. The only reason I gave this film 3 instead of 1 was the appearance of Rita Moreno in the film.
