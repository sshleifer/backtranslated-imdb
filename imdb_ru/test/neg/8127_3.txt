First of all, let me say that after watching this film, I felt that I was sold a product invoice. Keep in mind that this is not the film’s fault, that IMDb listens to it first as a comedy, and then horror, and then (although I don’t know how it sounded ... maybe some jerk from the film crew put it in) . Being a fan of the horror / comedy genre, I checked it based on this, and I'm very sorry that I did it. When to start? First of all, to return to my beginning, there is no comedy in this film. He tries once or twice, but at best he never gets more than a chuckle. My reaction first of all rolled my eyes and wondered why someone considered such tired material to be ridiculous. In addition, there is no horror. No second voltage can be found. You think I'm exaggerating ... no. No tension, very little blood and not much violence on the screen (sorry, but in a terrible blow, when good things start, the main foul). Damn ... there is even zero nudity. Call me a purist or underage ... I prefer some horrified if they can't come up with an original plot / premise. And what the hell was sick of the "reality show went wrong"? It was done earlier and much better. For example, Wrong Turn 2, or ... hmmm ... whatever the name of the film with Edward Furlong. That's how bad this movie is. I don't even remember the name of this movie, but it was better than that. I also liked one comment stating that the time for this was good, because “reality shows are taking over.” Someone from the last post that time machine? Are you joking? It's rubbish ... and no joke.
