This film is a window into the world of Britain in 1973 - the world of resort camps, fagots and birds. In fact, I was at Pontins Prestatyn while it was being filmed, so it’s interesting to see where I was resting as a child and what kind of world we left behind. The “plot”, as it is, concerns Stan and Jack’s attempts to turn work into a holiday camp (25 pounds a week!) Into the possibility of chasing young women and eliminating Blackie. They are joined by the rest of Stan's family, and from Arthur's (Michael Robbins) and Oliva's (Anna Karen) laughter, as well as Blake's apparent weirdness, you should hear laughter, but the idea that young women will see something desirable in a brilliant Stan ( Reg Varney) or depraved Jack (Bob Grant) is ridiculous. Pretty harmless in its time, now it's just a curiosity from years gone by.
