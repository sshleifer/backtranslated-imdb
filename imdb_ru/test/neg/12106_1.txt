I don't even know where to start. I did not like it. He did not act like a story, and so much was introduced into the film (cakes, the son was gay (?), The murder was justified, what possible reason could there be in the script for the existence of Linda aka Penelope), which was never explained All liquid spilled on the table and remained dripping from the table until everything turned into a big mess on the floor. <br /> <br /> Why did Vanessa Redgrave make a five-second cameo? Why did Diane Wyst use her character “Bullets over Broadway” without having fun in the camp? Why Jane Birkin was in the storyline for a start. The list is endless. The film ended, and we all looked at each other - sort of - did you understand something? <br /> <br /> I’ll tell you one thing: if I had seen my long-lost father kill, I certainly wouldn’t have embraced the murderer. Say one more thing, if “Bob” broke up with “Bob”, why did he hide his son in the closet? Was Bob going to have sex with Bob in front of his son? How did the murderer get in touch with his son so easily? <br /> <br /> If this review sounds confused, it’s because it’s a waste of film, talent and time. What the hell is a dead psychiatrist related to anything !! <br /> <br /> Jezz, this is one of the worst films I've ever seen, because it should / could be better, stronger and should have some meaning. Any feeling. Instead, they give us a diluted “Diva” (a 70s film with a murder) and tired performances that read boring words from a completely insane script. <br /> <br /> People are passing by. Or maybe I and the rest of the people who have reviewed this film are too stupid to understand all this - I mean, after all, this is a French film.
