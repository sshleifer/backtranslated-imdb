Obviously influenced by the success of "Destination Moon" and Lippert's "Rocketship X-M", this one simply does not make a cut. Limited special effects, a thin storyline leads to a performance that even a semi-decent composition cannot save. There is simply no credibility here. No one is surprised at the meeting with the Martians, who are very similar to earthlings, etc.
