Joe was first released in the US in the summer of 1970. Despite respectable notices, a reasonable box office and an Oscar nomination, he soon disappeared and remained forgotten during the 1980s, before being overestimated with enthusiasm, somewhat unfairly, in the USA in the USA. the end of the 90s. Thanks to this prolonged inaccessibility, his reputation continued to show that he was placed (inexplicably) alongside Michael Winner’s original “Death Wish”. Although revenge is a topic, a film about vigilance is definitely not the case. <br /> <br /> The plot is not worth describing. This is flabby, obscene and strangely theatrical chatter about random murder and about the incredible relationships that arise from it. This relationship and largely based on the class of the quirks of his two passages are exaggerated in a ridiculous caricature; these two and their position have absolutely nothing to do with reality. <br /> <br /> Almost everything in the film is monstrous and reluctantly outdated, which makes it all totally exciting. Hippies are depicted as insane and exceptional misanthropes, hard drugs make you sleep or dance manic with lipstick on your face, and most young women are willing to have sex with strangers in exchange for marijuana by a drop of a fly. In many ways, this is a film of the '60s, not of the' 70s, which is why why some of the stars in the industry began to include it in retrospective talks about the beginning of the Hollywood New Wave, is a complete mystery. Of all the people, Martin Scorsese even got involved, although probably only to give a hint of the dank, gloomy nuances of the gloomy urban cinematography, which almost certainly influenced the Taxi Driver four years later. But Joe is very reminiscent of the fierce tirade against Easy Racer and Bonnie and Clyde, and not the continuation of the same insurgent cinematic spirit. <br /> <br /> This film has no artistic value. - despite the incontinence of Joe’s rage on everything in his world, he remains absolutely nothing in history - but his value as a subject of a cultural museum is unprecedented. Filmed on and around the streets of New York in the darkest hours of the Vietnam War, and at a time when America (and, not least, its cinema) was revolutionized to the horror of the old guard, the film ends on its own completely forgetful and random path, telling more about this period of history than about the numerous infinitely excellent films that directly tried to capture him. <br /> <br /> But how about the movie? Despite the really amazing and effective shock ending, this is basically a Michael Winner film, but not so well done. How does it tickle your imagination? ** By the way, if you, like me, love to look at arbitrary background counterparts, then look at Harold Stepto at 1:22:11 in the hippie art gallery.
