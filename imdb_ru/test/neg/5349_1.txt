Regardless of whether the prevailing social message of this film is legitimate - that fair justice is warranted - I was more offended by McConaughey’s final statement. In the drama in the courtroom, the defender's final statement is largely the essence of the film, and when the issue is as difficult to solve as this one, the statement is indeed delivered to both the spectators and the jury. This basically implies that the audience considers the rape of a white girl a more horrendous crime than the rape of a black girl. I find it very offensive. As for the rest, I think the game was reasonable, with the exception of Sandra Bullock, who seems to play her usual playful role (doesn't really work in drama in the courtroom), but what’s the point when the message of the film is just as bad like this. He tells you that justice justice is in order, and accuses you of racism if you disagree.
