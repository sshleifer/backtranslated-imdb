The Texas Revolution of 1835â€“1836, including the periods preceding and immediately following it, is depicted in this mediocre 3-hour film for television, the only value of which is to shed light and pay homage to Stephen F. Austin, the so-called Father Texas, whose life story has long been clouded by the story of the legendary Sam Houston. The rest of the film is just the usual Santa Anna The Tyrant storyline and with a weak attempt to show a Mexican perspective with a fictional Spanish character demonstrating a stereotypical Latin courage. In combination with short low-budget battle scenes, such as Alamao and San Jacinto, this film is recommended only for lovers of real history who did not come from Mexico. To its credit, the Mexican form looks neat, and the romantic plot (another love triangle) does not take too much time on the screen. In general, this film portrays the movement of forced separation from the Anglo-Saxon Texas racial minority to be a positive and fair revolution against Mexican tyranny, as personified by General Antonio Lopes de Santa Anna, the so-called Napoleon of the West.
