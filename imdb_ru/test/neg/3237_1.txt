It's hard to believe that someone could take such a wonderful book and make such a terrible film. <br /> <br /> Imagine that King Kong is turning into a monkey organ shredder and the role of Fay Ray, played by a young boy. What about Elton John in the role of Rambo !!!!. This film is even worse than the TV night “Hunter's Night” remake. <br /> <br /> Using the name "Observers" and the name of Dean Kunz, the creators of this film should be held accountable for fraud on the part of readers of the book who expected a fairly accurate adaptation of the book. <br /> <br /> After reading the book, I never spoke to those who did not like it. Another good book is “The Winner” by David Baldachi.
