“Time to kill” is based on the first novel by John Grisham, which he wrote before he became famous, and which did not raise him to fame. (This will be achieved by "The Firm"). That is why this film did not appear much later, after Grisham began to release meaningless books with fresh dollar signs in his head. Unlike most of them, this book was about something. He had meat, he had weight, and he had a heart. <br /> <br /> But he also had a fatal flaw, and this fatal flaw is translated into a film. Namely, “Time to kill” substitutes you. <br /> <br /> Here we are dealing with a black man (Jackson), who is facing trial for the murder of two white men who brutally raped and tortured his 10-year-old. daughter. We have an outsider lawyer (McConaughey) who is struggling with a bad system to save his client. And, oh, by the way, all this is happening against the backdrop of racism in Mississippi, complete with men with a hood from a KKK, burning crosses. <br /> <br /> In other words, we must sympathize with Carl Lee Haley. We must believe that the father who loves his daughter is justified in killing the men who raped her. We must feel the injustice of the system, in which a racist snow-white jury could judge a black man, who was simply trying to avenge a cruel crime. We must feel that we are standing next to the people who sing "Free Carl Lee." <br /> <br /> But the problem of racism is a smoke screen, and all this is far-fetched. Karl Lee Haley was a warrior. Yes, for what he did, there were extenuating circumstances, but the fact remains that he was not innocent. That would be true, no matter what his skin color or the skin color of the attackers of his daughter, judge, jury or anyone else. <br /> <br /> And what is so harsh in this film is that he draws anyone who thinks that Karl Lee should have been convicted is a racist. The message seems to be this: if you think that the law should not be taken into the hands of people, then you can also burn crosses on a lawn somewhere in the hood. <br /> <br /> This is not the case. for the first time a heavy dose of sentimentalism is inserted into a similar story, and it will not be the last. Like the movie, “Time to Kill” remains true to the book, and the game is not so bad. But it played the hand with which it was played, really. Even a good cast cannot pick up a bad source material.
