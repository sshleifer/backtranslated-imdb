For the uninitiated, almost any Andy Milligan film is a shock, but despite the fact that I've seen many of his films, this one still perceives it as disgusting. Milligan takes Sweeney Todd's story, made with historical costumes (but not necessarily with historical hairstyles, in some cases) and with usual camera work, causing headaches and grainy quality. As for the blood, well, the version I saw may have been shortened, since not so much for the movie with the “bloodthirsty” in the title. The best indicator of disruptive filmmaking here is the meat pie, which consists only of the tits of a poor victim. <br /> <br /> So, while I’m going to cherish this work on my video shelf, it’s definitely a bit of a disappointment with the content, though. It is recommended only for the reckless and painfully curious. 3 out of 10
