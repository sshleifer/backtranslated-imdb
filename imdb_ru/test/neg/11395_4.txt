After watching this film, I thought, they really darkened the life of Errol Flynn! The film is really a nice eye candy. They truly understood the atmosphere of Hollywood of the 1930s and 1940s. The costumes were great. All the women looked charming, and all the men looked beautiful and dissolute. <br /> <br /> This is a serious film about the life of Errol Flynn? Nope This is a funny movie based on all the scandalous things he has done in his life. <br /> <br /> Why am I criticizing this film? This is a film that was promising, but could not deliver it. Duncan Reiger was really good as Errol Flynn. He was not as good as the original, but he made you believe that Flynn was not just a beautiful playboy who didn’t take himself seriously, but also a man who, although gifted with great talent, was a little excited and unhappy inside. Flynn's love life was a disaster, given that he had so many unsuccessful marriages. He also lost many good friends in his life. He also suffered from an unrequited love for the elegant Olivia De Havilland. The last scene of the film showed how Errol begged Olivia to stay with him, and instead she leaves. He is shown in his tuxedo, looks really empty and walks slowly around the pool, pouring the drink into the pool. It was a sad way to finish the film, but it came up because everyone already knows how he eventually fell apart from alcoholism and a scattered lifestyle. <br /> <br /> This film could have a much greater depth, it could have been better written well. Of course, they showed all the scandals, but they never showed Errol Flynn’s human center. Surprisingly, Duncan Rieger was able to give emotional depth to the character of Errol Flynn, even though there was no depth in the writing of the film. <br /> <br /> I’m probably never going to see this movie again, but I can still remember after watching this movie, “Gosh, it could have been a lot more .....!” I give this movie D +.
