I bought this DVD as part of a set of 50 "historical classics". This is hardly a classic, and since the plot has been updated by the time it was released, it is also not historical. The actual title on the DVD is “Obscene,” and the subtitle “Becky Sharp’s Private Life.” Myrna Loy is not very convincing, although in her defense she is burdened with a terrible scenario and a banal dialogue. As in many early conversations, especially in small studios, the actors and film crew show little skill. Loy wears some elegant dresses, but her costumes and makeup in the later scenes overdone. The only saving grace is the tolerable performance of Billy Bevan, who plays one of her many suitors.
