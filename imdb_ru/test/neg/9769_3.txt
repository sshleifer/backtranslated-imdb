I'm going to be generous here and give him 3 just because I live in Huntsville, and it was great to see how well the city was shot. However, this film was pretty bad. It seems that they started almost without a script, and the director simply told the actors to look at each other intelligently when the music was playing on him. And Billy D. Williams looked like he had better be anywhere, but not in this film. This is just a mess. I think I could write the script better than the offset for this film, and I'm not a writer. <br /> <br /> In the reviews and on the bulletin boards I noticed one thing - everyone is under the impression that the film begins during World War II, and in fact everything looked as if it was supposed to start in late 1950- x / early 1960s. Although by then the military was not segregated, Iâ€™m pretty sure that any troops waiting to board the train will still be segregated in a place like Huntsville, El. If the beginning of the film was supposed to be in the 1940s, then Billy Dee, Lesley Ann and Ray Don would be in the 70s and 80s, not in the mid-50s or in the early 60s. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time if you really dislike actors, because the story is not very interesting.
