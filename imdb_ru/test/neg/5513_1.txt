Roger Corman's plagiarism, collected for what seems to be a virtually zero budget. All special effects were originally used in the Battle for the Stars, and I suspect that a significant amount of props, costumes and decorations were also used from other sources. It seems that the story was written around these elements, so in fact it is not a film, but a recycling project. Third-class Star Wars trash was not needed either then or now.
