Enchanted April was one of Harry Beaumont’s latest films - he shot a few more after that. He made the Maisie films in the 1930s and 1940s. The opening credits say “From Elizabeth’s novel” and the author’s surname is completely omitted ... rather strange, but since it was von Armin, they might not like the German association at the time ... It’s sad to hear that it was a failure when it was released, with funny names like Frank Morgan (The Wizard) and Jessie Ralph, who played WC in the disapproving mother-in-law of Fields in Bank Dick. Two girls from London (Ann Harding and Catherine Alexander) decided to rent a castle for their two friends, but things are not going the way they had planned. Reginald Owen plays a husband with several personalities. In addition to a few funny moments, it moves rather slowly. Ralph is the only bright spot here, as an overbearing type of charge taking, and the picture is rather blurred and out of focus for most of the film. The views of Italy are all obvious backgrounds. The only savings here is that the Turner Classic version lasts only 66 minutes. It is a pity that they did not give Frank Morgan a big role. This was redone in 1992 by the BBC as a British film.
