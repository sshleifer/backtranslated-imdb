20 years ago, Dr. Chopper (yes, he drives a helicopter, and also cuts people) disappeared when the police discovered the bodies in his clinic. Since then, people have disappeared around Lake Tanoka (or something like that), and corpses / body parts have been found everywhere. It turns out that Dr. Chopper needs parts of his body to stay alive, and he took them from strangers, such as a couple of lesbians and 5 female girls during their dedication (you see the picture), traveling on Tanok Lake. When a group of teenagers decide to go camping, they will definitely encounter a doctor ... <br /> <br /> Well, if you want to spend some time, this is the right choice. The action ranges from really bad to mediocre, when girls stumble and fall all the time for no apparent reason. Every chance to show the skin is used, but in fact nothing shows. The same applies to the special effects, which are quite pathetic from each slash shot at an angle, so you can't see it, but in the film there are many parts of the body, all covered with blood (probably to hide how sad they actually look ). The plot is quite erroneous, and the dialogue is rather sad. The only time I laughed was when Dr. Chopper said, "Hi!" when you try to be scary. Do not watch this if you are not a hack n 'roll fan. Even then, I would recommend that you look at something better.
