I really liked this movie. Number 5, the film's star robot received a thunderbolt and something happened to its chains. He acts and thinks more like a man. The robot repeats the advertisement, which he studies after watching TV. Then he applies these statements to his circumstances. Number 5 is smart and funny. The character mimics the voices of the stars, tries to dance like John Travolta in Lost and much more. He has a saying for most of his circumstances that he remembered. Robot actions are really good. Number 5 wants to drive, cook and delight Stephanie with all the characteristics of a person. The way robots move and line up is really hysterical. I am disappointed that the authors could not keep it clean for all viewers. There is a surprise in this film, ending with something you donâ€™t expect. I hate movies that have swearing, although I like them, I give them a lower rating. There were curses in this movie. Jesus Christ was used as a curse word that insults me, it is used at least 3 times. Gd dm, Bull shit, etc. This could be a great movie without all this offensive expression. In this film, there is no sex, some manifestations of violence, such as robots, blowing machines and cars.
