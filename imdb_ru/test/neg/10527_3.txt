This film was disappointing. Fifteen years later, when I was reminded of some information about Mariel Hemingway, all the regrets I had about the film rolled back. Although I remember Peter O'Toole, I completely did not notice the fact that the “lead” woman (well, she was just the object of discussion in the storyline) was Miss Hemingway. I saw this film back in the days when I wrote reviews of films, and warned people about it, because the stories simply did not work, and fifteen years of my subconscious, trying to figure it out, still did not make sense in the flow of ideas. <br /> <br /> This may be partly due to the fact that, it seems, after the original film was shot (whatever it was), the editor came in and tried to put something together on this I don't know whether it was the project of the previous studio boss, and therefore it was sabotaged to discredit his or her successor, or was it a disaster because of the original script when the attempts to save were unsuccessful. Theatrical version simply did not work.
