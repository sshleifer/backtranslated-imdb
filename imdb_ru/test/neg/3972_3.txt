First, I will say this ... the film would have been a science fiction classic of the 70s, if it had been performed much better. <br /> <br /> However, let's take a look at the plot ... does it start when Peter Graves (or is it Clarence Over?) running for president, and then turns into a stupid environment, similar to a college campus, full of authoritarian in stupid caps and headsets for truckers and mentally retarded athletes who behave as if they are forever 8 years old. shows that one guy seems to be going to America for a party, and then taken to the medical laboratory, where he is given drugs, wrapped in a plastic bag, and then prepared as if doctors are packing vegetables for packages of steamers ... well , in fact, it is planted on ice so that doctors can extract the necessary organs. <br /> <br /> After that, it seems to him that the place where he lives is a bit strange after a can of beer (from all possible conspiracy devices) that he finds in the river makes him look suspicious (damn it, these beer cans!). He and some equally stupid love lovers feel that they need to get to the bottom of all this, so he forces her to stay when he runs through what is basically a large college administration building, with some evidence that he discovers along the way cloning. ... and how it is part of it. <br /> <br /> He runs away from his controllers after he was shot dead, and an old reporter helps him find his "father" - the man from whom he was cloned. It so happened that he was a clone of brother Peter Graves. After a debate about what to do with him and his evidence, he returns to the institution to find his girlfriend (who in the meantime has undergone a lobotomy to become even more stupid, harmless, and ready to conduct a talk show in accordance with the SOL team). He was captured and placed in a cold store, like his Nazi friend, backward from the very beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, several people, including Graves, were killed in a clash in the house of the Graves brothers. A reporter and his wife were killed by a bomb. It seems that the conspirators to some extent won ... <br /> <br /> Then Peter Graves can survive if a metal poker breaks through his clone pieces by a miracle and he votes again. for me, ‚Äùjust as reporters confront him about cloning. <br /> <br /> Definitely MST3K-feed, but at the low end of the spectrum, how bad it is.
