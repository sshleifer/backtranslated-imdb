I do not agree with the fact that Dante portrays zombies who support Democrats as creatures with an average IQ of 23. I believe that their behavior should reflect a lower IQ than this, something in Pelosi's IQ order ... The figure consisting of single digit please <br /> <br /> The MOH series is rather uneven, and this is the worst episode. Dante, another thoughtless Hollywood liberal (or apolitical nerd who cuddles with the left establishment to rekindle his miserable career?) Must have finally realized that his directorial aspirations have stalled for almost two decades now, therefore, have come up with this provoking, awkward, leftist "satire" of the Bush administration, Republicans and capitalism. Perhaps he felt that he had not been openly political before. He certainly would not have been the first incompetent person who used political propaganda to develop his career when all else fails. Creator of such whims as Piranha, Howl and Matin, Dante was as useful a contributor to the horror genre as Adolf Hitler to world peace. <br /> <br /> TH uses humor with the lowest common denominator, cheap and predictable jokes that even a blue collar among union members will not have problems with understanding. Or have you ever seen a clever, subtle, clever liberal satire? Populist manure has the main message of all, therefore, the language and the way in which this message is transmitted should be as simple and basic as the name of Sean Penn. And what could be better than people sending this message to popcorn eager sheep than a couple of Tinseltown Cocaine sniffers who fell so low that they are forced to write for television ... <br /> <br /> I don’t want political propaganda, neither left nor right in any type of films. But to put it in horror - of all genres - is evidence of the infinite stupidity that prevails among the anti-intellectualism of Hollywood. Dante was so helpless that he didn’t even notice the funny assumption that zombies would vote for the Democrats ... (This is what you get for finishing a film school: not a source of wisdom or useful knowledge from any imagination).
