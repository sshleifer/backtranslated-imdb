Here is a film that is clearly advertised as exotic for viewers unfamiliar with its subject matter. <br /> <br /> An attempt to mix fiction and documentation “Kadosh” awkwardly falls between the chairs. As a documentary, on the one hand, it is neither accurate nor insightful. To understand his careless handling of the details, one has to go no further than to the initial scene, where it is quite obvious that the ultra-orthodox protagonist does not even know how to properly put on his t'filin. In a more general sense, the tedious rote-style representation of details (in this case, a Jewish ultra-orthodox ritual) is the role of leadership rather than a good documentary; the latter must provide the organizer with a principle (gestalt, if you will) for the viewer so that he can manifest himself with a better understanding of the subject. This is clearly not happening here, as the ultra-orthodox ritual becomes even more mysterious. The director seems to have done a decent job explaining all this verbally during the film’s advertising campaign; Cinematically, however, this is a serious case of stuttering. As an artistic feature, on the other hand, it suffers from flat character, simplicity of plot, and frankness of the message. In some moments I felt like I was watching a cartoon. (for example, the scene of the end of the wedding night - without going into details of angles, positions and sizes ... well, technically it cannot be a realistic image of the human sex, no matter how wild it is.) <br /> <br /> The film has no subtleties. Smart manipulations with cues that stimulate the viewer’s thoughts and thoughts to actively participate in the cinematic text, which, I believe, is a sign of a good trait, are completely absent. On the contrary, when I watched the movie, I felt compelled to force-feed him again and again with the same already experienced and too obvious content. This is really, as the director Gitay himself said in one of the interviews, the architectural “moving objects in space,” and then coloring the scenes with relevant emotions when required, and moving the plot along its appropriate and predictable path; but the spark, this creative, duel-like dark, unintelligible spark (let's not forget that “Kadosh” is supposedly a tragedy), the one that casts a spell on a two-dimensional screen that turns it into an extension of the viewers world, was missing. Perhaps the work of a visual engineer, perhaps an inexperienced ideologue; definitely not a real director. What I saw was a game of passion for animated problems, not real people of flesh, blood, and complexity. In general, the acting was not able to overcome this directing plane of the idea, forced (sometimes even tortured) in the film. One notable, though relatively minor, exception was that the Mikveh lady and mother played the magnificent and experienced Lea Koenig. <br /> <br /> It requires more than strict adherence to the victory formula (namely, a portion of the exotic, plus a heartbreaking, but simple melodrama, plus a popular agenda, preferably politically correct) to tempt my interests. The bottom line is that in much of the film I'm just bored. Despite the novel, perhaps even the pioneering achievement of using the ultra-orthodox neighborhood as a film set, for which Mr. Guita and his team deserve all praise, I found Kadosh too nadadsky (Hebrew for “banal”).
