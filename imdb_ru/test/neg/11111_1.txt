My God ... where to start? Chupacabra Terror is one of the worst Horror films ever made. This shit makes the "Killer of Demons" look like an "Exorcist." Special note: There must be at least one sex scene in the horror movie B. Do not expect even a hot girl in this. With this unforgivable mistake I have to start with a full blow. <br /> <br /> First of all, if you are going to make a horror movie monsters, you have to spend most of your budget on creating a “cool” Monster outfit. The monster in this movie looks like a $ 10 Halloween costume. Chupacabra (yes , that's exactly what is written) does not look threateningly in the film. It's an actor in a Halloween costume, please! it looks so cheap that it drives me crazy. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the bloody effects are any spinal cord horror film. Again, the producers decided not to spend on decent effects of blood. Blood looks damn under Please take a look at the guy who split in two. This is probably the best scene in the film and it lasts about ten seconds. The ending is a very bad scene that will not leave you satisfied. <br /> <br /> Actor game - the last thing to expect is that the quality of films of this type, but in this film it is terrible. The cast, which has no acting experience, fools itself about 85 minutes. A special mention deserves the blonde with curly hair who tries to convince members of special forces that He is sick. The cough he pretends is just ridiculous. He's probably the worst actor in a horror movie, no kidding. In addition, Captain Peña demonstrates terrible performance in the first ten minutes of the film. <br /> <br /> The true story of the Chupacabras is not even told. All you learn is that the monster sucks the blood of a goat. Why bother with this piece of shit? Plesae, do not even watch it, even if you have such an opportunity. Even if it is ventilated on the cable. <br /> <br /> I usually support low-budget horror films, because the people involved in them, at least, try to do something “different” from Hollywood, but this does not mean that horror fans like me, should take this kind of garbage.
