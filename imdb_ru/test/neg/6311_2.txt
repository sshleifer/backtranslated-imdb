It really is just awful. Quaid replays more than Shatner. The part that Elvis comes in and says, “You can have everything,” just kills everything that could be good in this film, bad enough as it is. Drug use was completely covered in snow, the only thing that had to do with his life was that he married his cousin. Quaid also does not look like Lewis and has dark roots and eyebrows. I would like this to be done in the future with someone who is not trying so hard. A larger budget does not hurt and perhaps more about his real life. I was very, very disappointed in Quaid. Do not watch this movie, otherwise you too.
