With the little respect it deserves, I would like to state that this film was terrible. The filmmakers had good intentions, but the overall quality of the direction and production value was clearly not enough. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes to laugh well, and then spend another two hours of his life, experiencing a truly painful experience. I am surprised that I even found this film on a DVD stand for $ 1, where it was successfully placed. I thought maybe it would be good, and that I could open some amazing independent film - I was wrong. I wish I had never seen this movie. My 3-year-old cousin could not make the worst movie. I am glad that I watched the film, because I can finally tell people that I have seen the worst film, and I was sure of it.
