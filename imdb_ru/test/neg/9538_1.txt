Well - let's say, in some college in southern California, there is a film making class. And some guys were credited just to shoot girls, and they gave them a camera. And then they were drunk / stoned / or just stupid to actually use the camera, and they turned it into their assessment. And failed. <br /> <br /> This is my only explanation for this thing. My God, they left a date and time counter during some of them. The picture began in a new scene long before the sound and forgot about the plot. Well, obviously, there was one, and they should have told you about it as soon as the 3-hour sequence of introduction was completed. But I'm glad they did, because I would never get it by watching it.
