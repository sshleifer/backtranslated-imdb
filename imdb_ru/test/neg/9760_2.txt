Screenwriter Patrice Leconte takes a versatile and potentially bottomless thing - friendship - and turns it into a flat and meaningless farce, despite its outstanding actors, excellent cinematography and elegant design. It's all in the plot, and the plot is ridiculous. “Teach me how to be pleasant”, art dealer Francois Coste (Daniel Auteuil) tells a random stranger (Dany Boon), and this sums up about him. We know almost nothing about friendship, and Daniel Othey can be a good actor, but we do not for a moment believe that he can be a dizzying egoist, on whom the script depends. In the same way that we hope that the parody is over, Leconte performs one of his usual cathartic actions, quickly moving from damage to disaster. Like Francois’s treasured Greek vase, everyone and everything in this film is a fake. The only asset "Leconte" is Julie Gayet in the face of business partner Kostya Katherine, which looks gorgeous and sexy, despite a serious mishap.
