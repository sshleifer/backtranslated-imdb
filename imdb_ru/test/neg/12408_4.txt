How do I mess around after watching Wong Kar-wai's 1994 film Ashes? more precisely, reissue and reissue of 2008 with “Redux” at the end of the title ?? I wonder what went wrong. I wonder why the movie just didn't work? I wonder why the film did not score significant points in my book. In particular, what was this film that sucked him up and made him the worst film director in his career? <br /> <br /> Well, it's really not that hard to understand. Let me just say that it’s really a shame that Kar-wai so suddenly descended into this hellish pit of mediocrity and poverty in motion, especially given the fact that he released the Chungking Express, one of his permanent legacies and absolutely exalted film. So ?? something went wrong? It would be advisable to consider "Ashes of Time" as something of an experimental film. Our director essentially puts his own unique style of filmmaking and puts it in a completely different setting, mood and atmosphere; The result is a catastrophic film that is everywhere and just does not work. Therefore, it would be even more reasonable to call the “Ashes of Time” a failed experiment. Bold, bold and innovative, but nonetheless failure. <br /> <br /> Let me elaborate. Those who have seen the films of Mr. Kar-wai, a Hong Kong racer who has left his mark on the world of art houses since his debut in the late 80s, will know that there is a primary aesthetic that binds all of his films together ; in fact and, to be honest, they are all colorful, thought-provoking, friendly, slightly humorous and meaningful memories of life, love and loss. The same formula is transferred to the ashes of time; nevertheless, in Hong Kong, places are regularly visited, and in its place we find ourselves in ancient China, in the land of legendary warriors and martial arts clans. <br /> <br /> In this intertwined Quasi-adventure / historical marque - a typical love story of Kar-vai, this time with the participation of an elegiac assassin who has moved to the middle of the desert and commits assassinations. However, I have to stop there; character description is useless. What for? Because no character in “Ashes of Time” is worth mentioning or anything. What a soft cast and what a waste of talent (in the case of "The Ashes of Time" there are almost all of Kar-Wai's permanent associates). <br /> <br /> Not only that, but the film is, in fact, an endless continuous wandering in a horrible, almost non-existent narrative structure. One of the main reasons why the Ashes of Time detractors curse him is that he seems to have no plot, let alone similarity or pointing to it. You can definitely see what they are striving for, even from the first two or three minutes, and maybe less, of the film. Perhaps this is just an atypical setting of ancient China, which is unusual and not suitable for the typical Kar cinematic style. I like to think, sadly enough, that Mr. Kar-wai simply spent a lot of time here. <br /> <br /> One thing that a reviewer can actually make a compliment in “Ashes of Time”, although he said that the compliment is sharply isolated, is this another brand director? wonderful, colorful and blissful aesthetics. What joyous color is written on the screen, what magnificent textures are painted for us, and what fascinating landscapes and images are captured for us throughout the film. We can at least accept this as a sign that Wong Kar-wai is still there at heart, and this is just a film that is so atypical and usually hides his meritorious nuance. Although we do not have enough visual effects to completely release Kar-vai for this disastrous undertaking, are they enough to make the film worthy of attention ?? and, at least, we do not leave the film in a completely and completely strange mood, now that there is something we can pleasantly think about. <br /> <br /> In essence, this is the film “Art of Ussya,” followed in the style of, say, the legendary Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. However, one thing distinguishes the film Kar-wai from the best Kurosawa, and this is what in the films of the Japanese director everything sticks together and just works. In Ash Time nothing works. Kar's attempt to make a truly deep film “Usya”, not to mention an intellectual and provocative film in general, is a futile attempt. <br /> <br /> Kar-wai claims that the creation of the “dust of time” exhausted him and that he needed time to clear his head. It must have been a tedious effort on his part, since his efforts were embodied in the film and passed on to us directly? I mean, just watching a movie is a tedious effort, and now I need time to clear my head of this unpleasant movie.
