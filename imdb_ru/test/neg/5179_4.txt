“Soldier Rising” follows the cruel cruel journey of the gangster Carlton Lich and his companions through drugs, violence, sex, violence, weapons, violence, and did I mention violence? <br /> <br /> Protagonist Carlton Leech (Ricci Harnett), member of the ICF (Inland City Firm); a group of football hooligans who have become professional gangsters, leads the audience through the events leading up to the “Range Rover assassinations” in 1995, when three gang members became victims of particularly brutal professional “hits”. Lich's success as a doorman and talent in finding abusive friends to control undisciplined players at a local nightclub brings him to the company of infamous drug dealers and gangsters who benefit from the rave scene of the 80s and 90s and the culture of drugs . <br /> Starting with violent realistic shots of the dead, the viewer is thirsty to understand what happened, but was completely unsatisfied. The next 2 hours go through countless representations of the characters. Each of them basically establishes another typical “tough man”, showing that he attacks usually undeserved victims before probably coming to an even more unpleasant end. The small emotional understanding that viewers are allowed to form for some characters (for example, a family man accused of missing drugs) quickly collapses when they are either killed anti-climatically or their plot line remains unsolved. Hints at the plot, presented at the beginning, inadequately end with vague impressions of how the killings occurred, since the events are put forward with a small reward for continuing the vague confusion of previous events. <br /> <br /> This film was created with a standard audience formula that prefers violence and slang 'ard nut' to a real storyline. “Rise of the Footsoldier” borrows too much from the “Football Factory”, leaving aside the good moments, without showing any moral consequences for the hooligan subculture or establishing empathy with the main character. The violence, although brilliantly shot, seems excessive and implausible, because there is no one close enough long enough for the audience to form an emotional attachment. The sense that the gangs are untouchable by the police is fair enough, but the doorman owning a machete regularly commits murder in public places, makes even the most willing spectator think. The audience remains at a loss as to the relevance of many key events and developed characters that do not affect the final conclusion. An attempt at "gross realism" is further destroyed by a substance called "True Serum", which the Turkish mafia uses to get honest answers from involuntary people. This is NOT a genre in which to invent psychologically unrealistic drugs, and makes interrogation almost absurd. <br /> <br /> On real scenes of violence (before they become repetitive) some tension persists, combined with quick flashes of color or the end of a film. Smoothly put up fights in combination with the obligatory but effective shaky manual shooting of the camera saves the film, but, unfortunately, the plot (or its absence) limits its demographic niche. <br /> <br /> In essence, the events of this film are based on not deservedly presented, and an adequately consistent storyline is donated for stereotypical characters and non-original plot. This film takes place on the market, but if you like your cruelty, this film is not for you. <br /> <br /> http://www.obotedwithfilm.com/
