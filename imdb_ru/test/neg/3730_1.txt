Throughout my life, watching and enjoying thousands of Feeling Minnesota movies is absolutely the worst (** main movie with A stars) I've ever seen. Bar not. This film completely fails on every level. It is poorly photographed and edited. There is a boring acting game in which the actors look boring. Maybe just collect a salary? And worst of all, the dirty script seems to have been written under the influence of some unpleasant substance found only in the sewer. I can not even understand how a writer / director could find someone who could finance this project, not to mention attracting any star he did. I really would like to go back the time I wasted watching this piece of garbage. If possible, I would give this film a zero rating. A negative number is even better.
