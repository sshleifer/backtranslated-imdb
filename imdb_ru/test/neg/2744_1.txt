I admit the secret admiration for the original TV show Love Thy Neighbor - mainly because they demonstrate a kind of excessive insolence and bad taste, synonymous with many programs of their era - but I would be lying through my teeth (very uncomfortable position) if I pretended that this spin -off on the big screen is not an abomination. The initial scenes of meaningless vandalism are not only meaningless, but also confusing - it is never explained why the film starts with a shot of people who steal each otherâ€™s houses, and nothing improves. By the time the film discovers the oldest joke in the book - the terrible mother-in-law dragon unexpectedly turns out to stay - accompanied by the horribly obvious discovery that she is developing a soft spot for the black neighbor's father, moving her passionate son to ever greater depth of self-satisfied, ignorant rage, most astute viewers will shut down. Take it as a warning if you are not interested in the side effects of a cheap skateboard with a terrible game, a static direction and a common comic flair for a burning orphanage.
