In addition to all the negative reviews: I was amazed to see that somewhere in a hat cap, a surveillance camera was somehow called in the most unexpected place to show the “crisis” team (“Look, Maaaaaaaam”) what happened, especially near the Thames Barrier, when a professor delivers a heavy blow (in full force) to the head with a heavy object and subsequently lives to tell a story. Otherwise, I did not manage to shake off the image of some actors depicted in other films / programs: I told my wife: “Hey, this is Neil, from Young (Nigel Glider) and“ Did they call Hercules Poirot for help? (David Suchet). To add to the disgrace of this film (recently shown in two parts on ITV UK), ITV showed the Environmental Protection Agency telephone number after each episode for concerned viewers living in areas “at risk of flooding.” How low can you, as a broadcaster, treat your audience like that? What should the Environmental Protection Agency think about ?? (“Oh no, this is again Mrs. Jones from Hull. She says that she was right all the time, she saw it on ITV”).
