This is one of four 1970s films filmed by TV presenter Lane Slate, about sensational murders in small towns. They show cute television personalities as police chiefs and bizarre characters as urban regulars, including light love interests. Others: they only kill their masters (James Garner, 1972); and "The Girl in an Empty Grave and a Deadly Game" (both Andy Griffith, 1977). <br /> <br /> Alda is located near Vermont ("Mount Angel" near Horse Creek "); the rest in California, Garner by the Sea (Paradise Landing) and Griffith in the Mountains (Lake Jasper). Everyone is trying to catch the feeling of a small town, move at a quiet pace among comfortable characters and solve the mystery with at least some difficult turn or turn to it. At this level, they are somewhat interesting (the fact that they often recurred on their own suggests that they have some attractiveness). But they suffer from shared fine stories and dialogue, a hectic rhythm, soft settings, flat or exaggerated characters and repulsive, forced attempts (often juvenile or coarse) in color or humor. <br /> <br /> Alda’s and Garner’s are most serious about history, characters, rhythm and tone. They have the best support rolls, although Alda has the best use; Griffith pales in comparison. Alda is the best director. <br /> <br /> Shocking has a surprise and a drama. The killer method is inventive. The tone is more even, and the dialogue is more natural than that of Griffith. Alda’s film does not suffer like the others from the smug transplants of a big city into a city or from exaggerated, exaggerated local characters, both of which look like inventions by a Hollywood screenwriter and not as authentic (the worst offender — Griffith’s witty film mumbles “Whit”, which as we are told, he tried to hook on a jeep and drive away with a trailer serving as a temporary bank branch, dragged a dock for a police boat, stole tomatoes from a farmer's truck just to get nothing for them, and filled $ 11 per sq. The statement about the seizure of “Spiro T. Babilis”, which only the cashier should discover). Fortunately, there is no awkward, heavy recurring dialogue from Griffith films (“Are you going for lunch?” “I'm going to take the boat.” “Are you going to take the boat for lunch?” “Me, I'm not going to have dinner.” “You are not going to take the boat for lunch? ";" There is no fish in this lake. Why are you fishing here? "" It is illegal in Mounted Mountain. "" It is also located here, you are breaking the law. "" Some law. There is no fish in this lake. "" Then why are you fishing here? "" I told you that it is illegal in Horse Mountain. ";" Please, call me Lloyd. My name is Lloy . "" Well, Lloyd ... "" Call me Lloyd. That is my name. My name is Lloyd. ") <br /> <br /> But Alda is too few Key and not impressive to be taken seriously even as a little The police chief, of course, is not a red-hot lawyer demanded by a rival city. Slate has the character to recognize this when he is late for the scene by the time an obvious clue, as a result of random name recognition. Instead of finding out or investigating, Barnes blindly erases in emotional denial. His secretary Lasser gives him a clue (“Why didn’t I think about it,” he says!). An embarrassing funeral scene plus the conspiracy contrivance leads to another clue to the present. <br /> <br /> Worse, Barnes is more interested in making fun of the military district’s helmets sent to his aid (Deadly Game also suggests Slate has something against the military) than effectively leading them or his people . He admits a later murder, incompetently guarding a known target. Barnes allows you to repeatedly ram your car when the killer leaves the scene of the crime, not grabbing the weapon and not trying to take control. Again, he is ineffective and almost killed on the climate scene, which is the result of numerous mistakes on his part, which are only partially corrected by chance. The erratic northeastern accent that affects Alda does not help believability. <br /> <br /> There are gaps in the plot. Why did the killer strike after all these years? And committing the first two murders without a trace seems implausible. But they are nothing compared to the later ones - a couple together, a shop owner in his shop during working hours, a fully dressed deputy sitting in his office, and, incredibly, his dog! <br /> <br /> Alda’s film also suffers from some offensive elements that Slate incorporates into all films. Barnes first appears in a motel clerk's bed. Then he treats her rudely at every step and insults and tries to avoid her children. This talk about a woman doctor, smacking a rude, mean-spirited character (Garner’s film was described as “sloppy”, including a scene where he and his deputy laugh at how the girl in the back of a car as a result of a collision with otkushena guy in the car with her. Griffith feature - routine of Ersatz Ropers, in which a woman embarrassed trying to persuade a man in the "pantry"; talk like a room with a deputy when discussing the death in a car accident a young woman ("You took her?", " I took her once "), mentioning the cashier of Bernice Bank as" swollen in places "and" putting pins into her "and" hatred "and dismissing the Maud secretary because she was" too hairy "; two tables of stirrup and a flashlight "; a humiliating scene in which Fran Ryan offers Griffith, offering" a little homebrew ", and an offensive plot in which a woman being pursued by a deputy plays like he is" sleeping around "). <br /> <br /> Finally, Alda’s film has a gloomy, discolored, colorless, lifeless look. Only Louise Lasser adds a spark. At least other films had some kind of spirit, scenery and pleasant music; Griffith went to the mountainside, to the lake and even to the big city. You like to revisit the Masters or the Empty Tomb rather than the Shock.
