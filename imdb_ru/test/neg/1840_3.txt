Doll Master is an example of a lousy horror film that fell somewhere in space with its two not very well-established genres: a horror film and an emotional dramatic film. It looks like The Doll Master is trying hard to be a very scary horror movie, but it fails. The noise of the puppets during the movement is similar to the kayak kayak of Ju-On, and the crawling looks like a sadako Esq. Killing dolls will remember you a cute version of "Chucky." But compared to "Children's game" this film is more magnificent. But the story seems to be nothing, brilliant shots from the camera and the magnificence of acting skills were removed because of the plot. <br /> <br /> Don't watch it if you expect big shocks.
