I have not seen many films worse than this. Storyline, dialogue, acting: it's terrible! The story just jumps from a to b to c without any logical steps between them. Every time you think you have missed something, but no: it was intended. And why on earth does a hero that Jenny Garth portrays so much in love with this unlucky guy (who now plays in the movie “Cinderella with Russell Crowe”)? Oh, well, this is not Spielberg, of course ... I need to write ten lines to publish. This film is really not very inspiring to write 10 lines! This is a romantic movie for a good mood with a lousy story, so if you are ready for it: you will have a ball.
