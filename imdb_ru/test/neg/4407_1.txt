This is not a plot, good; it is not a study of character, good; no action, okay; there is no point, hmmm ... Maybe this should represent the boredom and absurdity of living in Palistine and some parts of Israel these days in a state of violence, minor differences, deep-seated hostility, etc. But mostly they are long, long scenes where nothing happens - or things that look as if they are dripping with meaning (the checkpoint tower is crumbling to the ground, Arafatâ€™s balloon floating in Jerusalem, tigers squatting, deflecting bullets into halo), but when you try Obtain some value, there is none. <br /> <br /> Bonus: you can watch this movie in an accelerated mode, and it will not matter, except that it may be a little less boring.
