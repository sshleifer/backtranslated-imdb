Secret Service agent Jay Killion (Charles Bronson) was appointed to protect the president-elect wife, the new first lady (Jill Ireland). She is a very difficult woman, and Killion is full of hands. She is the victim of numerous assassinations committed by the head of the presidential administration, who wants the first lady to die. This film insults your intelligence not only by the storyline, but also by the lack of realistic locations. For example, in the scene depicting the inaugural parade, the first lady is in a Rolls Royce gig with Agent Killion and without a president. In addition, we know that in Washington, DC, it looks like the weather in January, and not only all the “less cover”, you can even see some 70-degree palm trees and sunny weather! (Obviously shot in Hollywood, not in Washington, DC). This movie is a joke. It is not worth your time.
