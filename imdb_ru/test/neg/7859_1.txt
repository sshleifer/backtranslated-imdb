"Heaven can wait" - a crushing tediousness and a woman-hater's lie, covered in candy. I can not imagine anyone except the film students sitting today. Don Ameche is present in almost every scene, and although he has a wonderful voice that no doubt contributed to his successful radio career, he does not have the charisma to wear this film. Amech plays Henry, a womanizer. Lubich wants to make Henry's sexual urinary incontinence delightful and funny, and therefore he sends Amecha to play this role as gently as possible. The combination of Ameche's lack of charisma and Lyubich's persistence on politeness leads to the fact that the main character is deadly dull and completely unsightly. You would not want to spend some time with this person; he put you to sleep. You will not leave him alone with your daughter, regardless of her age. Something terrible can happen. <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty boring. Behind the scenes consists of static, overly illuminated pictures in the style of a diorama, in which indecently dressed shirts with a printed picture of the era of gilding and bustle idle in excessively busy Victorian salons. There are so many frills and frills and curlicues, so lilac and blue and pink, you need Dramamine. <br /> <br /> This film hates women as much as hardcore porn, but it represents that hate with candy coated and a sweet little bow on top. The contrast between the content of the message and its delivery is disgusting. In one of the most hated scenes of the film, an elderly woman is sent to hell because she is not physically attractive.
