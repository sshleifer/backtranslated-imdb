It was unbearable. (SPOILER # 1) The main characters avoid meaningless disclosure of agonizing truth to their loved ones in order not to give up this status and not accept the role of antagonists (SPOILER # 2) victims of violations. (SPOILER # 3) Until the last 15 minutes, I expected the score to be 6-8 out of 10; instead, it was like finding that Lieutenant Colombo's dog is a REAL killer. The story is simply not credible, and I do not think that the best director in the world could have saved it without extensive editing.
