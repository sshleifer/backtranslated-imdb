This film has some pretty bloody parts like boobs coming off and other big bites. Castle Frick himself is a good monster. I would be scared if he comes after me. However, the film has some nonsense. <br /> <br /> Husband drives drunk, kills his three-year-old son and blinds his teenage daughter. I believe that death is more harm than blindness, but you will never know that parents really do not treat their daughter's blindness. All they care about is that JJ is dead! While their teenage daughter walks, she faces things and says that she can never drive. Parents are like, “Honey, stop walking without a guide, you know it better,” and then they cry and never stop falling into depression because JJ is dead. To me, it sounds like favoritism. <br /> <br /> Dialog lines are not very realistic or well made. For example, when a giant rumble is heard in the castle, everyone goes down to the basement to see what it was. It was a huge mirror that fell to the ground and smashed to smithereens. The husband, horrified, runs to the broken mirror and says directly: "The mirror broke." I do not know, I would say a little more if a giant mirror had mysteriously broken in my castle. <br /> <br /> Husband and wife have serious relationship problems, and it’s funny to see how stupid they are with each other. No one ever believes a blind girl. Advice: if a blind girl says she hears something, trust her and don't tell her to shut up. I think this is the moral of the story. Listen to people when they tell you things, otherwise you can kill yourself to prove your point. <br /> <br /> Finally, I thought that the best hero was the chief police officer. He was the best actor and character. All the rest (except for Castle Ugly) were pretty jogging mills. 3/10
