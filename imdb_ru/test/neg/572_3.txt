A film about a mysterious love letter that puts a small city in your ear should be fun, romantic and light entertainment. Instead, this film is more about things that were not said and not expressed, so it comes to the point that you are grateful when something is said at all, even if the dialogue is not entirely accurate. <br /> <br /> SPOILER - <br /> <br /> When the relationship that says the most is what is least visible on the screen (Danner and McEwan), you know that you have a problem. But these two actresses are a very pleasant sight in a film screaming for some real people. <br /> <br /> THE END OF A SPOILER <br /> <br /> Kepshaw is tasked with creating a character from a small amount and is not entirely successful. As I said above, the topic seems to be repression, and I understand that this is an element of life and love, but I donâ€™t want to watch a movie about it, at least not this one. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend it at all, despite the very talented cast that is left to stand up for myself.
