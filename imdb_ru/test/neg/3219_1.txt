I'm a fan of films about mobs and gangsters, so I made this film. This film is a complete train wreck. With all the famous actors in this film, I can't believe how bad everything was. It was so bad that I started laughing hysterically by the end of the film. The actor, better known as Zues or the big dude from the Ice Cube movie Friday, does an incredible job throughout the film. The first thing I said to Blockbuster when I returned the film was to remove this rubbish from their shelves. Do not shoot this film if you do not want to spend two hours of your life. If they release a sequel, I wonder if it will be twice as bad as the first. I will be more careful when renting so-called mob and gangster movies.
