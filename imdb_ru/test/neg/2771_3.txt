This was obviously quite low-budget production, but the actors were pretty decent, the main premise was promising, and something more could have been done, but the script was not so good - the plot is inconsistent and seems almost random in Times and dialogs unnatural and terrible. <br /> <br /> In fact, the gangsters beat the girl's father, and then she becomes a robber and wants to avenge his death, and then goes into the defense of the crowd. racketeering involving corrupt politicians. <br /> <br /> Alan Ladd gets the highest score, but he does play a very minor role. <br /> <br /> I have to say that it seemed to me that it was a bit fascinating in his archaic B-Class Jokyness, but it is really cheesy and pathetic.
