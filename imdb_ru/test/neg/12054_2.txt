Well what can I say. What the f ** k? In fact, nothing special to say about this. The only way you would like to do this is if you, like me, love the terrible terrible horror that you laugh at. <br /> <br /> ACT - VERY WRONG! Just watch the latest scene with the main actresses! Robbery for Texas Chain Kill! but in a bad way! Just awful! <br /> <br /> Gore - Actually implausible. In one scene, they use one of those knives that have a piece cut out that fits a part of the body, etc. Using this, with the addition of red ketchup, his supposed 2 look real, although in reality this is not the case. br /> <br /> The plot is a predictable film “The children got lost in the woods on hiking holidays,” shot from Friday the 13th. <br /> <br /> Killer Quality is a scary mask if you are afraid of clowns, it seems incredible that someone would choose this as their costume however. The director obviously understood that all the good costumes were used in all the other horror camp movies. <br /> <br /> TOTAL - 3/10 * / ***** ps- stay away from CAMP BLOOD II The one who made it look like the Lord of the Rings.
