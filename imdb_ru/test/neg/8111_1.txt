I loved Stephen King’s novels and short stories for many years, and I, like most reviewers, were constantly disappointed in the adaptation of the film to his printed work. A few notable exceptions are “Stay with me” from The Body, Carrie from the novel of the same name, and Rush Hayworth's Ransom from Rita Hayworth and Shawshan Ransom. This film is the worst thing ever made with the name of Stephen King anyway. Not surprisingly, Mr. King largely disavowed any connection with him. I feel that I was offended most of all by this poorly played, cheaply shot, disgustingly directed piece of garbage, which is that they had the courage to COMPLETELY change the final. !
