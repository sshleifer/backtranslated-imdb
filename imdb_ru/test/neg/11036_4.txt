Pretentious, but - in varying degrees - watchable collection of mostly meaningless "stories". <br /> <br /> But let's start from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Kaurismaki: If anyone is surprised that Finnish love / romance was, perhaps this boring little oddity is some indication. Muffled feelings, non-emotional, apathetic faces and a very depressing prospect of moving from Finland to Siberia! I believe that the continuation of this story will be "For our honeymoon, we are moving from Siberia to Greenland." Obviously, Aki had no idea what to write for this small film, so he simply came up with some unfinished non- “story” centered around the band that he particularly likes (or maybe they are his friends), because we can watch them and listen to their music more than the two main characters. <br /> <br /> Erice: First, I have never heard of this guy before ?? and now I know why. A good black and white photo and nothing more - unless a silly boring occupation can be considered an advantage. But you will be surprised at how many film critics and filmmakers love boredom in movies, so I highly recommend Eris’s 10 minute dream holiday to these two humanoid groups. <br /> <br /> Duke: not a film, but probably part of his documentaries about the tribes in South America. This is not a short film, but a report, but, considering how boring the first two recordings were, Herzog's bit almost refreshes and has some interesting points, and if nothing else fits into the pretentious concept of the “time” of the film very carefully. br /> <br /> Jarmusch: As you would expect, this once-interesting director (with the brains of peanuts; a talented idiotic scientist) serves us as another dose of meaninglessness. He became lazy and could not be bothered to write something interesting, either for his own films or for a collection such as TMO. The only bright side to seeing how a stupid vegetarian actress spends 10 minutes in a trailer is that the beautiful Chloe Sevigny plays her. Otherwise, skip this nonsense. Oh, and by the way: I do not believe that any young actress is listening to classical music; Did Jarmusch try to be surreal by making Chloe listen to such music? Can Lindsay Lohan listen to opera? Maybe Drew Barrymore is a jazz fan? Who am I to say that this is not so ?! <br /> <br /> Jim Jarmusch is an idiot. Oh, right ... I already mentioned this ... <br /> <br /> Wenders: This is the real shock of the entire film: Can Wenders really do something good !!!!!? Everything else that I saw from this overvalued charlatan, until now, was boring and meaningless. However, this short little story is written in (atypical) style and is the best part of the film. This leaves you wanting to see more of this, even if the story has permission. <br /> <br /> Spike Lee: Oh, dear Lord ?? What can I say here? Lee makes someone seem talented by comparison. Like the Duke, he chooses not a story, but presents a report. and the left political propaganda report on it! CNN, but in black and white and one-sided, of course. Naturally, “We Wuz Robbed”, the backward title of this little sleep inducer, about how poor, gullible and infinitely idealistic democrats are pillaging Bush and his team of “EVIL EVIL” Thieves. This is definitely the most dull and boring entry in this film, and I had to use the fast-forward button to keep from taking a nap. Spike Lee is truly a product of positive action. God knows how many truly talented (black) directors have never had the opportunity to make films, because this pretentious and mediocre little energetic gets the opportunity to make them. And he is wrong every time! Now this requires some talent, right? <br /> <br /> Kaige: Chinese history has a serious premise. Do not worry, do not worry. <br /> <br /> In general, there are many and much better films that you can spend your time on, but if your time is not so valuable (as, obviously, in my case) you can watch this little movie. <br /> <br /> “Ten minutes can be an eternity in the hands of antimasters of cinema. Time is precious. Spend it on the best films. ” - Fedor Miklovits, 1588
