I felt that the film was rushed, and the game was full of holes. Arnold was good, but the main girl was stupid, and the guy who played the devil was terrible. The story was confusing and idiotic. The film did not make sense and was incredible. The film is not the worst movie, but not too far from it. Overall I was terribly disappointed; it could have been much better. My account is 3 out of 10
