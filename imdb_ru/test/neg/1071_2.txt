I do not understand what is difficult in this film! I do not understand why schoolchildren should watch this! I do not understand why this should have made me think about anything! <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * <br /> <br /> When the unnoticed girl is going to commit suicide I was the only one who encouraged her? Classical clich√© music, long tracking tracks, melancholic emotions of the film of this scene made me return to what was intended. I would only be happy if she entered the room and the whole cast was there with her scissors to cut their wrists. <br /> <br /> Why? <br /> <br /> Because I went to high school .... and, frankly, I got sick to death when I saw a movie for a film in Australia, where teenagers were filmed solely because of a terrible cliche. I waited for ages for a young man to write a film to which I can relate, and this emo-rubbish driven by stereotypes is what I received instead. It was like a dark version of a broken heart that needed a predictable ending. <br /> <br /> Why do all teenagers in Australian dramas get depressed or have really weird problems that you just can't be believable about? <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it was funnier than Blur. And I had to laugh
