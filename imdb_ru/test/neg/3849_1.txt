I was not lucky to see this film in the house of friends. What a waste of time. What a complete and complete nonsense this film! Absolutely there is nothing funny, from the scene of the soul to the offensive and humiliating depiction of the Germans. There is no plot, the acting made me shut up, and in the end I personally wanted to beat John Leguizamo with a stick. I thought that John Woo's films were bad ..... this film is officially the worst film I've ever seen.
