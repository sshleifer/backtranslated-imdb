Something is not so great. "The Silence of the Lambs" remains the only good film of Demme, and I, of course, include all the overvalued left-handed exercises in condescension on the big screen, some of which I have not seen - and never will. <br /> This is a light comedy that unfolds in a thriller somewhere halfway through. The first half is a bit difficult to survive; it's not funny and not particularly interesting. Daniels plays an incredibly naive fool who is so trusting and trusting that he defies faith. His animation is often annoying and hardly ridiculous. He actually lies to Griffith from the very beginning and tells her that he is married, has children, although in fact he is divorced! Throughout the history of mankind and in films, any man who is married and meets a woman he likes will lie - if he lies - and say that he is NOT married. (Later, an unreliable or plausible rationale for this was revealed: he wanted to "protect (himself)." What a bunch of crap ...) The fact that his character makes all the wrong decisions and makes all the nonsense in the film made me look forward when Liotta knocks on him when he meets with him in the apartment of the former. <br /> <br /> What’s happening in Daniels’s apartment is the classic end of the movie Fight to Death, which a good guy predictably wins — albeit a very stupid good guy. However, at least in the last half hour there is some kind of action, something happens, and Daniels is no longer allowed to be animated. There are no trustworthy characters in the film (both major and minor), and this feeling is too 80s, which means that the film looks pretty soft; visually ugly sales again removed in the role of a policeman. The film is also perhaps too heavy for matches. Griffith once again plays a quiet stupid chatter, but, as usual, she is convincing, because she is a quiet quiet chatter. It was an earlier film, before her lip augmentation and breast augmentation surgery; compare the natural bosom she shows in this film with the ready-to-explode balloons, which she briefly flashes many years later in No Joke. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading my Griffith’s “biographies” of other Hollywood intellectuals, please contact me by email.
