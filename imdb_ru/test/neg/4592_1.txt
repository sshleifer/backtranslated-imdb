This movie is terrible. A real hockey fan would have to assume that people who appeared in and created this film never played or watched a real hockey game. I got it in the hope that it will be a “film about a guy,” but the only people who are likely to enjoy this film are women aged 13 to 17. Hockey scenes are terrible, defenders play as if they are 5 years old, goalkeepers dive from strikes 10 feet wide from the net, etc. However, it is so difficult to predict the end of this film !! For those who saw it, who could guess ?? For those who have not seen it, do not waste your time! <br /> <br /> I figured it out less than halfway through the movie. Calling this movie a drama is ridiculous!
