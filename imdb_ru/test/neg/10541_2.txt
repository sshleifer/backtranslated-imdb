Yes, a long time ago it turned into a tourist attraction. Now it is a prison again. View. Well, it's more like an airport mixed with junior high school, but guys in orange jumpsuits are running around, so I think it looks like a prison. Although not quite. When Sasha, the character of Steven Seagal, goes to prison, he stands chained up in a queue and switches to another line to talk to his friend, as if he were in a queue for an airport security check. Soon, he and his friend strike their fists at a pair of guards. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you something. You are attacking a prison officer in a federal prison, and they will shoot you right away. Ja Rule would have been shot about 30 times before he struck the second blow. Oh, and there are guys in hats and bandanas and whatnot. In prison. Federal prison. <br /> <br /> It is wrong to dress like this in most high schools in America <br /> <br /> Speaking of Ja Rule, I must say that a person who probably liked his performance more than anyone else on earth, including Jaul Rule himself, should have been 50 cents. Shortly before I watched this movie, I saw one of these great celebrity enmity shows on TV, and, as with 7 or 8, it was a rivalry between 50 Cent who lived the life of goons for real, and ja rule. Who did not have. Every time I saw Ja Rule on the screen, the only thing I could portray was 50 Cent laughing at his ass. Every time he appears on the screen, Ja Rule looks like a noisy 9-year-old. <br /> <br /> In any case, I return to the plot. It's funny. Sasha is an FBI undercover agent, and he agrees to allow himself to be sentenced to imprisonment so that he can support the criminal organization. He was sentenced to five years, and that old line between determination and stupidity instantly disappears. Nothing else in the film matters after that; it becomes a meaningless sequence of actions, most of which are not even very well delivered. <br /> <br /> Oh, how about this, a helicopter crashes through the roof of the “New Alcatraz" accidentally released all the prisoners at one point. And what are they doing? They all run out of their cells and play basketball in the center of the block. Without so much as a basket. They had the ball, but it doesn’t matter. The scene is so stupid that you could play the same classics as well. <br /> <br /> This guy is sentenced to the fact that he was the first who was executed in Alcatraz’s modern execution chamber is obviously not for stealing $ 200 million in gold, but because he doesn’t tell the room where he was hidden when he was caught. <br /> <br /> Hey, good thoughts, people. If you can't get information from someone, kill them. This is a great way to find out the truth! So some gang breaks into prison, planning to stop the execution and find $ 200 million. <br /> <br /> Yes, and $ 200 million in gold bricks. I doubt they thought beforehand how difficult it would be to turn it into an exchange currency . <br /> <br /> The prison also has a problem with the warden. He is some cruel Vato who thinks he is a hardcore barrio guy that reminds me of a joke. I saw this comedian once talk about people in California who talk harshly with each other, calling them houses and all kinds of other nonsense. These people go to Mexico, the comedian says, and they say: “Oh, God! Do people live there? It's like a complete hut! ”<br /> <br /> Best of all, when the US Supreme Court comes to justice, and this guy tells her that her men cannot carry a weapon in their prison:“ I don't care if she is a Supreme Judge US court! ”This woman can crush him like grapes, and he thinks he is responding. Ha. <br /> <br /> And by the way, the Supreme Court judge, taken hostage in the film, tells the bad guy that she is 53 years old. This is a year younger than Steven Seagal. I just thought it was funny. <br /> <br /> The only good scene in the film is a scene in jail where Jaul Rühl slaps the prison like a bag of cotton balls, this little Asian. It was the funniest thing I saw in a movie in a long time. <br /> <br /> You know, I work for a company that produced this film (and that is why I watched it), and I still have not a single positive thing to say about it, except, of course, one scene with Jah Rul that this asian slaps. <br /> <br /> So read my review of Malena, and you see how strongly I sometimes disagree with professional film critics such as Roger Ebert, but in his review of this film Ebert wrote something that I agreed with , just like everything else he ever wrote: <br /> <br /> "I present the flywheels to the MPAA, congratulating each other on a good day's work, when they rated" Half Past Dead "PG-13 , after they gave the anti-cannon film "Bowling for Columbine" R. "<br /> <br /> The way to go guys.
