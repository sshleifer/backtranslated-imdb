As a sci-fi and casual fan of Angelina Jolie, I thought that this obviously low-budget film might be worth seeing ... maybe there are several scenes in it or a storyline that compensates for all other flaws. In addition, it would be interesting to see how Angelina begins her stellar career. <br /> <br /> Oh, how wrong I was. I learned one thing - at age 18, Angelina Jolie could not play. Therefore, to make her feel comfortable, the producers made the whole movie with people who could not play. Seeing this, Jack Palance (who can really act) decided to replay. Observing the 10 minutes of this event is enough to tire your eyes. <br /> <br /> To horrible actions and replays add a meaningless script, tasteless dialogue, cinematography "under the bottom" ... in fact everything is at stake. <br /> <br /> In this story, Angelina is depicted as a cyborg, programmed by her corporate overlords as a murderer. She leaves the corporate headquarters with the help of her combat instructor. The corporation sends bounty hunters for them. Stupid things happen. The end. I would tell you more, but I didnâ€™t want to waste my life watching this tree. <br /> <br /> I beg you - you should not look at it. Do not even think about viewing. Rid yourself of the pain and move on.
