(Warning: there are several spoilers ahead.) <br /> <br /> What an incredibly crappy movie. Iron Eagle 2 seems good. <br /> <br /> The story is this: his friend Banning (Robert Patrick) shot down Captain Holiday (Rutger Hauer) so that he would not hit an Iraqi airliner filled with innocent civilians. Six years later, Holiday returns to take revenge. Among other things, he was sitting in a tank, pursuing Bunny (now a colonel) and his pregnant wife across the field. He manages to shoot shells and lead the tank at the same time. After the explosion of a tank from a bazooka, he miraculously survives and steals a jet fighter. With his help, he knocks down several Allied fighters before attacking NATO headquarters, trying to kill Banning's wife. <br /> <br /> An added bonus is that Major Baxter (whom Holiday hangs in her office) has awarded the title of insignia on her right shoulder, behind her. Elegant.
