Remove this film from suffering and burn the negatives. What i say The whole movie was negative. Fortunately, very few would find this film the least attractive. This is what the overwhelming American majority would call too much sex and violence. He may someday appear on some non-premium cable channel just for shock, but after eliminating nudes (most of the violence remains), all that remains is 45 minutes of really bad behavior, interspersed with 45 minutes of commercials. There are too many starving actors in Hollywood.
