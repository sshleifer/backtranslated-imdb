“Volcano” is at best a B-film, and at worst it’s a disaster rather than what it is supposed to portray. To be fair, you must be prepared to suspend disbelief in one important concept in any film. "Volcano" asks you to stop disbelief in science, human interaction and common sense. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Jones becomes the honorary director of the Office of Emergency Situations, who is still sensitive by the 1990s, and he is fine when he is not stuck in the foolish dialogue that the script provides. Nevertheless, Anne Heche gives a drop-off bad performance in the role of an intelligent geologist who becomes Roark's love interest (as long as the city burns down, naturally). Gabi Hoffman moves from the Dream Field and the American President to the turn as a tearful, needy and lifelong daughter of Jones. Don Cheadle sits in a very cool office and receives Jones phone calls, doing the work that Roarke really had to and should do. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film really begins to descend when the geological partner Heche gets sucked into the lava hole when they burst into the subway line. He picks up speed when Jones begins to suggest that they use buses to block the flow of lava flowing down the street, the geologist Heche (who likes to lecture everyone about the Science of Geology), obviously does not notice the fact that the lava is hot and it melts metal and stone, and the dead bus is unlikely to have a big impact. It really begins to suck when the film talks about racial tension, like Rodney King, between two bad actors dressed as policemen and evil blacks, who can't understand why the fire department is busy with this big river of current lava. But in the end, all three will work together to build the K-rail dam to prevent lava from engulfing its surroundings, even if the dam is built in the wrong direction and the material used does not stop. lava anyway. In addition, K-rails are hardly waterproof, but I think the lava will not think about pushing its head in between, not when Tommy Lee Jones looks at it. Do not even lead me to a section of the megalopolis with cars stranded where the hot lava tunnel goes, but, oddly enough, not too hot to try to escape, not too smoky to see, and there are no poisonous gases for everyone to breathe. This should be LA Lava or Lava Lite. You know, he eats cars, but is environmentally friendly. <br /> <br /> There are times when you will camp, and it almost makes you wonder if this is a comedy. For example, two guards packing pictures of Hieronymus Bosch lead a completely meaningless and farcical conversation about weight, and in the end, as soon as the little boy Roark / Jones saves the attention that everyone looks the same, being covered in ashes, a rainstorm broke out and cleaned everyone and then the sun rose, and Heche said something like, "Oh, shit, Roark." <br /> <br /> “Volcano” almost reaches Battlefield Earth status, but except for Heche, no one approaches grass-like anger, and the technical aspects are handled fairly well. If you're from Los Angeles, like me, it's pretty funny to think that the lava flow destroys Wilshire Boulevard. I gave him three for the effects and the small amount of stress you get from this.
