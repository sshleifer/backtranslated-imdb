Tarentino should be ashamed of participating in this terrible film. Acting, directing and screenplay - all on the third level - the whole film plays the role of a pretext for the writer, director and star Larry Bishop. The only reason for which this was done is most likely related to its connection with QT. The plot of the film is quite fragile, and basically it tries to survive thanks to the not too dark references to old bi-films and some cameos from guys like David Carradine, Dennis Hopper and Vinnie Jones. Each of them is sluggish in his work, especially Hopper, who is currently in full-time wages in his career. The grace of salvation, if there is one, is that the script is so ridiculously bad that it can be interesting. Bishop struggles to get this Tarentino trademark, and just fails, which can sometimes be quite funny and annoying. I would check it out if you like bad movies ... or if you really like biker movies.
