I watched this movie last night, although I shot a horror / scary movie from the blockbusters, and I shot this one. The initial scenes were so tight that conversations between the characters seemed to lead nowhere. <br /> <br /> The storyline seemed so poor to me that she infected him with HIV and then goes to a meeting with someone else, but she was killed by the person she infected (I think she might have done it's a long time for different people) Then, when he threw the body, it was the man she was going to meet with, was in the forest and saw him throwing the body. Then he pursued them (did he ever finish burying the body ??), and they got into the car, and he somehow found them on the other side, where they came from, and killed the guy. <br /> <br /> I think that a severed head was the only good thing in the film, since it was quite realistic. and then, when the woman ran, she fell in front of him so that he could stab her with a shovel !! AND THEN IT'S FINISHED !! <br /> <br /> What a relief, it was the most meaningless film I've ever watched ... please stay away from it, it's so poorly made, I counted only 5 different people, and the scene where it killing her is so unreal, and they only swear at it, and that is all !! Here it is from me ... <br /> <br /> STEERING WELL CLEAR !!
