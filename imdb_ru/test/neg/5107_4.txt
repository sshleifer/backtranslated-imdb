When I first heard that the “Not Enough World” video game was coming out for Nintendo 64, I was so excited. When it finally came out, I was one of the first to rent it. I rented it for 7 days, and I went through the whole game !!! The game was easy and gave too many clues. The main disappointing continuation of GoldenEye. Take my advice and DO NOT RENT THIS GAME. <br /> <br /> Of course, guns and gadgets are cool, but tired of looking at the laser, which looks like it was taken directly from GoldenEye, except for the fact that it is red. color instead of blue, a bad excuse for a dart, a terrible stunner and a dull hook that can only be attached to things in yellow and black. <br /> <br /> I think RAREDLY this game should be made, and not EA, which should stick to games in which it is good, like sports, and should avoid first-person shooters and let the craftsmen do their work .
