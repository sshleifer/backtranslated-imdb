The robot against the Aztec mummy was one of the most stupid and least believable films I've ever seen. OK, I can buy that woman in the film is the reincarnation of a virgin who was sacrificed to the god of the Aztecs. What I can't buy is an incredibly fake mom and even worse robot. If you want to watch such a movie, you want to see a lot of fighting. But the robot and mummy fight in just a minute! Probably the worst thing was the art of Dia de los muertos, which they had in the credits. This is the worst thing I've ever seen. Avoid this if possible.
