Very rarely do I see a 1955 film that I don’t like. Noir, JDs, Sci-Fi, Drive-Ins; I dig it all the most. Robert Aldrich is a director who has done a lot of excellent work, and most of this line-up has great performances under their belt. So what went wrong? <br /> <br /> When I worked in the world of independent films, we talked about something called acting films. Actor films are films that are not available to anyone except other actors. Actors like "acting films" because they are watching an acting game, that is, an absolutely incredible melodrama. Actors love when they are given the opportunity to completely free themselves, to “give everything that they have,” and they take great pleasure in watching how other actors do it. In many interviews with the actors, they say: "He was a great director, he never bothered me." In fact, this is the opposite of good direction, because the whole point is that the director was on the set, not to let the actors make a fool of themselves (that if they had the opportunity, they will always do) . <br /> <br /> Obviously, Robert Aldrich forgot about this project. Or maybe he was sick. Or maybe he thought that there was no hope of saving the script, so what the hell? In any case, here is an example of a less well-known film that is best forgotten. Characters gesticulate, pontifyruyut and, as a rule, work it all over. I can say one thing: realistic: everything happens in Hollywood, and everyone thinks that their minor problems are the most important thing in the world. Not funny to watch, but it is realistic. What is unrealistic is that the producer, who desperately wants to keep his star under the contract, tries his best to counteract him in almost every conceivable way, including demanding that he engage in illegal activities. But this and other plot contradictions simply carry melodrama, increasing the opportunity for arm twisting and shouting charges. <br /> <br /> I managed to get to the end of this film, which makes it no worse than “3” of 10 in my book. But why test your stamina when there is so much to rent?
