Let me start with a terrible storyline and a terrible control system. good animation, but not too good graphics. that is why I give this game 4 out of 10. This game really needs improvement if you ask me !!! I would redo it and make this control system better so that the jaws are not so difficult to control. if I did it to improve it, I would have done this graphics better than in the film. it will make someone crazy when they kill you so damn easy. I played it and was killed by a diver when he had one of these snap knives in two hits. Dolphins will kill you so much that a shark will beg to go to the bottom of hell. This game sucks fat ass. sorry for all the curses i think i have done now. Just this game is so bad that it must be removed from the store shelf. I dare you to play trash, and you are probably so angry, dying so easily, so don't play it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
