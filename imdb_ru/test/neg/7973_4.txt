When Christy Swanson gets guilty for what she does, she wants to leave. Unfortunately, Madsen is her immediate supervisor at the company, where "a two-week notice is impossible." <br /> <br /> Kristi, killing vampires, did a very good job. The image of the girl in the valley seemed appropriate. But as an assassin on the run ... well, keep driving Christie. Run, run far! This film is not a concept that was not done before, but it was made better! <br /> <br /> I didnâ€™t want to watch the rest of this film, but I felt that I had to, if I wanted to give an overview of this film. I always liked Madsen, and his character was a bit predictable, but this film was definitely a waste of time for both watching and creating ... no wonder he was never theatrical!
