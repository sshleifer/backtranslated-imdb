It is strange that fate does with some people. Looking through the discount store in the DVD store, I came across a copy of Deadly Instincts. Being a collector of any film that is either sci-fi, horror or with alien monsters, I decided to buy it (not to mention that it cost five dollars - a bargain, trust me). After reviewing it, I came to the conclusion that there is nothing special about this. But after some research on the Internet, I discovered that the film is actually called "The Breeders" and is a remake of a Tim Kincaid horror film that threatened video stores in the mid-1980s. Which I have already seen. My assessment of the “death instincts” increased after this discovery. <br /> <br /> A meteorite falls on the lawn next to a private college for girls. The only teacher there, Ashley (played by Todd Jensen, right, the guy who was turned into a cyborg four years ago in the cult film CYBORG COP), notices that some students are starting to disappear, meeting the black ones. a woman with a scar on her face and in a strange leather dress. His investigation shows that the alien creature made a trip to the meteorite and arrived on Earth to breed, using local women. Along with a local detective who believes he is responsible for the disappearances, Ashley is trying to stop the monster. <br /> <br /> The Original Breeders, directed by Tim Kinkade (who would leave the genre to make gay porn), was a sci-fi / horror movie, which was actually a thinly veiled soft core porn movie designed to make skin clicks for fans genre. In my opinion, this is one of the worst films made in the 1980s. Why would anyone want to remake this rather mysteriously. <br /> <br /> This remake is actually better than its low-budget source. The film, which occupies the basic concept of an alien monster trying to interbreed with human women, eliminates any pornographic elements. In fact, the film is actually very boring. There are no sex scenes, no nudity (even during a shower), swearing and violence are minimized, and there is no blood (which can deceive the hounds). This makes the remake safe for the whole family, that is, if the children are not afraid of the alien monsters (which leads me to the rating of the movie "M 15+", which seems a bit large). <br /> <br /> Leaving aside the topic, there are some flaws in the film. The script, although it has some good characteristics, has such a large number of holes that you can smash a meteor. <br /> <br /> What? Are you mad at me for this? C'mon, this review needed a bad word game, so it will remain interesting. <br /> <br /> In any case, the installation of the film is one of the problems that the script could not solve ?? The film takes place in Boston, but the buildings do not look as if they belong to Boston. Something in the architecture is wrong. Another thing - the college itself with a fairly large building, which is home to about twenty students (all women, of course) and only one class? Art. The only teacher has a relationship with a student (as well as a janitor!), Who somehow eludes the attention of the principal. Not to mention the cops, who are so one-dimensional (and stupid) that a real Boston policeman would have a good deal if they had ever decided to sue. Oh, and a meteor? The probability that a meteor sent from Saturn (check the opening credits) reaches the Earth without an onboard propulsion device is astronomical. This does not include the chances of passengers in a meteor surviving after landing. <br /> <br /> With regard to acting, Todd Jensen shows himself as a heroic teacher, while the late Kadamba Simmons (who was killed by her boyfriend shortly before the film was released) cut off a striking figure in this leather outfit, as well as Proved that can act. The visual effects are mediocre, with gratitude to the filmmakers for bringing us a cool monster.
