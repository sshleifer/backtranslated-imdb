It was a dirty and dreary mess. I needed a shower when it was all over. It goes something like this: some secular people are killed, and a female homicide detective has been assigned to this case. She discovers that the victims belonged to an underground lesbian society, and she provides support to a team member who may have relevant information. Since the detective is an attractive woman, she is, of course, agitated and intrigued (which says a lot about Hollywood and his psychosis about women). What is surprising is that all this is not very sexy and not interesting, but just depressive and disgusting. Ellen Barkin plays a solid role as a chief detective, and Julian Sands has an unintended laugh as a psychiatrist who changes clothes, so he avoids the one-star rating.
