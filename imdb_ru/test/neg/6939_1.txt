For some unknown reason, 7 years ago I watched this film with my mother and sister. I don't think I ever laughed with them before. This film was sooooo bad. How the sequels were removed, I do not know. It has been some time since I last saw this “film,” but the only impression he left with me over the years was: “They must have found the script in a dumpster in the background of a cheap film studio, turned into a “movie,” and decided that it didn't suck enough, and made it worse. I am pretty sure that they spent the entire budget on camera work and the so-called "special effects", and then left 13 cents on the script And to pay for the "actors".
