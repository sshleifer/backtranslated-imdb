I entered this film, really wanting to please - he headed the film festival earlier this year, and had a star cast. But (and you could say that “but” has come) is a failure of the film. The outstanding character who plays Sarandon and Walken is destroyed by editing and acting tricks. Turturro's performance is dull, and most of the comedy is replayed. Repetitive puppet shows are meaningless, and a few scenes are completely irrelevant. <br /> <br /> However, there are some great moments in the film. A really touching moment on stage, some temptations and a bit of comedy flavor really work. Unfortunately, they are overshadowed by a scattered, incoherent scenario and some bad actions.
