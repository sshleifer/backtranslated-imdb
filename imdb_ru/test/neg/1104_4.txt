J.S. In 1982, Cardone shot a little-known “Opposite Video,” called “The Killer,” and has since taken part in several feature films; including a trash movie about vampires Forsaken 2001. His latest feature film, Wicked Trivia, boasts a plot that sounds decent, as well as a creepy looking poster that I think I remember pop up a couple of years ago in connection with the film Tob Hooper was supposed to shoot. Well, I think he felt that this film was too much like his silly Mortuary film about the zombie mushroom, and therefore refused it. I don't blame him for that either. The plot is dedicated to the mother and her two daughters, who move into an old house in the mountains that once belonged to her late husband. However, they do not understand that about a hundred years ago; a group of children who were used as miners were trapped in a mine. Naturally, this is not the end, and they managed to survive the ordeal and now wander around the neighborhood in search of revenge ?? <br /> <br /> The film is essentially a collection of clichés; from the youngest child with an “imaginary friend”, from the mother who rejects him, and from all the usual zombie trash. J.S. Cardone is trying to bring back horror fans to the side with shocks and bloody scenes (mostly involving children), but this is not enough. The story is also not very well developed and really reminds me too much about the early film “The Dead”, and this is not a good thing (although the movie “The Dead” is actually a better film than this). Acting is nothing to write home about nothing; Lori Heyring looks decent, like the eldest daughter Scout Taylor-Compton; but none manage to provide an interesting presentation. Chloe Moretz is a little better than the usual children's actor. The plot is hardly credible, and indeed, the script does not even bother to explain the reasons why children attack local residents. It all comes down to a typical and rather boring ending, and in general I have to say that if you know your horror movies, you can safely skip this one!
