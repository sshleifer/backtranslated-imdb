The son of the native leader is unjustly accused of the death of his father. Evil Wizard orders to execute him. Then he returns as a killer tree (!), Tabanga. Well what can we say about this "movie"? If it was intended to be a horror film, there was obviously some kind of wrong judgment. And for comedy it's still not funny enough. I do not know why people make such films. I think you should be in a really stupid mood to watch this. Or you may want to see an incredible “monstrous” tree that gives a new dimension to “slow death”. Or maybe you want to test the excellent acting skills of all the participants. (Miss Kilgore!) Or a dialogue and script that were strangely ignored at the Oscars this year. <br /> <br /> “Shouldn't we conduct psychoanalysis on this tree? Oak trees ". 2/10
