I cannot believe that someone could light this light, let alone voluntarily decorate it. I can never regain the 90 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Some films are so bad that they are good. This has gone so far again that for some reason this is so bad, it is terrible. I did not expect much, it was a low-budget carriage jump, rehashing film “B”, but it still did not meet my expectations. Even television films have a higher production value. <br /> <br /> There were (very) bad special effects, shocking dialogues, a terrible game and a completely inexplicable plot. Who cursed her, and why, why did 6-inch snakes turn into 15-foot snakes, did anyone ever hear of very poisonous snakes with garters or pythons? 100 passengers? 3000 snakes? So many promises, not one fulfilled. <br /> <br /> Some comments will make you believe that this film is worth seeing the last five minutes. It is not even worth renting. Stop and watch a low-budget TV movie, you will enjoy it a lot more. <br /> <br /> Why was this done? Oh, yes, shamelessly make money on the Internet phenomenon of SOAP. Shame on you, brothers Mallachi, shame on you
