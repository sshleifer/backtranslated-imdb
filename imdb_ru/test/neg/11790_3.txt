I am sure that any legitimate submariner will gladly go to the USOS Seaview (yes, SOS ...). Why don't you play basketball on the court in the torpedo room, it's so big. And what about the bay windows in the bow, is it better to see giant squids or minefields that appear from nowhere? Did I mention a colorful zucchini with a parrot on its shoulder? And the admiral's cabin with what seems like a loft? Big drop dead sub ... <br /> <br /> Good, good ... he will never win prizes for authenticity. And if the sub is funny, the plot is even worse. Somehow, the Van Allen radiation belts, located hundreds of miles in space, “lit up”, will make global warming look like sausage roasts. Pompous Admiral Nelson (Walter Pijon) along with his partner Lucius (Peter Lorre looks rather uncomfortable) are carrying out a fire extinguishing scheme, firing a rocket on his environment. <br /> <br /> There are many intrigues (sic) along the way, with a born-again surviving (and his little dog too!) two "ladies" who can never be left alone well enough, a bunch of "red shirts" who can be spent, and the plot holes, large enough for Godzilla to go through. The thrill of the sea view, pursued by another submarine at a speed of 60 miles per hour - no need for an advanced sonar when you can proceed from 100 feet astern. <br /> <br /> The film is removed from one hanger for rocks to another; the payoff is so anti-climatic that it is senseless, of course, not worth 1 hour and 50 minutes of waiting. <br /> <br /> A 14-year-old boy with a stack of Popular Mechanics was to be the technical consultant for this shipwreck. magazines. Worth seeing, at least on the riff.
