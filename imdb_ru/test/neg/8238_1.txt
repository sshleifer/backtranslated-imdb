I made this film and was horrified to find out that the film was based on the rape of a little girl, to whom the parents deliberately attributed their daughter. My first thoughts were that I had never been so ashamed to be a Hindu and a Hindu. I found this movie terrible. Please do not waste your time. As for the music, there are no more than two terrible songs, and the film is cheap. Beautiful scenes are not what India is famous for. I just hope I shed some light on how disgusting this film really is. Yes, it can stress how evil people can be in power, especially when it comes to religion, but sitting and watching almost 2 hours of this film can make anyone shut up. If you need a good Indian film, watch something from the director Mira Nair.
