I'm not one of those people who complain every time a movie comes out of an old TV show. Rather, I usually run out and see him (if I watched the show) and try to experience nostalgia. But if someone wants to get rid of films based on old TV shows, this is Exhibit A (so you can say something more than just “McHale's fleet”). "Mod Squad" is depressing, tedious and lethargic. At the very least, the original series was filled with anxiety long before anyone knew that adolescents could be so gloomy that it makes them innovative. It is just tiring. Claire Danes is a pleasure to watch, but she does nothing except change mood and sneak up to spy on villains. The cast of Giovanni Ribisi in this film is that the Droopy Dog looks for an hour and forty-five minutes. And Omar Epps looks like he wants to escape from the set, but the holostrophobia of the script took him by surprise. Of course, the performance is pleasant, with the now seemingly obligatory sequence of actions to open a nightclub "rave" and an abundance of shootings. Oh, and the children scream and are angry at each other and at their elders too. It's like making the decision to use Scooby-Doo's to travel to Hollywood with teenage children who, like you and your spouse, need heavy therapy and prescription medications. I really wanted this movie to be liked, and there were some promising moments, but the next scene will suck the life out of it. You can knock out another remake of “Spelling,” “Charlie's Angels,” as you like, but at least this film knew that he wanted to have fun with himself. "The Mod Squad" makes you wonder where inspiration came from from the original series.
