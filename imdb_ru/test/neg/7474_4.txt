... recommendation! Gloria Graham runs an orphanage where discipline is divided by a meat grinder, orphans are hung on meat hooks to punish them, and their bodies are kept in a deep freeze so that they can be found when social services call. We know that there is no money in the shelter, because Gloria makes all orphans work, and also because there seems to be not enough clothes to walk - especially for older, married orphans (age range 12â€“30 years ). Ish). The new arrival, however, turns out to be more than a match for Gloria - and her own mother and mother's lover have really just killed (in the witty nail puller and the arson opening scene). As expected, Gloria herself was on the hook with meat. This one was made approximately for a coup, but was / BIGGERLY a HUGE blow to the circle of the mill. The cover of my DVD promised "disturbing and politically incorrect scenes," and this is definitely not a lie. I believe that citizen Kane from an orphanage makes films about torture. 4/10
