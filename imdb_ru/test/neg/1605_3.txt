I hoped that this show would be somewhat realistic. It struck me as another mainstream show after I watched it. I did not feel the characters at all, this charming idea of ​​America about how terrorism works? The main character does not act as a fundamentalist at all, and how he perceives himself as a terrorist is not clear to me. None of the other terrorists managed to seem authentic. One of the participants, a blond, All-American white boy, will never be accepted by Muslim terrorists in real life. Another member, a former French skinhead, does not quite fit into the Islamic terrorist movement. In addition, terrorists have sex with white American housewives, which I find very strange. It's just another silly, disorienting American TV show. This is about as realistic as Prison Break.
