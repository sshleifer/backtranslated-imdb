This film seems to be made with the sole purpose of annoying me. Everything that I hate in films is present: false sentimentality, extreme self-interest, bad child actors and much more. This ignores the fact that he portrays the extreme ignorance of American sports fans, with many actors claiming that the soccer ball is in the shape of a lemon. What kind?! This is a rugby ball. The story tells about a group of hopeless ones who get a new teacher who they like (who, by coincidence, teaches a class in a short skirt) and is interested in their football. Naturally, they are all rubbish (do not forget, they do not hope), except for one child who moved from El Paso. Blah blah, etc. Hell, even adults are starting to rebound; drunk people are turned into caring parents, illegal immigrants are let off the hook ... moan. <br /> <br /> Steve Guttenberg starred in this film. Now, before you rush to the local video store to get yourself a copy, wait a minute. Guttenberg is rubbish. No no; let's face it, how did this guy go to the movies? I have no idea, and in this film there is nothing that could give me an idea. Olivia D'Abo removed with Steve and is also not impressive. She just seems to be going through the motions and looking good by doing it. Although I have no problem with the last part; her performance does not make a film without honor. The daughter actors who make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as one would expect from such a film. Most of them are disgusting and / or annoying, and it does not make for a pleasant viewing at all. In the film there is a goat who plays a talisman, and he does a good job; but you won't see a goat movie, so don't worry about watching this movie.
