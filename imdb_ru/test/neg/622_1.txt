Leave Ed Wood alone. To call Plan 9 from Space the worst movie ever made would be to deny this horribly vulgar heap of Hollywood guano and its legitimate name. This pretentious fusion of meaningless, capricious and stupid socio-political "commentary" actually seems to have been shaped in the spirit of Plan 9, in which scenes with failures on successful actors on cheap scenes alternate with what looks like scenes of battle and mass scenes, taken from high-budget epics. But while Plan 9 sometimes manages to be funny when it means to be reasonably entertaining as a whole, this tasteless theatrical performance is terribly lacking in mainstream showmanship, with scenes ranging from offensively unfunny (disgusting parody Groucho Marx stealing Manhattan from Indians) to a low camp (Hedy Lamarre tries to impersonate Jeanne d'Arc, hearing her "voices") boring (Dennis Hopper does absolutely nothing with the role of Napoleon) unexpectedly acute performance of Peter Lorre as a psychotic Go Nero. Give the worst directorial trophy to Irvin Allen for turning so much into so little.
