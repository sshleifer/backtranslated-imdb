Well, now I'm almost certain that my resume caught your attention, and my comments that Zazu Pitts is Satan are not unfounded. Let me explain. At first, the film seems to be a trendy B-film about an evil organization called Curve Circle and their oath of revenge in the form of the murder of a rival crime disclosure organization. Although it is very strange (especially the idea of ​​a club of private citizens uncovering crimes), and CAN be interesting, this film is falling apart, despite the rather impressive list of familiar supporting actors. What for? Well, because Zazu Pitts (never one of my favorite actresses) spends most of the film, but, like Olive Oil, with a strong toothache !! While murders are being committed, people are kidnapped or something like that, you can always count on Ziza, whining in full force - almost like someone’s disgusting three-year-old child who wants everyone at the party to pay attention to her! At the same time, it is NOT an integral part of the film, but received a higher score. Why does she even exist, behind me - I suppose it is just to whine and scream. As a result, I found that the film was practically unavailable for viewing, and it was completely destroyed. Now you probably know why I called this actress of dubious talent "Satan"! I am sure that when the actors in this film saw the final product, they also felt the same as me about her terrible replay and amateur performance. <br /> <br /> This film is in public domain and can be found for free download on the Internet. I understand why.
