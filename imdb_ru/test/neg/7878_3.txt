I never understood the controversy and excitement caused by this film. Especially in France and in neighboring countries (for example, in Belgium, where I am), “Baise-Moi” was declared the most shocking and thought-provoking social drama you could ever experience. Yes, right! Perhaps this can be a bit shocking (how often do you see someone being kicked by an ass?), But a weak and meaningless conspiracy, of course, did not make me think a lot. “Baise-Moi” is another one of those who “blames everything that goes wrong in society” - films, and they, as a rule, are not very convincing. About 99% of people function perfectly in this society, so why don't you blame this particular society for the despicable and hopeless actions of two irresponsible nymphs-girls? The two main characters and their pitiful life are presented separately and in flashes. Nadine had just killed her roommate; Manu shot her brother, and they met late at night at an abandoned railway station. They decide to travel to France together, leaving traces of sex and blood behind, wherever they stop. Despite the fact that we are constantly exposed to pornography and violence, this film is very boring to sit through. As girls all the time point to themselves, the dialogues are not convincing, and the people they encounter (and kill ??) are very uninteresting. If people want to make porn movies, that's fine with me, but please do not pretend that this is an art house filmmaking. If you do not ask curses and hip-camera work, everything is there to see this (not so) exciting pornography. Cool soundtrack, really!
