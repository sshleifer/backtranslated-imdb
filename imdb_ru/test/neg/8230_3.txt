This is a strange film. At first glance, it is no different from many other rank films, but at least in several aspects. First, the main killer character is really strange. How the hell was the guy who had ever cracked like a chicken, was conditionally released, completely outside of me. What this female member of the council for parole thought was: “he is completely reformed and rehabilitated.” He clicks! Another problem with Luther Geek is the scenario / direction for women. The daughter is so miserable and seemingly stupid that if she were mine, I would give her a slap in the face. Trying to untie her mother from the bed, she fights with the knots and simply does not think: "I will get scissors or a knife." Later, in a similar attempt to untie her mother, she goes down the stairs and starts looking for some scissors in the litter box, eventually she gets a knife. By the way, this is after the killer apparently drove into the car and just returned. Bizarre. On the other hand, the daughter took off her set for the scene in the shower, so it was pleasant, although unusual again. It seems that in many of these films about the bloodshed of the d-class, they are happy to show that the throat is bitten by the gushing blood, but the look of the female breast is somehow too strong for the audience. Overall, it worked, but it was annoying and nasty, although bare breasts made up for some of it.
