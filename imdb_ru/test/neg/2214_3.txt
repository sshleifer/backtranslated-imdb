This is one of the stupidest things I've ever seen. Perhaps this is not the worst movie ever, but if you have not seen so many bad movies, it can easily fall into the top ten worst. When you think about what was accomplished in 1933 with the original “King Kong,” you have to ask yourself why someone dropped so low to cause this defeat. Then, taking another step forward and realizing that the quantum leap to Star Wars next year reached a new level in science fiction entertainment, this proposal will make you laugh and cry at the same time. <br /> <br /> Now let me ask you what the professor (Peter Cushing) can bring to bring an umbrella as the main subject of underground research equipment for traveling to the core of the Earth? Okay, so it was helpful in fighting the parrot / tyrannosaur (parrotosaurus?) At the beginning, but come on. For some reason, I don’t think that was exactly what Edgar Rice Burrow meant when he wrote his stories about Pellutsidar. Probably, he did not mean Caroline Munro as princess Dia, perhaps the only redemptive factor of this escapade. <br /> <br /> At least there was one little pseudoscientific explanation I received. of; I am always looking for one in such films. It must be that the sky at the core of the earth really was the underside of the crust, explaining this ethereal pinkish glow. But, no matter how hard you try, the story simply could not catch me in such a way as to find something interesting about the Hooligan Sly or Jubal the Ugly, especially the half stupid people, half pterodactylus. To paraphrase a good professor: “You cannot hypnotize me, I pay attention!”
