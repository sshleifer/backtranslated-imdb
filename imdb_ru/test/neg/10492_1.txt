Imagine how it was on John Agar. One of the main characters of Hollywood. Married in the Shirley temple for five years. He finds himself filmed in such films. I remember him in Tarantula, where he was not half bad. Unfortunately, there is nothing to recommend this film. The monster is stupid, uninteresting and incompetent. The police are boring. Teenagers are boring. The plot is stupid. People run around. There are events that do nothing to advance the plot. There are dances that go on and on, and then there is no attack. There is some idiotic love triangle that nobody cares about. It is not even polite or outrageous. It just doesn't cost anything. Agar could just as well be fasting. He has nothing to do.
