This film was one of the few that really hurt me. Anyone who thinks that it would be fun to see his / her mother in a crowded disco full of people of her half age who “invent” some completely ridiculous dance in a completely mistaken desire to become a “thigh” . Seeing Ingrid Bergman descend to such a poor performance on the dance floor was difficult to watch. I was confused. <br /> <br /> Worse, the music at the disco wasn’t realistic at all - it’s a fictional Hollywood director’s idea of ​​what pop music was at the time. This is always embarrassing in most films of that era — the music of the ersatz is conserved and has only a painful, fleeting resemblance to music that was really popular in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> It is hopelessly mistaken to assume that Matau is some sort of lady's man; he just looks slutty grotesque. Innocence wide-eyed Hawn is too stupid. My roommate is too serious and serious. He looks like Brady's boyfriend who is lost in this farce. A painful, pitiful mess.
