Back in the 1960s, those of us who were poor film fans thought that Plan 9 from Space was the worst movie ever made, and will remain so for all times. For comparison, we also thought that $ 3,000 is a lot to pay for a new car. <br /> <br /> As we got older, our innocence gradually disappeared when we witnessed films such as Hercules in New York and Overdrawn at the Memory Bank, which completely changed the genre of bad cinema "In this context, last night, my son and I saw an" Alien from Los Angeles ", who pushed the envelope to the limit, unimaginable only a generation ago. any other label existing in English. Even if there were Ova, which can accurately describe this film, it would have no meaning, since they would be banned in a civilized society. <br /> <br /> The foreigner mentioned in the title is played by Katie Ireland, who apparently took some time from modeling swimsuits for Sports Illustrated to start her cinematic career. Her casting may seem like a recommendation until you actually watch the movie. Make-up artists made their money by making Katie look so gray and unappetizing that you don’t want to touch her at the far end of the broom — a considerable feat. Simply put, in this film she has a face that will freeze Medusa. However, even worse than her gaze was her voice, which was so hoarse that I initially could not attribute its origin to a person. Throughout the film, I was craving the blackboard to drag my nails to hide the harsh sound of her dialogue. At the end of the film, Katie finally gets makeup and finds herself in her favorite swimsuit. I suggested to my son that the film would be better if they put it in a swimsuit at the beginning of the film, so at least we would have something to see. My son shrewdly pointed out that if then they took off their swimsuit and shoved it in their mouths, this would greatly improve the film for two reasons. I rely on the simple brilliance of his observation. If you have any doubts, compare this thing with Barbarella, in which a competent director shows how to exploit the assets of an ethereally beautiful leading fantasy lady. <br /> <br /> The story itself, commenting is not enough, because there was so little evidence. It is said that if millions of monkeys were printed continuously for millions of years, in the end Hamlet could have been invented. By the elimination process, the rest of the time they come up with something that approximates this scenario. Imagine, if you will, modern Alice, falling into a hole and falling 500 feet onto a stone slab, after which she gets up, dusts herself off and starts looking for her long-lost father in the kingdom of the city of Atlantis. Once in Atlantis, she spends most of her time running, fighting or climbing stairs and ladders, and mostly tries to stay away from the hands of a general who seems to have no soldiers to carry out his order, and who would make Tiny Tim look macho. This summation, however abbreviated it may seem, is probably longer than the shooting scenario. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, when you enjoy the production values ​​and take everything you can from sets and costumes through smoke and smoke, you understand that this is one movie you can really see on the screen, where all 20 dollars have gone. <br /> <br /> I thought that directors should not have access to drugs and alcohol during the filming of the film or, perhaps, earlier, if this leads to such results as “Alien from Los Angeles”, although frankly, I must admit that I do not know whether they were actually involved in substance abuse or were simply mentally retarded at the beginning of the project.
