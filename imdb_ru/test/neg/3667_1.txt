<br /> <br /> In Japan and other European countries, new technologies allow filmmakers to bypass the closed workshop of the Hollywood mainstream and avoid Ed Wood as visible low-budget production figures for producing attractive films. What a shame that in the UK we can find examples, such as Avatar (the name of many video games), where insane attempts are being made to imitate so many films - and console games, loved by adolescents without friends, - which themselves are cheap clips galore, like a kangaroo, filled with testosterone. Read the overview: <br /> <br /> “Futuristic London, 2024, tells the story of the team of virtual reality virus killers, faced with a perfect Internet virus.” <br /> <br /> Go back and read this quote again - avoid nagging - and try to find in it the only original idea. This should have seemed a tired and sad concept in 1993, not to mention 2003. Ah, but there is one more thing: the “final virus” has already led to the crash of the airplanes, infected the air traffic control center, etc. A gland that is well versed in the snarling and martial arts of cod, right from the play area - a living product of teenage fantasy. Oh, and she is accompanied by sound effects like “Predator” to highlight her remarkable abilities. <br /> <br /> All of this has a futuristic vision of stunning originality - the Lloyds building, filtered with AfterEffects, looks a little green. The budget really shows - what this day and age should not be. All in all, the useless mess of cheese, ham and cliché that Roger Corman would leave on the floor of the chopping room in his most shameless, desperate moments. Shame that such an alleged labor of love brought nine minutes of lost celluloid. <br /> <br />
