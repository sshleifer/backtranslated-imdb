I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I traveled from Youngstown, Ohio, approx. 85 miles I did not know anything about the plot, nor about the players. I did not read the reviews and did not speak to anyone who saw it. Believe me, I will never make this mistake again. This is advertised, I think, as the first feature film shot in the new 3D process. This is what prompted me to make a 170 miles round trip. <br /> <br /> There was a two-row waiting line that stretched out (I'm not joking) 2 or 2½ blocks in length and moving very slowly. I could wait patiently to sit down. If at that moment I knew only what I would soon find out, I could be returning to Youngstown by the time this function was launched. <br /> <br /> By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I had already nodded. The novelty was quickly exhausted and has since become pure agony. <br /> <br /> Without going into painful details, I can only give the following advice. If you have ever seen the famous film “PLAN NINE FROM EXTERNAL SPACE”, supposedly the worst film ever made, then, in my humble opinion, it stands head and shoulders above this garbage. <br /> <br /> I don’t know if it has ever been shown on TV, if there is, I don’t know why. If you ever have the opportunity to see it, do something else. Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, ask someone to smack you with a rubber hose. ANYTHING. Your time will be better spent. <br /> <br /> This was my first review of the film. This may be my last, if the worst movie does not appear, and I will not make a book that will happen. <br /> <br /> Bill <br /> <br />
