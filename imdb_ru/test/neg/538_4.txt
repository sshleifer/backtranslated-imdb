It is perfectly normal that people die in animation, but there are too many deaths in it. Start from the beginning, the story is all around battles, battles, death and revenge. It goes on and on for a full hour and a half. In the beginning it was interesting, but I was very tired after the show was halfway through. Unlike other animations, this lack of humor. There are not many interactions between characters. The good thing about this is that the sword fighting scene looks pretty good, and the characters look good.
