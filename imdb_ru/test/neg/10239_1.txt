I saw several scenarios and screen versions of Alice in Wonderland, and this one should take the cake as the worst. My family was unaware of buying a DVD and could not even get through the first half. Later, I came back and forced myself to look at all this (it was a Christmas present for me) and was just shocked. <br /> <br /> The only saving factor (and it is hardly enough to save the whole show) Mark Lin-Baker plays “The Yiddish Turtle” This is one of the few moments in the play that has real charm and can be taken quite seriously. In addition, songs are semi-songs, melodies are semi-melodies, and even Meryl Streep cannot make this direction look good.
