There are several plots ahead. <br /> <br /> The so-called Nashville Network resurgence as the “First Network for Men” is a complete disappointment, just like the cartoon unit for adults. The new Ren and Stimpy were just awful, the “Gary the Rat” is mediocre at best, and the “Striperella” is rather unattractive. This cartoon is mostly boring; if “Ren and Stimpy” suffered from excessive exhaustiveness, the “Striperella” did not have decent shock jokes, funny crazy jokes, smart jokes or jokes. The concept of bad to begin with: Pamela Anderson, a stripper superheroine, rescues the "City" from an assortment of stupid supervillains. This cartoon looks like a tribute to superb parodies of superheroes, such as Dark Duck and Tick, but without the wit of these cartoons and good writing - or even a good storyboard. “Agent 0069” tries to fluctuate between stupidity and sexuality, but it is neither one nor the other, and the inability of this cartoon to force her to do this or that leads to the fall of this series. <br /> <br /> Watch your Tick taped episodes and see what a real cartoon trickster superhero is.
