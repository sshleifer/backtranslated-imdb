I would like to read the comments on IMDb before I saw this movie. The first 1 o'clock was fine, although it made me wonder why everything was concentrated in Chicago and why no one reported any weather anomalies outside the US. Separate natural disasters (of such magnitude) are unthinkable. But after the first 60 minutes, the film stretches like an endless story. The script is terrible. As for the actors, a very bad choice. Only people hired in a panic, adhere to their roles. But I have to agree that there are good “special effects” in this film. If you rent it on DVD and want to watch a movie, despite the reviews, then play it at the maximum speed that your player allows!
