This is one cheap movie! The stripper is attacked and raped by a zombie, and no one believes her. She goes to the police, who also rape her. Finally she finds a child who is also attacked by zombies, and they trace the zombies to the “Zombie Master”. The fact that Stephanie Beaton is acting as a stripper is the only reason to watch this movie.
