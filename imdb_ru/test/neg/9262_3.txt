Extremely slow movie. There are excellent performances from all the actors, so above 5 points. It is assumed that Suriya and Jo are the ideal husband and wife, and we are shown this until it comes to the point that you begin to ask if there is a story. One day, Gio discovers Surya's diary to find his failed love story in college. A college love story is completely unconvincing, as Surya is an arrogant senior who always pokes his head in Bhumika, beats up his friend, shouts at her in public, and despite the fact that he is afraid of him she falls in love with him. Even after this, he continues to dominate her, using coarse language. Of course, I could not appreciate the meek character played by Bhoomika, I do not think that any self-respecting woman will fall in love with such assholes in real life. Jyo decides to bring them together, and what happens after that is the climax. The plot of the characters is very weak. Extremely arrogant Surya in relation to Bhumika is the complete opposite of Joe (and there is no reason for a sudden change of character). Again the meek Bhuomika becomes a great extrovert when she returns. If she became so self-confident, why she did not try to find her love, because she was not afraid of anyone else.
