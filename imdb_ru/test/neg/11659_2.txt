All I can do is repeat the feelings already expressed by some other commentators. This CITY CITY meets HAPPY DAYS. The bipolarity of a ruthless thug (one minute of a ruthless killer, the next minute of the Luv diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing. You can approach it in one of two ways: (1) a sandy, realistic film that has become full; or (2) juicy, special alphabet school with profanity, violence and cruelty to animals. In any case, it just does not fly, does it? Why then did he receive so much praise? As others assumed, he receives a “voice of conscience” from the west. Show us pictures of poverty to contrast with our fluffy, double wide theater seats and 44 oz cola, and we will applaud in an instant. But, oh, do not forget to cover it with candy, because the bitter pill of reality (teasing as it is) is difficult for us to swallow. <br /> <br /> I am terribly disappointed that this film will receive so many awards and honors, especially when there is much more worthy film work there. All I can say is: beware of any film that receives awards (Hollywood Oscars = wide, thick pranks. Cannes Film Festival = beard stroking, unsophisticated propaganda). To find real gems, you have to work a lot on this.
