When I saw this Icon on TV, I was surprised. I know that the first clue as to where he was going was the fact that it was on the Sign Channel - Must be said - excuse me !! I was full of hope when I saw that F.F. he was an executive producer, but very quickly realized that the only real way that a television movie and a book looked like was only the name and the names of the characters. The television story was at least indecent, but I agree that the act itself was worth 3 stars. In my personal opinion, Mr. Swayze could have portrayed a real Monk, but I think that, judging by the film, it would be a much longer film, and I do not think that Hollywood itself would go to the plot of discrediting the ruse. As an example, a terrible version of the film "The amount of all fears." Should I say more?
