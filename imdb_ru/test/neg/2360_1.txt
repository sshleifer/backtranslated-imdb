completely useless ... being there, did that with the subject, I must say that it captures the club atmosphere in absolutely no respect. This could happen if the characters were not just the mouthpiece of incredibly awful, unreal nonsense. So many horrible scenes that could disgrace The Office (not a compliment to this film). It also may have helped to have some semblance of a story, a point, a message, a comment, anything. Seriously, Kevin and Perry Go Big could say more on this issue than this film (in this case the term was used very loosely). For such films minus numbers should be reserved. -10 (extra turd)
