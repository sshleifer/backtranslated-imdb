"The opposing force [1986]" was not as good as "Doctor Strangelove," and not as good as "Bridge across the River Kwai." Damn it, it wasn't even as good as “J.J. Jane,” which is pretty sad. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around a basic ethical problem: how far can a situation with a prisoner of war can be modeled do you go before you start breaking the law? What exactly is the law in such a situation? How can you simulate the torture of someone without actually torturing someone? Can you intentionally hurt? What about broken bones? False executions? Sexual abuse? Severe blood loss? Real guns with bullets? Death? Somewhere between them there is a really fuzzy line dividing "acceptable" and "cruel." <br /> <br /> Now, what could you do if you were in such a training program, and the boundaries between simulation and reality began to disappear? ? What could you do? This film is trying to portray this dilemma. <br /> <br /> It was interesting for me to see what types of tactics are used in “weight training”. I have a brother who passed the US Air Force POW training program. According to him, technically it was pretty close to the goal. <br /> <br /> The film is a pretty good premise, but it does not have a particularly good story. I wondered if this could be based on some real event, but it became quite obvious that it was not when the explosions began. They must have changed the screenwriters by three-quarters of the film, because it takes a real extreme turn and turns into a somewhat meaningless exchange of fire with many distracting explosions. <br /> <br /> I found a rather unsatisfactory ending; senseless again. I am interested in the meaning of all this - I begin to suspect that it simply did not exist. It could have been much better if a little more of the story was accompanied by fireworks.
