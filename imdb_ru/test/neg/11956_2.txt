This is a great example of a breathtakingly bad b-movie. There are movies worse than this (for example, Titanic), but this definitely shares a bunch of smoking movies. <br /> <br /> Well, it was obviously filmed in Kansas City, which explains why everyone is so limping. The main guy looks like Steve Guttenberg, and even more lame than him! I did not even think it was possible! In fact, he and the main girl in the film are responsible for the worst drama ever! It's not just that acting skills were too dramatic, well, in fact, it was, of course, a terrible script, combining a deadly blow one or two in a terrible terrible completely invisible drama. <br /> <br /> Scarecrow, let's talk about him. The whistle you hear every time he is near is stupid and clearly dubbed. Now his suit, I can’t put up with it - this guy in sackcloth and a stupid mask! I'm just stunned, maybe if you are 3 years old with brain damage, you will be scared of him / him. <br /> <br /> One of the characters, a black guy, used the line: "This may be a chance to earn my red wings", meaning trying to score with one of the girls for her period. Wow, yes, this is the dialogue which you can look forward to. <br /> <br /> Oh, in the beginning, when a poorly dressed girl runs across the corn, why is she torn off? I’m pretty sure that this should not be obvious, only one of many obvious mistakes, admitted in this “film.” The other is a bad dubbing of the musical number (yes, that's right), everything is on the beach and one dorkaziod is typed in bold to sing a song and play the guitar for everyone, and this is clearly called ridiculous. Fortunately, a scarecrow answers all our prayers and throws a spear right in the boy's chest when he finishes singing. By and large, such blood is pretty good , this is one of those movies when you are a killer for killing these people. <br /> <br /> Well, there is a scene where two guys bury one of their friends in the sand, then get up, grab their penis and urinate to all the guy in the sand. Who does this? In fact, imagine: "Hey, let's bury Joe in the sand, then stand and pull out our genitals, as it doesn't matter much, and pee on it." In fact, it raises homoeroticism in this film, what the hell? A good part of the beginning of this film is the athletes standing there in their underwear in the locker room and in the corn field while they are engaged in hazing. What the hell is with that? Traditionally, in the cinema and in real life, athletes get girls, but botany does not. It really does not make sense, since all nerds think about girls and sex, and obviously all athletes think about sports and about being next to each other in underwear, I do not understand. <br /> <br /> Lets get to sex. Someone who watched this movie with me said: “I have never experienced such an aversion to heterosexual sex in my life,” and this is true. If you like hot A cup action or ugly boobs of an old woman, then this movie is for you. I swear, they found a girl with the smallest breasts, and now whom do they force to act in nude ?? Then the ugly old nurse shows her vigorous a couple of times, and man, I just didn’t want to see it. <br /> <br /> Now I have to talk about the duration of the schedule of this movie, that's really just weird. It starts in the afternoon, then they all head to the cornfield, and for about 2 minutes it is instantly dark in the middle of the night when they drive off, saying they go to the beach - this is again an instant day, and obviously they stay in the beach until nights again, and until the day the next day. So basically these events in the film cover 4 days, without any characters needing a dream or anything else, this is really weird. <br /> <br /> After the main killings have occurred, he blinks forward after 3 weeks. and obviously, none of these people really care what they saw their friends brutally kill! The survivors are literally making champagne! And then I realized that the budget does not go to the script, directing or acting, it all went to this damn bottle of champagne. <br /> <br /> End. Stop reading now, if you don't want the ending to spoil for you, it's really nice. <br /> <br /> OK, so that the end happens in the church, and the scarecrow puts his soul into the body of a child with diabetes. Then he fights with a guy who looks like Steve Guttenberg, and fights with him with the help of the b-movie version of the power that the emperor had in star wars! I'm not kidding, it's so stupid! Anyway, in the middle of a fight, a stuffed soul jumps into bodies in Guttenberg Jr. the guy, and then with the last will he has, he pierces himself on the cross in the church! That's cool! A bit of blood, but what's even better is that the cross is clearly cardboard! You can see the bottom moving from the ground! Wow, yes and have fun.
