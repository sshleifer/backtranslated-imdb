The puppeteer, like a child, for a children's show in open access passes through a deep end, when he discovers that the children he entertains in the hospital have become victims of terrible violence. In this film, some of the worst indescribably monstrous parents you've ever met. Not a film about exploitation, but a special program for children telling about the danger of child abuse. Seemingly harmless, Mr. Rabbi takes matters into his own hands when it seems that the police are neutralized by lack of evidence to convict abominable parents for their terrible abuse of their children. Children are insensitive and look like zombies (.. due to a lot of insults), parents are loud, incredibly harsh, despicable and warlike. Mothers, in particular, are so obscene that you will be rooting for their execution. These are essentially pathetic people who upset their children. Our detectives are very tired, frustrated with the whole legal process, because the police often cannot prosecute those who beat their children. While the crimes themselves are disgusting, the film clearly does not reveal the terrible activity on the screen. I would say that the reason for this is that Tom Basham plays an unbalanced male child who goes into psychosis. There is a rather strange dinner table sequence between Mr. Rabbi and his guardian, Basham, shortly after he killed the parents responsible for the death of their child, regarding how he lives in fantasy and how what he just did left an indelible mark ( notice a change in behavior, a pretty impressive job, going from innocent to creepy). Peter Reneday - Lieutenant Hayes, a detective in charge of murder cases, on his face expressed tension that affects him. John Ashton, at an early stage, played the role of Detective Matthews, always causing Heys anger because of his inability to follow directions, not to mention how self-confident he is about parents insulting their children. Awkward, laid-back bluesy score that seems inappropriate for a movie such as this. Controversial conclusion, stating that even children can only tolerate so much. Too slow motion for my tastes, but I felt that Bashamâ€™s eyes were effectively used until he went into business, patiently waiting for him to get ready to strike.
