This film was fine. Mary-Kate and Ashley play twin sisters (sorry for the obvious), who are sent to Paris against their will to spend a week with their rich uncle or something like that. <br /> <br /> Immediately two French boys who looked slightly inbred), start talking to them and show interest. Blah blah blah. This is the Olsen twin film - we already know what will happen between them. In any case, at the same time, the twins meet the Fantastic French model, because they are in Paris, the fashion capital of the world. They make the best models with the model and make an exciting installation shopping in the city of lights. Yes. <br /> <br /> Plot, frankly, I can not remember what happened. I think it might say something, but hey, this is Olsen's movie. Olsen's film seems synonymous with light fun. <br /> <br /> Overall this movie was annoying. I mean, can I even identify with the two girls who are devastated to learn that they are going to Paris? Indeed? Also, the jokes weren't all that funny. However, I watched the whole movie. So this must be somewhat entertaining. The fact that it was installed in Paris was something that probably made me look.
