this cartoon is not right, lol, I totally disagree with many things that he portrayed, however it ended on a positive note, but as for me and mine, we will not watch it in our family, mainly because stereotypes every day, and this cartoon only confirms that most white people feel that black people behave like a comment from one of the little black girls made in the cartoon, was that her boyfriend was so conscious (he was white) that action tionary hurt me, that it is not what we, black, see as frivolous - a condition which black people reach when they realize their true ability
