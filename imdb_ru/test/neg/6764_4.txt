Some nameless aliens who went to a distant ship from a distant planet sent a giant robot, Kronos, to deprive the world of its energy. They have a prototype ringing around Mexico for newbies, and if it is successful, more will be sent. Of course, only this Kronos could complete this task. <br /> <br /> For reasons that I cannot explain, the aliens first captured the mind of leading scientist John Emery, who telepathically directs Kronos to his first goals. Since Emery was killed later, and the monster seems to be functioning quite well without Emery as a controller, why aliens needed him in the first place, a bit strange. <br /> <br /> In any case, scientists Jeff Morrow, Barbara Lawrence and George O'Hanlon, working under Emery, are not too fooled by his nature. And, of course, they came up with a plan to fight the raging metal giant. <br /> <br /> Kronos is the perfect movie for the fifties, the bad guys have never been seen, they are just trying to undermine humanity. This is the perfect movie for the cold war. And Jeff Morrow assures us that we will be ready for them in the future. <br /> <br /> Players look as if they had long been glorified by so many clich√©d lines that writers could have inserted into the script. I have the impression that Kronos is the film that Ed Wood could have made with a big budget, but with more caution.
