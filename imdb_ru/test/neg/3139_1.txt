This film should be one of the most boring in history. The only thing I liked was the use of Argento-esquire lighting in most scenes. The music is terrible, and the pace is so slow that you can watch it at a speed of 2 times the speed, and even then it will be slow. History does not exist. There are not even shocking scenes. <br /> <br /> This is classified (at least on this site) as horror, but it is not. This is a kind of feature film that explores the dark side of human nature. If you like such things, and you can sustain a slow pace, then look at it, but I'd better recommend you something Japanese (for example, Ichi the Killer). I think that the only reason this film has never been in cinemas is the fear of the audience committing collective suicide caused by the huge amount of boredom generated by this film. The 80 minutes of its length would be better spent watching the drying of the paint. <br /> <br /> I gave 1/10 simply because there is no 0 in the drop-down menu
