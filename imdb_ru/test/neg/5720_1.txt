I remember a trailer for this sadly weak Conan exit. I watched the movie years later and laughed. Accidentally! Poor Brigit Nilsson. Her career has never had a chance thanks to Cobra and Red Sonja. The plot of the film is as follows: Sonya (Bridget Nilsson) comes from a tribe of warriors who were killed by the evil queen Gedren (Sandal Bergman). Queen Gedren steals the sphere that the warriors defended, and uses her to destroy every city she passes. Sonya goes hunting for Queen Gedren and later learns that Gedren killed her parents. In her quest, she reluctantly joins Calidor (Arnold Schwarzenegger), an arrogant prince named Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr.) and his clumsy idiotic servant Falcon (Paul L. Smith). Together they go hunting for Queen Gedren and Sphere. Acting is below nominal, and the action scenes are sucking. I mean Brigit Neilson looks so emotionally distant. For Sonya, who has lost her entire family, as well as her friends, Sonya does not look shocked at all. Arnold plays his usual stoic role, and Ernie Reyes, Jr. ... what an annoying lousy jerk he was in this film! Falcon's imbecile servant had more personality than these guys. Scenes from the film are the only redeeming moments of the film, although sometimes they do not work. The scene where they fight a mechanical sea creature made me laugh until my ribs ached. Dialogue is also a dial tone. As if the screenwriter thought that no one was going to take the film seriously, so he gave everyone stupid lines for work. I can only recommend this film to you if you like your epic films. Anyone else bother.
