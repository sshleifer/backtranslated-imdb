Talk about trash! I can't remember one good thing about this movie. The script was bad, the game was terrible, and the effects - well, there were no effects. I cannot believe that the author of this film made Identity, everything in this film made me nauseous from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The cover of the video box shows a showman with shark teeth and scary eyes. I look like a scary villain, but, like the old saying “never judge a book on the cover,” the whole villain looked like it was cut out of cardboard. One part in the movie is a girl killed by salad tongs, terrible. The settlement was bad enough, as if they could have set it all in Lapland, but no, instead a tropical island. <br /> <br /> I took this film as a hoax, which I think they wanted it to be, but the only thing that made me laugh badly was the tasteless effects. You can argue that I did not look first, but after seeing this, I would be safe if I had not tried. <br /> <br /> The biggest joke in this movie is the effects, the snowballs looked like they were made at home, and this carrot was a total embarrassment. If I had suggested, the budget of this film would probably be from 8 to 9 pounds fifty. The producer at the last minute had to grab the actors by the street and gave them a script saying that they have 6 minutes to train in these lines and shoot on the island. <br /> <br /> Finally, in the film, No matter how painful it was, the actors forgot their usual scenes and paved their way. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I give this film: 0 stars out of 5
