The apparent vanity of the press for Julie in her first film with Blake. We'll see. Where we start She is a traitor during a world war; she redeems it by falling in love; her friends (who are supposedly patriots because they are German citizens) are expendable and must die; and she turns out to be a heroine. OK. Scenes with a drunken pilot and French intelligence jesters cannot even be described, and we won't even mention the romantic scenes of Rock with a woman. (By the way, when they visit the museum, look at his glance - I translate it into video, and this is priceless). Is it a farce, a romantic classic or a war movie? I do not know, and neither will you.
