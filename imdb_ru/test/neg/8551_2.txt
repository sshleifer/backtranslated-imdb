Many actors in the shower have many good movie roles. Some, a handful. Others may have a couple. <br /> <br /> Then there is Linda Blair. "Exorcist". That's all. <br /> <br /> When you see the Chain Heat and see Linda Blair in it, you have to wonder what, if anything, was going on in her head. <br /> <br /> Of course not, “Oh, boy: Oscar for the best actress, here I am!” <br /> <br /> Another woman in the prison film, which was filmed in the 70s cheap, this one actually has names that you can recognize, John Vernon plays the dean ... I mean, the warden (with the jacuzzi in his office; I wonder what he said to the contractor?) Stella Stevens pops up, even Henry Silva and Louise Moritz show how much they needed work. <br /> <br /> And a special mention, of course, for our heroine Sybil Dunning as a bisexual prisoner who makes the moves to poor Blair. To paraphrase, Sybil is the same as Sybil, and everything Sybil does is perfect. Makes you forget what a terrible movie you're watching. <br /> <br /> Almost. <br /> <br /> Two stars. One for Sybil, and the other for trying to pass Linda Blair as a sex symbol. What could they master (understand?)?
