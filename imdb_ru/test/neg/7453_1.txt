You know, I was very surprised when I watched this movie. One day, when I got sick, he sounded during the day, and I had nothing to do, and I continued to look. This is by far the worst movie ever! But to my surprise, I kept looking. I sat there, saying that it was terrible, but still did not change the channel, because I was so surprised at how bad it was. Maybe it was the guy who looked like the Big Tom from the survivor, or the terrible mustache and Iroquois that these characters had, made me look. However, the girls were not half bad, but if this is what you want, there is much better. Oh, and there are "NINJAS" and "PAJAMA BOYS!" <br /> <br /> So if you like ninjas, a bad act, a cheerful (and terrible) dialogue, and two twins, five feet tall, that everyone kills in their eyesight, then this film is for you. This is so bad, this is good. However, I just had to give him 1 out of 10. I couldn't put 10 there with the Lord of the Rings. <br /> <br /> ENJOY !!!!!!!!! :)
