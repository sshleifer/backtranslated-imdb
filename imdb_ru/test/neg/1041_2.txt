I mistakenly thought that it was a 70s feature film about a bed that consumes people, which sounded interesting. This is not true. Interestingly, I mean, not to mention the bed that eats the person. <br /> <br /> I believe that Stuart Gordon called it the same way that Lloyd Kaufman puts the “Throm” on almost everything that was shot from. video camera, in the interest of creating a library franchise. About this opus, you can say a little more, except for the time less than 90 minutes. Of course, we are talking about a bed that is haunted by the spirit of a man or something that once killed a woman with a wig and long false eyelashes. Along the way, we get ** a five-minute introductory credit sequence (the same for Lawrence of Arabia, how much time?) ** the killer with Marilyn Manson contacts, who kills using the same technique as the troll in Cat's Eye ** demonstration sexual practices Michael Hutchins may have used ** a preview of what Estevez will soon look and act like ** soft core porn even Cinemax will take place on ** manbutt and one topless scene ** stupid (or is this “kick” -e?) ending including unintentionally hilarious hammer blows and remnants of strawberry pie (well, it seemed to me like this) ** and an elementary surprise, nothing special about the apostle. As if the screenwriter even fell asleep on the Death Bed before finishing the last draft. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, not sexy, shot on high-definition video, looks good, but not 'Looks good, too, acting is good enough not to be bad enough to be fun, like everything else . Nobody probably did not even see or hear about it, if he had not been on a disk with another film, a modern “double function”. I did not pay attention to parts of this, so I could miss something. But for some reason I doubt it. Rating: PASS
