Nickelodeon went down the toilet. They have children who say something like “My God!” And “We screwed up”. <br /> <br /> This show promotes hatred of people who look bad or not in a crowd. This suggests that sexual promiscuity is in order when girls drool over boys without a shirt. Not to mention the overweight boy who takes off his shirt. The main characters generally avoid any unusual. Carly Sam's girlfriend, who may be a lesbian, beats the snot of someone who crosses her path, who says that it is good to be used ** h In this show there is so much negativity that no one should watch it! I give him 0 out of 10 !!!
