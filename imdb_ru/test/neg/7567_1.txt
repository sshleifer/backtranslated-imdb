If I could give this movie less than 1, I would certainly do it. I read a review of this film in the LA Times, and I found myself walking around the theater, and remembered the review. My wife and I were playing, and we thought that everything was not as bad as the critic said - you know the critics. Of course ... Give me a break from the terrible game, the terrible camera work, the inefficient use of the budget (this was mentioned again and again as an excuse). I worked on movies with smaller budgets, which are 100 times better. Director and producer make films work - they choose teams. That's all. If they do not connect it and do not make it work ... it just will not. So they did not do it - and it is not. I don’t think they can ... I just needed time to write this review ... although I’m sure the film crew doesn’t appreciate this review - I hope I do you a favor with My wish for you to succeed , but - in another career. Good luck.
