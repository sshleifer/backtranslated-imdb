Andrew Gurland's “Codes” are a fictional “true story” about four school friends who maneuver to cheat on tests. Quartet: arrogant school hater Trevor Ferman (as Handsome Davis), his handsome friend Matthew Lawrence (as Victor), their plump school hater Elden Henson (as Sammy) and perverted hipster Martin Starr (as Appley). Adults include North Point's excitable head Mary Tyler Moore (like Mrs. Stark) and pornography Griffin Dunn's loving father (like Mr. Davis). High jokes begin with the fact that Mr. Ferman and Mr. Lawrence presumably urinate in the teacher's record book. Put it in the bottom of the pile; and be grateful it is not included in any permanent record. <br /> <br /> *** Codes (2002) Andrew Gurland ~ Trevor Ferman, Matthew Lawrence, Elden Henson
