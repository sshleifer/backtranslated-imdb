Since it came from HBO and, based on the IMDb rating, I watched the first season of this series, what a waste of time. Characters are sometimes interesting, but mostly animated. Acting skills range from good to mediocre talent with an emphasis on the latter. Not only the prisoners, but also the audience should leave behind the door of the camera the hope that this story is plausible, it is such a dung that you will need an unusually strong resistance of the testicles to continue to observe. Violence, like most of the events in this story, is terrific, and no matter how hard I try to justify morality, it has a slight variety. If your idea of ​​excellent television includes writing quality, acting, and overall production quality, which can be seen in SOPRANOS, DEADWOOD, or Six Feet, avoid OZ. If you want to see Disneyland for illiterate jerks, see OZ. Such things give a sharp bad ear.
