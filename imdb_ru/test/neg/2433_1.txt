I can't believe this show was alright. First of all, J.P. Manu does a terrible job replacing David Spade, and Pasha’s voice is too deep compared to John Goodman’s. The theme song is so annoying, and the episode plots are so stupid !!! The only good thing about this show is that Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton remain the voices of Isma and Kronk. This show is a waste of money and waste of your time. Half of the episodes are copied from the movie. In my opinion, the Emperor's New Canal was one of the best children's films in recent years, but they were completely destroyed by the creation of Kronk's The New Canal and this show. You should watch shows like Spongebob, Fairly Oddparents, Danny Phantom or Kim Maybe, but not this show.
