“Mama” is a shame for many things — for Lucille Ball, for a story that was told many times better, and for the music genre as a whole. Miss Ball doesn’t understand her character at all, and she seems very reassured. Bea Arthur is good, but that is not enough. The production is very crappy and cheap, the songs do not meet the standards, and almost every joke fails. In addition, Lucy could not dance well, so the music had to be slowed down to a furious pace. Avoid at all costs, but look at the amazing "Aunt Mom."
