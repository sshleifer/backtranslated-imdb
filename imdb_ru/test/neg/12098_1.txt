This is one of the worst anime series I've ever seen. When I looked at the review of the manga in the magazine, I thought that it might be interesting, but when I got the chapters, I realized that this is utter nonsense. <br /> <br /> Okay, the first 2 or 3 chapters are in order, and the series has a standard. But as the story progresses, it becomes completely incoherent. The series tries to show some mystical, based on Christian mythology, but this is utter nonsense. There are a few demons and stigmatic scenes ... Absolutely nonsense. It seems that the series is trying to seem deeply thoughtful, complex or mythologically revised, but an observer with a small amount of brain and cultural references will soon realize that all the elements used have no real meaning: THEY ARE INTENDED FOR PRINTING ONLY GIFT WATCHES !! <br /> <br /> The final chapters are full of absolutely meaningless elements: battles with demons with cat ears, links to a supposed battle between demons and demons controlling time (for no apparent reason). Finale - complete nonsense; an ignorant observer will see on it a floating finale that gives them a place to meditate; but the truth is that the FINAL AND COMPLETE SERIES ARE COMPLETELY DESTROYED AND NON-COMBIDAL.
