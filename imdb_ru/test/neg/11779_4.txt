This film, which I had just discovered in the video store, apparently spent a couple of years without a distributor. Easy to understand why. The story of two friends living in New York, looking for a high-school friend who now lives homeless under Coney Island waterfront, has flashes of what is a very good film, but ultimately burdened by the story of Stan and Daniel and not on their homeless friend Richie. Cryer, as usual, is very good, and the film has a nice gloomy look with ghostly images of Coney Island. However, the writer Cryer and director Richard Shankman are too busy dealing with the rather uninteresting life of Stan and Daniel, instead of focusing on Richie. One flashback in a record store, where Richie stands out from the employee and really shows the viewer where this film could go. But in the end, not so much. Two many stretched scenes of irritation, for example, inside the Skeeball building. RATING 4 of 10.
