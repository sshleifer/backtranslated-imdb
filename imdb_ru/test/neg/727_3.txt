When I first watched this series, I got the impression that the characters were charming and funny, in particular, Lorelai and Rory were witty and clever interlocutors, although they were too talkative. However, after seeing it for some time, my opinion changed. <br /> <br /> The main characters gradually showed themselves to be selfish, selfish narcissists who treated their wound with tiny wounds as the worst insults in their existence. For example, Rory did not speak to his mother for several months when Lorelai did not consult her about her impulsive marriage, while Lorelai left Luke for simply wanting a little time to adjust to his new life circumstances. These people are small, they consider themselves the center of the universe, where everyone else should behave exactly as their own rigid rules, and if they do not, they will be offended by them forever. They do not want to see the problems of other people and treat the slightest, as the most serious crimes. Most characters lack the ability to behave in adults. They think they have to do whatever they want, and everyone else will be cursed. <br /> <br /> The series is based on characters, so when the main characters became so incredible, the show also became impossible to watch. I still have the rest of the series, but I doubt I ever finish them. I will also hold those who appreciate the show and its horrible characters with the greatest suspicion - they must be as terrible as Lorelai and others.
