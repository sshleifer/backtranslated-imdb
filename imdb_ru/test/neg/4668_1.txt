First of all. I do not look down on Americans. I know a lot of people who are smart people from the USA. But this film is so bad that I just needed to comment on it. <br /> <br /> First of all ... Films are mostly far from the truth. This film is no exception. Many scenes are so incredibly false. For example, the departure of 2 spacecraft. You see them dropping full tanks in space. Just a short distance from each other. Remember what caused the space shuttle to explode in the past? Just a little Vincey who left. Here, they simply dump fuel tanks, which are so big, if not bigger than the whole ship. What idiot would allow two space ships to rise and do it at the same time ??? Secondly, the Russian station is a piece of shit. I hate to bring this to you, but the astronauts are now going to Russia. Because their equipment is much more reliable than that of NASA. Space Shuttle retired. And NASA uses it only to pay bills. And there is no better alternative for this. And the list of crazy can go on and on. This is really an insult to people who are serious about space travel. And I know half as much as these guys. But the most annoying part (read: the whole film) is the propaganda and crap of the patriots you are suffocating. OH MY GOD !!!! I thought I was watching CNN commercials for an hour. Actors solve their petty problems by shooting at each other, giving the middle finger to everyone they come face to face with, fighting, ignoring the police, etc., etc., etc. ... But when it comes to their love to their country and sacrificing their lives, suddenly everyone gets in line to commit suicide (bomb detonator) ?? Maybe I lack the feeling that I am a real “Patriot” who can sing the national anthem in Swahili. While you are driving with George Bush behind the wheel of a golf cart, move in a circle until the battery is discharged. But this film was too much for me to handle too. And when I finally grabbed and pulled out the flagpole and fabric of the American flag from my heini. I realized that I was glad that this film was finally shot. I don't know why so many good actors participated in this narrow, stereotypical, propaganda film. But I feel sorry for them. This is a country in which you can avoid murder if you have money or power. For now, "Uncle Sam" thinks you're a good patriot. Where everyone is happy, while it is a devastated country, nobody cares.
