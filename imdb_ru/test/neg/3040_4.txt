Simon West's remake of the horror classics of 1979 is a pitiful attempt to bring the thrill of the old school into a modern audience. The talented teenage girl Camilla Belle is in the lead role, when the Stanger Calls cannot even bring a shocked or even surprised face. Bad attempts to intimidate the audience range from blurry coats, similar to people, to creating intense music for a cat running from the shadows. The plot follows Jill Johnson (Belle), a teenage girl who has to pay her father a bill for the babysitting. She is invited to work at night in a house by the river, and she believes that this is a very easy way to earn money. But little she knows, there is a stranger hiding in the house and constantly bothering Johnson on the phone. Pathetic excuse for the film.
