I had the misfortune to catch it on a flight recently. I had even more misfortune when he played on my RETURN flight. Obviously, Demi's attempt to get some “artistic” authority, the film collapsed because of its lousy acting ability. The best actress could do this job, but a simple look at Moore's face shows the emptiness inside. At least this time it does not spoil the American literature.
