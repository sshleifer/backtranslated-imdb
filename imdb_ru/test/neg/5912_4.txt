1989 was already the year when Eddie Murphy was not so hot, and he began making films, which will soon be forgotten. Oddly enough, it was also the year when Murphy shot his first film, but it will also be the first and last experiment. “Harlem Nights” is not exactly what can be called a success, even if it was great to see together the two best black comedians, namely Murphy and Richard Pryor. Do not blame the actors, since they all played their roles as you expected, even if you have to face (again) the typical Murphy laugh. The worst of the "Harlem Nights" is the script and its terrible scenery. Everything happens in the turbulent twenties, and everyone makes a profit from forbidden clubs. Sugar Ray (Prior) and his adopted son Kwiki (Murphy) easily gain $ 10,000 a day, but, of course, soon the crowd and the corrupt police come around the corner to get their share of cookies. Sugar and Quiches are not guys who give their money for free and have their plans. You can watch Harlem Nights, that's for sure, but if you tear up from the moment you hear the name Murphy, you'd better avoid it, because after all this movie this is just a lame excuse to see good jokes.
