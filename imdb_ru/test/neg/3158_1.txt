Barney does not teach children anything !!! Here are some reasons why you should not let your children watch this show: 1. Barney teaches children that we must think EXACTLY like each other to get along with each other. <br /> <br /> 2. Barney teaches kids that you shouldn’t be sad, and if you’re sad, eat lots of ice cream! 3. If you make people feel sorry for you, they will give you what you want, when you want it. <br /> <br /> Barney is just a fat doll who said that the children of strangers are your friends. He should NOT be trusted. And he is tall every day !!!, he constantly giggles !!!! DO NOT SEE THIS SHOW !!!!!!!!!!! Your children will thank you when there is older
