Last night I was sitting in my television room with a beer in my hand, a bowl of pretzels on a television tray and I decided to put the film “Monster Man” in my reliable video recorder. Waiting for a merry, bloody, crash and blows from the film's cheese fest. What will I get instead? One of the most stupid, stupid, disappointing and predictable films that I have ever experienced discontent. And what's worse, all the time (and I use this next phrase) “sexy scene” the girl is holding all her clothes! I’ll make this summary short and enjoyable: mix "Dude Where's My Car" (about half the film) with a very blurry "Hitcher", add the antagonist version of "I Madman" as a redneck, as the main villain, and finally incoherent black magic, and you sort of understand how rotten this film is. It is also completely predictable everywhere. The only remarkable factor in this film, disguised as a “horror film,” is that some moments between two guys (even if the “hero” is one of the MAINly annoying and the other is a clone of Jack Black) are quite funny. (just mediocrely funny, i.e. like most SNL parodies). Besides this, "Monster Man" is a monster mess! 3/10 (I will give this away during Halloween - just hope that after the person sees him, my house will not be annoyed or worse)
