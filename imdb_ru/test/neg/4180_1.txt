This should be one of those times when you come across a film with a neat cover, my first impression, a sweet full moon, ravens, a stuffed animal holding a scythe. Well, my impression (I watched the scarecrow on TV a few weeks ago) is excellent, a good slasher film from which to start the evening. ................... wrong, absolutely wrong, I think after 5 minutes I was going to take it off, but I thought I spent $ 3 on it, so I’ll finish its where the scarecrow went. Well, I guess it's fisherman's legs in heavy rain boots. You see it from time to time. I watched this thinking .... Well, when these guys run into this dude, I once thought they were dead. but no .... I mean frig, they are still alive. I just laughed at several parts of the reason for their terrible production. One of them was the zoom partly at the beginning. the director / actor / writer says: “Remember, I had this feeling, well, I have it again,” and it was either an increase or a decrease, to hell, I check. but I think the scene was supposedly shocking, I mean, shocking that his wife was just as shocked ... OK ... did she believe him ??? Sorry, but YES ... I didn’t know that he was a psychic until I read the box with the film in order to understand what I saw. Not only that, they used pictures to make you think that this film was at least clear. <br /> <br /> Another thing that made me laugh a little is screaming at the camera so it would be scary ....... Ok ............. ... shoot a girl with a cry for 5 minutes in the camera ....... that's right ... I laughed because these children could not behave like other people in the film. br /> <br /> to end up with a scythe, something must be lost or something like that ... because the bad guy just has a stick. not even an ax, someone has to drown a dam production film <br /> <br /> Do not give in to this picture, this film is a piece of shit. I looked at the trailer and guess what he has <br /> <br /> GIRLS WHERE YOU TALK ME AND SEA
