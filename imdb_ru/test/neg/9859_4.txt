Being a recognized chess addict, I was excited to see a documentary about the 1997 rematch between Garry Kasparov and the IBM Deep Blue supercomputer. I was hoping to see a detailed look at the match and much of what Kasparov should have said. Boy I was wrong and went astray for a mile. This documentary is very similar to many modern documentaries - it has a lot of flash memory, but no real content. After I watched it, I am sad to say that I felt I wasted my time. One of the most annoying aspects of a documentary film is that it does not stay in one place for a decent period of time. It has the typical MTV editing type, where the camera displays different images and quick sound bites from people every five seconds. It’s very sad that filmmaking comes down to the attention span of a 10-year-old child. <br /> <br /> I understand that it is difficult to make a film about chess, but this does not mean that it should make it luxurious. Game Over had a couple of interesting ideas. This raised the idea of ​​whether computers can think like people or not; have computers reached a new, unique level? This is what Kasparov thought after the match, but this film does not go deep enough into this idea. In addition, this film is trying to introduce a strange theory. It is trying to impose the paranoid that the person was making movements with the help of a computer. Kasparov had suspicions about this, but so far there is no evidence. Toward the end of the film, he is trying to understand that perhaps Anatoly Karpov could have been the person who secretly made moves with the help of Deep Blue. It is interesting to think, but I do not know how plausible or realistic it is. I still would not recommend this film, even for chess addicts.
