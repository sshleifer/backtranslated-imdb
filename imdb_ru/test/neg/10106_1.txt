Starting with terrible special effects, I was completely fooled by how bad everyone can make a movie. Let's just say, I have absolutely no directorial experience, and for the first time while watching the film I thought: “I can do more! while sitting and watching this dad. The acting in this film was terrible, I think the best actor was the guy from the lawn mower, but the Frenchman from Aliens3 was so wooden that I wondered how he got his old job at all. The storyline was mediocre, and I suppose, like most movies, if everything else was done well, it would stand up. Usually I don’t write reviews here, but when I saw several people give this film a good rating (must be played / team), I felt I had to say my work to save someone from accidentally hiring or spending money to buy cack .
