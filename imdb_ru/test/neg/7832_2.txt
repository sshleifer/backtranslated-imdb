If you're an ordinary guy like me, and you like a good game, a good storyline, good scripts, new ideas or entertainment, you can skip this. I was honestly bored from the opening credits to the very end, but I tried to give the film a chance, and watched it all the time - only to be disappointed at every step. <br /> <br /> The game was incredibly low, but Iâ€™m not sure if the actors themselves are to blame or if it was a ridiculously wooden and terrible dialogue combined with an even worse scenario. The plot is very vague and underdeveloped, and I think that the audience should extract some deeper meaning from it or be able to somehow look behind it, but to be honest, it would be a waste of time. <Br /> <br /> There is some kind of rough sexuality in the film that serves no other purpose than showing off some tattoos and underwear. It seems that no one has any motivation, except to make money on some kind of "investment" transaction, which has never been explained. The relationship between the characters is not very clear, and the character development is almost absent. <br /> <br /> This is either a subcultural film intended for a very specific audience, or absolute crap, but you can decide for yourself. <br /> <br /> I gave him 2 because this is definitely one of the worst films I've ever seen, but probably not the worst.
