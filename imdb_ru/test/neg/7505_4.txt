Zombie Planet seems like an example of good ideas and praiseworthy ambitions. I thought the zombie explanation was really original and clumsy, and I liked the dog chewing on the show scene. The rest of the blood was effective with a small budget, but too far apart throughout the film. The problem was that it was too long and was not climatic. Of course, they had an intriguing, albeit derivative plotline, and a similar familiar, but cool atmosphere, but a low-budget zombie film really should be hot to make an impression, and I simply didnâ€™t have enough red moments. I think there was an excess of cheap and bloodless battle scenes, especially given the minimal grumbling. Plus, for a two-hour movie, there are very few closings at the end, and although this somehow makes me want to hunt down Zombie Planet 2, I felt a little deceived. So, probably the most worthwhile to look for them two.
