Paul Telfer, who plays Hercules in this television film, must be the hottest on two legs. Wow. <br /> <br /> But this film is 100% distorting the story of Hercules. Like Troy, this film has nothing to do with the original story. Zero. What makes this particularly offensive is that they actually invented a funny character so that people could hate him, making him as mean and evil as any character in the history of television or movies. This is three times offensive, because Hercules may have had a wife, as they expected in those old days, but he also had at least a dozen male lovers. The irony is that they have to create a gay character, a royal opponent, for this film. No, not ironic. Evil. The creators of this parody should bow their heads in shame.
