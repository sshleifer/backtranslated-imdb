This look is similar to the earlier film of 1987, The Masters of the Universe, based on the cartoon Man-to-Man. In fact, you have a great old world, and for some reason they need the film to take place on the modern earth. Well, I believe that now it is not such a modern land, and that now it is an ancient world of strangeness and a string of past times. Well, I think I can understand why they actually put almost all modern films in this and that film. Save money on suits and sets. It is much easier to recreate what is happening in the present than the strange world, such as the world of Eternia in Heh-man, or the ancient world with cults and strange pyramids, victims and strange creatures that hug you to death. This film is memorable and not very interesting, your first clue that it will not be the best film in the world, is that Robert Z'Dar is in it. The only thing this has is animals that are not as common in this as in the past. Mark Singer is back, and I feel sad for him in this state. The guy was a pretty good actor who tried to make a sequel to the film, in which he really wasnâ€™t needed, and even if that had happened, he would have come five years later. ,
