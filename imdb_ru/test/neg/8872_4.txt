Of the thousands of films that I have seen so far, this is the first film that made me think about the expression of "lost talent." I have never NEVER seen so many great actors giving such terrible performances (Frederic Pierrot, Elsa Zilberstein and so on). The “aging” of the make-up is terrible and, even worse, is widely lit. The use of music (for example, love at first sight for a young adjutant) is sometimes so caricatured that I felt that most of the audience around me was smiling awkwardly. Until now, Antoine de Couns was a pretty good actor, but after seeing him and Les morsures de l'aube, I think he should start thinking about quitting. Please, Antoine, give up this project "Master Balantry"; I doubt you deserve it.
