Unlike most reviewers, I hated this film simply because the writer's / director's bloated ego didn’t bother a potentially interesting topic. Too many movie fans equate “EXTREMELY self-indulgence towards themselves” to the movie “GENIUS!”, But I don’t believe in this personality cult. The film should be about the topic, not the director (unless, of course, this is not a Woody Allen film). * SPOILER * (which is just as good, will save your time ...) There is nothing brilliant to show you you know that in the last Frame-, what is actually called the sticky maneuver, a foot-long Porn-star that Cries Film School Hacks. <br /> <br /> Poster film received the status of "great movie" due to its condescension and pandering to the public ?? which is primarily a writer / director. But the rest of the audience should look down on the sullen, brutal nature of the porn business too. Flick was on the side of the corner to the porn industry, looking down on every player he could pummel. It doesn't matter, just love your writer / director. Love those four-minute segments of the steadicam, which should show the energy of the moment, but somehow had all the power of the switch. Do not Love the plot no matter how boring it is - about the rise of the sensational and dirty fall of a porn star. But take a look at it from the top down, of course. While the subject has the potential to be exciting ?? innocence, money, degradation, beauty - your respectful writer / director somehow managed to make it all look, again, dull. Partly because of its lead time. This is what your hero-author did NOT try: to give the characters a dimension. Or a soul. Anything but genius, which is Paul, of course. But I do not buy. I do not buy indulgent khaki with amazing deception. <br /> <br /> Another long hacker article written by the author is fifty times more than hype about quality. I know some of you agree. The rest will surely see this indulgent click again. Not my problems.
