The speed at which these films seep through artifacts from the Amityville house does not take long before we get to the floorboards, but so far this is a mirror that causes problems for more cardboard characters in this sixth episode. A homeless person sends his hairdo to the artist Ross Partridge, who then has strange visions, and he discovers some unpleasant revelations about his past. This worldly horror unfolds at a dull pace, forcing us to wait for a buildup that will never happen, since various “creepy” actions lead to a blunt finale. Soft and lifeless, with a rope game and huge Partridge hair that doesn't help.
