Okay, so this is also not great, but only because of how great Laurel and Hardy were in the past. If this film were completely reworked, with improved image quality, the addition of new duplication to poorly duplicated voices and the addition of pleasant unobtrusive background music, then this film would really start to take shape. As it is, he has his own problems. People count how old boys are. Kel surprise! They were over 60, and they led a "life." However, for me, they still faced the fact that they had a lot of charm, and although it didn’t even tickle their classics (I gave 4), it’s worth a look just because they are. To think otherwise would be an impostor !!
