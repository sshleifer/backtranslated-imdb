As a child, I loved the Andersen tales and recently saw several intriguing documentaries about this strange, albeit brilliant, author, I was looking forward to the opportunity to watch this movie for television. Unfortunately, this experience was just a disappointment, which left me in anger and confusion. First, the story / script is full of inaccuracies and frank fantasies and, thus, creates an almost completely new story, while shamefully abusing the tales of Andersen, presumably to sell crap to such suckers like me. Secondly, the actor of a cute boy (did ... ever see a picture of the real Andersen?) Kieran Bru manages to portray Hans Christian as mentally retarded, and not the brilliant, though very agitated, character he really was. Despite the irritation and irritation, as in Andersen, Bru lacks the necessary charisma to create any feelings of compassion, whatever they may be. Thirdly. The love story between Andersen and the fictional Jetta (who really should be Henrietta, wife of Edward Collin) ... Why? This man has lived such an interesting life, this should be enough as a basis for a good movie! <br /> <br /> I could continue this to be a very long list, but I feel that it is safer to just recommend to all of you instead spend your time and money on something else.
