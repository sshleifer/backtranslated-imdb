My opinion: Steven Seagal is obviously too boring to be a leader in an action movie, even completely boring. <br /> <br /> Remember Steven Seagal? You do not? Do not worry, not so much to catch up. After Seagal has starred in films that are truly enjoyable for viewers, such as UNDER SIEGE and EXECUTIVE SOLUTION, Seagal falls into the bottom of the abyss of a bad movie. Now he is filming low-level action films of level B, some of which are made for the TV movie "Cinema of the Week", which got lost on the big screen. HALF PAST DEAD is, let's say, dead fighters. Loud and lousy fighter, carelessly shot and lazily written (and, even worse, bad acting). This is one of those bad films that I don’t need to watch until the end to understand that this is bad. I did not have the courage to have all my brains die, and I was wasting time on it. These are bad films in which you understand that other films that you hate are, after all, quite good. <br /> <br /> The plot (and locale) is completely removed from the similar picture by Michael Bay THE ROCK. , although this cannot be a word to describe it. Both films are summer films, and should not be taken so seriously. But for comparison, even THE ROCK (which is not so much in the writing department as in lighting and sounds) has better characters, a more convincing plot, better action sequences and a generally more entertaining atmosphere. Although there are action scenes in HALF PAST DEAD, none of them are impressive. All this is sometimes tedious and predictable. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that predictability seemed a welcome advantage in summer action films, predictability has never been more acidic than funny, and HALF PAST DEAD is never really funny, in many cases it’s just a pain in the head hearing bad rap music repeating over and over throughout the entire movie makes me crave aspirin every second I hear them). The action is terribly mediocre, the plot is derived, without any persuasive or attractive characters. Seagal's character, an undercover agent sent to Alcatraz to stop a criminal boss (Morris Chestnut), a very boring villain, cannot help worrying. Seagal's character is also provided with an assistant (played by rap star Ja Rul) and a group of amigo prisoners, and no chemistry takes place here. <br /> <br /> If you star in a series of other forgotten action movies (what were these films?) killed during Segal’s career forever, HALF PAST DEAD is too much. And viewers should be warned: you are invited to feel pain. Tip: Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0 of 5.
