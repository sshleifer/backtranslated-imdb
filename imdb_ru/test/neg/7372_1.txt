Please do not waste your time and money on this stinking turkey. <br /> <br /> This is an incredible melodramatic love story created against the background of New France (Quebec in the 18th century). Or is it the historical saga of New France with an epic novel? I do not know, and at the moment I do not care. <br /> <br /> There is a rich story about the fearless French adventurers, rogues and other different characters who settled in Canada and parts of the United States. This is not true. Characters are clich√©d, the story is bloated, breathless and devoid of any charm, and soon all the viewer wants to do is to break out of the theater, check his head and grab his or her wrath caused by hype. <br /> <br /> This film was the biggest disappointment of my year in terms of cinema, especially since I became a historian and a French Canadian or a Canadian of French origin (or something else) I: a) believe in that the story of my people in this country has not yet been told how it could have been about the film; b) is interested in this topic; c) a cinema lover who thinks that cinema today can work wonders with this grand and tragic history. <br /> <br /> As I said, do not waste your time on this disappointing piece of cotton.
