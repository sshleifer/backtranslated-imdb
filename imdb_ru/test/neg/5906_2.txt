He was praised as a bloody comedy with a fast tempo and the best German film of the year, so I tried it, although I had already seen some of Dani Levy’s films - or at least a part of them. <br /> <br /> I got what I expected: no comedy, unless you think that heart attacks are ridiculous. This is a great example of a sloppy screenwriting with an implausible plot and characters loaded with clichés, which may be true, but, of course, are not funny either. <br /> <br /> The most annoying character is the character of Zucker's wife, played by Hannelore Elsner. She must behave incredibly strange to keep the plot moving. For example: she does not know anything about Judaism, but for reasons that are most likely unknown even to herself, she has the idea of ​​playing a charade that she and her family are Jewish laws, subject to the Jews for her husband’s family, which , and from very orthodox and self-satisfied diversity. To make it a little harder, she invites all four to stay in her city apartment, because they arrive from Frankfurt to Berlin without having booked their hotels in advance, something is not a 60-year-old businessman, is not really an adult German ever do. This gives the viewer the opportunity to swallow a lot, but still does not give a joke. <br /> <br /> Zucker and his brother Samuel have not seen each other for forty years, but it turns out that his daughter - now Lesbian - and the son of Samuel - now an Orthodox warrior - were once lovers, and he is the father of HER daughter. Samuel’s daughter, a nymphomaniac, follows Zucker's blue son. Should this be some kind of humorous parody of the incestuous tendencies of the Jews? This is probably just a thoughtless way to add the “turbulence of love action” that every comedy needs. And, of course, also can not joke. <br /> <br /> Praise to this film is purely political. Therefore, only people who like to watch films that are supposed to be “politically important” will enjoy it, even though “Alles auf Zucker!” It’s absolutely clear that it doesn’t matter. <br /> <br /> For everyone else: don’t watch it without the Fast Forward option. I really missed it.
