I see absolutely nothing funny - even remotely funny - in this stupid film. Unrealistic, stupid, ridiculous idea - just ridiculous. It is hard to believe that the main character, who seems so expressive, intelligent and creative, will not be accepted in any college. It is even harder to believe that no one has closed this place. The actors portrayed characters straight from Characterville. We have seen them many times in many films. There is nothing new here. I found it on TV late at night, and since there was really nothing else, I watched the whole boring and stupid movie. What a common waste. Maybe if you are a teenager, you may find it funny. Films are made for an immature mind, so teens go for it. For the rest, for nothing.
