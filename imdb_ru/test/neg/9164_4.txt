No matter how cute and charming she is, the story of the three singing chipmunks does not seem to have enough meat to last for one and a half hours. I thought the first half hour of this movie was worth seeing. It was fun, there were a few laughs in it, it was full of energy. Then it just lost it somehow. I would not even say that it disappeared, because it seemed to me rather sharp. The fun has passed; the laughter disappeared. My daughter noticed it too. She is 4 years old - she laughed loudly several times in this first part of the film, then her laughter stopped. It may have gotten too serious a tone â€” the evil producer of the film killed the chipmunks to death. In any case, something happened, and it was not for the better. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film is trying to tell a story about how the chipmunks began (Alvin, Simon and Theodore). Everyone knows the Christmas song. Here we will find out how they met Dave and got a start. The film has been updated to the present day, although its real origin is noted at the street address of Dave in 1958, when animated singing rodents were first created. Jason Lee did a pretty good job, since Dave and the chipmunk voices were also pretty good. David Cross, like angry Yang, annoyed me to be stupid, and I could not understand the essence of the character Claire played by Cameron Richardson. She added a bit to the movie. This is a movie that you can watch with your children, in fact, this is a movie that you would like to watch only with children. It gets 4/10 from me.
