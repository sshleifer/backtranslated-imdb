I bought it on VHS as “Horror Hospital,” and when I got home, I checked IMDb and looked like OMG, this is the legendary “Nurse Sherry” !!! So, here’s another one from Al Adamson, who since the “Blood of Dracula’s Castle” has obviously learned a bit of meager about making films. Where this early effort is more or less completely sclerotic, this mixes it up a bit, adding a certain element of diversity and wonder among incompetence. Of course, half of the film is a blind postoperative football player shooting in the wind with his folded nurse, but at any moment we could be cut off to the giggling disembodied head of the satanist mastermind, or nurse Sherry drives the farmer through a pitchfork or a small piece of an abstract student film quickly cutting to go with the effects of pulsing blob on the ownership stage, or the most useless indecisive topless ever, or god knows what else (I forgot, to be honest). As the dumb bum pieces go off, this one runs to the top end. Congratulations, Al.
