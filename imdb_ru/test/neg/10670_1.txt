First of all, how someone with his creative potential can believe in such a film. I saw this film, and after a few hours, he scratched my head what exactly the director was trying to say. <br /> <br /> If this is a thriller, then there is no thrill if its action is not. action, with the exception of the chase sequence, there is no drama, and a very publicized love story, it never really takes off. No passion, no emotion. <br /> <br /> In fact, I never expected miracles from the film, but after opening the bumper, I decided to give it a chance. I have no problems with Himesh Reshamia, and I am not one of those guys who will beat him at every opportunity. I entered with an open mind and went out with a closed one. <br /> <br /> Let's not blame Himesh Reshamia, he is just a debut actor. But the direction, the script, the script, the makeup - everything went into decline. <br /> <br /> Himesh is very tough and it will take him a long time to climb the curve. He can perform such roles. Khansika is just a child, and it shows on the screen her baby fat woman and how she walks. <br /> <br /> The only good actor was Himesh’s friend in the film, I don’t know his name, but he looks promising. <br /> <br /> To look at your own risk and risk, even it is not good to watch it for some time. <br /> <br /> ** We strongly recommend that you avoid this movie. **
