I do not understand why some of you (or many) gave this film a rating above 8 stars out of 10. Do you understand that there are reasons for lower ratings for a reason? Of course, it may be a film about zombies with splashes, but it is. I don't hate zombie movies, but it was horrible. In fact, in fact, I would call it more like a zombie soap, because such is the game. Production ... well, okay. Hardly an attempt to develop a conspiracy, terrible game, stupid effects, cliches, and a sudden ending. Go ahead and love zombie movies, but never put it above 5.0. Honestly, the only reason you want to watch this movie is to laugh. Seriously.
