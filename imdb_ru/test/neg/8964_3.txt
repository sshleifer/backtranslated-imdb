As mentioned on this board, it is very difficult to make a fake documentary. This requires tremendous skills, tempo, patience, directorial "distance", a plausible premise, a narrative "flow" and a REALLY believable actor's game (that is, a GREAT actor's game). <br /> <br /> This does not happen with the "Love Machine". He begins to show his false arrow about the 20-minute mark (from 60 minutes left for viewing), and the viewer begins to understand that he or she is being received. From there down. <br /> <br /> Directed by Gordon Eriksen just peaked too soon. But in order to be fair to Eriksen, his problems started early: as he explains in statistics, he began to want to make a REAL document, could not get funding and agreed to a cheaper way to make his film. <br /> <prerequisites - people who have a secret life posting themselves on the porn site - were perhaps more interesting in 1997-98, when the film was made. Eriksen does a lot of tricky things — an up-and-coming master, hand-held cameras, zooming, grainy black and white — all of this, I suppose, evokes a sense of authenticity, but it just doesn't work. The film is confusing and compelling, but ultimately it negates the credibility of the actors and the rather awful dialogue.
