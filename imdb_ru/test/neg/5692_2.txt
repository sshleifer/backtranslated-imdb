You see a movie called “The Battlefield,” what will you think? Space battles with cool as fucking explosions and shooting at each other. What do you get with this movie? Well, you do get SOME blessings in a space battle, but in most cases they are just stupid people wandering around and doing almost nothing. NO ONE TALK !!!! What is this nonsense ?! We have storytellers and a ton of British computers, but that's all. The protagonist must be the worst person I've ever seen, since she doesn't even have a dialogue and lunatics, although the scene (literally!). Some of the things that are happening are just stupid, for example, they use a rocket (for example, to fly into space) for the main transport planet, why not just use one of these elegant spacecraft? In any case, the music is almost non-existent, with a few boring, dull, lifeless samples, but the main thing you notice is the Atari sound effects that use ships ... you must be joking. I can also say that the budget was low because everything looks fake, which is not at all what you expect from the film, especially what should be a super cool space combat movie. I seriously think that the budget must have been double digit, it is so bad that it makes you laugh more than it should be about how bad it is. I'm starting to think that they paid the actors based on how many dialogues they had, because there are very few of them here (if you can't say this is my main trouble, as I probably said 3 times already) .
