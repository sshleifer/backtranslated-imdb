Well, this film was not good at all. Video games are not something that I would boast about if I were more than 15 years old. It's cool to play games, but to write a comment about video game players this movie may be like because it’s weird. Just play video games, do not invent a sad story about your falling into the trap. I use my mobile phone, I hope I won’t lose my girlfriend in it. Lubrication is the worst? Well, Grease has a very well thought out story as well as a musical. Even if you don't like musicals, someone will say that Grease is good. My brother plays video games all the time, he watched for 30 minutes and left because it was so terrible. I feel asleep.
