As much as I love trains, I could not digest this film. The assumption that you can steal a locomotive and “drive” from Arkansas to Chicago without hitting another train on the way should be right there on the “Impossible Plot” hitboard. Imagine that two disgruntled NASA employees are stealing a “caterpillar drive” that weaves shuttles back and forth and takes it to New York, and you get the idea. <br /> <br /> Having said all this, this is a good attempt. Wilford Brimley plays Quaker Oats best of all, and Levon Helm does a good job with his stupid, but well-meaning girlfriend. Bob Balaban, as the Corporate Guy, is a worm, respectively, and the story of the "little guy Goliath" goes on the air.
