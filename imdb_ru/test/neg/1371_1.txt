Sorry, but this guy is not funny. I swear, I heard, heard that 4-year-olds have come up with better jokes than some of them. For example, “Dee Dee Dee” is probably the worst phrase I've ever heard. He lacks creativity at all, and joking at people with mental problems when you reach the level of your own show is incredibly stupid on the part of Mencia. <br /> <br /> Although everyone compares this fool to Chappelle, they are not disputed. First, they had very different shows. I think that on the whole, on the Meniqui show, on average there were only about 2 short 5-minute scenes between his 10-minute sensations about what God knows. Chapelle show turned out more like a sketch comedy, with 2-4 scenes, which occupied all the shows. All that the choir has done is a brief summary of each parody before and after each. Here, Mencia fails even more. What would have made Mencia think that a show consisting of the same comedy he talks about in his specials would be a good idea? Does anyone really want to listen to a little George Lopez, who was a pioneer in the years before Mencia, but simply pulled out of the faith to the extent that he died? Chance Snowflakes in hell. <br /> <br /> I believe that although most people hate this guy for his racism, I simply cannot bear him for his incompetence. The central comedy was looking for a minority, which they would call “controversial”, and then leave it to follow the Chappelles. The problem is that this guy made it clear that he did not want to be Chappell. So instead, he conducts his shit show like a burning piece of train right in the ground. Someone wants to watch weekly reports about the same material every Thursday, I know for sure that I don’t know. <br /> <br /> Although I can not express my gratitude to Comedy Central. This idiot's show is over. Personally, after watching his performance, I don’t know how he even got his own show. There are so many decent comics like Jim Gafigan, Zach Halifinakis, etc. In fact, someone is better than this fool.
