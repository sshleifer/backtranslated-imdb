This film is to be held in Milford, New Jersey. I know the house on which it is based, as well as the person. As you see at the end of the film, she was killed during an incident at the World Trade Center. I know this because I was one of the cops who helped identify her remains. (She was the only one lost in our area). The nudity in the film has gone a bit far. I'm not a prude, but the actors could have shot the scene with two women without showing it all. This film has a bad taste, and I can't understand how his family could give him a blessing. It is an insult to the person on whom it is based.
