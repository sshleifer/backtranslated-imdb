Here he is. New horror icon for the new millennium. Better than Freddie. More dangerous than Jason Forhey. More evil than Michael Myers. Hard to believe, I know. But his time is here .... <br /> <br /> Ray Prick. <br /> <br /> Yes, an antagonist, Ray - a full prick. This is partly due to the disobedient things he does. Also, because he has a scar (oh, scary) on his face. But mainly because of Dock Ray Ucol. <br /> <br /> Yes, Ray does not direct evil. He does not even become a cursed voodoo spell. No, Ray Prick was milked. As De Niro once said: “You can milk everything with your nipples.” And Ray milked. Evil. <br /> <br /> How do you pray for evil? Snake nipples, I answer. Snake nipples. <br /> <br /> Why are you asking Ray? Because he prick, I answer. Capital P. <br /> <br /> Watch the New Line Pictures extravaganza called "Freddie and Ray Prick". <br /> <br /> Thought your new savior rescuer was Jeeper The Creeper? Well, no more, because Ray Prick is here. And I'm scared. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the film has no atmosphere, PG-13, the original quality of the film, because Ray is a star.
