Occasionally, I accidentally leave the TV on after South Park, and eventually catch some of the train wreck with humor in a high school called Mind of Mencia. This is the only time I would like my room to be cleaner because I could find the remote much faster. The truth is that Comedy Central needed a replacement for the “Chapelle Show,” and what they got was a show that appealed to idiots who either missed Dave so much that they would cling to any variety of minorities or be satisfied plain "Mexicans love taco-jokes that Carlos Mencia shovels every week. I must understand, however, that there are some people who really find Mencius * wince * funny. I firmly adhere to my words when I say that I believe that these people exist only in myths. However, if you are really there, I only ask that you never enter my residential area and read these basic differences between Carlos and the Chapelle Show: <br /> <br /> 1) Dave was funny. You can highlight this. <br /> <br /> 2) The Chapelle Show was FIVE times as sharp as Mencia ever could have hoped. And yet, every time a promo sounds in his little show, everything about him, about how he says that he is nothing we have ever seen. You understood correctly, Carlos. And not in a good way. Chappelle did not need to tell people that he was sharp and funny. We are all kind of stuck around to watch the show, to find out for ourselves. <br /> <br /> 3) Chappell did have jokes about race that penetrated the depths of different cultures - things that some people didn’t know about. Like its game segment "I know black people." The main prize is black hair cream. This is deeper than Mencia would dare to dive. So how dare he call himself nervous? If Mencia wrote this sketch, the main prize would be fried chicken and cole-help. And my charges have a certain value. A few days ago I saw a TV commercial for his show (which I affectionately called “My TV monitor takes thirty minutes”), and it was some kind of stereotypical Olympic sketch, which, as I admitted, was quite pretty. funny concept. Then I saw that the winning Mexican received a green card as the main prize. This is it?! It's as close to the fire as you want? Who CAN'T think about it - back in 7th grade? For you fans of the show, if you ever watch and miss one of its highlights, perhaps because you and your friends discussed how “Duh-De-Durr” never gets old and is in no way part of a joke where someone it would be ridiculous to say something clever - just remember that in any case there are only five possible variations of the highlight: green card, taco, lintels, lawn mowers and, of course, duh-de-dur. Just remember - whatever it is, it screamed. Enjoy! <br /> <br /> 4) Relation to the second. Every time he says something that makes you laugh, he pauses to tell people (laughing at his own joke) that he thinks he "went too far with this last one." Then do not say it for the sake of God. Or let people decide for themselves. He and Comedy Central continue to shove this prank down my throat that he is a “say how it’s” show that is more controversial than Da Vinci Code. You do not. You will never be. <br /> <br /> I have never been offended by the content of the show. I would never have believed it. I am offended by the fact that Carlos Mencia is given thirty minutes to scream unnecessarily. Yes ... I am literally offended by this fact.
