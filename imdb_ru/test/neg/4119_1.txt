I can't remember when the last time the movie was was so boring that I left. The Weatherman and The Island were so bad that I thought about it, but I even stayed at it. This film was incomprehensible, not funny and just went on and on. Like some other commentators, I wondered if the parts were just French humor, which I didn't get, or whether the characters were serious. In the end I just gave up and tried to take a nap, because I didnâ€™t want to disturb my husband if he liked it, but he noticed and let me know that everything would be alright, if I want to leave and leave the door, we went. He would like to know how this ended ... if Deneva lived or died, etc. ... (I don't even care).
