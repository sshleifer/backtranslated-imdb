It seems that most of the films of Lorna Michaels have failed, because these are just extended versions of parodies that hardly managed to make people laugh in five-minute segments. "Tommy Boy" - a character from "SNL" - a big, cute, in their opinion, stupid, who knows nothing. <br /> <br /> David Spade gets the role of "Merciless overloaded man in the street." He is paired with an annoying Overweight Servant, and they suffer Tormentous Misfortunes when they travel over rough terrain to save Daddy's Business. <br /> <br /> The plot, for starters, is really faulty. The whole premise - dad dies, and the rich, stupid son has to save the family business - can be traced to almost any movie you want. Like any film in the style of SNL, it comes down to simple motivation - empty, shallow; just a reason for the fat guy and the thin guy to be “funny” together. <br /> <br /> The film’s biggest “influence” is the 1987 comedy Airplanes, Trains and Cars. This film is great because the plot is not outdated and not reworked. It's simple, yes - the guy driving home for Thanksgiving is stuck with a slut. But this is real, damn it. It makes all the difference. Characters are real, situations are much more real. “Tommy Boy” is a pure farce, and his ridiculous situations undermine the characters — we feel nothing for them, and we don’t care what happens on the screen. "PTA" has passed a careful border between outrageous and completely believable and relevant - "Tommy Boy" is simply absurd, and jokes, like a simple deer in the headlights, turn into a catastrophe, turning into a fight with dead and then wakes up and crashes their car. <br /> <br /> This whole wrecked car is completely stolen from PTA, and it’s scary how many things in this film really resemble Steve Martin / John. Candy film. <br /> <br /> Farley is too unpleasant to find him pleasant - I never liked watching him in any film, and this did not change my mind. Spade has nothing to do, he serves as the most ungrateful character in the film. <br /> <br /> Dan Aykroyd - an evil villain who plans to destroy the business daddy. The ending is a joke, not a funny one. More like "oh god, are they serious ?!" way to. <br /> <br /> Some people dig it, it's cool. But I just can't get into it, nor do I appreciate all the things he “borrows” - not just counting PT & A - without any credit at all.
