I do not know where to start. <br /> <br /> Huge problems with continuity, bad play, etc. For example, Sam should be far from all people, but you can see the ski slopes cut into the mountain next to his Head. <br /> <br /> But the most fundamental problem is that the essence of the book, Samâ€™s adventurousness, paving the way for a better life for his entire family, is not even affected. Instead, in the film, he is angry with his family, and he leaves his rich parents alone with him, and when he gets tired of this, he goes home. Where is its development? Where is the arc? <br /> <br /> If you've never read a book and can go through incredible 60-fold (double / triple / quadruple visions of a falcon) and terrible product quality (crackle, um, fire, winter) the wind stops howling during dialogue and then restarted, etc.) I think this * may * be good for an 8 year old. <br /> <br /> But compared to the complexity of the book, this is a terrible disappointment. <br /> <br /> Read the book instead.
