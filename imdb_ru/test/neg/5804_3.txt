In all the positive reviews of this film there is a background - this is just a brainless comedy, do not take it seriously. Chillax dude !!! Well, that's one point of view. Another would be - why do we accept the same script, the same formula and the same unfunny people in all these "comedies". <br /> <br /> What you get is a slacker who, in some completely unrealistic circumstances, has to change his life (always he), overcome a number of circumstances that only create a problem for a raccoon or teenager, defeat an equally stupid a bad guy who is trying to steal the girl he met two days earlier and win by remaining a bum, but with a lot of money / self-esteem. On the way, someone does something rude, but very illogical. This means that you, the viewer, can call someone after the movie and say something like: “You will not believe it, Maann. This guy finds an otter drowned in a bucket of diarrhea, which the other guy left after he ate laxative cakes. with that ". Jolly. <br /> <br /> Most of the common names appear. David Spade and Rob Schneider make funny jokes, but they are the characters of crrrazzeee - Russian and, I hold myself, the waiter in a vegan restaurant. , the king of a brainless, non-ridiculous, illogical comedy, co-producer, and some talentless one that nobody called Dante appears again. The US will have to explain to the rest of the world what this guy Dante is famous for because we are ignorant from me the biggest laugh of the night. He was 42 years old and he I looked a few years older. <br /> <br /> I laughed? Yes, but no more than I would watch on TV, and I don’t need to pay a penny to watch them. Please stop making these films.
