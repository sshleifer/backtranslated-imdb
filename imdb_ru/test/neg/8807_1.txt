The Rat Hood is absolutely terrible. This is the city version of "Willard." I just can not believe that this film is made, not to mention the distribution. Someone from Universal Studios thought that people would like this movie. The only good thing about this is Ice-T as a landlord. He was funny. <br /> <br /> The only thing I hate in the movie is speeding up the action. Once or twice bad enough, but the whole movie is like that. Each scene transition is a special effect of fast motion. The director should be prevented from making films forever. <br /> <br /> Believe me, never watch this movie!
