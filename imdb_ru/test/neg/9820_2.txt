I guess the rave reviews on this page were from people who never read the book - Unfortunately, for those of us who love text, Hollywood surpassed itself by destroying this one. <br /> <br /> I’m not sure Where did this woman’s love come from, except that she replaced the cat, and why our Rogue didn’t have a useful family in Blythe - in fact the vast majority of the book was cut out and replaced by your standard rude love story. The ambiguity of how the world leader was in his views was completely eliminated, and our Rogue was given a name (none of them appeared until the second book). <br /> <br /> I gave him 2, not 1, simply because Cockney had surprisingly bad accents. Joan Bennett surpassed Dick Van Dyck in the movie "Mary Poppins" for many miles, and this is a very small way to his rescue. <br /> <br /> Well, the British should probably avoid it. Trust me :)
