What could be on the mind of Irene Dunn, when she took a role in this disgusting story about a woman with contractual morals? Of course, Irene Dunn of the 1940s, whose reputation as a faithful Roman Catholic, who publicly hated rubbish and avoided any movie scenarios or Hollywood society that could even be remotely interpreted as destroying social morality, would never become associated with such morality. dubious project like this one. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Cardinal Spellman from New York, in his private audience with her, gave her a nice embellishment of this role? We probably will never know this, since she never spoke about it in subsequent years, although she condemned her morally suspicious (albeit rather successful) 1932 Back Street film as “trash”. <br /> <br /> Of course, by the time she received the outstanding award of St. Robert Bellarmin in 1965 for exemplary public Catholicism, Ann Vickers was no longer mentioned by the general public. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that “Ann Vickers” does not work either as an entertainment or as a social commentary. <br /> <br /> The role of Miss Dunn as a social worker who is engaged in adultery who sleeps ( between reforming prisons and writing a bestseller on remedial rehabilitation) does not fit her temperament or screen behavior, and everyone continues to suspect that all this is a kind of tongue in her cheeks (what else can we think when we see the installation of a sympathetic blissful look Miss Dunn, superimposed about a shot of a female prisoner being scourged? By the end of the film, she abandoned careerism in favor of marriage, (to the equally hard convicted Walter Houston - and what kind of insanity would you ever think of in a romantic relationship?) <br /> <br /> Irene Dunn, no doubt, wants to see this curiosity, at least for a chance to hear her promise to rehabilitate a cocaine addict under her control: "I'm going to get you out of a snow turkey" !!! <br /> <br /> Well, if nothing like this happens, give her your light years from her usual environment of opera trills, spike thorn and strawberry phosphates - cocaine addiction is not the first item associated with impeccable Miss Dunn.
