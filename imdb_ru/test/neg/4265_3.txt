There is nothing wrong with showing an old man falling in love with a young girl. Lolita did it. The American beauty did it. <br /> <br /> but They did it finely. From the very beginning, they did not show that the director was preparing them to fall in love with each other. Not as natural as two people (Age no bar), but forcing them to be next to each other, as if they were to fall in love. <br /> <br /> In general, there should have been chemistry. This would solve the biggest problem. Persons with reservations against this topic would also be absorbed and possibly convinced. It would be a perfect love story, regardless of impracticality. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it was hard for me to believe in the character of Jia. What was harder for me to understand is why Vijay - a photographer and artist who seems serious - would be interested in such a frivolous girl. Unless he himself has no hidden frivolity that has not manifested at all. <br /> <br /> There are many uses for Dutch corners or angles in which the frame is tilted. It is usually used to show something unnatural or something that can lead to something wrong. So the RGV itself calls the relationship unnatural. <br /> <br /> Camera angles, background evaluation, editing and even overlaying pictures and characters underline and overestimate their relationship. Is the Indian audience so stupid that we need to say something in 10 different ways so that we can understand it? Especially when they were dancing together ... it was obvious what was going on. Why was the scene slowed down by dramatic background music? I feel that the subject was very well chosen. But Verma should not have made the film, constantly remembering that this is a controversial issue. If so, then delicately deal with it, why not?
