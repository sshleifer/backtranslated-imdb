Launched from Troma (this is my favorite film company) Unspeaksble is a dirty horror film that can be interesting, but very dark and distorted. <br /> <br /> Unspeakable begins with the family in the car, they have an accident, leaves the daughter dead, and the mother is deformed. father goes crazy over time and injures prostitutes. He sees his daughter in other people. He kills for her. In the meantime, his now deformed wife was raped by her orderly. These are sick people! <br /> <br /> Incredible tries to be sick and anxious, and he does it, like a good horror movie, it is not. Most Troma films have a sense of humor, but this is not true.
