Not so much in this film ... the stunt rider or the production car has a flaming car at the beginning of the film, he goes to a bar, a biker gang approaches him, which destroys his chances with a very nice lady, offer him a job, he will return to his place, refuses, the police asks him to take you! A very annoying little film is being played, in which the hero doesnâ€™t really do much, and the biker gang can kill, and for some reason the police cannot impose a crime on them. I'm not sure why the biker woman did what she did at the end, but hey, this is a bad movie, you always get scenes that don't have much meaning. I'm still trying to find out if I heard this when they said that the hero of the play was a car stunt driver. They may have said that this is a race car driver, because why the stunt racer will participate in the race, and I do not think that this can happen so rarely when a car stuntman breaks down. The actors are bad, and all the bikers are pretty annoying, but the hero seems to be incompetent ... in fact, this film is not full of blows, but these are holes.
