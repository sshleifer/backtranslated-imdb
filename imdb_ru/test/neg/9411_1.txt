Very bad script and acting skills. I was very surprised that the director was able to convince his cast of his empty story, which does not tell us anything new. Everything is in the clich√© of a "mentor" and a "talented immature student." Characters are not even interesting or cute. Artistically it is just as empty and insignificant. The colors are very impersonal and light. Only a poster can be attractive. Al Pacino is trying hard to give his character depth, but to no avail. It is a pity, because sports betting can be a really interesting subject, which many can relate to. But I can not give a full commentary on this film, since I left the theater 20 minutes before the end. Everything was so predictable that it was the waist of the time ...
