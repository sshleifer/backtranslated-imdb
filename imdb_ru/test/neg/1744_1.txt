I recently waist 8 ?? by going and see this movie in the cinema. It was a waste of time, and the only feeling you were going to get from the theater was a bit nauseous of all the disgusting social pornography. <br /> <br /> It could be interesting if he had a rather absurd turn, but it wasnâ€™t, it was just awful, maybe one or two scenes that could be shot and made of very good ones short films. <br /> <br /> Another thing I thought about is how the director uses all Finish stereotypes as characters. Quite unusual, as you, as a Finnish director, can make films with the worst stereotypes of your nationality. It was sad to sit and hear the audience sit and laugh at things that, in their opinion, were typical of the finish, but in general just laugh at people.
