The film has strange, annoying characters, a strange inexplicable farce and an irresistible amount of talk about smoking. The film has a contrived story about the search for the love of bitchy, empty-headed woman (Jeanne Tripplehorn). Although, who ever will like the character of Jeanne, her personality or reading dialogue, I really can not say. Except that she likes to smoke. <br /> <br /> Sarah Jessica Parker gives an interesting insight into a character (who likes to smoke). Dylan McDermott does his best to look cute and spiritual (when he smokes). And, hey, what is Jennifer Aniston doing there? Oh, she really isn't enough for someone to take care of her. (But she likes to smoke). <br /> <br /> This is a waste of time. I do not even know how I managed to survive as much of the film as I did. I cannot even believe that I have spent the time to write it, except to warn others about its banality. Does anyone need a cigarette?
