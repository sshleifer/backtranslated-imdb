I did not see any other Antonioni films, and the people who saw this film with me agreed that he shares his themes and images with the rest of his works. Perhaps if I saw other things from him, I would have enjoyed it, knowing what to expect. <br /> <br /> I saw it as almost complete failure for many reasons. First of all, the film presents interesting deep questions about social relationships, feelings, nature of reality and fiction, but very often this is done in clumsy ways, forcing the characters to speak as if they make speeches, roam and continue matching ads, not dialogs. The writers seem to be so worried that we don’t understand what they prefer to tell rather than show. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the film has no rhythm, especially in its first half. It's not just that it's slow. Some slow movies were made with an excellent sense of tempo and rhythm (“Examples of the era” by Victor Eris or “The Age of Innocence” Scorsese are examples I like), but in order to succeed, we need to find characters so attractive or Story so touching that we can adapt to it. This does not happen in Behind the Clouds, where the first episode seems to be stretching endlessly, and the relationship between John Malkovich's “reality” and the “fiction” of love stories is sometimes fluid, others are harsh, others are confusing.
