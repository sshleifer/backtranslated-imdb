The STATE is a capricious historical play, the winding history of a Jewish woman who, after the death of her father, goes to Scotland in the 1830s, posing as a pagan to get a job to support her family in London. <br /> <br /> Rosina - or Mary, as she calls herself in the not too thin part of the symbolic letter - is a child without a rudder, a social dream, dreaming of becoming an actress. She enters into an alliance with her employer and accidentally solves an important problem in her research with a photograph. With frivolous success, they begin to fall apart and feel embarrassed, while the eldest son of her lover hopelessly (and inexplicably) falls in love with her. <br /> <br /> And as a child, she does not understand the consequences of her action - after all, the betrayal of those whom she deceived in order to make a life for herself. <br /> <br /> Many argue that this is something like a feminist manifesto, but I disagree. Intentional or not, this film only resonates with me if I think of it as a warning. In the end, Rosina’s greatest disappointment - it’s true - that she lied, found a way to help the man she wanted to be both her father and her lover, and in the end didn’t bring anything but destruction. Thus, the end of the film gives me the impression that nothing of what she did, no one used, made her happy - and this is exactly as it should be. <br /> <br /> I need a movie for so long? and violently teach me this lesson? It's my pleasure. On the contrary, if it were not for excellent cinematography, a unique score and my hope that it will get its revival, I would not stay with this until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Minnie Driver’s fans are likely to be disappointed with her uneven work, but may want to see her anyway; I doubt that young fans of Jonathan Rhys-Meyers will be able not to fall asleep for the expected returns, and I can't help but think that there are too few cultural details to be of interest, even for photo lovers. The 3 points that I award to the film are intended solely for its visual style and rating. Because of their other work, I suppose that acting is so frustrating because of the bad script and the worst director, but in the end, they are not remarkable.
