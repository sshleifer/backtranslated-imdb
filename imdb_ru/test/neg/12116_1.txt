The television award shows that in half of the cases he is put up for nomination in the Comic Relief category, chats, quizzes, game shows, charity shows, Brighton. At that moment, when your mind ends and you think you can find salvation in the wireless network, the thundering sound of the good old JR strikes you like a freight train that goes non-stop from Texas to the center of New York, who has lost an hour and is trying to make up for it. <br /> <br /> About this show (FNWJR). <br /> <br /> This is a regular chat format featuring JR As host and a four-gay home group (ha ha ha, here’s mine, but in the first season he had Andy Davis, but he left or was fired to give way to Ross's Ego. <br /> <br /> Ross will increasingly use his guests as a prop, and you really don’t hear them talking because of his relationship "This is my ball and I will take it home ", you also see that the bigger the guest, the more he is willing to lie and suck them to communicate with the big boys (Like a weak child at school who hangs out with igan). <br /> <br /> However, when a little star of a reality show appears, he will humiliate them with joy by asking personal questions about the past and telling them about their absence of a fairy tale. Do not laugh. He sometimes underestimates the guest’s popularity, says to belittle him, and then when the audience acts in shock, he quickly turns and starts to become a falling guy, the best example of this was when the star of "Life On Mars" John Came Simm and said how someone like you works to work with you everything is in order, but not with a Hollywood appearance (without turning I note that Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry were in the green room, he really only tried to suck up to them earlier (they were even on the couch). When the audience was shocked, Ross quickly said: “What, I am a little puzzled by the fact that I wear this corset, I do not know what I am saying.” If he doesn’t have low forms of television life, he simply digs up four gays on the piano with jokes more outdated than his fashion. <br /> <br /> This is a very different story when a Hollywood actor or a big TV star appears in the series, he will tell them stories to amuse them. When an actor explains that he was in a support group, then Jonathon Ross would say something like, “Wow, well, whenever I go, I would look at the group in which I tried to get interested in the support group so that they felt as if they were being searched for "" with an underlined message "please, like me, I was probably one of those who encouraged you when you were in your group." End this with an audience of Ross fans who are so enthusiastic about every old bad joke and bulling what it really does for a bad sho w. <br /> <br /> You'd better watch American chats instead, they are more scripted, but not somewhere close, how difficult it is to watch.
