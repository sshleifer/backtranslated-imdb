Two little girls make friendship. One tries to convince the other that she is a witch. The other is a weakling who leans towards the will of the witch. From time to time, the film stretches with meaningless interaction between two little girls, and many are dramatically cut off when they ask "shocking" questions. You know, good cute little children should not ask, for example: "How do you make a deal with the devil"? Oooh ... creepy. <br /> <br /> In the end, the kid was tired of being controlled by her witch. Her belief that her friend is a witch leads to a tragic end. But by the time he comes, you will not care. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that this film could be intimidating for the very religious Mexican moviegoer of the 1960s, but it does not even stand a charming relic. It just drags on. It's boring. It's pointless. You can not watch him. <br /> <br /> Many here can say a lot of good things about him, based on their knowledge of other works of the director and, of course, on a common denominator that everyone says. about meaningless films: “Ah, the cinematography is beautiful!” Those reviewers probably have a point. But for those who have found this film without any prior knowledge, who do not care about his “photo”, his “atmosphere” or his ... all that he has is for these viewers who just want * A good * movie that will entertain them for an hour and a half, do yourself a favor, guys: <br /> <br /> Skip it.
