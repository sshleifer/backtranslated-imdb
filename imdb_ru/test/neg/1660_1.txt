Have you ever thought how after watching a horror movie with a group of friends: “Wow, this is so cool! We need to make a horror movie ourselves in the near future. I bet it's not as hard as it sounds "? Well, that must have been what came to mind to the young Campbell brothers in 2003, apparently immediately after seeing Sam Reimi's “Dead Man” or similar independent horror classics. This “demon summer”, however, is so bad that it confuses! These young amateur directors obviously worship the horror genre and know their classics, but this hardly makes them talented. I have seen quite a few lousy B-films in my years as a horror fanatic, but this, to be honest, is considered one of the biggest pieces of shit ever made. And it’s very sad to be so open, because the whole cast and crew obviously had good intentions. There is practically no script at all. A duet of thugs simply steals a mysterious book from the ass and, reading some excerpts from it, one of them turns into a disgusting demon who begins to kill members of all different groups of teenagers: idiots, hot Catholic girls, stoners and troublemakers. That's all, except, of course, all the obligatory cliches, such as a hot girl, in love with the biggest moron, etc. And so on. D. It’s really painful to listen to speeches, and none of these pesky teenagers use facial expressions! They just stand there motionless until the script says their turn to interact. I hate this! Some of the makeup effects are distantly decent, but still not spectacular, and the soundtrack contains some of the most awesome punk songs ever. This film should never have been released ... I can imagine that being part of the production should be fun, but it is completely insane and does not have the slightest redemptive element. Even fucking nudity, damn it!
