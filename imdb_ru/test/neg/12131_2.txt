Waters’s contribution to the world of cinema should be sought with a telescope, and then when / if something is discovered (by chance and luck), it should be analyzed with a microscope. <br /> <br /> And after it was analyzed, it was thrown into the lab's “trash” for absolutely useless things. One atom of this microscope is worth all of his films combined. <br /> <br /> CB is very kind, and intentionally so. The usual stuff for JW: comic book dialogs, simplified plot, debility funny characters, chewing gum popularity, replaying, etc. Waters knows that he is not able to make a high-quality film, so he hides behind the mask of "deliberately cheesy movie" - which supposedly makes him a special kind of “anti-artist.” But in the world of cinema, anti-talent is often mistaken for talent, and this is exactly what Waters had hoped for - and eventually got it.This is fraud. art; it's a plague. <br /> < br /> Perhaps we are to blame for the fact that John Waters inspired Baz Luhrmann to create all these terrible, stupid turkeys. It looks like a virus: one Waters creates five new bad directors, and then each of these five creates more and so on. Where will it end? With the "Dancer in the Dark"? Could this bomb really be?
