I don't understand why everyone loves this film so much. True, he has good intentions and sense, but you cannot compensate for such a bad scenario. Woody Allen is a great director, but I'm afraid this is just a piece of trash. It is extremely predictable, and the subject is too visible. I'm a big fan of Woody Allan and I love most of his work, but I can't recommend it.
