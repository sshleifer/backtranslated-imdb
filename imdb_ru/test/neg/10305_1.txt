The first season was great - a good mix of work with my brother and friends at home. actually it was a pretty funny show. <br /> <br /> Now it appears again, and brother and two hot chicks disappear - and it all revolves around the airline. Even the old man, the manager of the company, was wrecked - too much, where it used to be beautiful. <br /> <br /> This and no more than Sarah Mason is one of the most beautiful girls in Hollywood. /> <br /> This is what happens when you let some managers get hold of the show. You can almost see the meeting: “The old man is funny, let's focus on him, tell him everything about the airline and tell about the airline ... it will be a crazy office version!” Anyway, there are no hot chickens, no hours.
