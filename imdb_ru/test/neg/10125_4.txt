I enjoyed the prequels and found the relationship between Tucker and Chan earlier fun. RH3, however, was a rethinking of the first two without charm or humor. I think I might have laughed once - and that was during the NG. Tucker was extremely annoying in this film, and his character seemed to have no purpose but to confuse everything in the most annoying way. Chan is always cute, but he seemed tired in this film. I was able to predict EVERYTHING - who was the villain, who was this girl (SPOILER ALERT), who was the good guy who became the bad guy, etc. I hope to see more films from Tucker and Chan in their individual endeavors, but not in the sequels Rush Hour. Just too tired. I recommend hire, but not a purchase.
