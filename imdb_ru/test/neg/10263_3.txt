Films use blue-black and bright skin tones to give this film a special style, unfortunately, do not work. In fact, this is quite annoying, as it obscures the characters of the demon and reduces them to one-dimensional creatures. <br /> <br /> At least the original had hysterical energy, and the blood suites were pretty overwhelming. Black blood hardly frightens, and the main demon woman does not frighten at all in her attempts to roar and growl on the screen in her best camp style of Lugosi. <br /> <br /> The narrative is very disconnected, and if you could imagine The Naked Lunch by director Russ Meyer, you can appreciate the attempt to become William Burrows. Otherwise, give this film a wide girth. The fans of Bava and Argento are again bitterly disappointed.
