Admittedly, I watched the MST3K version of this, but in fact it’s not that bad, at least compared to others that deserve my cinematic hate. <br /> <br /> The story tells about a restless girl, mistakenly sent to the “reform” school “City of Girls”. Along the way there are races, ransom and delirium (unintentional). The story and the action are a bit flat, as is the action. However, all this is actually interesting to some extent, if you are absolutely bored. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is just a film shot under sub-paragraph 50, but far from the worst film ever made, with some bright spots on the film (the episode “Ave Maria” was good for me ). <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see the version of MST3K, you will not be disappointed. In itself, not so much, but I can think about the worst methods of torture (anyone "Spiker"?).
