The most hardcore lover of bad movies will be surprised by the general ineptitude of this film. Mary Voronov, the smart actress best known for her roles as Mary Bland in the movie “Raul's Food” and “Miss Togar” in rock and roll school, is by far the best thing about this prank. This movie is almost too bad even for MST3K - honest!
