Perhaps I expected too much from this film, but at least the comedy should be funny, and there are very few funny moments in it. He manages to insult homosexuals, heterosexuals, women, obese people and possibly several other groups. The graduation scene, where _everyone_ claims to be gay, is one of the most unpleasant I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Tom Selleck and Matt Dillon are ridiculously mistaken, and Kevin Klein seems confused most of the time. > <br /> Other reviewers compare the film with Will and Grace, but at least Will and Grace _is_ is ridiculous.
