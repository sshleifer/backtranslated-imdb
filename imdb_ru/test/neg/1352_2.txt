To say that I was disappointed is an understatement. Amateur film made by professionals. I was going to leave the theater two or three times (which I never did), I was really stopped by Cloris Lichman. It rings true, the only thing I have to say. These new women are less modern than the women of George Cukor of the 1930s. They “act” for us, trying to be with him, but their “conflict” is exactly the same as always, in the cinema, in any case. The fun of the original was based on a clear, violent and very funny script. Master direction and unique cast. All items that are missing here. Television actresses mingle with models and Oscar nominees / winners. There was nothing organic about it. It all looked like donning, improvisation at the moment without a clear goal. 2/10
