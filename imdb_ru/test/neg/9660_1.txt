In case the title is not issued - this film is rubbish. <br /> <br /> Overview? Yes. <br /> <br /> I decided to spend as much time writing this review as Hollywood probably decided to include in the script. I doubt that it will be published, considering how badly I formulated everything, but if this is so, and someone will read it - continue to cherish the first Sandlot film. It completely surpasses its predecessors in all respects. Sequels are never worth buying or watching, and everyone who creates them should be ashamed of having spoiled what should be one of the most classic, original films of our childhood.
