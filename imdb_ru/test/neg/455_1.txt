Not surprisingly, except for how quickly ABC responded to the gloomy ratings. According to published reports (“Diversity”), the show received the worst scores in the history of the ABC television company. <br /> <br /> And I quote: the ABC "The One" musical talent competition opened on Tuesday evening to cancel the ratings now. <br /> <br /> The article further states that the series received "a shockingly low 1.1 / 3 rating among adults 18-49 and 3.08 million viewers in general." <br /> <br /> This makes it the weakest premiere for any reality show on any network, as well as below all serial bows in ABC history. <br /> <br /> From the very first moment I saw commercials for this, I knew that it would fail. We don't need another American Idol clone. But ABC should have given this show a fair chance of success.
