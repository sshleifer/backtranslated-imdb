Sorry, but I usually love French thrillers - for example, Chabrol - but it was a glossy shambolic mess. The fact that it was based on Harlan Cohen’s book says because, instead of being a French film (strong on psychology and character), it is more like John Grisham-Esquire's roller coaster of numbers with ridiculous plot twists, memories that update previous memories, predictable villain (as soon as his name is mentioned, you think “hm, he will be a bad guy!”) and sets of mysterious stereotypical characters that seem to inhabit different films. By the end, I laughed hysterically at the uneven tone of the film (scenes where the hero is assisted by two shady street characters, unintentionally funny), completely incomprehensible plot, absurd coincidences and good luck luck (for example, guessing). password for the email account) And yawning uncontrollably (I thought that I must have misread 1 hour and 50 minutes, as it seemed to last for 3 hours and 50 minutes).
