The most impressive in “Anemic Cinema” is its name: an anagram, which is also almost a palindrome. Unfortunately, it only works in American English, since in the UK “anemia” is spelled differently. <br /> <br /> I have always found the amateur Man Ray and his artistic efforts very pretentious, and I never Understand why his work attracts so much attention. Besides his Rayographs (which he invented by chance, and which are simply direct photographs of print), his real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to portray female nudity in a way that was rather accepted as art like porn. But, of course, this should have happened in the end, and there is no real reason why Ray deserves praise. A critical reaction to Maine Ray reminds me of a story about the Emperor's new clothes. <br /> <br /> Back in the early 1960s, the second season of the Twilight Zone opened each episode with a round of concentric circles. In black and white. In “Anemic Cinema” there is an image that is very similar, interesting, “Twilight Zone” borrowed it from this film. The main difference is that the rotating image here is a black and white spiral. Indeed, if there ever was any film that deserves to be called a spiral, then this is it. Throughout the “Cinematic Cinema” we (?) Addressed images of a rotating disk containing words (in French) moving in a spiral. The effect is dizzying, and the texts — about incest and Eskimos — are almost dada in their meaninglessness. I laughed at one clever sex pun. <br /> <br /> The emperor is naked, guys, and this film barely scores 2 points out of 10. Au suivant!
