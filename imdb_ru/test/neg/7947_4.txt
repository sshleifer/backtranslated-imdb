I’m sure many guys will like this movie. The only woman who shows any "eggs" (regret for the unsuccessful pun) makes you look, speak and seem like a guy, the other two women are portrayed as either sexual objects with one thing on their mind - sex / be sex sex as their only attribute skill (iris) —or like scared cute little princesses, whose neurosis negates any strength and professional authority that they had before all hell broke (Doc). The only power that Iris has in the end is the result of some advice from a big strong man. In addition to my negative reaction to the intestines as feminists, I have to give support to the photographic equipment - and Ethan Hawke is great in the very first scene. After that, his performance is losing momentum. Empty entertainment for the brain that wants to calm down. At least the film removes the theme of good / bad duality in the criminal mind.
