It does not need balls to make fun of backward people. Listening to Mencia’s insistence that he dared to joke with “mental retardation” is unbearable. In addition, it does not take balls to bite off the show chapel. Racial game shows, racial olympic games, it seems that many parodies are simply reworked parodies at the Chapelle Show, which are simply less fun. <br /> <br /> But the most tedious thing about the show is his perseverance in that he just comes under the blow of his own drum, when he actually comes under the blow of many recycled, reloaded drums that was many times. <br /> <br /> I hate this show. I hate that it sounds like a voice for Latin America. <br /> <br /> And no, Carlos, I'm not trying to censor you. If people like it, continue. But I personally think that this is a bad show.
