Klutzi young man returns to the west after studying in the hotel business through Boston; he quickly learns that his friends in old Spanish colonized California expect him instead to fill the shoes of his late father, a romantic thief known for kissing his female victims after robbing them. The colorful, but stupid production of the M-G-M has a huge talent in front of the camera and behind it, but it never takes off. This could be a fun, secondary material for Abbott & Costello, but Frank Sinatra looks confused and confused about the leaders. The combination of hoarse comedy and musical interludes is made difficult by poor performance (Sinatra is photographed when she sings at one point in the mirror, but the person is not so much concentrating on her performance as she notices how strangely the star reflects in this way!) who falls in love with Frank, and her high touching soprano turns her singing scenes into self-parody. In addition to the cinematography of Robert Surtis and a decent artistic direction, this “Bandit” remains without a kiss. * from ****
