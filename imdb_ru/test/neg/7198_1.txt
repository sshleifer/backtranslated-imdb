This is one of the films that killed western spaghetti. It’s not only losing something in translation, it’s also a chaotic editing mess. Either its fragments have been edited and edited for the English version. In any case, it makes little or no sense, period. Because of this, Trinity and Eastwood films Man Without a Name look like John Ford / John Wayne. Nothing in this film is original. Somewhere there is a beginning, a middle and (finally) an end. Except for the end, not everything is exactly in that order. Robert Wood seems quite personable. The rest of the actors, especially women, should have made a better career choice.
