What a waste. John Travolta and Scarlett Johansen deserved better than this. To start from the beginning, JT was horribly mistaken to lead here. The role demanded someone who could convince himself as a broken anti-hero, someone who could look persecuted and defeated. Billy Bob Thornton could have met all the requirements, or even Al Pacino, but JT is just too alive and looks too cheerful. In addition, of course, someone who went through the mill to the extent of a JT character would experience some physical effects? The character presented to the audience looked as if he could begin as a tight end for the Oakland Raiders. Scarlett released a slightly better role. Where was the pain and conflict of what should surely have been developmental? As for the “plot” ... well, none of this makes sense. The characters jump from one mood to another, seemingly for no reason - and, of course, without explaining the reasons. The pace of the film also leaves much to be desired, namely the pace. This is a very slow movie, I have nothing against slow movies while they are moving somewhere. The pace is gaining momentum just to the very end, when it moves from a slow motion to a mad race to fill as many tired cliches as possible. In this he succeeds - the only thing missing is something associated with a small dog. 3 out of 10 for this is purely for the performance of Gabriel Macht - he was the only member of the cast who was a) well-played and b) able to convince in his role In general, terrible disappointment and real waste of a couple of hours.
