This film was one of those films where he completely deceived me, making me think that it was a frank flick of the 80s, based on the cover, but it is not. Quite possibly, it was one of the worst slashers I've ever seen. The image on the cover did not correspond to any part or scene in the film; in fact it is not related to the chainsaw. Even the label does not fit the film. The film tells about a group of fans and two tadpoles who flee to a deserted hut in a cold forest for the weekend. However, things get colder when they start to be killed by an unknown killer. At the same time, the local sheriff’s department is tracking down a dangerous killer. I will name the problems in the list. <br /> <br /> 1. Actions. The boy was cheap and terribly bad. It was unnatural, and it seemed like it was very scripted. None of the actors looked as if they were trying to play with good intentions, and so they seemed stupid and tired. All the characters in the film played poorly, so I will not indicate specific people, but I want to say that the stoners did a terrible job, as well as the police and support group, which is not surprising. br /> <br /> 2. The plot. This story created the perfect storyline for a good old fashion film, but instead they filled it with plot holes, useless and unnecessary scenes, and a common silly background to the killer's intentions. There were serious holes in the plot, including how the killer so quickly killed the last victim, and yet remained there in the group of girls when it happened? The ex-scammer in the film had almost no sense, except for a useless plot. There was random and unnecessary sex and nudity scattered over it, even for a bi-movie or, for my taste, it was too much. As for the killer's intentions, let's just say that it was stupid and there is no point why she / he kills young girls. In addition, there were very predictable killings, which I saw at a distance of about 30 miles. <br /> <br /> 3. Technical side. The lighting was fine, it was certainly not worse than the lighting I saw in the film, but there were points where it was supposed to be dark, but it was more like midday. The house seemed darker with the lights on, then with the lights off. The filming was average, she didn’t have good shots, amazing panning and zooming, but she did her job - created some uncertainty with framing. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was a sense of plot, character development, and performance that was a huge disappointment and a waste of my time. What I thought would be a big flick of a slasher turned out to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting was really bad and wooden, there was almost no meaning in the plot, and there was no emotion in this film. However, the technical aspect of this film saved it for me, because if the camera was working or the lighting was bad, I would turn off the DVD player and turn on something else. I would recommend this film to those who love really stupid bi-films, as well as those who follow the cult classic, because this film is definitely there. I would partially recommend this movie for those who love the slasher of the 80s. But for me this film was miserable and terrible.
