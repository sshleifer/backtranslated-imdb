What a boring movie. While this had really humorous parts, it was just boring and long (for a 90-minute movie). I believe that the reason was the lack of action. <br /> <br /> When I rented this film, I expected to see how white blood cells fight off evil viruses, but no luck. The point is rather that the virus was broken, than defeated. <br /> <br /> The film promised, but since it was created for little children, in my opinion, it did not justify its potential.
