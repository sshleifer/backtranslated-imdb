Did bevis and butthead make this movie? This is just so bad. A truly uneven and unfair image of the "bad" and "good" in the wine world. You noticed that the director tried some of the guilt shown by the advocates of individual wines and terroir. The camera work is dizzying at best, while the content may put you to sleep soon. This is not insightful journalism. What I got from this film is that the director tried his best to emphasize the global nature of wine, for example, showing that the Mondavi family owned wineries in all parts of the world. Well, this is a good start. So how are these wines compared? Is the cabin Mondavi Napa taste of their Italian wines. We will never know, because no one in the film comments on this. Instead, there are many hints of Nazism and fascism. Well, these things do not grow grapes. Hmmm
