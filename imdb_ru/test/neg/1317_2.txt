Oh, but it's sad. One good actor after another turns into a deplorable dialogue in an indecisive way into what must have been an incredibly pedestrian direction to be considered acceptable. I like Robert Carlisle, and Joan Walley is one of my favorite actresses, Tom Courtney can play well when she is pushed, and David Suchet is the highest level professional, but they all roll like fish in a barrel with watery gin. I swear, Courtney was drunk on painkillers or on both. <br /> <br /> Was there a good overall performance? Well, yes, David Hood, as a junior underground engineer, whose partner was washed away, looked as if he took it seriously and believed in him; it cannot be easy when, so to say, “everyone loses their own,” or maybe his scenes were led by an assistant director (if there was one), I just don’t know what these people did in the film that was so poor (besides paying the bills, obviously), I can’t start talking about how disappointed I am in them . YOU MUST FAST ON YOURSELF! <br /> <br /> Any positive side other than David Hood, the third ... yes. Aerial photographs of London, mostly flooded, were very well made, and responsible artists deserved it better than their beautiful work was emphasized by such a shallow story, if you will forgive the expression, because the few people who see it will do it on a much smaller screen. than there would be for a better advantage. <br /> <br /> What's going on here? why British filmmakers try to imitate such impersonal, spectacular boulevard-level genres, like a film about a catastrophe, and then make it worse than Americans. Sandy realism, integrity of character, capture of real emotions in a way that makes you feel and take care ... Family path, Spring and Port wine, Get Carter, Long Good Friday, Trainspotting .... Don't get me wrong, I like a little escapist hock. This "Italian Work", "The Adventures of Tom Jones"; but the fact that this should come to this, there was a more realistic drama in Carry On Camping.
