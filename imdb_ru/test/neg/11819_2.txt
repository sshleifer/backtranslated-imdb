And you would be right. “Black Mom,” “White Mom,” also known as “Women in Chains,” is precisely that cheesy and cheesy bi-film that offers the premise. Pam Greer was thrown into prison on a small island with many other women, and this place seriously turns the summer camp, where Martha Stewart is currently locked, into a high-security prison. Less than five minutes later, as one of the guards beauties uttered the phrase "Undress them and get wet", and then we get acquainted with prison life, which resembles some freshman's fantasies about what's inside the house of the women's society. <br /> <br /> The prisoners washed, rubbed and fought with each other in the shower, as if it were a hunt for girls, and then they all hung out in the dormitory, openly smoked a pot and discussed in a large group what would be the best way to escape . I have never been in prison, but I have a feeling that escape plans are the thing that you want to know as few people as possible, about prisoners, guards, or something else. The biggest difference between this prison life and some kind of fantasy life of the female society is that all women in this film wear orange cardigans (not pants. Go figure) with the word “TYUR” on the back. These must be ordinary prison outfits for prisons that cannot afford expensive accessories, such as their prison name or prisoner numbers for their uniforms. <br /> <br /> And, as you would expect, a prison that you cannot afford to imprison. Obviously, when identifying prisoners on the back of a uniform, it will not be possible to find guards who are interested in guarding prisoners just as they have sex with prisoners and with each other. <br /> <br /> Conflict The name of the film refers to the fact that Lee Daniels (Pam Greer) spends most of his time in handcuffs with a blond prisoner named Karen, because they run away from the police after escaping from prison. I will not go into details about how they run away, except to say that you could see something like this in "The Fugitive", if they could not afford to arrange a train wreck, and this leads to a confusing story about the conflict interests also pursuing these two women for different reasons. Karen and Lee have their own gangs of people, each of whom hopes to save his escaped prisoner, and the police are always looking for both. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) So Karen is associated with a bunch of hippies who want to revolutionize life as they know it. Meanwhile, Karen just wants to leave the island, which she tried to do for years, and isn't it just perfect that they all need to go to completely opposite sides of the island in order to achieve their goals. Thus, we get this strange couple, and since they are a strange couple, it is not difficult to predict that they will hate each other in the vast majority of films, but will love each other by the end. <br /> <br /> In a film with so many conflicting interests, especially when these conflicting interests not only push the two main characters in opposite directions when they pursue their goals, it is quite reasonable to expect that a critical moment involving competing gangs in some point in the movie. Not going to leave anyone unsatisfied, they throw a stupid standoff gang at the end of the film, where everyone shoots each other with machine guns, killing each other en masse, while the two women calmly and calmly cross the river in a small boat. Nice. <br /> <br /> Even better, at the end of the film, after a huge slaughterhouse in which many people shoot and spill bright red paint everywhere, the police captain looks over the masses of the dead. The criminals are covered with terrible, terrible special effects, and we learn that he will be a major until dinner. A good way to finish the movie, all the criminals kill each other, and the police get all the credit, but here's the last line in the movie ?? “It’s better to win, isn't it?” <br /> <br /> This is why the captain will be promoted to major? Because he understood it ???
