I had no idea that this film was produced by "WWE". The fight is lame enough. Why did they have to sully their name by making the movie as crappy as this one? I found this a complete disappointment. If I had known that this film would be as stupid as before, I would have stayed at home and started doing something more interesting. Of course, I will give them credit for cool effects; but the killer didn't seem as scary as it could be. He lacked many things. But I will let you specify them for yourself. The plot was a great idea, you could just make it a lot better. Perhaps in the future, WWE will continue its retarded struggle and remain outside the film industry.
