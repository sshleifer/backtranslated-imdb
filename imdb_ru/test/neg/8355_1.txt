This film is just as bad as Alcatraz's Lamb House. I do not mean acting, but the assumption that both films are trying to portray psychopathic criminals as heroic characters. It also worries me when such respected actors as Alan Alda (and Bert Lancaster) are so respected because their status increases the credibility of the directorâ€™s intentions to raise the theme of the film, a social outcast. > In the last years of Caril Chessman's life, I was in high school, and his calls for the death penalty and books were in the news. I remember the rationale that the death penalty was wrong, and the Chessman was the victim. <br /> <br /> Take the people into your own hands. Read the story. The chess player was a criminal and sexual predator. At night, he drove through the streets of Los Angeles with a stolen police lantern in his car. He stopped cars with attractive women inside under the trick of retaining traffic; then they abducted and raped women. Rape is the worst trauma a woman can experience, and many victims say they would prefer death to her horror and humiliation. <br /> <br /> A chess player got exactly what he deserved, just a decade passed. No sympathy for the devil here.
