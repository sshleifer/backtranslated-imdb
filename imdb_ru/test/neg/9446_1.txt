I never comment on the film, but I must say that it was one of the worst films I have ever seen. I feel that this was done by an aspiring filmmaker, and not to overwhelm talented filmmakers, but it was awful! I didnâ€™t buy the lead actress and felt that I was with her in the acting class while she was shooting. Her decisions were very safe, and I feel that she is imitating other actresses in films, and does not act and makes her own decisions. The direction was very confusing, and the sound was louder than the actors themselves. The end might have made a little more sense if someone was telling the events, not a song. I love Patsy Kline, but her songs appear in films quite often. Perhaps the choice of a song might be a bit more original. The song "crazy" was such a cliche. As I said, I never comment on films and see my share of good and bad, but it was the worst. Sorry.
