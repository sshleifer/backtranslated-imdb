Once again, not quite bad enough to make it enjoyable. In fact, it's just boring. It's pretty well done, although the script is bad, the effects are ok and mean. (Except for James Mason, who is always great, but is not used enough) <br /> <br /> I suppose it’s hard to write something about this film because it didn’t cause me any reaction than ever. br /> <br /> Dull, boring, boring, boring, boring.
