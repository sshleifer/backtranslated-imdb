what happened to matthew modin's career ??? I can still remember when he was considered an actor of the “List” ... <br /> <br /> It was a merciless island - the last nail in the coffin of a once promising career ??? wow, this guy must really hate Renny Harlin's courage ... <br /> <br /> This film really wants to be a comedy, but does not laugh, the characters are caricatured and badly drawn ... but still it’s the most bothering me that Mr. Modin plays on such roles, alongside the actors so far from his caliber, I mean while he was making films like BIRDIE, which he could never in his worst nightmares Imagine that in In the future, he will be filming a movie with a mob of a cow that just had an anus attached, and maybe Even worse, next to Elizabeth Berkley !!!
