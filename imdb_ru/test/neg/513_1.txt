Don Wilson stars in the role of Jack Cutter (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!) The hunter trembles for no reason during the combat sequences, and although this should emphasize the mood, it simply makes the film sharper. the fact that it preceded Blade, but the problem is that it was done with a small budget and that Don Wilson was in. This is from Roger Corman, and basically this turkey is a movie that most people would pay to NOT watch. I, unfortunately, am the bottom feeder, and I serve the section of the store looking for precious stones, in this work you always come across poop. With Night Hunter, I may have the most stinky poop in the world. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * of 4- (Awful)
