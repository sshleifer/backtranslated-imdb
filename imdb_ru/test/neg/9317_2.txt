Help! Once again, Paul Schrader sabotaged his own intentions by boring, pedantic storytelling. I moved my vacation to see this “world premiere”. What mistake! Why did Schrader even want to make an exorcist film? Noble intentions are good, but if I wanted 2 hours of theological chatter, I would attend my nephew’s Sunday school. The struggle of Father Merrin with his faith, presented in his early years, is a potentially interesting subject. But the film "The Exorcist" needs more! Relentlessly addictive presentation, along with funny special effects, creates a strange statement. Who is this movie for? I did not bother to see the version of Harlin, but at least they, apparently, tried to deliver some intuitive sensations. <br /> <br /> The Exorcist series was rather strange. The first film was excellent, but each sequel was unloved and meaningless. Why do they keep doing them? I believe Schröder did it so that he could get a lot of money. But why should we go?
