This film was very frustrating. Everything seemed energetic, and I was completely ready to have a good time. I, at least, thought I could stand it. But I was wrong. First, a strange cycle? It was like watching “America’s Most Funny Home Video.” Damn parents. I hated them so much. Stereotypical Latinos family? I need to talk to the person responsible for this. We need to talk. That little girl who was always on someone? I just hated her and had to mention it. Now the final scene goes beyond, I have to say. This is so brilliantly bad and full of evil that it is your own movie. What a crappy dance. Awful and beautiful at the same time.
