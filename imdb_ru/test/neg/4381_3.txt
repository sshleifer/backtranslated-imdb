“Hero and Terror” is a rather boring thriller - a la: there is no real essence of the character, a predictable plot and ... boring. For a thriller, I discovered that this film is slowly running to its pitiful climax, as it simply stretched forward until the child of Chuck's wife was born ... and then it stretches from there until it reaches the end - which I barely remember Already, although I I saw the movie only 10 minutes ago. <br /> <br /> I give this film 3 out of 10 - the first 10-20 minutes.
