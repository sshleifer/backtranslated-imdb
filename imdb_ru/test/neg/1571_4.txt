The film was disappointing. I saw it on Broadway with Bernadette Peters, and she was outstanding. Perhaps when she finishes her musical career herself, her state of despair puts her in a position in which she parades, reinvents and conquers as her own. The singing of Bette is always belted, always even and devoid of the ability to show herself as an actress. To be interesting, this performance yearned for a stronger leadership and a stronger cast, so that others would remain unforgettable in the absence of Bett. Another criticism: she smiles straight into the camera every time she starts singing! I know that this is a musical theater, but please leave some grace - Middler cannot act like Lisa or Streisand, in a retrospective tour - out of character and out of context.
