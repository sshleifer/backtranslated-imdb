Isaac of Florence took off some of the best fighters of Western martial arts. In particular, the US Seals 2, Cold Harvest, Special Forces and Undisputed 2 are all classic action. You can say that Isaac has a real passion for the genre, and his films are always eventful, creative and poignant, with some of the best fighting episodes that a militant fan can count on. In particular, he found a muse with Scott Adkins, such a talented actor and fighter that we can only dream of. This is confirmed by the "Special Forces" and "Indisputable 2", but, unfortunately, the Shepherd simply does not justify their abilities. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that JCVD ​​looks better in battle than he did in years, especially in the scuffle he spent (mostly without a reason) in the prison cell and in the final fight with Scott, but look into his eyes. JCVD seems dead inside. There is nothing in his eyes. As if he just does not worry about anything throughout the film. And this is the leading person. <br /> <br /> There are other tricky aspects in the film, both in the script and in the visual, but the main problem is that you are completely unable to empathize with the hero of the film. As a shame, as far as I know, we all wanted this film to be as special as it could be. There are a few good points, mostly the militants themselves. In this film there was a terrific director and an action movie, as well as a terrific opponent of JCVD, who was supposed to fight. This could be what brought the action movie star back to zero in the number of action movies. <br /> <br /> It is sincerely sad that this did not happen.
