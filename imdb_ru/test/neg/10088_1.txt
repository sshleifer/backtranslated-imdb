It was terribly simple and clear. What was their message? Where did the film go with this? It has all the components of a movie class below B. From a storyline without a plot is a bad game to slow cinematography. I would rather watch a film that I have already seen, like Goodfellas, Bronx Fairy Tale, even Lubricant. NO cute characters. In the end, you just want everyone to die. Save 2 hours of your life and miss it.
