Director Michael Richie and the second documentary drama of the actor Robert Redford “The Candidate” is a political satire that still seems fresh and relevant. So it is a pity that the 'Downhill Racer', made shortly before this, seems so outdated in contrast. The music is ugly, and perhaps innovative skiing sequences are now standard in the television coverage of the sport. The world of skiing seems strangely amateurish (probably, given the time when the film was made, but this is difficult to relate to today's professional world), and the theme of Americans in Europe also seems obscene in an era of increasingly easy travel. Perhaps the biggest problem is a flat plot focused on an arrogant but mysterious hero; unfortunately, this is a dreary representation of Redford, giving us a little insight into his worries or motives. And a movie driven by a character without a special character will never be a good bet. I expected a lot, but unfortunately it is a boring movie.
