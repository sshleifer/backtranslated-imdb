I do not understand people here. The film is not as good as bad as some say here. With the exception of De Coc, the acting is fine. The problem with the movie is basically the script. Characters are not believable. Sex is well done, but the psychology behind people has very little meaning. The film does not look very good, but what do you expect? The film was shot for very little money on video. Of course, it doesnâ€™t look as good as a regular movie! I agree that the music is bad. Sounds like a cheap soft erotic film of the 80s. The film is not very good, good, but you have to give credit for pulling it without money.
