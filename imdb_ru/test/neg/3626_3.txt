Well, folks, I have to agree with almost all the reviews here. Characters Are. Stupid. They are ALL stereotypical, but they have beautiful clothes and are always thin. <br /> <br /> Don't even start me with the role of Jamie Lynn as ZOEY. Zoey is a cute, popular, tanned, young blonde who all LOVE! She has a “rebellious”, great personality, with which everyone agrees, no matter how stupid or extreme she is. Most annoying: her voice is so damn playful and unpleasant. “My God!” <br /> <br /> Take, for example, the first episode. The moment she steps into the huge PCA campus, everyone seems to love her. The boys want to invite her on a date, the girls want to be her friend, and so on. Thinking that she has it all, the episode ends when Zoe is always in the spotlight; She is the so-called best player of the unofficial women's basketball team, self-confident, and everybody feels sorry for her when she is poorly beaten in the face. Oh my God! <br /> <br /> My favorite character at the moment is an entire series, this is a girl who appears much later in the series, Lauren or something like that, the ONLY person ever shown on the series who hates Zoe. <br /> <br /> And Zoe sometimes doesn't even seem to be faithful to her friends In one of the episodes, she even calls her friend a freak, never apologizing, and does not show the slightest regret at the same time. <br /> <br /> Zoe is ALWAYS the best: <br /> <br /> - Design professional t-shirts and backpacks (which are becoming popular) <br /> <br /> - come up with VERY complex patterns for YOURSELF to teach a lesson man <br /> <br /> - Impeccable ratings <br /> <br /> - To take the blame for things that were not even related to her, just so everyone can be happy. <br /> <br /> - Come up with an ad that was so good that it was shown on television. The list goes on and on ... Ugh. She has no acting talent. She is always the perfect person. She behaves snotty, rebellious, tidy and ... Ugh! I can't stand her. <br /> <br /> Not only that, but everyone on the show always has great clothes. EVEN SERIES! Her wardrobe is better than mine, and my pretty decent. <br /> <br /> Nobody cares if everyone in the PCA loves you, Zoe, and does something for you, even if it meant giving them the right hand. <br /> <br /> BUT, regardless of these cardboard characters, the plots are creative. Not everyday things. They are interesting and fun. Humor is usually good-natured and cheerful, but the characters are so paper that they are difficult to enjoy. <br /> <br /> This show would really be nice if Dan Schnyder spent a little more time thinking about the type of characters he wanted, because they are so typical, so boring that it is stupid and stupid. <br /> <br /> Meaning: No one is overweight, everyone has stylish clothes, Zoe is Mary Sue's definition, the plot lines are well thought out, and the humor is funny. But again, I want to emphasize that the characters spoil the show. Watch the show if necessary, but do not say that I did not warn you if your eyes start to bleed.
