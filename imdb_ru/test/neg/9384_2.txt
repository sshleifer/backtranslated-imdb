Talk about creepy. If you really want to sit down and watch this episode, where the girl who was later in Firefly is abducted, there is entertainment for you, but only if you like such things. I do not think that, frankly, this episode was terrible. Fortunately, this is one of the few Duff episodes in season 3, and the only episode of Charles Grant Craig, so you won't get anything like this in season 3. So, the general verdict? Just read the summary at the top. This is a strong challenger (Hell Money says hello!) For the worst episode of the third season. Honestly, I did not expect much. I wish Oubliette this episode at all. This one thing they got right: the name.
