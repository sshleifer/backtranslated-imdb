This is strange, this film; you have the impression that the creators of this replay spent more time in local bars than on the set. In fact, it is surprising not to see the name Harry Alan Towers on credits; He certainly has a taste for one of his projects aimed at protecting against taxes, but here the motivation of the project seems to be that all participants enjoy a long stay in Provence. Although the film should be shown throughout the region, Les Baux and its surroundings are almost everything. <br /> <br /> David Byrney is an incredibly colorless hero, as Michael Lonsdale says at some point, “you're a walking cliché.” What Lonsdale does in this, one can only guess. For some reason, the most interesting character played by Rampling was relegated to the background, whereas, regardless of the book, she had to be a central figure, because she clearly had the ability to carry the film (which would be boring anyway but at least we would have more on something beautiful to look at). <br /> <br /> In general, it is a meaningless business that only needs to be looked at to see what kind of action a militant could be.
