After placing the mummy in a local museum, cats are scanned, a metal object in his brain reacts negatively to the procedure, thus freeing the spirit or ghost of Belfegor's mummy, if you wish. Due to convenient circumstances, Liza, who lives next to the museum, is possessed by an evil spirit. Soon enough, she steals the Egyptian treasures of the museum from under their noses. Detective Verlak is retiring to catch a supernatural thief. <br /> <br /> This is fairly regular if you have not seen any other incarnations of Belfegor before. If you have one, I recommend skipping this particular version, since it cannot fail to turn pale compared to others, despite the good local people and the landscape. It plays like a (slightly) budget film Sci-Fi Original with a big budget, and I It really means a compliment. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Sophie Marceau shows the ass and side breast <br /> <br /> My rating: C- <br /> <br /> Additional characteristics DVD: no one
