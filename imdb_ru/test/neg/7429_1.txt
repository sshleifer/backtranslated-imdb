This will be my first IMDb review, and I am glad that the standard rating is 1 out of 10, because then I don’t need to change anything ... <br /> <br /> Horrible movies appear first. Movies you can make laughter from, for example, Island City, Battlefield Earth or Conan the Destroyer. This is completely acceptable. They make a great party party. Then there is the worst movie ever. I can't believe how crappy this steaming pile of dog shit was. <br /> <br /> I found it in a second-hand store on VHS and bought it quickly, because I like science fiction, Terminator, post-apocalypse, and more. like this. Everything on the art box was very promising. Then I quickly loaded the cassette when I returned home, and the first thing I noticed was ... WHAT? It was possible 10 minutes (or more) to switch between existing clips and memories in a very annoying blue effect with sounds that make you vomit. And it just goes on and on. Then some kind of "acting game" comes into play, and you wonder why you were ever born in a world where this abomination of humanity really exists ... And then I realized that in fact there are two preliminary requests. At first I did not think about it, but the title says "3" ... And I was terrified. But since I’m actually in great pain and agony, I’m watching it to the end, I thought that nothing could make me feel worse because of myself and this universe ... But then a little text appeared saying "..." Next ... "and ... NEMESIA 4?!?!?! NO PLEASE NO !!!!!!!!
