* spoiler, warning! * it just makes me feel the courage that some people have to remake (and I use the term loosely here) .. good films. In the American version of this Dutch thriller, someone decided that the original ending was not pasteurized enough for an American audience. So what do they do? they create a new one! stupid, unbelievable, i-pretend-i-dead-but-alive-again-such-good-guy-can-kick-my-ass-some more end. do yourself a favor and get the original.
