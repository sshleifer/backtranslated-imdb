Dreamland began to moderately interesting, but never went anywhere except in the city of Tedium. Low rents without the names of actors and ludicrous effects are not recommended for any reason. The best that can be said is that they seem to have actually shot it on a film set in the Nevada desert. That's all, I can not think of anything good, except this one about this abomination. It is assumed that the final will be a kind of revelation, but, like everything else, fails. Oh, I thought about another good moment with this cheese, it starts to work just over an hour, although its reception still does not work. When a girl starts walking in the desert at night, it seems she lasts forever and it only gets worse. Attempts of horror are not very effective. This story is an attempt to feel the style of the twilight zone, but it fails. Check out "Retroactive" for a good sci-fi B-film.
