The first half of this film was pretty good. It was interesting and intense. The second half was pretty bad. The story of comic book revenge has come full circle, and we see a lot of comic Nazi characters and some bad acting “good guys” who carry them away. There is a lot of violence in this movie. I'm not squeamish about violence, but I think it should have some sort of purpose in the film. Violence here had no particular purpose, apart from creating a genre film in which we see a multitude of people who are mowed with rifles. We must somehow be surprised by this. <br /> <br /> I recently watched Reservoir Dogs. There was a film where violence was used effectively. It was realistic in the world created by the film. There has never been an excessive sound effect. It was a crime film in which everything was clear. Inglorious bastards had to play straight, but did not. I rolled my eyes at how violence was exaggerated with sound effects and additional bullets in the head and face. <br /> <br /> None of the prehistories of any of the bastards are really explained, they are just Nazi hunters. We also do not like any of them, because they are too busy cutting scalps and shooting people in the face. It's all about “revenge” and much more. <br /> <br /> Two and a half hours worked here, but few of the bastards were really deeply studied. Looks like it was just a clean rematch. We saw this in Tarantino’s latest film, “Death Proof,” which is also not indifferent to me. He suffered the same problems. The characters were almost interchangeable. <br /> <br /> The first half was pretty good again. I wanted to see the exploits of inglorious bastards across Europe. They gave me a film with a much larger margin about the resistance movement, which is preparing to take revenge on some of the Nazi comics, when they all go to the same film premiere in France.
