"Oh, you pilots, such people." "They call it a cabin for a reason, dear." Such a dialogue is just one of many reasons why The Concorde ?? The airport was 79 years old (or, if you saw him in the UK, where he released heels, airport 80 years: Concord) was the last and certainly the smallest of the series. In the late 70s, a disaster film was hard: “Roy” offered a lot of unintended fun, and “The Adventures of Poseidon”, “Time is up” and “The City is on Fire” just offered a lot of boredom and despair to find a new twist in the genre . it's too obvious here. This time it's a conspiracy, when news presenter Susan Blakely discovers that billionaire fellow Robert Wagner is selling weapons to terrorists and North Vietnamese. Naturally, she decides to tell him everything, and not to publish the story, but he deceives her, explaining: “I am a very rich person. I have everything in life that I could ever want. Why would I risk it by doing something so incredibly stupid? In case she does not buy this line, instead of, say, hiring a killer to kill her on the ground, he decides to act rationally, planning to destroy Concord while she flies to Moscow through Paris. “I did a lot of things that I was ashamed of, but I’m not a killer,” he insists indignantly, trying to reprogram the guided missile to destroy the plane. So nothing incredibly stupid is there. And when this fails, he sends a fighter jet after him. And when this fails ?? <br /> <br /> Don't even think about looking for something like logic here: this is the real thing that is being attacked, which even the studio threw and sold as a comedy in the USA after the critics laughed at it from the screen. While the previous three entries looked like glossy high-budget entertainment, this small screen-friendly effort (the only thing that cannot be filmed at 2.35: 1 widescreen format) does not even allow Concorde to look good, which is a real feat. Television veteran David Lowell Rich apparently received a director's concert because he was fast, cheap, and had previously shot the SST television film: Disaster in the Sky, where Peter Graves' supersonic aircraft was unable to land due to sabotage and the Senegalese flu (which wasn’t was, at least, intentionally, a comedy, despite the presence of the young Billy Crystal in the cast), and it seemed the natural choice of what looks like a television film worth $ 14 million, which somehow hide I in theaters, when no one was looking. <br /> Cast, as in a bad episode in Hollywood Squares, this time there are very few stars, and most of the few vaguely familiar people seem to have been gathered in rehab clinics and ravaged sitcoms. Alain Delon makes a Hollywood career with one last shot as the pilot of the “Happy Fish” (do not ask). George Kennedy moves from the executive suite to the co-pilot seat in hopes of reminding people of other films, while the rest of the ensemble includes several Hell veterans in the sky (Wagner and Blakely), a soft porn star (Sylvia Kristel, trying to walk respectable) Ingmar Bergman is regular (Bibi Andersson and she plays prostitute alone!), David Warner's Navigator on a diet with nightmares about pursuing bananas, the Devil's voice (Mercedes McCambridge), Charo and her Chihuahua "Seeing Eye" ("Wrong bang "), Martha Ray and her weak bladder, Jimmy Walker plays the saxophone in her place and smokes weed in john (during those moments when Martha Ray did not take it), Cecily Tyson kisses her authority bye as an obligatory mother with seriously ill Eddie Albert, airline owner and trophy wife Sybil Dunning, who holds the best place in the house, Ed Begley Jr. in goggles, the Russian Olympic team and their cute trainer Val Avery and his deaf daughter (aaaaa!) during a good tour during and across the United States (who knew about the boycott? ). Just to add a bit of “Simpsons” to the hearings, Harry Shearer voiced one news report in the same tones that he later used for Smithers. <br /> <br /> Highlight? Despite the improvised wedding ceremony during an emergency landing, George Kennedy simply distracts the rocket, which is looking for heat, opening the window, putting out his hand (almost twice as fast as sound!) And firing the flash ?? until the plane is turned! And then Alain Delon turns off the engines so that there is no "heat source" for the missiles, on which it would be possible to detect ?? Yes, someone did get paid to write this and that someone was the future winner of Oscar and screenwriter of Munich and Insider Eric Roth (hey, everyone should start somewhere), although in his defense it was producer Jennings Lang, who came up with the plot. However, what do you expect from the film, which tells about the tricks with balloons and ends with a shot of "Concord", flying at sunset? Surprisingly, in one of those moments of defeat that the studios usually did not allow, Universal a few days later took another 20 minutes or so to include them on television television programs (not included in the DVD). Unfortunately, his box office failure led to the fifth entry in the series, a riot of laughter, which would have been "Airport 1984": a UFO, without taking off. Even more sincerely tragic that it was the Concord used in this film that crashed in France 21 years later. <br /> <br /> (Oh, and if you are wondering what the charo says to his chihuahua in unsigned Spanish, when is it not so? On board it is allowed: "What do you think? Do not worry. When the revolution comes, I promise you will fly on everything you want. I promise. What a shame, my love. What do they think? ”)
