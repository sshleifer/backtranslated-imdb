Why on the poster and illustrations it says “Clubbed is one of the best British indie films I've seen in a very long time. SCREEN INTERNATIONAL ”, when it was a quote from French International distributor REPORTED from Screen International (an influential film-selling publication). See www.screendaily.com/ScreenDailyArticle.aspx?intStoryID=39811 where it says: <br /> <br /> “Pretty Pictures” has acquired all the French-speaking rights to “Neil Thompson” in the club .... James Velez, president of Pretty Pictures, said: "Clubbed is one of the best British indie films I've seen in a very long time." <br /> <br /> Is this too misleading? Distributor must say that it is good. Are the rest of the quotes real?
