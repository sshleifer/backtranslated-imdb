I am surprised that so many comments on this film are positive. After reading the book several times (and all the other historical novels of Micah Valtari), it is impossible to say anything good in this film. If I forget the origin of the story, I could consider it a pretty good epic. Of course, to bring such a piece of the book to the big screen is a task that cannot be envied, but this can be done with the help of the class. I can not understand why even the name Nefernefernefer had to be shortened to just Nefer. I love Peter Ustinov, because Kapta and Marlon Brando would probably have done a better sinuha, but the general attitude is too Hollywood to judge a book ever. Keep in mind, Mika Waltari left the premiere of this film in the middle of the show. That's how he liked it.
