Wow, I was very disappointed. I was not going to watch this film in the theater, and I would like to stick to this plan. It really should be a movie for television. I was kind of excited to see this, since I am a big fan of Fairuza Balk, but this film did not justify it. In fact, I am a little disappointed with the actions around. What a terrible cover for Fairuza Balk's tattoos that bothered me every time I saw her shoulder. <br /> <br /> There was no flow to the film, it was very difficult to get into it. In one scene, we get angry, spin up, we need blood, waiting increases, and then the director takes us to another scene to show love between Annie and Bobby. It would have been more pleasant to follow him if he were broken up into three sectional paper comics on Sundays. <br /> <br /> There was also little logic behind the characters chosen to perform certain roles. The gangster leaders were skinny guys, not very believable. Matt Dillon, head of a gangster organization? Come on, give me a break. There was simply no intimidation. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack .. wow. I think this is one of the worst musical scores I've ever heard. What horrible guitar solos, my god. I am sure that the sound of my teeth was more pleasant for my friends. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I would like to make one positive comment about the film. The settings were well made. I liked the colors, the good work conveying this period of time.
