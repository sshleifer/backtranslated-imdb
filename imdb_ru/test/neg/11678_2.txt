The film uses random events of historical significance as a background and, willy-nilly, crosses the lives and time frames of its three central characters. What is the purpose of asking? The problem with this film is that the script becomes a “story” and not characters or their lives. <br /> <br /> It begins with a group of rich, aimless college students (and the couples are not very rich too) drawn into the Naxalite movement. Case, failure and separation follows. People go their own way, it would seem. Only as long as the heroine is not imposed on them. Not once, but twice. After a pause in the “Movement”, the next obstacle for these three is the emergency situation imposed on the country by Indira Gandhi. Many politicians roam for no apparent reason. Plots are too contrived and do not add up to make a logical whole. <br /> <br /> The film tries to impose a false tempo, but never reaches the true rhythm. Barely connected at times, in the arcs of the three former friends there is no maturation and growth at all. Even after they seem to be married, engaged, settled, or something else, they always too much want to just drop it all and go to the village to have sex with a former lover or a former flame. What kind of fertile imagination does the screenwriter have? So many 4-letter words are used without any rhyme or reason that it is completely offensive !! <br /> <br /> Chitrangdy Singh has a terrible American accent that she is not trying to hide. It's disgusting to hear her mouth, like a cliche, like, “What happened? I did not think that you would come "(this, after the hellish nightmare she just went through) or, in the beginning," I appreciate your concern, but I can take care of myself. " Clap. Which clown wrote the dialogues for this? She invites her friend to have a cup of "South Indian" (no less) coffee, wishes someone a good morning and then wishes good night to someone else in the family. And what now with this?!? <br /> <br /> Countless countless residents and tribes are the best actors. Editing is indeed erroneous with too many abbreviations. Obviously, struggling to make a bold statement, Sudhir Misra screwed up with this.
