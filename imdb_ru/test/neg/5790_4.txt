From this film, I learned very little about what I did not yet know from CNN and The New York Times. (And I didn’t follow Enron’s case as some others did.) The film very poorly explained what Enron's “business” was, which may have been on the rise before he began to hide his debts in the entities created by Andy Fastow. It also significantly underestimated the role that Arthur Andersen and Vinson and Elkins played in testing practices that were later found illegal. Nor did he go as far as he could, exploring what "investors" - all these outstanding bankers - thought they were doing. Thanks to the 24-hour cable networks, the Discovery channel and the History channel, documentaries have become widespread. I saw a lot last year that were better than this.
