"Ernest Saves Christmas" - a Christmas special film comedian Ernest. In this film, Ernest must find a successor to Santa Claus for Christmas to continue. On the way, he meets a young girl who is a thief and eventually steals something very important from Santa (I will not tell you what it is; you just have to watch a movie for yourself). As with most Ernest films, there is a lot of humor in it. <br /> <br /> This film is probably one of Ernest's best films. This is ridiculous, and he has several important lessons about friendship and family and how not to be afraid to show love. This is not the best Christmas movie, but it is good to introduce you to the spirit of Christmas. It is a little sad that the film is a bit old.
