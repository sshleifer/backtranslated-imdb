I know that it is rather unfair to comment on the film without seeing the full part - but I'm going anyway! I was waiting for laughter, I tried to give him time. I think 20 minutes is enough to wait for a comedy to laugh. My laughter never came, so I gave up. <br /> <br /> This is stupid humor, not so stupid that you have to laugh. It is not so close to this high class. Let me fix it, it's just * stupid *, not stupid humor. Perhaps they wanted certain scenes to be funny, but they are not. I suppose if you were really bored, you could somehow mix the film with hallucination and end up with a little exciting experience. <br /> <br /> A very pitiful effort.
