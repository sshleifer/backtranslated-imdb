This is an old dark movie. A young couple crawls through a strange mansion, which, as they say, is ruled by Satan, where they run from one to another in the same group: unhappy lady, monkey, monkey man, dwarf, different strange people looking for and two Chinese. They find themselves in the throne room, where the hero must play in the “Price is True” competition, which includes climbing seven steps with seven illuminated tracks; hence the name. For my taste, this is too much of the same thing. Crawling through the corridors of a merry house is fun for a while, and then repeated. Compared to Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, Laurel and Hardy playing the same roles on two drums, this is not exactly funny. This is also not scary, and, apparently, was not supposed: the house is too absurd. Most films in this genre counterbalance comedy with a real threat, and usually two - one, in which the characters believe that it is real, and the other - a cover version. Here the cover should not be taken seriously, and not what is covered. A few moments of fun come from the mix, but it's pretty hard fun. The novel on which the film was based was a real thriller, and I think that he could play straight to achieve the best effect — and still could be.
