This is a disgusting film, claiming the genre of an unexpected finale of films. And a genre that was made much better before. The plot is lame, with a predictable ending. (Yawn) The characters are incredible, and some are so incredible that they are almost impossible to see. Matt Dillon, a wonderful, tense actor, is completely inappropriate here, he is cruel and brought up. Others are forgotten. Most of the dialogue is sophomore, again the pretender tries to be witty. I would not hire a screenwriter to write a shopping list. Yes, this is so bad, deviating from misogyny to a mere gross, as if behind a grand rough house. With so much real talent, I'm really surprised that this film was ever made. This shows a complete lack of fantasy office suits ...
