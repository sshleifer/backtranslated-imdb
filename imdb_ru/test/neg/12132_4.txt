First preview 30/04/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Deer-John Waters): a comedy musical similar to “Roots Waters”, with some funny scenes and good roles, but it didn’t bring much experience. John Waters filmed this music-filled parody scene of the 50s, where Johnny Depp played the title role. This film is very similar to what he did with the parody of the 60s called Hairspray, but this one is not as effective. Some melodies are striking, some characters are interesting for their bizarre Waterlike manner, and the images are good, although sometimes they are overdone. The storyline is similar to the film Lubricant, where there is a good group and a bad group. A guy from a bad group, Cry Baby, wow, a girl from a good group. A good girl then joins a bad group, but once Cry Baby hurts her, she returns to a good group. It simply sets the end where Cry Baby is trying to get her back. Now, one difference that is expected in Water's films is that a bad group doesn't look so bad, and a good group behaves as if they have a pole, which you know that. I definitely saw it in Hairspray. Strangeness and stupidity are actually not so interesting in this film, but they just make us feel that the film could be much better. The main attraction of Johnny Depp's character is that he can make one tear roll down his cheek (thus his namesake) at different times and cause women to fall everywhere for him. This is used too often, and the main point is that the film is fine, but not so good.
