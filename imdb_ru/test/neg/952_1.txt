This show is what happened to Screensavers after G4 got it in their hands, transferring it from a useful source of information related to a computer to a show that was the high point in the push of a miniature web server to someone then the back. <Br /> <br /> As the G4 ratings plummeted, they moved away from their original target audience, gamers, to ordinary young men who like hormones, adding a pleasant look to the staff and the sex advice segment. Now even those gamers who initially applauded the show turn away in disgust. I look forward to the show and the network, in most cases overdue and deserved death.
