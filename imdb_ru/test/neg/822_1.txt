Don't tell me that this movie was funny or a little funny. It was a complete disaster and one of the worst films I've ever seen. Ali G is funny only on the Ali G Show channel 4th. After watching his performance, all I can say is that it was not made for cinema. With the help of the script Daft, or rather, without the plot, you have nothing to have fun. This film, full of annoying, unrealistic characters, is garbage. At the end of the film, Ali G is giving a speech. He mentions that if you hated this film, tell people that it was good. Even speech could not save the film, he probably knew that it would be terrible. I would give 0/10, but the minimum start is 1. In general, don't even waste your time on this garbage.
