I was looking forward to it, being a big fan of the book. However, when he came out, I remember that I thought it was one of the biggest costs of money and time I ever spent in a movie. <br /> <br /> Basically, the acting, the scenery and the music were excellent. and this is the main reason why I rate it 4. <br /> <br /> In this version, Sarah, for my taste, is too selfless. There is no way that she intentionally lied to Miss Minchin to stop her punishing other girls; in the book, she believes that a lie should be called “not just evil, but also vulgar” <br /> <br /> For me, too many Disneyfield endings; Sarah's father returns from the dead, and they all go to the Indian sunset. Despite the fact that the book has a happy (and critics can say the same incredible) end, it does not leave the thought of “Oh, God!” <br /> <br /> The only things true to the book were: < br /> <br /> 1. Sarah's father, a soldier 2. Lines between Sarah and her father (“Do you memorize me?” / “No. I know you by heart. You're in my heart.”) 3. Sarah’s friendship with Becky, and her “adoption” Lottie (although this latter was not developed as much as it could) 4. Changing her room by adding various luxuries. This piece was brilliantly executed. 5. The main core - a rich girl suddenly falls into poverty - here, but that's all there is. <br /> <br /> People can say that this adaptation is more suitable for a younger audience. Maybe. All I can say is that I have two cousins ​​- aged 7 and 12 respectively - who were big fans of this film until they read the book. <br /> <br /> If all you want is a “feel good” family film, then it delivers. If you're looking for a movie that actually tells the story of “Little Princess” (actually, if you read the book), don't waste time with this. This is such a shame; with such a cast of actors, if they followed at least the main story, it could be fantastic. <br /> <br /> Am I saying, “read a book” and “read a book” that too much? Very likely. But if someone tries to adapt a book — especially such a classic — to the cinema, then he should at least do the same. Desirable more than once.
