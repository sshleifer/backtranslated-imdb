Although this is the first film of a group of broken lizards, this is the last one I've seen. Having received a little pleasure from Super Troopers, and having managed to sit in this shit - club dreadlocks and beer fest, I was surprised to learn that they starred in an earlier film. Now I was not sitting with high hopes, but I was hoping for a funny, noisy campus. My friend asked me to remember that they are younger (obviously), and this is their first foray into a movie. I did and was still disappointed. Without taking the acting and comedy skills of the guys from BL, they were fine. The whole movie was tedious, clich√© and frankly boring. Some of the other actors in the film were really bad in action. And the rugby game doesn't even look like rugby. Bad showing They have improved significantly with Super Troopers and have declined since then. Let's hope they get back in shape with Super Troopers 2
