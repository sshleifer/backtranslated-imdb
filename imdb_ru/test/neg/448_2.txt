Let's describe Larry as an interviewer: sucks in all possible ways. He laughs at the jokes of all the guests, asks the most boring questions and never dares to contradict them. He amazes me as the type of person who wants to be loved ... everything. Friendly, boring, unpredictable Harry. He probably owes his success as an interviewer to a dream for celebrities, because they do not fall asleep with what we people want to know and have the right to know. Let's just say: he is interviewing, as if he is in a red country. 02/10, 2 for guests who come to the show, but it all seems meaningless when Larry starts asking his breathtaking questions, such as "What's it like to be a mother?" then comes the usual answer: "Being a mother is the greatest thing that ever happened to me: it is beautiful, but tiring."
