Perhaps the weakest film on Haris, despite the presence of John Carradine (mistaken as the Egyptian high priest) and George Zucco (as his predecessor, ridiculously affected by the severe case of Parkinsonâ€™s disease) supporting Lon Cheney Jr. as a title creature it really is under bandages, since his contribution is insignificant at best! I believe that it is 60 minutes to observe, but the standards have dropped significantly compared to even the two previous entries, and the end result is strictly routine and not at all memorable. The only interesting feature here is the fact that the leading role of a woman is the reincarnation of the Princess of Ananki, which was much spoken about in earlier films, but in fact has never been seen.
