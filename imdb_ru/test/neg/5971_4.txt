After watching Darwin's Nightmare, you should get the impression that Tanzania is a living hell, and its population is quasi-slaves who deliver the best fish to well-fed Europeans, leaving the fish bones of a starving population. In exchange for the fish, they receive weapons of Western manufacture, which are looking forward to using the mainly unemployed population, because being a soldier is their only source of income. <br /> <br /> So with trade, the embodiment of evil and the source of all suffering? Not really. Fortunately, Darwin's Nightmare shows only the dark sides and completely eliminates the positives. In fact, the documentary tells almost nothing about the economic and environmental significance that Victoria has for the region. <br /> <br /> For the countries surrounding Lake Victoria, Victoria is the second and third largest source of income. Wages in the fishing industry are much higher than average. Tanzania has banned huge trawlers to ensure the work of thousands of fishermen. Neighboring states have reached agreements on preserving fisheries at a sustainable level. Cities on the lake enjoy taxes that fishermen must pay for each kilogram of fish caught, as well as taxes on exports and the profits of factories. In addition, Tanzania has banned the export of local traditional fish, which still plays an important role in feeding the local population. <br /> <br /> Ignoring these positive signs, the documentary scares away the much-needed Western consumers and investors, and thus threatens to exacerbate the situation. The situation in Africa. <br /> <br /> For further reading I can recommend two articles published in the German alternative newspaper: http://www.taz.de/pt/2006/09/02/a0013. 1 / textdruck http://www.taz.de/pt/2005/03/17/a0151.1/text
