Perhaps you should be a former hippie to fully appreciate it, because apart from some outdated modes, music and dialogue, nowadays nothing really happens. <br /> <br /> Four fun colleges Art students enjoy the carefree days of drawing nude models and riding motorcycles. They take acid in one scene and go to the zoo. A sign “Do not feed the animals” flashes on the screen, and suddenly in a cage they laugh and hang on a swing with a chain tire (?!). An angry artist (Larry Swanson) tells (in memoirs) how his Art career was almost destroyed by for a painful hand disease. He sends the kidnappers of zombies dressed in black to abduct people, and then injects serum to them that distorts their faces. He is trying to create some kind of new form of an abstract act (I assume that the details given are a bit soft, to say the least). Meanwhile, Jason (Ross Harris) intends to save the day after his friend Scotty (Chris Martell) is killed and his girlfriend Janet (Eugenie Wingate) is kidnapped. I thought the zombie makeup in ZOMBIE LAKE was terrible, but wait until you see it here! This is Douglas Hobart, the star of DEATH COURSE TART. Brad Grinter, director of Z-classic BLOOD FREAK, plays a small role, which is much, much nicer than this deadly dull turkey (also known as NIGHTMARE HOUSE). <br /> <br /> Useless Note: The Regal 1984 video release depicts the wrong cast (for THE BRIDES WORE BLOOD) printed directly on the video label! <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10
