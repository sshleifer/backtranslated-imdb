I never thought the film could make me regret that I signed up for the HBO service. Now I know better! Jack is usually one of my favorite actors, but even he could not save this part. Not that he tried. Jack plays his usual character Eastwick Wiitches. Unfortunately, it is not transferred to the American southwest. He is just as likely a desperate cowboy as Pee Wee Herman. There is no performance margin and for this reason comedy fails. He's almost dumb. The rest of the cast was worse. The delivery times for the lines seem to be something that the lead lady hasnâ€™t perfected since 1978, and the rest seemed just glad to be there. I recommend to those of you who are interested in watching this movie, save your precious time to dry.
