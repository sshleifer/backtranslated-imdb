Well, I read other comments. I donâ€™t think it sounds good, but I still decided to record it on tape. It may not be so clever to read all the bad reviews before watching this movie, because, of course, I would notice all the same strange things. Excessive use of a smooth transition to black, a few strange camera angles and cross dialogue for different conversations with the same people taking place at different times! But noticing everything that I thought to myself: well, it would probably be very boring if everything went in chronological order. Conversations are not so exciting, but mandatory. And the constant extinction of black after really short scenes really makes you feel that the story is quickly promoting the interesting part. Skip the boring bits. At the end of the film, it gets a little thrilling. Will they survive? <br /> <br /> So I really liked this movie? No, not at all. The director had some interesting ideas on how to keep viewers from being bored while he was trying to introduce characters. But he overdid it. It is annoying and sometimes confusing. It was, apparently, only the second film that he shot, so maybe he will learn and do some really good things in the future. And if you sit there (in the future), reading this question, is it worth it to watch a movie of a second famous director. Well, if he is good in the future, of course, look at this shit and wonder how he could make a third one at all. Otherwise, this film is not worth watching, if you are not very interested in creating a film and want to see how you can turn the obligatory boring opening scenes into something watchable.
