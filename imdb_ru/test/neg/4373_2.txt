Police officers Logan Alexander and Debbie Rochon are escorted by five black juvenile offenders across rough terrain and find themselves in a difficult position on sticks when their van breaks. After a deadly clash with a racist white bitch with a shotgun (played by the director), the survivors take refuge in the house of a blind voodoo priestess. One of the teenagers is meaninglessly using a spell to summon Killjoy, who finally appears about halfway through this hole in the makeup job and more, more bold, who can slip out of his head at any moment. Then he continues to kill the stupid characters, at the same time spewing out some of the worst odnostrochnnikov, heard since the cancellation of Hee Hou. <br /> <br /> The game “teenagers” is terrible, the dialogue is even worse, the FX stink, and it looks much cheaper than the first movie. Although I liked him in his earlier films “Troma,” Trent Haag (trying to imitate Jim Carrey here) is terrible and cannot compare with the hyperactive reassessment of Angel Vargas in KILLJOY 1 (who, at least, was somewhat silly laughing). <br /> <br /> Another nail in the coffin for the studios of Full Moon, whose reputation as a funny direct-to-vid franchise has completely disappeared since TRANCERS / PUPPET MASTER.
