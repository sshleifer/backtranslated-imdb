First, let me get this out of my chest, I hate Octopussy with absolute passion. What is frustrating is that he had such great potential and a very good sequence of discoveries, unfortunately, after a sequence of discoveries everything goes down. First, there was absolutely no conspiracy to begin with, just an excuse for Moore to tell his banal jokes. Then there are several sequences that would make a Bond fan cringe, for example a sequence in which Bond turns to disperse a bomb dressed as a clown. The villains are rather poor, Louis Jordon cannot influence, because Kamal Khan and Bollywood veteran Kabir Bedi are as poor as his minion. It's funny that when people argue about what the worst Bond movie is, and Octopus is overlooked when they can easily get money for their money.
