Clint Howard, the brother of the more talented Ron, is filmed in this terrible horror comedy about spiritual work that delivers ice cream to children and kills people. In an effort to be a film that has “so bad it is good” variety, this film misses that mark by a mile and should instead be viewed as “so bad that it is ... good ... BAD.” In any case, this is a permanent cinema "shoe advertising", "fat child" filled with pillows, or "horror", causing a dream that tormented me in the film, I do not know, all I know is what I hated film (the guy who has a weak point for horror films B). Paul Norman decided to continue making films in the porn industry before and after that, his only mainstream movie. A sensible choice is really a horrible action, a nonsense plot, and a ridiculous dialogue is much more delicious, seeing porn sterlet do its thing. Oddly enough, this turkey has absolutely no nudity (another reason to stay away) <br /> <br /> My rating: D-
