And one of them is bad movies. The name, as it turns out, refers to a male-style killer, not a fish. This is not "Piranha", directed by Dante 78th year (which had a fish), and also known as "Piranha, Piranha." A trio of photographers, two men and a woman, somewhere in the Amazon jungle, meet with a local hunter / trap named Caribe. Unfortunately, they are not familiar with the summary of the film by William Smith, who plays Caribe; otherwise they would have immediately understood that he is the villain of this work. Smith may also have refused to shoot the final or cut before they finished shooting (see End of this comment). <br /> <br /> As mentioned elsewhere, there are many long shots of local wildlife in this shot. (birds) - and the central part, the race on motorcycles, which lasts too long. The reason I got the second star is, of course, William Smith, who cannot save this sediment, but once again proves why he was a guy 30-35 years ago, if you really needed a nasty villain; at his best, Smith could be really terrible. He is one of those who love to kill, perhaps in a sadistic manner, and you get this feeling from the wicked grin that he usually puts on when his mood hits. Physically, he is very impressive, and you know that the other 3 characters are doomed in the first half hour. This was what Smith brought in most of his roles; other characters seem hopeless against this monster man. Unfortunately, the film continues to be confused until the very end, as if the minute of the footage has been lost - a confusing, incomplete climax.
