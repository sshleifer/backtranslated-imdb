This is a meaningless insult to the memory and genius of Wells, this senseless collection of self-satisfied improvisation on a grand theme should have been locked into the repository along with a number of other unfinished Wells projects that no one has ever seen. Now we know why! To add an additional insult to a previous injury, the terrifying dubbing of English by amateur actors, duplicating actors and even the greatest man only reinforces all careless mistakes in story-telling and plotting. As if every weekend, some kindhearted Spanish soul gave Orson a few pesos, a 35 mm camera and several short ends of negative film left over from some other production, and told Wells to go to the Spanish village and just keep shooting everything and everything until stock the film has not dried up. It is true that if Orson really created this film instead of the notorious Jesus Franco, he could have thrown out 85% of what he shot, but we will never know. Since Wells never spent time editing his own work here, and somewhere along the way he or his heirs sanctioned someone else to do this, he is not entirely perfect to defeat. Those who want to prove that in the first years of his life, Wells was the happiest of young people, because he surrounded himself with people like John Houseman, Herman Mankiewicz, Greg Toland, Bernard Hermann and Robert Wise, do not need the best proof of his insolvency among adults than this movie mess. In his sad old age, Wells was able to do everything when he needed a few dollars or pesos, including selling his artistic soul. The devil, of course, got his due with this!
