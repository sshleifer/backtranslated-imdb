I saw this movie, and I really like horror movies. <br /> <br /> I did not know what to expect, but as soon as the film was on the way, it was a pleasure to watch it. The idea was quite original, and the game was good. Especially Jenna Devan in the role of exciting / evil Tamara. <br /> <br /> The hardest part of horror movies is a good ending. But there the film failed. For a change, the final scene in the hospital, where all the staff suddenly left. First you see the doctors and nurses running around, but then they all went home? <br /> <br /> No cries for help during the pursuit of Tamara, the escape to the roof (also a smart move ... no) and off Of course, this is some kind of open final. <br /> <br /> No .... the film started off great, the main part was nice to watch, but they really messed up the final using all the clichés from bad horror films. Jeffrey Reddick failed in my eyes because of this movie, after he made some really high-quality films, such as Final Destination 1 and 2. <br /> <br /> If you like horror, full of cliché, Tamara is a good movie to view. I like movies that surprise me.
