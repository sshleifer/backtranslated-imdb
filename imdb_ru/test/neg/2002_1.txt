Please do not spend money on this sorry for the film. The only way to see someone watching this is if he were a dedicated fan of Erica Elaniac, but you'd better surf the Internet than watch this piece of shit. I'd rather see how the paint dries, than go through it. <br /> <br /> They lure you with Casper and Erica and make you believe that this is a science fiction film about Dracula, but it quickly turns into a farce about great-great van van Helsing Grandson, here, ironically, for one the last clash between him and Dracula. <br /> <br /> The film also tries to make a political statement, I suppose, when it seems that none of the characters in the future knows, God is that they have not been taught about him and do not understand when they see the cross. Could do a lot more with this idea. It's a shame, it happened.
