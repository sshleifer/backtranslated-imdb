This film is about a party organized by a scary girl high school. For illogical films of this kind, she gets permission to hold a party in a house that used to be a crematorium, a dubious place, long closed and locked up. Apparently, the history of this property is one of those city secrets, which is best not to talk among the righteous people, although the legend is really whispered among young people. <br /> <br /> Why was this crematorium really closed? What actually happened there in the past? <br /> <br /> I like these supernatural “kill-kill-kill” films if there is something in them that is not copied from a hundred other films. The highlights of this film are the petty theft of a “7-11” robbery, a distracting clerk with a bright eye, the dressing up scene of a “good girl” witnessed by her younger brother, a moron, the possible death of an ugly neighbor who hates a holiday, a creepy mirror scene and the concept of a aqueduct which is a barrier against the supernatural; the best part of this movie is when a possessed party sponsor dances at BAUHAUS in front of the fireplace; that scene is swinging.
