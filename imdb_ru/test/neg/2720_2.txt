I seem to be outnumbered, but I thought “Radio” was pretty awful. It seemed that these typical "heartbreaking" films contained almost every phrase. <br /> <br /> The motivation of the heroes in love with Radio was never explained. We just had to accept that everyone loved the radio, except for a couple of bad guys. <br /> <br /> You could see almost all the important moments in the story from a distance of 100 yards. When the film wanted you to go "Awww" or pull out your fabrics, I rolled my eyes and wished I was watching Rudy instead. <br /> <br /> Actors had a number of good performances. It is a pity that they did not give the best film in the desire to appear.
