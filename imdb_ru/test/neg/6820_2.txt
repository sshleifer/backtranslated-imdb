Dooley and his partner Jerry Lee were together again in this second sequel (? !!?) I sincerely did not guess that they had done one sequel, let alone two. And for a movie that was only slightly better than Turner & Hooch? This time, after Dooley retires, he must mate with his dog (with other dogs, humans) and wait for Jerry Lee to be crippled. Real cool stuff. I mean, come on now. The original laughed at least a little. It has none. Jim Belushi just looks old and exhausted. Both brothers Belushi were great in the 80s. If John had not died, would he be so bad today as his brother? This thought somehow saddens me. <br /> <br /> My rating is: D- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: US Network
