Senseless and rather stupid film, which basically is a collection of clips from horror films, fiction and unknown films. The audience watches unnecessary footage that watches the clips, and Donald Pleasant and Nancy Allen are among the viewers who turn to the camera and explain why we love horror movies. Not a bad idea, but all the explanations are obvious (“a horror movie helps us cope with real horror,” “you are at the mercy of a director in a theater”) and rather banal. In addition, the clips are shown very quickly, and the changes are a kind of noise. And, as can be seen from the context, these bits are not at all scary. And this is really not enough - I saw it at the cinema in 1984 and was outraged that I paid $ 5 for an 84-minute film! <br /> <br /> However, he edited well enough, and Allen and Pleasure seem to have fun. For people who are interested in learning more about terror, it can be fun and interesting. But if you're a horror fan (like me), you will probably be bored. Good idea, bad performance (no pun intended). I give it 3.
