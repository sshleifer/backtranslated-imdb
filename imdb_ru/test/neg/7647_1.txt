Honestly, one of the worst movies I shot and made in movies. Looks like a movie for television. And bad at that. I can't believe that people still hire Danny Houston after seeing him in this film, or that they still allow John Sales to make films. One evening, my husband and I saw this film on TV, and we were so bored that we finished cleaning the house while it was on. and we are still bored! It made me think that the critics were so gullible with the previous sales movies, such as Lone Star, which at that time was delighted, but in the end gave nothing. Spend your time on something better. Anything.
