A quirky plot, a cunning script, a quirky almost everything really. The most convincing performance is Joanna Pakula as Lauren, but even this does not save this meaningless and unpleasant film. The implicit directorâ€™s invitation to viewers is not just to suspend disbelief, but also to suspend judgment. <br /> <br /> Presumably, it is intended to be complete and threatening, but although the film has its erotic moments, there are few of them and they are far from each other. Similar things have been made better by many others. Do not try to see it.
