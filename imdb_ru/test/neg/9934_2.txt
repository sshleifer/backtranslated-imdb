I have been a frantic Star Trek fan since 1966. One thing I learned from Star Trek is that special effects are secondary to the characters. Encounter At Farpoint is not coping with its mission. <br /> <br /> Perfectly prepared. <br /> <br /> Bad director, written act, acting D.K. Fontana really blew up this one. This episode is so embarrassing that the master record should be burned. <br /> <br /> The first half of the first season did not go much better.
