Alfred Hitchcock made this comedy about a failed marriage in 1941, but his heart does not seem to be in it. Carol Lombard and Robert Montgomery - a couple who discovers that she has never been married under the law, and spends the film, returning to true love He does not have much reputation, and it is easy to understand why. The jokes are familiar from the best films, but here they are not glued together. And leads are not charismatic. Lombard’s performance is clipped and tortured, and it’s doubly sad to think that she died only a year later. Robert Montgomery seems to know that he is in the pig's ear and tries his best to make a silk purse out of it without much success. The best performance comes from Gene Raymond as “another person” (he has a beautiful drunk scene). This is one of the few really bad Hitchcock films.
