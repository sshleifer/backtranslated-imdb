I thought it was a comedy! What a cry! I cannot believe that Forsyth or Reynolds will actually appear in this piece of garbage ... And then there is the beautiful Erica Eleniak or whatever that eye candy is called ... It looks like she gained a few pounds since her central Playboy warehouse How about 50 !! The storyline is ridiculous, the acting is absolutely terrible, and the tired old cliches that run over and over, boy, it took him a lot of stamina to sit behind this dog ... The only thing that cost is LAUGHTER !! And there are a LOT! If you really want to kill, say, take an hour and a half, take this child at the box office, but make sure that you have a room full of mentally retarded people to watch it with you. I think that this is for whom it was written ... it looks like what they thought about the real low rent, the addict audience for that ..
