I don't care what anybody says, this movie is hilarious! It combines the grim seriousness of "Threads" and the anarchic mix of alternative comedy, and the result is a dark, but incredibly ridiculous satire about the border management policies of both the western and eastern blocs at that time. You must pay tribute to the creators of the film for the fact that even tried to surpass the real madness of "Duck and cover" or "Protect and survive!" <br /> <br /> Imagine that someone made a movie based on the track Dead Kennedys "Kinky Sex". Makes the world go round "and you are very close to oops! Apocalypse. Add Rick Mayall in top form as a crazy OTT SAS commander, and youâ€™ll get it for sure. A worthy companion to Dr. Strenglov, and that says something.
