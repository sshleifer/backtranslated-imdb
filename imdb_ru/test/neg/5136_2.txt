This film has good intentions, at least in the message “do not be afraid, no matter how hard it may be. Fear will eventually kill you. ” This is a good message, but the container is so spoiled that the message is broken because of a bad game, a complete lack of trust in feelings, a dialogue that sounds as if it was read out loud, stereotypes instead of breathing, of living people. <br /> <br /> He abuses such effects as slow motion to compensate for the complete lack of confidence in acting skills and, consequently, in the lack of emotional power ... <br /> <br /> The suicidal part still reminds to me about a low-budget film before the 90s, when lesbians thought he had (at least on celluloid) a complete inability to live a good, happy life and a tendency to fall into a drama that often included separation, death or prison. <br /> <br /> If she focused on rewards for living life depending on how we feel (and not on how others think we should live it), she would be less dramatic, more inspiring. But this is not the case; it focuses on pain, on loss, and leaves only the idea of ​​a theoretical ideal. <br /> <br /> I don’t understand how this film can inspire anyone to quit or conquer fear and rejection. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a really good film that talks about overcoming fear and how to dare to experience what you feel, go back to the gorgeous Desert Heart (even better: read the novel!)
