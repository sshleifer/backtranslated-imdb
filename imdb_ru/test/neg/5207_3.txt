I am a big fan of horror, and I bought this film because of all its hype on bulletin boards. Well, let me tell you that I don't know who advertised all this, but let me tell you a few things. <br /> <br /> Firstly, this film is “not” a LOT of things. It is NOT scary, NOT anxious, NOT excessively bloody, NOT excessively painful (except for one season, CAN BE), NOT beautifully crammed ... EVERYTHING. <br /> <br /> The essence of the film is that the couple runs to a small island in Greece, because they did a little bit of mischief in London. We do not even know what they did, but it is assumed that they killed someone. <br /> <br /> ** warning about a spoiler ** <br /> <br /> A male leader kills several people from his perversion of “cleaning the island of perverts”, strangely enough. Kills are cheap, characters are cheaper, and effects suck. <br /> <br /> There is one part when he rapes a goat, because his wife does not give him in the mornings, but even this is done without any care. for the way it's shot. <br /> <br /> The end of the spoilers <br /> <br /> The end of the film is the only thing that is not quite predictable. I especially liked it when the "shepherd" farts her husband. Anyway, if you can rent it and you have 2 hours to spend ahead. It is nothing but a sandwich with melted cheese on moldy bread. <br /> <br /> 3/10
