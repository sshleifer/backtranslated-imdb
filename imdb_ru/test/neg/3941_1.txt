To be honest, I was a big fan of the 'Stay Alive' trailer when it came out a few months ago. I continued to tell my friend that this film has a great plot - and, perhaps, a good one. In any case, this film somewhat exceeds my expectations. <br /> <br /> The plot has great potential, but how the story unfolds, along with acting, directing and bad CGI, this film is a disaster. The ghost does not make any sense, including murder - it is too much in a hurry, creating a feeling of "unreality" in the minds of the audience. <br /> <br /> This film can be scary for some viewers - but fear in the sense of shock (because of sound effect, etc.), and not prolonged fear due to certain actual factors in the film. <br /> <br /> You should reconsider watching this movie.
