Today, You Die starts with the sinister businessman Max Stevens (Kevin Taig) hired the honorary crime bank Harlan (produced by Steven Seagal) to drive a $ 20,000,000 cash vehicle in the back of Las Vegas casino point A to "B". it sounds just like that? It’s good that Max forgot to tell Harlan that the money was stolen and that he had just become an escape driver during an armed robbery. Bummer. The situation gets even worse for Harlan when local policemen catch him and throw him in jail for a long time, but Harlan managed to hide the money before he was caught, and with a good $ 20,000,000 at stake, and Harlan is forced to watch his back. rogues want this, like government agents. Harlan teams up with Ice Kool (!) (Anthony 'Teach' Criss) in jail, and they both manage to escape, and at this moment Harlan goes in search of revenge ... <br /> <br /> Photography and director Don E FauntLeRoy It must be said that cadres in Eastern European action films that Steven Seagal specializes these days are not getting better, and Today You Die is a good example. This is a terrible movie, really simple. Scenario producer Danny Lerner, Kevin Moore and Les Weldon gives Seagalu a new type of character, which allows him to acquire his non-existent acting skills: criminal, not some government cliché of a government agent / policeman / soldier / one person he usually plays. In fact, if you were charitable, you could say that Today You Die is plagiarism of the excellent thriller Mel Gibson's “Return” (1998), where he also played a really dirty job with such a good effect. While Payback was an excellent uncompromising noir-style hard-edged fighter, Today You Die is nothing compared to anything. Unfortunately, Seagal is terrible here, he has no presence on the screen, no threat, and viewers can never be sure that he is a bad guy whom we hate or not. For example, initially his character is set up as a modern Robin Hood, when he steals from rich drug dealers and scum to give to the poor (and also to keep a decent profit for himself), which is ridiculous in itself, but then it has Segal turns around and kills a lot of people that contradicts the pretty criminal with the moral that the film went to great lengths to set in the first place. The story is full of holes, for example, Agent Knowles contacts the running Harlan, and then gets reprimanded from her bent chief for meeting with him, and it turns out that he found out by clicking on her phone. Then why didn't her boss use the information he had to catch Harlan? This is a common boring and predictable bustle due to a lot of money, and a surprise surprise that the government investigative agent is really a bad guy! Wow, I didn’t expect it to happen, I have to say ... <br /> <br /> Directed by FauntLeRoy slows everything down to the level of a snail, and Today You Die feels that it goes on forever, the action films and the scenery are also not much Enough of entertainment value. Rare battle scenes are not great, most of them are either shot in the shadows, very quickly cut and edited, or with a camera played as Seagal’s character to try to hide the fact that most of the stunt works done here are doubled. Seagal again looks fat and out of shape and uses a long baggy coat to try to hide it, it is not. From the very beginning, this place is a rather steep car chase through the streets of Las Vegas, and I thought that Today You Die might be fine, but it seems that the whole sequence was stolen from another action movie called Top of the World (1997 ), which is dedicated to the robbery of a casino in Las Vegas, as well as the use of footage from this film “Today You Die” also edits scenes from the action movie Charlie Sheen “No Code of Conduct” (1998) ) ”And“ Wesley ”.“ Indisputable ”traveling prison fighter (2002), t to which a large portion of the film "Today You Die" is a guess. <br /> <br /> Technically, a film is in order, given that it has been edited together from four separate films, and also Own cadres are quite competent and consistent enough. All shots of the places in the USA are obviously taken from the already mentioned films with all the original shots made on the cheap in Bulgaria. By the way, rap music that littered Today You Die is terrible. The acting is bad, and Seagal just mumbles through his lines, as usual. <br /> <br /> Today You Die is a really bad movie made up of other bad action movies, Seagal looks old and fat, action movies are average at best, and most of the story is quite random and at the end it doesn't look so good. One thing to avoid if you are not an avid Seagal fan, if such an animal even exists ...
