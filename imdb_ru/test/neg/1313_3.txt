“Flood” is a vivid example of how throwing good actors and cgi into a movie will do little to compensate for the garbage script. The basic premise is good: what if a strange storm threatens to send the sea right across the Thames barriers and swallow London so quickly that most people will probably never leave on time? This is basically the “Day After Tomorrow” New York segment, but this should not make it any less a film. However, there is simply no script. It is simply functional, flat and not deep enough. Great British talents, such as Robert Carlisle and David Suchet, we name only two, best cope with what they have, but their characters are two-dimensional ciphers, like something from the old Marvel comic. and it would be frankly easier to reverse. Not that every actor was off the hook - Tom Courtney seemed capable of only one emotion throughout the entire film, but then he was not given any particular problems. <br /> <br /> I welcome any opportunity to see a few - the Hollywood catastrophe requires change, and I don’t expect millions of dollars to be spent on rendering ultra-realistic graphics. Nevertheless, there are no excuses for elegant writing - especially from a country that has created some of the best scientific works ever made with little or no budget. This is an indecisive class B fluff that produces a Sci-Fi channel, and it is unlikely to be a goal to strive for. If, like me, you are such a fan of disaster films that you are still tempted, do yourself a favor and watch it with friends. Even better; Do not worry
