Witchcraft / Witchery / La Casa 4 / and everything you want to name. How about ... Crud. <br /> <br /> A gathering of people in the island resort of Massachusetts is besieged by the black magic of an evil witch who kills every person with cruel, torturous methods. Photographer Gary (David Hasselhoff) shoots for Linda (Katherine Hickland, whose voice and behavior resembles EE-YOR from the cartoon Winnie Poo) a virgin studying witchcraft without permission at an island resort. Rose Brooks (Annie Ross, depicting an incredibly rude bitch) is interested, perhaps, in buying a resort and with her husband Freddie (Robert Champagne, who always looks back on other women, much younger than him), pregnant daughter Jane (Linda Blair) and grandson Tommy ( Michael Manchester, who is just bored everywhere, probably wanting to watch Sesame Street instead of starring in this garbage), goes on a boat to the resort to look at the estate of Tony Giordano Jerry’s real estate agent’s son (Rick Farnsworth), it’s obvious that Scheno to in the business getting wet feet. Together with these people there is an architect Leslie (Leslie Cumming, whose character is a nymphomaniac) who can help Rose rebuild the resort. The captain of the boat is killed by the Lady in Black (Hildegard Knef, dressed in her make-up and very thick lipstick), and a storm is brewing. The boat leaves by itself (guided by the invisible power of “Lady in Black”, I think) when everyone is stuck in a decrepit resort that is in dire need of repair. Most of the victims, before meeting their terrible destinies, are carried through some kind of red wormhole, whose whirlwind leads to another dimension (perhaps to hell or something like that), where they are tortured by these fiends, dressed in torn clothes with a disgusting face. One victim’s mouth was sown, and then turned upside down in the fireplace, while others roasted the fireplace. One poor soul is tortured by sharp twisting of a rope tightly wrapped around its flesh, and then found hanging from a snout of a swordfish, penetrating its neck. One guy is slowly choking when his veins are swollen (... and bleeding), and neck blood vessels are splashing onto Hasselhoff's face! One guy was crucified with nails hammered into his hands before he was hanged upside down in an open flame. Blair’s pregnant victim becomes possessed, her hair stands on end, speaking in another woman’s voice. One is raped by this demonic man with a "sick" mouth, when hell strollers next door joyfully greet. The film, despite its excesses, is basically a boring food for those who really want to see the lowest point in the career of Hasselhoff and Blair, who deserve better than this. At times almost unbearable, creating little by little uncertainty. Awkward performance of death sequences that look cheap and ridiculous. Of course, blood is all right, but most of the film shows the victims after they went through the bell. We have a chance to see how pregnant women (who look like stuntmen in suits with bad wigs) jump out of three windows. Yes, and the reflected face of “Lady in Black” often appears on inanimate objects that the characters see. Tommy has a small tape recorder called Sesame Street, which tapes “Damu” in the mumbo-jumbo Black songs, which were obviously used later. For some reason, the Lady in Black loves to visit little Tommy. He is not at all afraid of her, because Tommy is too bored to express any expression on his face, much less fear. Do I need to say more? This is a real bastard. Ugh.
