No one is going to take SQUALL for a good movie, but it is catchy. After playing the role of Mirna Loy in the role of Nubi, a hot-blooded Gypsy, you are unlikely to forget this experience. When this film was shot, the exotically beautiful Miss Loy was still filmed as foreign foxes, often Asian and usually sinister. She is, of course, vigilant here. It seems that her skin was darkened and her hair was curled. In most scenes she is barefoot and wears a little more than a skirt and a loose peasant blouse, and in one scene she wears only a patterned towel. I suppose I'm concentrating on Miss Loy's appearance, because she is definitely the best, if not the only reason to tune in to this creaky antiques and keep looking. You certainly will not be attracted by the dialogue, which is hopeless. In one typical passage, Nubi looks out the window at the departing caravan and poetically writes: “The Roma always sing. Strange and sad. When the fiery breath burns in the big sun, and when the pale moon looks out from behind the cloud and breathe the air like death, they sing. "Poetic or what? Fans of violet prose will have a field day. I can't help but wonder if in her later years, Miss Loy chose not to recall her involvement in this project. <br /> <br /> Like many early conversations, this was an adaptation of recent success on Broadway, the stage version opened at 48th Street Theater in November 1926 and lasted more than a year. The performance was provoked by the famous an episode involving the humorist and theatrical critic Robert Benchley, who was known to be disgusted with characters who spoke thick dialect or pidzhin English. According to the repeated anecdote, Mr. Benchley wriggled awkwardly in the introductory part of this show. for some reason, who moved to a village in Hungary because of the film) gave the actors the opportunity to practice their accents with varying degrees of success, but Bentchley's patience reached its limit when On this evening, the door burst open and the actress, dressed like a gypsy, rushed into the room with a cry: "Help! Help! He knocked me over! ”Then she threw herself at the feet of the mistress of the house and exclaimed,“ I, Nubi! I am a good girl! I will stay here! ”At that moment Mr. Benchley got up and announced to his companion:“ I, Bobby. I am a bad boy. Now I'm leaving, ”and left the theater. <br /> <br /> The film contains numerous examples of unintended humor, but never comes close to the level of wit Benchley. The melodramatic plot concerns the family of Lajos: father Joseph, mother of Mary and son Paul, a student of a neighboring college. We would consider this prosperous family "upper middle class", as they are landowners with servants and all the comforts of life, but their comfortable existence suddenly falls into confusion when the Gypsy caravan arrives in the village and their home invades, and Nubi is a Gypsy. She arrives at their door during the storm of the title - symbolizing turbulent emotions, I suppose. The girl is saved from abusive relationships and seeks asylum. After reviewing this issue, the Lyos family agrees to hide it from its angry lover, who soon appears but turns away. Nubi becomes a servant in the house. Kindness motivates the family’s decision to accept her, but soon enough, an indulgent little good-for-nothing Nubi pays for them by tempting every healthy man nearby, starting with servant Layos Peter, then moving up to his son Pavel. Nubi breaks Paul's relationship with his bride Irma (played by Loretta Young, while still a teenager), makes him drop out of school, and then invites him to buy her jewelry, stealing the savings of Lena's maid (Zasu Pitts). Lena, for her part, still mourns the loss of her own fiancé Peter, seduced and discarded by Nubi, when she turned her attention to Paul. Ultimately, Nubi targets the family of Joseph's father, and I suppose if there was more time, she would also go for Uncle Dani, Maria, the village priest, and God knows who else. <br /> <br /> I think it goes without saying that such a scenario easily lends itself to a parody, but during its first half SQUALL, nevertheless, manifests the undeniable charm of day soap: we are hypnotized by watching the Bad Girl conjuring men - people and wreak havoc, like an irresistible force of nature (almost like a storm! Ha-ha, another metaphor!). But as plot tricks spread throughout camp fun, it fades away. In the later scenes, Nubi is not accented, and the focus switches to the dysfunctional dynamics of the Lajos family, and after a while these people become a real brake. In particular, the son behaves like an absolute heel, but parents never recognize it and do not face their own shortcomings; all, as we are told, is the fault of Nubi, this bad tramp. <br /> <br /> People from the cast are boring. Aside from Miss Loy, the only actress who can handle a walkie-talkie is ZaSu Pitts, amazing as usual. The mother of the Layos family plays Alice Joyce, an old silent star who was out of her element with acting roles and who retired shortly afterwards. Loretta Young's fresh appeal provides good contrast with Nubi's dark charm, but her reading of the lines is so awkward that it's pretty sweet. No, there is only one reason to watch this movie, and that is Nubi herself. I can not remember another actress who could play this stupid role and managed to come off in half. However, I am not an objective observer. I am desperately in love with Myrna Loy and will be watching her in everything, even in SQUALL.
