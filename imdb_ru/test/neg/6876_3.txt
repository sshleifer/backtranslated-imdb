Yes, the specified title line does appear in this movie. What for? I'm not sure. When actually spoke, someone from a film crew, at some moment, laughed? I would like to see excerpts from this film, mainly because I think they will be more interesting than the film itself. <br /> <br /> Directed by Jim Gillespie ("I know what you did last summer,") comes out the movie "Slasher," which suggests that we have never seen the movie "Slasher." Of course, he should not be blamed in all. There are also three responsible authors, and this is somehow based on a video game that is still in production. The name of the named game is Backwater, but after searching for information about it I found absolutely nothing. <br /> < br /> And here we are starting the film ... I would like to say before continuing, I did not expect it to win an Oscar. When I'm right Thinking like that, I enjoy a funny horror movie to pass the time. I think there is an opportunity to create an effective, original and clever slasher movie. “Venom” is not a movie. <br /> <br /> There is almost no character development. It's all right. You don't expect much. However, instead of a well-knit cast, this film decides to introduce us to the next many horror cliche characters ... <br /> <br /> 1. Last girl: She just broke up with my boyfriend. This means that at some point in the film, when they are in danger, they will decide to come together again. Which, most likely, means that he will die, and she will remain the last survivor of the film. “Eden” is played by Agnes Bruckner, without much enthusiasm, I would add. <br /> <br /> 2. The Boyfriend: he is just there to coexist with The Final Girl until his death. Of course, he can save her, but he is doomed, and we know it. "Eric" is played by Jonathan Jackson. <br /> <br /> 3. The Bimbos: Usually, horror films only need one of them, but here we have two. They steal a shop, steal, they can show their breasts (not in this case), or they can be alcoholics. The main product of the genre. They also roam the dimly lit places alone, usually saying something like, “Hi? Is there anyone there? ”“ Tammy ”and“ Patty ”with the appropriate name are playing Bijou Phillips and Davette Sherwood. <br /> <br /> 4. The Jackass: Of course, he looks cute, but he is an idiot in a film that is inserted just to be an idiot. He says stupid things, does stupid things, obviously, has never seen a horror movie, and this is one of the pleasant murders for which you watch such things. "Shona" plays D.J. Kotrona. <br /> <br /> 5. The Girlfriend: She loves the Jackass, although pretty much no one else loves, and she usually remains the one who has been alive for a while, so she can scream and cry until she stumbles and stay behind. "Rachel" is played by Laura Ramsey. <br /> <br /> 6. Creepy Janitor: In this case, Creepy Gas Station attendants. Enough said. "Ray" is played by Rick Kramer. <br /> <br /> I could continue, but I think you understand. The remaining characters are not as common as they are equally killed. There is a "Gay guy" (Pavel Shyda as "Ricky"), who was definitely robbed when it comes to the screen, and "He who knows what's going on." Of course, all this does not matter, because at first everyone always thinks that this is crazy. Sisi is played by Meagan Good. <br /> <br /> There are still a couple of characters, namely, a deputy, played by the “Method of Man”, but he and others are rather quickly killed and receive even less character development than the following. cliche. <br /> <br /> So, you probably think: “Why does this film require such deep analysis? It's just a summer horror because you're crying out loud! ”Based on this question, does he deliver the goods? Yes and no. The game is not particularly convincing, even considering the amount of talent involved. Bijou Phillips was greeted for her performance in The Hooligan by Larry Clark, and Agnes Bruckner has long been gaining popularity. <br /> <br /> So what about blood? There are some. This is really about it. Many of the juiciest pieces are business cards. Namely, the scene with someone's face and sandblaster, which is used to remove paint from cars. <br /> <br /> To the credit of the director, there are a couple of interesting scenes. I liked the fragment where part of the house was literally ripped off so that an unstoppable villain could get to the characters. <br /> <br /> If all of this was centered around a smarter script in which the characters did not make the same stupid mistakes that literally made hundreds of horror movie characters, they could make them more enjoyable. All the most interesting characters are immediately killed in the first third of the film, and then it becomes not a particularly interesting countdown until we find out that this is just a Creepy Janitor and Last Girl. <br /> <br /> I suppose that I’m a bit exhausted, but as a fan of horror films, I wonder why I was worried when I myself could write a better script. I will not even mention numerous cases of terrible computer graphics.
