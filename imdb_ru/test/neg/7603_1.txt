Unfortunately, this is not one of those films that at least make you laugh at their incredible stupidity. It has no entertainment value at all. It just sucks. I do not know where to start to explain how this film annoyed me. I think you really need a cake, this is an unbearable soundtrack. It sounds as if someone made a simple punch, and then, for the rest, let the 5-year-old child go berserk with the synthesizer and record it on tape. It is really so terrible, and as if this is not enough, there is not a single scene in the film without “music” (= noise). By the end of the film, you either went deaf or cut off your ears earlier. That, at least, will not let you fall asleep, because nothing happens in the film to keep your attention. Just a lot of bad games, a few cheap and inconclusive killings, no story at all (she just jumps from one scene to another, and you, as a viewer, can try to make sense of it), and in the last 30 minutes or so you can witness some of the worst "special effects" ever. This is very boring. Do not watch this movie! You can do something much more interesting, for example, look at the wall or read the phone book. I mentioned how much the soundtrack sucks?
