Yes, Edward G. gives us a retro look at the world of criminal defense. At first, he is an overly zealous prosecutor who sends the wrong person to the chair (who passionately plays, although DeForest Kelly tells briefly), then he is so repentant that his only consolation is a bottle. Throw in a tormented romance, a really quick plunge into poverty, and don't doubt who he is protecting, and the next thing you know is Shazam! Black Legyeryer (God, I like this phrase). He sees the light just in time to save his tormented beloved from the chair. Yawn. <br /> <br /> But actually the action in the courtroom is pure melodrama. See how he knocks out a witness, sees how he drinks poison, see how he passionately argues when he squeezes a bullet hole in his chest. Get ready for a melodrama. <br /> <br /> However, the film is Jane Russell. With curves defying the laws of gravity, and IQ approached absolute zero, she has something to look at. Even sings a little.
