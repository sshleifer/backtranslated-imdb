A coach who used to be good, but had to move to a new area in order to get away from what he had once done; a hopeless team; a star player who fell out with a coach; assistant coach with an alcohol problem, a little guy kicked, scoring a winning basket; the whole city against the coach (all but the leading lady). This is an old story - straight from the British comics, where a team of fans and fat men fights with the Brazilians in football and wins. <br /> <br /> This film is admittedly well-made, full of these cliches. The only part I didnâ€™t foresee was when at the town meeting the star player suddenly decided to take the side of the coach. No reason has been given. It seemed strange that until now everything went on as usual. Maybe he just felt sorry for the poor man. <br /> <br /> Gene Hackman plays in Papa Doyle's dressing room. I am sure that the actor of the caliber Dennis Hopper did not find anything particularly difficult in his role. The same can be said about Barbara Hershey. <br /> <br /> In general, a movie full of cliches that could have been made much better than it was.
