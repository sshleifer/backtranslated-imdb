This film was not very well produced. they almost completely ignored the book. I think they tried to save time. The only plus 2 me was that the actor who played Finney was cute. Some of the dialogues between the main characters looked a little bit funny, which was not in the book. The main parts of the book were cut out again. You lost a general effect that was not as haunting as a book, and left me in short supply. Also a strong language, although it was brief, was very unnecessary. I was also surprised (not pleasantly) by a new character who was not in the book. One of my favorite characters (the leper) was poorly interpreted and depicted. He seemed more sinister in the film than the real leper in the book. For all disappointing.
