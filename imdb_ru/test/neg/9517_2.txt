I saw this movie without knowing it at all. The split-screen device immediately caused irritation, and after the end of the sequence of headings nothing improved for me. The plot, characters and dialogue - everything was incredibly stamped - the poor guy from the abusive family is thrown out of the house, he wants to get out of his “lot”, reinvents himself, changes his voice, puts on other people's clothes, is adopted by a gay on their way to becoming part of an international group of drug addicts accepting British aristocrats. <br /> <br /> The property of Patricia Highsmith (the talented Mr. Ripley) must sue the creators of this film. The triple screen for me along with the duration of more than 120 minutes underlines the almost non-existent editing. You can not decide which image works and is the most powerful, why not show three and hope that you get the right image with one of them. This trick took away any connection or interest that I had with any of the characters. The important dialogue was repeated 3 times on each screen, as if to say: “This is an important / touching / deep moment, well!”. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. <br /> <br />
