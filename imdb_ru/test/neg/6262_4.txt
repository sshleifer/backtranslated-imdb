I never expected too much from Jim Vinorsky, the cheesy B-movie director's film: a silly premise, some cheap effects and a bit of nudity from some busty babes, and I'm usually pretty happy. <br /> <br /> Well, the Cheerleader Massacre does the first and definitely the second, but unfortunately it glows a little when it comes to splashing. And when the title of the film has the word “slaughter”, and in the blood is whipped, then Houston has a problem. <br /> <br /> The Vynorsky film focuses on a group of fans who, along with their teacher, the mini-bus driver and a couple of guys end up in the mountains during a snowstorm. They walk on foot to a deserted mountain shelter, where they find food and shelter. And the crazy killer who wants them all to die! From the very beginning, good old Jim ensures that his film has many scenes loaded with T & A, and includes a mandatory soul scene, as well as many other moments in which delicious women get frankly frank in nature (including a rough erotic episode sex and a very useless threesome). Scene with beauty in a hot tub. None of the women look young enough to be cheerleaders (and never even seen in their clothes), but who cares about such details when they undress too willingly in the name of art? <br /> <br /> However, I take care of the numerous death murders in the film. With such an incredibly ominous title, I hoped that some inventive bloodshed would fit all asses, bushes and boobs; instead, almost all the killings take place behind the scenes or without features. Only a stupid scene after decapitation (achieved with the help of CGI "cheap as chips") approaches the delivery of goods. <br /> <br /> However, if you feel in a mood for some beating or a little because of the stupidity of a slasher without a minus, then in at least 82 minutes, at least, the slaughter from the support group will not become too a great waste of your time.
