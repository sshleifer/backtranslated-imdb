I just bought this film because I love to donate to Operation Smile, the charitable organization on which the film is based ... but I found that writing the film was very strange. In fact, it doesn’t pay much attention to Operation Smile or similar organizations, such as Smile Train, and their Herculean efforts to alleviate the suffering of children born with deformities in third world countries. No, this is about an American teenage volunteer Katie, whose “overly privileged” life in Malibu, California, includes a mother who brings her to a doctor so that she has birth control pills before she sleeps with her boyfriend What should do this contraceptive nonsense to attract the attention of the audience? It's 2005 now. I would be more surprised if, in 2005, a Malibu teen didn’t take birth control measures, and even if that’s the case, then who cares? Unlike Katie, she is the heroine of Lin in China, a girl with facial deformity, who missed her last year’s chance to get an operation, but this year she does not want to do it. Not one character is written in such a way that the audience can truly identify with the girl, let alone understand the motives. On the other hand, the actors are doing an adequate job trying to play the bad hand that the one who wrote this ridiculous script faced. The best performance was with a gentleman who plays Lin's father, although most of his dialogue is in Chinese and with subtitles. Operation "Smile" deserves to be awarded a much better film than this
