* Technically, this comment may contain “spoilers”, but there are certainly no surprises in it. * <br /> <br /> My cousin and I took him on a rental the other day hoping to laugh at the typical amateur shitty excuse for horror. movie. Unfortunately, we did not have too many laughs, and we, of course, were not too scared. <br /> <br /> Plan of the plot: the plane containing the daughter of the head of the company and some strange element of technology falls into the area where our furry friend lives, so the head of the company gathers a team of personalities rather than experienced hunters to restore it . <br /> <br /> In the first 3/4 of the movie, everything gets pretty boring. It basically consists of Big Foot shots lurking in the trees, where members of the group sometimes hear him, and give him away as nothing. We also see some pictures of the party through the Big Foot point of view, and he apparently sees this in heat vision. <br /> <br /> To set up the plot, we have to watch the sequences of the group sitting around the fire and talking. about the possibility of justifying the existence and actions of sasquatch. "Maybe he can dodge bullets ... if he sees them coming." Of course, later we will see that he can. “There are many uncharted lands in which sasquatch can live. Maybe this is one of them that we missed. ” And, obviously, it is. "Perhaps Sasquatch is angry because the plane shot down one of his family members." And of course it is. Along with these scenes, there is a pair of "Oh my God, this is a sasquatch, oh wait, it's just you!" scenes, and, unfortunately, they are one of the worst. <br /> <br /> Then, finally, people start dying. Well, at least 2 people. In addition, the bodies of past victims were found. The scene of death is rather lame. Basically, it just stays in our imagination, showing how Sasquatch captures them, then goes over to another stage, but first we encounter some terrible screams from the camera. <br /> <br /> Then, finally, we get to see the final battle of the main character with the monster. I have to admit, I found it quite exciting while it lasted. But, alas, this is not long enough, and after we turn to the final, which makes half the weak effort to seem mysterious. Then a small final text with a rather boring conclusion. <br /> <br /> I can not say that I recommend this film. It's not bad enough to give Mystery Science Theater 3000, and it is definitely not scary enough and boring to enjoy like a horror movie. Just don't worry about it.
