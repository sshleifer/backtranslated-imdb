Slayer is a meaningless vampire film with a few twists of an ancient plot. A special operational team is sent to South America to hunt down the bloodsucking locals. Their leader is a real old man who has aged well. There is an ecological twist, as vampires attack villages because their rainforest and old diet of wild animals disappear because of greedy corporations and farmers. Lost fights and so much blood, they just did not bother to wash the entire movie. Looks like they slept in bloodied clothes and were covered in blood. While each actor brought his own talents, he really didnâ€™t all click like a movie. The effects were fine, with the exception of vampires hanging from buildings on wires. If you are looking for a lot of blood and violence, this is for you.
