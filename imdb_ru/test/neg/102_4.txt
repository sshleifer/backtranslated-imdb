Of course, I saw a preview for this at the beginning of some other extravaganza of Lion's Gate, so, of course, these were only the best parts and therefore it looked intriguing. And that, to the point. A young student (Sara) finds riddles everywhere and becomes obsessed with responding to them, while she involuntarily becomes involved in some kind of game. Now it is quite intriguing, but, unfortunately, everything becomes rather confusing and so complicated that the viewer (like me) is likely to be disappointed. Characters appear with a little introduction, and you are not quite sure who they are or why Sarah knows them or hangs out with them. All this is somehow connected with this woman who tried to drown the little boy many years ago, and her reason for this was that it was "all part of the design." In fact, this is all part of a “very sketchy scenario,” and when the film ends, you will feel that you have lost about one and a half hours of your life, which you want to return for more productive use of your time. for example, cleaning the bathroom. 4 out of 10
