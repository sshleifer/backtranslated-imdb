Awful staging is not considered a “film”. It was obviously filmed on videotape, and very bad! The sound constantly sounds like the sound of a bad microphone, and it's so annoying that sometimes you can't understand what the characters are saying. Badly dubbed music suddenly appears in the scene, and all editing this item is rated as ZERO! <br /> <br /> The plot is far-fetched and ridiculous. In the late 20s a man tries to hide his live lover from his parents at a party? YOU ARE WELCOME! And the reaction of the mother, when she finds a photo of her son, kissing his boyfriend, goes beyond melodrama and turns into nonsense. Talk about a stereotypical picture of a fun life! Acting worse porn, and the direction is very poor! <br /> <br /> As far as the “production” goes, there is no any! <br /> <br /> This title is simply an unfortunate video called “Film.” There is no heart and soul to give him even the slightest praise. <br /> <br /> It's just a silly waste of time, so avoid it at all costs! Bad action! Bad spelling! BAD GUIDANCE, and the name “producer” is vanity, since this garbage probably cost them the price of a video tape they were shot at. <br /> <br /> This garbage does not make sense to get on the DVD because it is deceptive to cunsomer. I can not emphasize how terrible this nonsense is "SUGARPLUM"! <br /> <br />
