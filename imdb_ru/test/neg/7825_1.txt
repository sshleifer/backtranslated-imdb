The trailer is so deceptive ... I thought it would be a good movie ... Whatâ€™s the point of bringing women in Hong Kong for murder? They could do it in Paris. And the first half hour: <br /> <br /> -You love me! <br /> <br /> -No! -You love me! <br /> <br /> -No! -You love me! <br /> <br /> -No, no! I repeat 100 times ... then ... Well, I do not love you ... So I shoot you! : D So that's why movie piracy is a good thing! Imagine if I even gave money for this torture! I apologize for the time I lost watching this ... the filmmakers have to pay me for the inconvenience ... The worst movie I've ever seen ...
