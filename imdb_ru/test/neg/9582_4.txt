I can not believe the number of reviewers who rate it as realistic. I am a million miles away from being an expert, and I never intend to climb a mountain; but even the most basic knowledge gained from reading Into Thin Air and watching Everest Beyond The Limit and several other Everest documents meant that this film became more and more ridiculous as it continued. In the beginning there are good climbing frames; and when the leader of the billionaire mission asks at the beginning of the film “What Experience Do You Have Above 8000 Meters?”, I enthusiastically hoped that this could be a sandy and accurate odyssey “Man vs. Nature” Instead, you have a group of climbers who climb a mountain without acclimatization; climbing with glasses in full sun, and they barely breathe, performing miraculous feats of endurance. Only near the summit is a slight fatigue offered to sharply emphasize the physical feat of climbing such a monstrous summit, almost like an afterthought. If you don’t know anything about mountaineering, take a look at it: be prepared for some clichéd heroics (though not more clichéd than a hundred other tolerantly distracting clicks) and clichéd results. I developed a slight fascination with high mountains and looked forward to watching K2; but apart from some amazingly beautiful landscapes, it was a disappointment, because it was so far from reality. I can imagine that some experts were hired to create this film, but then it’s convenient to ignore them in pursuit of a heroic and sadly fantastic storyline. In addition, you would sound like a tit if you said “Welcome to the death zone” at 200,000 feet.
