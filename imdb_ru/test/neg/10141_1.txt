it's really a “good” series .. everything is pretty good about it. but I just can't take Reba. she tries to be funny, but she is simply not like that, and then she has a dull accent !! if they had taken her from the show, I would love to watch it every day. <br /> <br /> I watch the show after 10 minutes, and, as I said, Reba destroys the show. however, the 20-year-old boy (doesn't know his name), but he is so funny, and he really saves it all .. <br /> <br /> so here’s the recipe for a great show. hit Reba, and then put the 20-year-old guy in the lead. <br /> <br /> I really hope that someone out there will agree with me and think (like me) that they should kick Reba out of the show and put someone else in the lead role
