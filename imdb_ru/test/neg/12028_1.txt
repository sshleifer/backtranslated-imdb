It was honestly the worst movie I've ever seen. The acting was terrible, the storyline was also bad. however, it was a good idea. if there were better cinematography and much better actors in this film, I could say something better. Edgar Allen Poe was a great gothic writer, and this film simply destroyed it. why people should always kill good stories by making bad movies. the only good part was when the killer put his head under the floor with a tape, it was pretty good. the swinging ax was just awful, there was absolutely no expectation. and also, when the killer pursues everyone around, in the end, he moved from one place to another in a matter of seconds, it is absolutely meaningless.
