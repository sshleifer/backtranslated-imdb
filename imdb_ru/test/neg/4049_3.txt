Despite its ambitious ambitions, the film Zurlini should be seen as a failure. It's one thing to create a world that will make the viewer feel the boredom and longing that the main character is experiencing (which, I think, was what Zurlini was trying to do). Another thing is to make a film that is dull and senseless in itself. Despite the beautiful cinematography in a haunting place - and a wonderful score - the film never entices viewers. Too much is unintentionally ridiculous (for example, the fake sound of dripping water in Dragoâ€™s apartments or the robbery of a silent film by some of the actors) or just confusing (why Drago wants to leave the fort for the first time?) For the film to succeed as a coordinated work.
