Hello everyone, <br /> <br /> I bought it on DVD from England. You see, I have one of those multi-regional players. I thought it would be great to get a cool movie for my friends. Well, surprise for Amy-Jo Johnson, she is barely in the film. Although it is on the cover. Itâ€™s really hard to imagine how this bad film was made. Maybe someone has a trust fund. <br /> <br /> Oh ... This is about vampires who live on the beach
