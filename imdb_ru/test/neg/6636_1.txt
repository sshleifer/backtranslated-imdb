This is without a doubt the most poorly thought film in history. The fun of the invention from the Carrot Top - one of the most terrible attempts to be fun in the history of humanity I am not familiar with his other work, but if it is half so bad, I will simply pay. I give this film 1 of 30 billion stars, and may God have mercy on the souls of the guilty.
