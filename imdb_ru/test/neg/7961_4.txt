If there is one thing I want to distinguish from all the other great reviewers, this is what I am queen of searching for strange films in charity and dollar stores. However, you cannot imagine how happy I was when I found this. <br /> <br /> I can even remember this Saturday morning, when * each * station broadcast it at the same time, so you're stuck if you want to watch something else (again, I think it was an idea). As a child I didn’t know if I liked the way all the different characters were glued together (there are some crossovers that just don’t work). But I think that the special forces had an intended effect. Do not take drugs, because you will have nightmares about dolls. <br /> <br /> Now, if you look at it like an adult, on the other hand, you will end up in the weirdest drug film. this side is "Reefer Madness". I think I'll just leave it before I have a problem.
