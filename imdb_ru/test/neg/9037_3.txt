Another movie that makes The Beach Boys story worse than it is. I especially remember the scene when Brian said that he was leaving the tour, and the other guys called him a traitor. I didn’t have such a thing, and, as the film shows at the beginning, some scenes are overestimated. A film about The Beach Boys doesn’t have to be that way because a lot of things happened in any case. The sad thing is that this film gives the wrong idea about boys to those who are not very familiar with the group. Fans like me knew that it wasn’t the whole true story, so I gave it a low rating of 3. However, this is the best film about Beach Guys I’ve ever seen that says a lot of other movies. If you want the truth, I recommend the Endless Harmony documentary.
