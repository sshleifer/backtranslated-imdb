This film is of interest to fans of the famous rock band "The Band", in which the singer / keyboard player Richard Manuel appears in several scenes. It seems to me that the film could have been shot several years before 75, judging by Richard's appearance. Interestingly, Jones will later be filmed with Levon Group in the significantly better film "Miner's Daughter." Anyway, you really need a special reason to survive this tough one to watch a feature film. Alas, famously sensitive Manuel will commit suicide. I never heard him go to the movies. Four out of five band members will appear in another bad movie, “Man outside”.
