I watched the version with pretentious American overlays, perhaps it made it much worse, but from what I could see, the film was still pretty bad. It seemed like a low budget. The visual effects reminded me of a second-rate television film, an occasional white dog replacing Dogmatix, embarrassing 60s BBC costumes, and so on. Basically, I feel that the characters in the film do not behave like comics characters, and As a result, I never felt the desire to even forgive a bad kind of film. It will always be difficult to capture comics in a movie without animation, and I did not feel that this attempt was worth the end result.
