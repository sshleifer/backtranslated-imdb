I bought a DVD to get Julia Ormond. Well, I got it in peaks. She was beautiful in the romantic scenes; Too bad Bill Paxton has been flying on autopilot all this time. I almost lost my lunch when he pulled his big fat white from the back out of his flight suit, say, “get engaged” to Julia. <br /> <br /> I realized that Julia spoke French very well, watching her in Sabrina. ". I watched Sabrina with a French soundtrack to see if Julia duplicates her own dialogue. They used someone else. In any case, Julia was chosen for this Dutch film, and not a native French speaker with enough English to communicate with the American pilot. Perhaps they wanted at least one familiar name for the British / American market. In my unfamiliar look, the features of Julia could have passed for the Belgian. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was of a weird nature. It was a Dutch film about Belgium in World War II. I could assume that national pride would require the theme of the heroic resistance of the Dutch to the German invaders. The Belgians were much more passive during the occupation than the French or the Norwegians. The most fierce battles of all occurred in the Balkans, where Tito’s communist guerrillas fits the Germans. <br /> <br /> In another review, I noticed that dbdumonteil believed that Julia Ormond was an American, not a British citizen. Perhaps Julia’s acting skills were large enough to leave that impression. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, it suddenly dawned on me that the film was out of season. It was installed on June 16, 1944, when an American plane crashed in a Belgian farming country. The trees look mid-autumn with lots of leaves, and the weather is warm. People wear light clothing, and the grass is still green. There is not the slightest trace of snow or ice. It must have been the mildest winter in Belgium. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film was erratic. Where to begin? For anyone interested in the history of the Second World War, the film seemed farcical. As a reconnaissance aircraft used a huge four-engine converted bomber. Such aircraft existed, but they would need a massive escort of fighters in order to have at least some chance of survival. In fact, smaller and faster aircraft would be easily accessible and would be much more suitable for this task. The life codebooks in the film would never be transferred to a plane. The crew did not need this information to complete their mission, and compromising this information would be a huge defeat for intelligence. Even with the premise of the film, the first elements to be removed from the aircraft will be code books. They were supposed to go to Berlin 10 minutes after the arrival of the German troops at the crash site. <br /> <br /> The Daussua House, where Major Bryce was hiding, was a farm where no one had the least interest in agriculture. There would be very little food in Belgium at that time. Germans would need a significant amount of locally produced food to support their troops. The family truck would have been expropriated long before the arrival of the American pilot. In any case, there would be no fuel to launch it. <br /> <br /> The turn of the plot in which Henri Daussua turns into an American because of jealousy is pathetic. He would have to reveal everything he knew about resistance in order to allow him to live. He had to act as a double agent in order to thwart any effective opposition. A woman with a secret radio would never survive the war. <br /> <br /> Major Bryce was caught in civilian clothing by the end of the film. This made him a spy under the laws of war and was subject to execution without protection. He would not humbly surrender to appear before the interrogation without any restrictions from the Geneva Convention. It is better to make them kill him and spare his friends, if possible. <br /> <br /> I did not read the novel on which this film is based. If this film is a true adaptation, it shows a terrible lack of development in the novel. Regardless of the novel, the writers could easily create an excellent script that would not miss this opportunity to create a much better film.
