Komodo vs Cobra is not going to set the world on fire. This is not a distinctive feature of the history of cinema. This is a group of under-funded directors trying to make another film, earn another salary, and continue to support themselves and their families. Thus, I give these efforts a great weakness. C'mon, being a Russian special effects specialist should be difficult. There are not many big budget films. BUT - they are a committed bunch and are more than willing to throw all their strength into what the American monster needs in films at an affordable price. And I enjoy finding the same places that appear over and over in these films. If for some reason you look at it again, look at the sequence in which Pare and the company go through the jungle. Look at their legs and you will see paved paths. And if you still have a copy of AI Assault (shown a week or two earlier also on SciFi), you will see that people roam there in the same jungle of ersatz. If you think about it, I think that helicopters are landing on the same glade in both films. I can admire the thrift of these films. Every dollar really appears on the screen! It is a pity that just do not have enough dollars ......
