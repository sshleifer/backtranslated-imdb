Shade is trying its best to become another Sting, replacing poker with jumps as a means by which to defeat the enemy, but it fails miserably. <br /> <br /> I watched it all and could not do it. It is completely understandable why the young guy wanted to deceive his partner. Is it because his partner stole his girlfriend? Is there a woman in the world who is worth the trouble? If there is, then this, of course, was not this obstinate. She had no redemptive qualities, and did she now have a special room so that the surgeon could remove a kidney from someone who tried to pick her up at the bar? Dina Merrill looks short as a rich woman who, in any case, arranges poker parties in her luxurious home. And then the players say something like: "I will look at your thousand and collect another five thousand." Give me a break. You cannot call ("see") and raise, you do one or the other. Any child playing nickel and pennies at the kitchen table knows this; you would think that adults playing at such high stakes - or at least the mentors who wrote the script - know this too. <br /> <br /> One of the other authors mentioned that there is no high-limit poker game. allow players to actually turn in their own cards, and I agree. You do not allow the two most famous car cheats in the game, where the buy-in is $ 250,000, and then you allow them to communicate with each other. This is not poker; it's just a vision of someone who can be cheated better. And I would like to know what sane person will participate in the game, in which the two most famous card cheaters are playing, and expect that he may have a chance to win? And most of all, what kind of mafia boss will launch such a game? Every time Melanie Griffith appeared on the screen, I was so hypnotized by her gigantic fluorescent red lips that I completely lost the storyline, and seeing how she and Stallone together seemed more like a public service announcement about plastic surgery that didn’t as love. Stallone mentions that she used to be a fraud before she bought the restaurant she currently runs, but we don’t know how she was a fraud, and we will never see how she worked with Stallone in their young years, so we can only ask question, we even care. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx is the best character in the entire movie, but he is killed right away, and we still have cardboard cutouts that sound like they’re reading their lines from a teleprompter just behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> The ending also does not make sense. The kid gets his share of the game and just goes down the street with a briefcase full of money, and his partner is nowhere to be seen? Mafia does not follow his every step? All the rest just shrug their shoulders and calmly accept the loss of millions of dollars, not trying to recoup it? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Most of all, this movie makes a big injustice to professional poker players all over the world, hinting that the only way to win is to lay out cards and play from the “juice” deck. And why are they always good kings and aces ? Sometimes you need three or nine to fill a street house or a full house. <br /> <br /> The best parts of the whole film are sleight of hand deceptions during the initial and final credits; everything in between is funny.
