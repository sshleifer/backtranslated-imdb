Gene Hackman is a former Marine Colonel who collects several private Vietnamese veterinarians to return to Laos and save some of the Americans who are missing in action. Hackman suspects that in fact half a dozen or so Ministry of Internal Affairs is secretly kept in a remote camp by Laotian people in order to be tortured and provided with more hard labor. Hackman is paid by rich Robert Stack, whose son, like Hackman's son, is considered one of the employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. But the circumstances are such that Hackman can only buy old and outdated weapons, although he manages to enlist the support of an ardent anti-communist loatian and his two daughters. <br /> <br /> I don’t think the film was specifically designed to support the myth that the Vietnamese still hold our MVD for propaganda purposes. The myth was real enough. If anyone remembers, in 1982 and 1983 there were a lot of bumper stickers, “TAKE THE MOI”. Instead, I think the film was made partly to capitalize on the myth. It was absurd at first glance. Why our former enemy refused to return the Interior Ministry? Propaganda? Where is propaganda value in something that is kept secret? Add labor supply? Do they need a hundred extra workers in Vietnam and Laos? The motives of this film - with its triumphant music and plenty of body - were ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But what about the movie itself? Deprived of his theme of saving the mythical mockeries of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, he is an ordinary militant militant, no better and no worse than dozens of others that appeared in the 1980s. Gene Hackman's performance is the only one that manages to keep his head above water. It is almost always reliable. <br /> <br /> With regard to others, the fact that it was a sample plot, based, among other things, on the Dirty Dozen, I continued to try to guess which gang would sacrifice itself for the mission. Of the three anti-communist Asians, I thought that one or more were dead meat. That's why Asian helpers appear in such films. (I was right two times out of three.) I also thought that Patrick Swayze was a former novice officer, the youngest of the group, who never “earned the respect” of others because he had never seen a fight. something heroic mode. Wrong. He becomes a hero, true, but survives in its original form. I thought there was a fifty-fifty chance that Hackman would have to go too, but he understood that well. The formula doesn't really extend to originality. The claustrophobic prisoner of war, Charles Bronson from The Great Runaway, is located near the former tunnel rat of Fred Ward, a claustrophobe who is forced to crawl along a drainage pipe with a snake inside so that he can conduct reconnaissance in the Laotian prisoners of war camp. <br /> <br /> The name “Unusual Valor” comes from the tribute Admiral Nimitz made to people on Iwo Jima: “Unusual valor was commonplace that day.” Nimitz certainly was right about that. Whether people who fought in Vietnam are equally valiant or not is irrelevant. Anyone who saw the fight or even approached him, putting his life for the guys next to them, was quite heroic. This film and the way it uses our bitterness about the Vietnam War does not really justify them.
