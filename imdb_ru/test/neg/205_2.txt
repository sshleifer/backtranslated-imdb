What a bad movie, all the prerequisites were there, all the actors were there. And yet the plausible plot, good dialogue, the characters, which could be treated, were somewhat overlooked. <br /> <br /> A typical robbery didn’t go as much as a package against the background of how the system substitutes each person. The main character Ty and his younger brother did not have good luck, and their house will be returned, along with godfather Matt Dillon (who doesn’t look much older than Ty, so he’s not quite sure how it happened) to save himself with a plan to steal money from an armored vehicle. the van on which they work as security guards. Ty has a brief flirtation with conscience, but he decides to go along with it. And so begins a truly terrible hole, in which 30 minutes of incredible garbage. I will not list all the ways this film was unrealistic, but let me point out the main ones: <br /> <br /> Because Ty decided to become a good guy because the homeless received collateral damage, everything his close friends, including his godfather, die. His godfather, presumably the family and the man who at the last minute brought him to capers to help him out, is dying because of Ty. Ty in the process of undermining his friends and godfather destroys all the money. The money came from the same bank that took his house. And yet he chose him because of Matt Dillon's supposed family. <br /> <br /> There are many others, not to mention the fact that this film was a hoax, and I sincerely hope that no one else will see it.
