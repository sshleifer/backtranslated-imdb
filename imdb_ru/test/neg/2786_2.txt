I woke up and it was a beautiful day; The sun was shining, the birds were singing, and I wanted to get a movie, something new, a horror movie, maybe? Like many other reviewers, I came across what can only be described as a piece of navels in a golden wrapper. The front cover is gorgeous, and the comment on the back fascinates - “it will scare you,” oh, how I laugh, looking back at such naivety and ignorance. <br /> <br /> One of many things worse than this movie is the acting skills of these “actors.” I think, no, I really cheered up when they were cut by these “stuffed animals” who were dressed in classic costumed costumes. I used to rather quickly pass by corn fields, because at night it seemed to me that they were rather scary, but when I saw this film, I almost wetted (laughing so much) as I saw it. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I saw a more scary omelet, but not mine, but I really love cooking an omelet, and if someone associates this film with my omelet, let's say, I would create a situation will be forced to watch this movie 3 times in a row. <br /> <br /> If anyone has any good corn films (not in pop music) that they can recommend, feel free to let me know. This is a great comedy, if nothing else, well, this is nothing else. Enjoy, but a little tip - before you press the play button on your DVD player, throw it out the window.
