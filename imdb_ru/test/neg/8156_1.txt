It is rare to find a film so bad that it reaches the often sought-after paradigm, which has so little redemptive value that it alone makes it worth seeing. "Cyclone", I am pleased to announce that this is such a film. <br /> <br /> I realized that something good was waiting for me as soon as I found the video. I, at least, its fourth owner: he has a sticker “Sale of films! $ 9.95 ”front and one dollar sale sticker. I took it at a thrift shop for fifty cents. <br /> <br /> Selling used films! the sticker covers most of the pictures on the front cover. This means that what I see is a really strange mixed image of the front of the Cyclone supercycle, the car rolled over in flames, and Heather Thomas, wearing Flouncy Eighties Hair, with her mouth open. an expression that says: "I have a headache." I saw it and thought: “That's right.” Honestly, this case was enough (“there is nowhere to turn and trust no one, Teri plunged into a maze of danger and deception”), but I was surprised to actually take time to watch it. I always find time for really bad movies. This tape "Fight Club" can wait. <br /> <br /> Get to know Teri. Teri is an incredibly well-developed character, as we can tell from her introduction, in which she and her friend perform exercises that emphasize her chest and then her leggings. Then Teri leaves to meet her boyfriend for the evening, who is going terribly wrong. Before she finds out about this, Teri is being driven "right into the web of deadly double crosses in a CYCLONE." The VHS window says that it is. <br /> <br /> Leaving a resume out of the box - perhaps because of some faint hope that the real copies of this film will be sold - how awful the game is. Perhaps it was just me, but I kept thinking that I could read the thoughts of the characters through their eyes. "This is stupid," thinks Heather Thomas. “I know,” thinks the Bad Guy with his mouth wide too. <br /> <br /> The driving force (without pun intended) for the second half of this epic picture is car chases. In fact, they were pretty good, although I tend to believe that gasoline does not need to be taught to explode. What really impressed me was that in all the chases the streets were almost empty. As if in this huge city only twenty people. <br /> <br /> I know what you're thinking. You think: “Gee, Wilikers! I have to see this movie! ”Sadly, you can't find it. Oh no. “Cyclone” is a film that finds YOU. Just wait. Someday — perhaps during lunch, perhaps late in the evening, perhaps “when military scientist Jeffrey Combs (“ Rescuer ”) will be killed by hired killers” - you will hear the rustle of the Guardians and find out it's time.
