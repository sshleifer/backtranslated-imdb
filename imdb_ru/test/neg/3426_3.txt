Very promoted, smooth, sharp reinterpretation. <br /> <br /> They fell into the "because it is modern, it must be spun, smooth, etc." a trap. <br /> <br /> Romeo and Juliet have embodied this idea much more successfully, but I really think it’s time to go beyond the two extremes here (a historical film versus a sharp film). <br /> The fact that this is a “modern” retelling does not mean that the film should look like an advertisement in a magazine or have anything to do with drugs or weapons. <br /> <br /> If the attributes were Thin, like sweet words, Macbeth would be a much stronger film. As it is, read your Shakespeare. Read it out loud. Ask your Oxford dictionary a few questions. Skip the movie. Or not, but you were warned. <br /> <br /> Sorry for a very long review. IMDb made me do it.
