This film somehow shows 6.2 stars. It seems incredible that the director has so many relationships. I find it difficult to explain it. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs. You only have a certain number of hours on Earth, do not spend 1 and 1/2 of them on this backward steaming pile of Guano !!! <br /> <br /> There is no story, as the director apparently wrote (and I guess with a dull orange pencil) the script for the next day after the shooting of the day. The “story” was called whimsical, no, it is aimless, perhaps the “story” is enough to fill the commercial. Do not you hate advertising? <br /> <br /> Now that both parties can act, they obviously decided not to. And in the same way, a writer / director can actually write and direct, as evidenced by his next work, Toy Love. <br /> <br /> Recall, even if you get this movie for free, even if you get paid be careful, avoid it. <br /> <br /> Paraphrasing "Monty Python in Search of the Holy Grail", "Run, Run!"
