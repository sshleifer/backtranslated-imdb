This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen. It was a complete waste of money. If I had not been to the cinema, if my two cousins ​​would have been (who also thought it was disappointing, but not as bad as I thought), I would have left the cinema. There were two moments in the film that I almost laughed at, but the rest was boring, funny or painful. I thought it would be a parody of all the superhero movies (which I love), but in fact it was mainly based on Spider-Man, with a few indirect references to other superhero movies, such as the Fantastic Four and Batman. I really can't think of any good things to say about this movie. Do not waste your money with this movie - there are many other best movies!
