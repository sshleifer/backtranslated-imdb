This film did not give Mr Bachchan justice. He is a great actor, and I was very disappointed in the film, and there was not a lot of plot. The fact is, this is the first film in which I was disappointed with it. It all starts with the fact that she comes to his house with her daughter, and he is a photographer. He takes pictures of her in the garden when she comes down. He is a sixty-year-old man who has nothing to do except to photograph this girl. The film does not make sense. The whole film is about how she pursues him and tells how much she cares about him. Then his daughter falls, and he must take this girl in places so that she does not miss, and the daughter will find out. I just did not think that this film meets the standards of Bachchan. He's better than this movie. I always represented him as an honest person, and then I saw him in this film, and I could not imagine him in this film. The film did not interest me at all. I could not wait for the end of the film. And neither will you.
