Yes, the video cover of this movie made me want to see this movie as a child. On this cover, it was called "Screamers" with the inscription "Men turned inside out!". The cover even showed this twisted skeleton, which made me see all sorts of cool bloody images. Maybe a movie about a strange virus that caused a person to burn flesh, maybe a film about undead zombies that look bloodier than what you usually get, a scientific experiment was incredibly wrong, and now strange people with the flesh flow their bones rage. Yes, all these thoughts flashed through my head, one of those who were not fish guys on an island with almost no blood and boredom. This film is really more like Dr. Moreau's Island than anything else, and, frankly, this film is also boring to me, this is a way to teach many and not enough to kill for my tastes. These films are very important, but there is not enough blood for my taste. Yes, I know, I have strange tastes, but I can't help it, I like my horror films, either really bloody or fast moving, and the movie is really exciting too.
