If a copy of this film falls into the wrong hands, the world will be in grave danger. I am a big fan of B films, and I have seen my share of bad ones, but there is no letter in the alphabet that could adequately describe this rancid piece of hardened vomit. This film even surpasses the “so bad, it's good” phase and immediately moves to the “so bad that your world will seem a little less meaningful to watch it.” <br /> <br /> It is difficult to say what is more alarming: .1. The fact that the people who wrote this considered them a political satire (I use the term very, very, very at ease) is ingenious enough to film. 2. They were able to find so many other people who agreed with them enough to work on this garbage, obviously, for little money or without money .3. Someone really thought that it would be nice to pick up this shit to be distributed on a DVD with a horror anthology. <br /> <br /> If I were weaker, I would most likely have squeezed a spoonful of grapefruit in my eyes, and then blindly rushed to die in the oncoming traffic after seeing this. Anyway, I live, but I am traumatized forever by this experience.
