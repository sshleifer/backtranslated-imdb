I accidentally stumbled upon this film, and I wish I had done so. <br /> <br /> Why make a sexually rude sequel (and some blood when a man is beheaded) from a well-known children's film. <br /> Do not take small children to see that the heading misleads you, this has nothing to do with the original Snow White, except for stealing his characters. Better still, don't bother yourself, it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> I couldn't watch it all, the bad (compared to Disney) animated graphics, and no conspiracy except to completely screw up a classic movie made me want to give up and leave.
