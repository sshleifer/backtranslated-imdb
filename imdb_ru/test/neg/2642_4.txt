Milo is another answer to a question that no one has ever asked. Do we really need more slashers? I think we already have more than enough. I think professional high guys are overwhelmed, so we are dealing with a suicidal child who is also a zombie or a ghost when he feels that way. Long ago, he drowned, but that didn't bother him, and he still kills people ("Friday the 13th," what is this?). One day, his survivors have a big reunion and as an unexpected turn, Milo comes to pay them a visit. Through some really bad shots that show everything except the killings, the cast is thinned out until only the last girl is left to find out boring Milo, I mean the dark secret. She and her friends are eager to find out as soon as they discover that Milo continues another killing fury (doesn't she, he still does not go to bed?), And the girl, well, she screams a lot. The game is not even the bottom, the barrel refuses to associate with it. Milo can be one creepy bastard, from time to time I give him that, but some movies simply cannot be saved without a good script or excessive nudity.
