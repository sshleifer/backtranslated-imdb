Predictable, unmotivated, pointless cartoons. Invented actors did everything they could. The actors clearly indicated that they were embarrassed to do this. Not a single emotional connection. REAL SEQUENCE OF THE FILM “Whom do you call?” (Sic) “Police” (sic) “You can't do this, Stevie. Hang up "(sic)" Jessie got a crazy load of money for drugs, you can not involve the police "(SIC)" I'm not sure that stealing money from criminals is a crime. Even if they arrest him, at least he will be alive ”(SIC)“ Listen to me, Stevie, this is not right, Jesse is going to end up dead. Now hang up this e-phone. "(SIC) The best friend starts to load the weapon Brother," Hey, what are you doing? "There is no answer." Hey, I have a family to worry about. " the child is sitting right there watching all this.) Then more and more and more exposure <br /> <br /> Notice how, in the above sequence, the police on the other line never said: “Hello? Hello? Uh, we hear everything you say. We are sending someone there right now. "<br /> <br /> Embarrassment for everyone. Unfortunately.
