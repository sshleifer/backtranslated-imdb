I know that I loved this movie when I was 12-14 years old. Now that I am 24 years old, I looked at it again, and I would like it to be not. Because everything I laughed at when I was younger is no longer funny. so it's an hour and a half without fun. For me, the jokes were lame, not funny or just too childish. The same thing that I liked about the movie when I was a kid, now that's what I don't like about him. Besides the fact that it is not funny, in fact it is not so at all. The evil character is very poorly made, but I think this is such a movie. And the last 20 minutes of the film are pretty lame with bad fight episodes and so on ... But if you are young, you will probably like it. I rate this movie 4/10
