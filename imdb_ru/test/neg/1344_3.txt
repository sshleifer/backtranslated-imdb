I have never seen the original version of the film of the 1930s, but this remake is one of the worst I have seen at a major production studio in recent years. Seeing actors, such as Meg Ryan and Annette Bening, once close to their talent level, sleepwalking through badly written roles is painful. It seems that in this film no one wanted to be in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Jada Pinkett Smith and Debra Messing play useless roles that have nothing to do with the plot and add no entertainment value. Jada Pinkett Smith's character is used as nothing more than a ploy to look modern with an African American lesbian character, but in fact she is here to just look cool. There is no real reason why Messing is in this film, except to indicate the number of women in the original that I take. <br /> <br /> The side characters played by Eva Mendes and DÃ©bi Mazar are stereotypical female characters with Mendes. portrays a fox that wants to steal a rich, but bored and slightly dismissive husband and Mazars, playing roles in gossip. <br /> <br /> The film is boring, it lacks charm, humor or sympathy for any characters. It seemed that the film was a punishment for all participants, whether in front of the camera or behind it. <br /> <br /> There is one shimmering hope in the film, no matter how little it shines in the dim light and the dying stars around it - Cloris Lichman. Lichman is still an amazing talent, which brings her wonderful charm and humor to the film, in her small role.
