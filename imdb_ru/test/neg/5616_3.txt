For example, I really expected this film to be quite good, perhaps my expectations were too high, but the fact is that I love Judd Nelson. In fact, he is the only reason this film is worth seeing, and in fact his role is not that great. The highlights of this film are dirty sex scenes and a boring dialogue. If this is the main point, I’m sure you’ll get a pretty good idea of ​​what kind of movie it is. There is a definite reason why this was made for a television movie. Just see if you have nothing to do on Friday night or you just want to spend money on video rental. Save your time and rent The Breakfast Club!
