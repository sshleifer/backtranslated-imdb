I sat last night to see how this film will be shown on Greek television due to the upcoming Olympics taking place in my city. Knowing that this is an American film, I already expected that it would focus on the history of American athletes. And I was really ready for it. But what I saw was ... too much! I mean that when the film has such a name (“First Olympiad: Athens, 1896”), even if it is of American origin, you do not expect it to be so propaganda and, at the same time, ignorant of athletes and the efforts of other countries. American athletes seem to have all the gifts of nature (strength, intelligence, generosity, kindness, politeness ...), unlike their "sinful athletes" in the Games, who seem incapable of even ... expressing their thoughts or expressing feelings. The number of times the American national anthem is played during a film should be a record in the history of cinema. Megalomania at its best! It even uses fictional facts that are ridiculed by the Greek nation, such as the Greek citizens who serve wine to foreign marathon athletes, to help the race win nationals. So much for the Olympic spirit. <br /> <br /> Think about it. Being a Greek and a bad score of the film, whose name is also Greek, is something that does not please me at all. but, according to what I saw, I can’t give him more than 4 out of 10 (actually, quite generously).
