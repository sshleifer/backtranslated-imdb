Super Scarp fare for a slasher that feels too long at 80 minutes. Several years ago, a group of "Gypsies" who lived in mountain caves were burned in a forest fire. Over the years, vacationers disappear from the fire zone. Of course, a bunch of excited children go to the area for a depraved hike. Despite the ominous reception of the forester (Jackson Bostvik), children, in any case, run to the mountain. Soon the children begin to break away from the monster, which remains invisible until the very end of the film, probably because the makeup was so embarrassingly bad. It is not surprising that they are being talked about: they are killed in the order in which the formula for these films is dictated, leaving the “last girl” to the mercy of fate for themselves, although in a refreshingly depressed denouement the last girl is in prison and is saturated with a monster. <br /> <br /> The story itself could not bear the weight of the plot length, so it was supplemented with seemingly endless pictures of wildlife and insects that were obviously shot for another film and accidentally added here as a means to make a film enough long for the release of the video. Wildlife shots, on the other hand, are pretty good. Also among the highlights are Bostwick talking to a young deer, a worthy climbing sequence, OK Gore and the Great Jackie Coogan in his last movie role, as a clumsy local sheriff. This is far from Charlie Chaplin, but still it was nice to see him. This is only for slasher finalists.
