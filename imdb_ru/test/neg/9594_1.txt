******** SPOILER WARNING ************** Wasted 85 minutes of my life watching this “movie”. First, we think it’s funny that the producer starred in the film as a doctor at the autopsy with a terrible incredible incredible accent - what the hell was Romanian anyway? And why in Denmark, no one speaks Danish, except for swamp creatures? (Note the director of the Scottish camp ...). ? And who is shopping for swamp creatures? Their pants looked like they were bought in the Banana Republic. Very nicely dressed for 1200 years. This one was worse than the Silecrow Scarecrow (we didn’t even think it was possible). We basically quickly advance through 75% of the film in search of bloody, deadly and scary moments None found. Rent a DVD only to watch the 2-hour film “Behind the Scenes of Marsh Creatures”. Who are these people? Are they serious? And the film makers are 60 years old. I think that this is their holy grail, and this is quite a pity in itself. <br /> <br /> THE BEST LINE from the film, hands down: “Not bad for a girl who didn’t even go to graduate school ....” My blind grandmother, who has Alzheimer's disease, could have made a better film.
