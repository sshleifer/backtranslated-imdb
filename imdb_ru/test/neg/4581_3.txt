Living in Edinburgh and experiencing a strong thirst for history, I was very detached from the "imprisoned". Wrong breed of dogs to start! The owner of Bobbys Old Jock was an elderly lonely man who came to Edinburgh and died in poverty in an apartment, not at all like in the film. For those who come to Edinburgh and hope to see the sights of the film, you will not find a cemetery in Princes Street Gardens! There were a few moments when the fabrics would be great. The actors were brilliant in the selection of a rather fragile script. I donâ€™t feel that poor tiny Bobby actually got enough screen time, perhaps because he was lost at some point. All that said, the film was fine, and any 8-year-old will enjoy.
