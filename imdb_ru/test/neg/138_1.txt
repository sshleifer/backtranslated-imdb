I BUY THIS (1997) <br /> <br /> Developed and published No Limit Films <br /> <br /> >> Pros: absolutely not <br /> <br /> >> Cons: I don’t even know , where to begin! <br /> <br /> Short description of the plot: Master P plays a drug dealer who looks, speaks and behaves like a cartoon character. That's the whole story that I got from this movie. <br /> <br /> Review: I remember when I was in the ninth grade at the time of its release, and everyone in my class praised this clown named Master P. Bad, it’s not even funny from stereotypes, the sound is heard only when playing music, and the film looks as if it was filmed from a public channel. Fortunately, I did not buy this film, like all my other bandmates living in the city. <br /> <br /> My rating is: 1 out of 10 <br /> <br /> My verdict: avoid this video as its venereal disease.
