What happened to the RGV? There is so much wrong in this film that you need to stop and decide where to start - first and worst of all - music. Each scene was accompanied by this pretentious background music, which, as I can add, rather pathetically told you about the mood. Secondly, the lighting - do we need such dark scenes when we ask ourselves whether the projector is still working? And finally - if you are going to indize the Godfather and the Godfather 2 - please understand that many of us have seen it. Nayakan was a GF1 robbery, but better made and more interesting. I saw similarities in both “Company” and “Sarkar”, and although RGV’s “Ab Tak Tak 56” was great, these two films leave much to be desired. People will no longer be impressed by just corrupt politicians and everything else. Maybe the RGV is worth seeing Maqbool, which is good enough to be an RGV !!
