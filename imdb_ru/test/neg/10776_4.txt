I seem to disagree with many people here. but I really did not find this film as sparkling as the reviews I read claimed. It was, without doubt, a touching story, and the background of the section created opportunities for the epic. but the film was disappointed. especially for those who saw the "gadar". Despite the leading role of the sun deola and the incessant songs, I must say that Gadar is the best of the two. The story is almost the same. The section failed to create depth in its characters, as well as the scenes that were supposed to have an impact. looking at Christine Hook's accent and small image, which in itself was not an easy job. the characters just didn't seem too real. not that I criticize the actions of any of the leaders. it just didn't work. the atmosphere was well thought out, but the film really lacked content. it's not that I was a solid rambo fan, but some kind of action action outlasted an entire movie or some character development. it all seemed rush to the finish. and the final only added to the audienceâ€™s discontent. <br /> <br /> nonetheles, I must say that it was at least a good effort in the seemingly unfamiliar territory of the director. and if you have not seen a freak, then you like it.
