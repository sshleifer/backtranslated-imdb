No reason to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Why? Many reasons. First, the game is terrible. There is hardly a line that would not be misinterpreted - but this is not surprising, given the commonplace, stupid and repeatable dialogue that the actors are asking to express. It is horribly written. One of the most annoying things in the script is that the authors seem to know only one way to get their characters to speak after a certain point, and that is to make them repeat the most important words of the line from the previous character. <br /> "Repeat?" <br /> <br /> “Yes, they repeat it. For the whole movie. <br /> <br /> "Whole movie?" <br /> <br /> "Yes, the whole movie." <br /> <br />, etc. <br /> <br /> In such films, you usually know who the bad guys are and what they pursue. (All the good guys usually do is stop the bad guys. Creating a good “Mwahahaha! With X in my hands, I will rule the Universe!”, Villain is the first stop in any cheap SF plot), but in this Turkey? - You say me. <br /> <br /> As far as I understand, our “heroes” are a bunch of mass murderers sent back in time with a mission like the “Dirty Dozen”. They are sent by the fascist totalitarian state to prevent other mass murderers from changing the course of history. The new story will not include the rise of totalitarianism and the war, which kills 30 billion people and leaves the Earth a dead planet (we know all this, because this film has one of those handy long messages about the situation on the screen shortly before the start of the action) says you who is who and what is what. This indicates how the producers think that their target audience will be, that it is told just like on the screen - just to save the audience from overloading the brain by doing a lot of reading.) So who are we supposed to be sick here? I assume that we are asked to believe that our hero takes some kind of journey from totalitarianism to love, peace and understanding, shooting many people - but this does not work as an arc, because we are shown that he is a decent person being in early on, when he tries to save all civilians aboard the rebel station. <br /> <br /> I think the creators were aiming for some deeper than usual complexity in this film, but they just ended up with a Unholy mess with more holes in the plot and logical inconsistencies than a dozen or so your regular SF movies. <br /> <br /> The opening credits were good.
