Was bad shot. It looks like an urgent job, at the last moment casting is obvious. The letter is very weak. Good for the scene, not for the movie. I feel bad for Andrew McCarthy. He is a very good actor who has not been getting good roles lately. This role was not for him. Maybe glad he was raised yet. On the festival scheme, this film will remain.
