Rare and favorable moments in filmmaking, when greatness acts as a defining monument for the rest of the industry, with which we can compare, and so that we plunge into this glorious moment. <br /> <br /> Some stories go beyond their time. and strive for the high achievements of the classic and material legends. Add sophisticated acting skills that are at the very top of your game. <br /> <br /> “Where did originality go?” It is here, as in this story, that the story and the story are told, which not only educate, but also entertain even the most experienced connoisseurs of Shakespeare / action / love stories. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine where the authors came up with this unusual story. Where do geniuses have such inspiration? Now I have hope for humanity, knowing that this talent still exists, gives me hope that we will get to the stars and beyond, perhaps to the most heavenly gates. <br /> <br /> I have, like the others before me, dreamed of greatness. Although I did not write this film, I saw it because of the noble grandeur of this film, I feel as if I have been raised to a higher level of being, a higher level of spiritual integrity. <br /> <br /> It is no wonder that such glory eludes most of us. What will happen to our world if we can all achieve this level of magnificence? Probably, we will be swallowed up by the white fire of supernova, when we become trans-dimensional spiritual beings capable of omnipotent creative power. <br /> <br /> The most important thing to know with all your heart and the very essence of your being is that "Tomcats" is not at all what I was talking about. "Cats" is the antithesis of everything I mentioned. It can destroy our world very well. Since some reviewers rate the movie on a star system, that is, from 1 to 5 stars, or even zero stars, I'm going to rate Tomcats by a black hole. <br /> <br /> I’m willing to donate money to a cause that puts an end to these kinds of atrocities that, in recent times, seem to go against the cash registers. I am not even against the use of nuclear weapons. It must stop. How much more of this can we take before aliens from space come here and blow up our planet, because we have so many stupid, rude, vulgar and inappropriate films erupted from Hollywood? I'm not even going to adequately evaluate this film, mentioning someone's name, which was shot or shot in it. I am not even going to waste my time on the description of the story, since we have seen it several times, and all previous versions were at least several times better. <br /> <br /> By the way, my head almost exploded during this film, but thanks to my dedicated efforts and luck, I survived to warn the public. You have been warned.
