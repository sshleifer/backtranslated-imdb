I saw this movie a few years ago, and a man whom I never want to play golf again. I mean, ninjas obviously don't respect golf or the way it evolved. And I'm not talking about “no victims” things, such as fake scorecards. No no. Based on what I saw here, they are shamelessly cracking down on police and golfers in the sanctified territory of the country club. Judge Smayls will rotate in his grave. And do they repent for these sins? No, no, based on what I saw here, the typical answer of a murdered ninja is to capture the body of a magnificent phone repair woman and look for revenge. I find it morally reprehensible and, of course, after watching this nonsense, I not only stopped playing golf and talking on the phone, but decided to stop feeding the homeless.
