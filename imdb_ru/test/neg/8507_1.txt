Debbie Boone had a monstrous hit with her recording of the pop song "You Light Up My Life"; The Didi Conn movie of the same name was a terribly embarrassing failure. Conn plays the stereotypically stupid, home-made vulnerable girl who is in love with Michael Zaslow, who plays the stereotypically tuned yuppie guy. They are engaged, but everyone knows that Zaslow is not going to marry someone who is not blond and slim, so only Didi is surprised when he leaves her. Needless to say, Didi is pretty confused. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, in her free time she writes small songs, and she came up with a melody, which, in her opinion, is quite elegant. She calls it - can you guess? “You light up my life.” She gets into the car and drives off to the big city to sell her song and start a new life. Now I remember how I sat in the theater and watched as she jumped into the car to go to the big city, and thought: “Thank God, we finally removed all the expositions. Now, maybe something interesting will happen. ” "And something interesting happened. Loans moved. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's all. The film was not only poorly filmed, poorly written and poorly filmed, but also ended in the middle. This film is really a very bad film and we're not talking about the cult film - it's bad. We're talking about a full flop, a real yawn from start to finish. If you like Debbie Boone's song at any cost, buy a copy of it. movie. This is one movie you'll be glad you missed. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
