As soon as I heard that the greatest and most ancient surviving German heroic poem turned into a film, it became for me an obsessive idea to see it. The first flashes of his appearance that I caught never disappointed me. Futuristic interpretation With Lambert, our beloved highlander, and Mitra, the owner of the tombs, starring seems attractive, although some doubts came to life (an important female character in Beowulf?) ... Two hours ago I watched the movie. After I read the name of the director, my world fell apart. As I said, from that moment there were few surprises. First of all, the film ANYTHING has nothing to do with the original Beowulf, if we ignore a couple of cruelly and senselessly stolen names. If they hadnâ€™t stolen the names and announced that it was a new story, it might look like the stupidity of an action-class with beautiful costumes and set design. So, this is just a crime! The attack on the legend and its ideology, as well as common sense. Well, let me be sure for a second ... apart from the general electro-gothic atmosphere, which is good, it also has good music. This was for the positive part, and for this comment.
