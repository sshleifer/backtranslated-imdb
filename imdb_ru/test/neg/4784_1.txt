I watched the first 10 minutes of this show, I think I'm going to do it now! One worst show on tv. This is not even funny. It's so lame, it's disgusting. I gave him the second and third change, I could not even make it in five minutes. Do not waste your time. This is one of the many shows that need to say so far. Speaking of regular night shows, you need to go. All shows on CBS. All shows on the alphabet. All shows on FOX and Joe Buck. All shows on the new CW network. All shows on NBC. (Adopt the law and order of the series). All morning and afternoon talk shows. All court television shows. And all the reality shows there !! Every silly game show. period end! All home improvement shows! And all the news media. all this. This is a 24-hour cycle of bad news. Yes, I have Favorites Monk, Law and Orders, that's all for me.
