SAIMIN <br /> <br /> (USA: hypnotist / UK: hypnosis) <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Dolby Stereo SR <br /> <br /> After a series of strange and obviously unrelated "suicides", an experienced Tokyo detective (Ken Utsui) enlists the support of a young psychoanalyst (Goro Inagaki), who believes that the victims acted on post-hypnotic suggestion. But their subsequent investigations reveal an even darker power at work associated with a young girl (Miho Kanno), whose life was overshadowed by sadistic violence ... <br /> <br /> Keisuke Matsuoka Mystery, based on the plot, draws from the intense novel of Keisuke inspiration from various sources (Italian hyalas, traditional Japanese ghost stories, etc.), although some images in menopause show a more direct impact: the recent commercial success of the movie Hideo Nakata (1998). However, despite all its ambitions, SAIMIN is an ordinary boiler that stumbles strongly after opening a power station (“suicide” is particularly impressive, despite some weak CGI effects), although director Masayuki Ochiai - who wrote the script with Yasushi Fukuda - listened to the rally for the extended final, which finally reveals the stunning secrets of the story. Ochiai is best known for his adaptation to the movie “Turned into video” game PARASITE EVE (1997), which also starred Inagaki’s lead man (member of the Japanese pop group SMAP), and while SAIMIN repeats the strong visual meaning of this film, it falls In short, the drama, and most of the characters - just ciphers, undermining the emotional impact of the storyline. And this is a shame, because the last half hour has been galvanized by a series of dynamic scenery - first of all, a concert hall in which the Dvorak's New World symphony turns into a murder instrument! - and Ochiai is well served by an excellent production team. However, those who are tempted by the promise of a bloody massacre may be disappointed - the film is long on atmospheric and a little on splashes. <br /> <br /> The performances are different due to the limitations of the script, but Kanno (TOMIE) is outstanding as a young woman suffering from multiple personality disorder, which, as we are assured by, the subtitles on the peer-reviewed print are not recognized as a viable disease in Japan! - who is the victim of a dirty television hypnotist (Takeshi Masu), the main suspect in the killings. Inagaki is soft in a one-dimensional role, and he is constantly played by Utsui, a veteran performer whose career goes back to the 1950s Sûpâ Jaiantsu series. <br /> <br /> (Japanese dialogue)
