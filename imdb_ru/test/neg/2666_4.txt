Michael Myers, the irresponsible, is no longer such a young psycho who seems to be getting stronger with each appearance, is resurrected by his fellow druids in order to cause even more damage to his family members and to everyone who gets in the way. Gaps in logic seem to be ignored in favor of a healthy body. Michael, who initially choked strangulation and kitchen knives, learns to rock the ax and use any means necessary to kill its victims, and the result is a terrible, patchwork, dollar film about the store, almost not supported by several really scary episodes. Donald Pleasant, who died shortly after production, seems to have been entered into this story simply so that “someone” could be declared a star. You don't want to close your eyes during this, but you shake your head on the slide down the classic John Carpenter creation.
