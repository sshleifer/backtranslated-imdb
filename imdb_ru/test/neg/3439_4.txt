You get an hour and a half of brain death, I have to save the whole world, one liner and a woman somewhere in the equation. This time he plays a guy who helps people in a witness protection program. quote film cover. He erases their past to save their future. Woppi, it must be cool :) I bet young people will like it, although it is a little for my taste. And one liner is really something else, and I do not mean it in a good way. After killing a crocodile, he manages to say. "You are luggage." If you are in the right mood, you can enjoy the movie. As for the brain actions, this is not very bad. But almost before the movie starts, you know exactly what will happen. But if you like such movies, you will probably like this one. I rate this movie 4
