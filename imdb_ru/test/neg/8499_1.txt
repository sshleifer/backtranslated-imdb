I would not give this film such a low rating (2) if its average value were not ridiculously high, but someone had to bring it to something more reasonable. I sat for most of this movie, watching the scene behind the scenes tagging and shoplifting. No dialogue, only tags and shoplifting. Finally, the two Teggers kissed. Something happened. But then back to the tags and thefts in stores. I left the show. I recommend this film only to those who are impressed with the pretentious film industry. I didnâ€™t like the directors of the previous film (self-righteous love man-boy love), but at least this film had a story, interesting characters, a dialogue. The Graffiti Artist had only a scene behind the scenes of tagging and shoplifting. I want more from the movie than this.
