What can I say ... quite a bit of this. Pretty boring and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> With acting ideas, everything is in order. The only one who shines in any way is Simmons, but he has only 3 scenes. I understand that, by reducing the time of his screen to a minimum, he retains the mysterious psychic aura that he has, but I can't help but feel that his talent was wasted. No one else rose above the mediocre. <br /> <br /> The story itself seems intriguing at first, but then it simply does not go anywhere. There was not a single scene in the film that impressed me or made me feel like I just saw something special. The cinematography was rather soft ... I mean the desert in a blurry sepia ... not very inspiring. <br /> <br /> The story of his childhood friend, who returned from prison, seemed only partially thought out and impracticable. It really adds nothing to the story, except for turning the usual “Twilight Zone” script into a full feature. <br /> <br /> Drab.
