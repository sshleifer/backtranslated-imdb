I find it almost touching to see how Star Trek fans are desperate to love this movie, despite its incredible amount of flaws. <br /> <br /> To begin with, none of the familiar characters is actually a character, so to speak. Scotty is portrayed as an awkward artisan instead of the competent engineer he was in the original series. Uhura ... Gods, I can't even think about what they did to her character. Her whole dialogue was painful to listen. McCoy seemed his stepfather neurotic to Kirk, not his trusted friend. Spock ... well, let's say, Leonard Nimoy was terribly lost. He was given a bad dialogue ("I do not believe that you understood the seriousness of your situation, captain." Gravity, understand? Get it? ") And turned almost into a jester. Kirk ... oh god don't get me. William Shatner is a Hammy actor from the very beginning, so letting him lead in reality means inviting the calamity that we got. <br /> <br /> The plot is beyond funny. Writing Spock's brother is a rather desperate storyline and an overly soap opera. But hey, let's go with that. The quest for God. Again a weak plot base. Don't you think so? Ok, come on with this too. So, if we assume that the above two plot elements are true, what is wrong with the script? Well, first of all, it processes too much. An enterprise, for example, once again, is not working properly. Should we assume that Starfleet will send an extremely faulty ship with a skeleton crew into a potentially dangerous situation just because they want James Kirk to handle the situation? If so, why not put him on the best ship as an adviser? Besides ... the team is extremely incompetent. Scotty smashed the ship apart (and, apparently, he is stupid enough to hit his head, causing him to lose consciousness, While enemies are on board!) despite the fact that the sensors clearly show the ship in range of the weapon) and the crew seems too familiar with each other. In other words, there is no sense of discipline. If this is the flagship of Starfleet, then it is surprising that the Klingons have not yet overthrown the Federation. <br /> <br /> With regard to personal struggle with pain, this is crap. Lawrence Luckenbill is a competent actor, but even he could not save this turkey. In short, no one could. I believe that Leonard Nimoy of all the people involved is most embarrassed by this. In any case, I hope so. <br /> <br /> Thank God that the original cast didnâ€™t bow to this comic opus.
