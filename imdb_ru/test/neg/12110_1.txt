The director of this film is the famous French TV presenter Patrick Sebastian. He loves music and humor for cattle, and his incredible film is absolutely in his image. This is the story of a young backward man whose name is "Zep" (sic). At night, he sees his sister’s SM’s sexual relationship and decides to do the same: he rapes the girl he loves! Zep is at the shelter, and his unfortunate girlfriend is at the clinic. One man will find them. One person will unite them. This person is a psychologist. This man looks like a hell of an angel. This man ... Patrick Sebastian! With the overuse of clichés, we will see how Absolute Love can destroy all misunderstandings and how a humanist doctor can make a victim fall in love with her rapist. We will also learn how to use sandwiches to seduce a girl. Not only Patrick Sebastian believes that he can do better than one century of psychiatry, but he also imposes a stupid left ideology on us; with the character of her father's friend, the boss, who wants to take away his weak girlfriend. Ominous. But it is very pleasant to laugh at Zep (mentally retarded people are not funny, except in this film).
