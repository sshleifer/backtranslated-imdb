Wind. Easily one of the worst movies ever made. The only benefit from this meaningless fuss is that watching movies like this gets spread, forcing horror directors like me to be sure that my future feature will also be in the spotlight. I mean, if this was a horror market, I could make a fortune by videotaking myself, scavenging for 83 minutes. <br /> <br /> A complete list of the shortcomings of this film would take too much time. But the main points are: the lack of history, the terrible game, terrible cinematography and the virtual absence of editing. This last one bothered me the most. As an editor himself, this film drove me crazy because it was hardly edited. Each scene was shot in the workshop. They had absolutely no coverage. For those who do not know ... “coverage” is shooting a scene from different angles to be able to trim when editing in order to get the desired viewing experience. Yes, in this film there was nothing of this. I'm talking about even the most simple scenes. Example: A typical conversation scene between two people sitting at a table usually starts with a master setting who is on the stage and where they are. Then, as you continue the conversation, you continue the conversation back and forth, taking pictures over your shoulder. You can even throw one or two shots at the table or at someone's hand. Anything. This is "Film 101", guys. It seems that these people did not know how movies work. Each shot was locked by a camera. No movement, no cutting, nothing. If I taught a filmmaking course, this would be a visual aid for my lesson “What not to do.” <br /> <br /> In conclusion, do not waste your time, guys. The only thing surprising about this film is that it has ever spread. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
