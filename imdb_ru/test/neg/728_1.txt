I'm tired of several attempts to sit down and watch this Gilmore Girls program. It confused me because I simply could not understand what was going on. Was it because of a young woman who gave birth to a young child and never grew up? Was it because the daughter was more responsible than the mother? Was it about a rebellious rich girl and her recalcitrant daughter? What the hell is a show? Finally, I just didn't care. The cast makes me want to scream. The letter is neither “smart” nor “smart”, it is thick and tedious. <br /> <br /> So why did I watch? Because I heard so much good about it, and I am not one of those who express their opinions, until I looked. The reaction of the knee joint is usually wrong, so I watched several times. The first time I looked at it, I saw a mother running, like she was 12 years old, and her daughter acting as if she was 40 years old. Perhaps it did not attract me. I have never liked any of the "Freaky Friday" films - not to mention the fact that this is so, but there are some similarities. <br /> <br /> I also have a friend who watches this show every week. So I asked her: “What is this show about?” A very bright young lady, usually expressing her opinion clearly, she could never give me a direct answer. So I asked others who adore it - they really don’t know about it. <br /> <br /> Gilmore Girls is a television program that looks like an art-house film. Many of us will not understand this, but those who leave are desperately trying to find meaning where it really is not, just to be “fashionable”. Yes, I find Lauren Graham Lorelai annoyed - to whine, whine, nasally WHINE. The whole hour of it. Wow. And the rest of the cast is as memorable as yesterday's cheese sandwich. City hockey, men are weak, grandparents are boring, and, unfortunately, I do not find anything redeeming in any of these characters, nor in taking care of what they do. It's like watching the paint dry on the wall.
