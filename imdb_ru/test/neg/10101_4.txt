In the first half of this film there were some promises, since it seemed that the film would be a psychodrama of a reserved type, like THE MINUS MAN, but then it all turns into a cliche, and the viewer gradually loses all interest. There is a decent cast here, but the film is lifeless, and the talent is completely gone.
