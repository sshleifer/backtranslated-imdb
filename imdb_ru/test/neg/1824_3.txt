On a business trip to picturesque Italy, the beautiful synchronous lip Lana Turner (like Fredda Barlo) meets the elder singer and Prince Ezio Pinza (like Mr. Imperium). Two fall in love, enjoying the beautiful Italian countryside. Unfortunately, Mr. Pinza is called to the death penalty of his royal father, leaving Lana in trouble. Twelve years later, Miss Turner is an actress from Los Angeles who is going to make a film about how to fall in love with a king. Do Turner has an affair with colleague Barry Sullivan who wants to marry her - then is King Pinza back in her life ?? <br /> <br /> Mr. Imperium offers a weary storyline for the sex symbol of Turner and debut vocalist Pinza, who has appeared in the New York Metropolitan Opera for several decades. Pinza probably earned his career in the MGM feature film after appearing in the extremely successful production of The South Pacific (1949). The actor's album and Pinza gold single "Some Enchanted Evening" were sold by millions. The supporting roles of Marjorie Maine, Cedric Hardwick and Debbie Reynolds give the film an even greater sense of resources spent. <br /> <br /> *** Mr. Imperium (1951) Don Hartman ~ Lana Turner, Ezio Pinza, Barry Sullivan
