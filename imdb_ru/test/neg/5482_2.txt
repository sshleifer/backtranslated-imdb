These are 2 stars just because they put a lot of effort into making this game look good. I played a lot of good and bad games, and I think that in this game the most boring story I have ever had to listen to. The best thing they could do is to let you skip the conversation (but no, you should listen to their conversation for 10 minutes) and just keep doing the same thing over and over again. Climb up the building, save the citizen, go and kill the dude. ALL THE SAME! Ubisoft should really hire someone with some imagination. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of the Prince of Persia series (the first 3). The story was good, and you wanted to know what happens next all the time. I donâ€™t even hate Prince of Persia 4. But I think that anyone who was responsible for developing the story for Assassin's Creed should be prohibited from writing something else for life. <br /> <br /> A boring story and the same missions over and over again! If even one of these two things were good, the game would be worth playing.
