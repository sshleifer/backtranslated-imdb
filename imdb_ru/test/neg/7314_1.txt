Gross Violation was one of a series of texts released in Australia in the early to mid-1990s that explored the alleged victimization of a privileged heterosexual man in an era of feminism. This creature only needs to look at Pretty Young Thing, he is accused of sexual harassment, and his life is ruined. Damn these women chatter! Grrr ... <br /> <br /> As my tone tells me, I don’t buy this antifeminist BS, and, accordingly, I didn’t like this film. GM simplifies sexual harassment and teacher-student relationships. Sexual harassment here is the result of the imagination of a bewildered young woman, and those professional boundaries that teachers need to support ... well, when the teacher is a charming and handsome family man (and Jimmy Smits plays him!) Don't worry about it. <br /> <br /> Sexist trash, and even looking through it, I give him more time than it deserves.
