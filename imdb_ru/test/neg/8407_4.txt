Hmm ... ok, this is really very bad when compared to the first film, the very, very critically perceived Rosemary Baby. In fact, this is a pretty bad movie in general. Yes, there are several redeeming qualities, but I will come back to this later. <br /> <br /> A lot of time has passed since the last movie took place ... in fact, it was pretty much eight years old I believe. Rosemary is still trying to escape with her child and have a good influence on him, rather than letting him give in to the evil future that the coven (or “tribe,” as it is called here) laid out for him. When she runs off with him, and an empty bus arrives and takes her away, leaving her child with a prostitute, the prostitute picks him up until he reaches adulthood, where Satan is trying to take possession of him, since he seems to be rejecting his evil legacy in everyone <br > <br /> Obviously, everything is not going as planned, and there is an end for which I would be very ashamed if I had not seen that this would happen since I heard the continuation of Rosemary. Baby! ”Well, when I was about 11 years old, I witnessed Rosemary Baby masterpiece, and then read the sequel to the book. Thinking that this film was an adaptation of this, I sought out this film and got it ... was I right about that? Well in a sense, yes ... I am a real fan of this "franchise" and I can say that I saw a sequel, and I have an idea of ​​what happens after the events in the first film (speaking of this film And Son of Rosemary , Ira Levin's own sequel of the book, not yet adapted to the film. <br /> <br /> Ruth Gordon, who played Minnie in the first film, shown several times in this film, but why, why is the coven so different? The knife that Rosemary dropped in the first film is shown sticking out of the ground, but Minnie pulled it out! Coven is now called a tribe (as I said earlier ). Now they walk in hooded cloaks and sing "Hail Satan ... Hail Adrian ... Hail Satan ... Hail Adrian ..." and so on and so forth. The Gothic building now looks like a two-story house on a lawn in the middle of nowhere, it looks like a small suburban house or something like that! And the child itself is pretty normal, his eyes become “cat-like” only when he gets angry and kills someone or something in this fuss. <br /> <br /> As for acting, it's pretty bad. at all sites except Stephen McHetty, played by a very grown-up Adrian. Patty Duke Astin, replacing Mia Farrow in the role of Rosemary, should get one of the coolest PEACE performances that ever went to the movies! It's so bad that it's almost not even funny ... when she shouts, "Oh my God!" and crying like in the fifteenth time in the film, you just say: “Well, this is no longer funny,” and then, when she left and the film was turned on only twenty minutes, you THANK YOU Lord, I should not hear what she says : "Oh, my god," no one else! Sheesh! After all, this film has very, very, very, very few redemptive qualities, enough to get at least four stars. But, if you look at it as a serious continuation of the first film, it practically does not exist.
