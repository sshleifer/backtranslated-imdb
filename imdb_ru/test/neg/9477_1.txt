this is a terrible movie. it's past stupid. First of all, the only thing that worries the twins is how they look and what the boys like. they are in grade 7. not to say that I am a prude or something like that, but it sends the wrong message to girls of all ages. to be beautiful and popular is not all. but that's what the twins do. The plot is even worse. The grandfather of the girl is simply the ambassador of France (sp?). He has an employee who carries girls in Paris, and they meet two "cute French guys" with motorcycles. they want to meet guys who really start to like them, etc. They meet a supermodel in the process and walk around Paris with complete strangers whom they think are cute. Do I need to say more? This film can be pretty for 8 and 9 years. twins play losers who want guys. it makes the girls send the wrong ideas. The film itself is also not great. I do not recommend this to anyone. I give passport to Paris 2/10
