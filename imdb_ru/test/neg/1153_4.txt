If good intentions were enough to make a good movie, I would rate the dim, heavy, obvious Focus a little above 4. Macy does everything possible, but as the earlier poster commented, Miller’s little parable asks us to stop disbelief too often. Perhaps the novel gives us a little more information about Newman, so we can understand how someone, obviously, not without intelligence, can be so dense in perceiving the attitude of others. I agree with another reviewer that if someone does not know how bigoted the average citizens in America were during this period, then this film may be a revelation. I grew up in the 50s, and the “good” pastors of my Lutheran church did not find anything wrong with having a church picnic on a commercial beach, whose sign clearly indicated that neither Jews nor blacks were allowed. Today, young people find it difficult to understand that this was the norm, and not only in the south. Back in 1964, when I graduated from a public high school in Baltimore, which was somewhat racially integrated (but segregated by gender), my black classmates could not attend the traditional “banquet of father and son”, as it was held in an institution that was not negros were allowed. Unfortunately, it was an institution owned by a Jewish family. The “Focus” theme is important, and we should never forget, despite the persistent signs of racism in modern America, how disgusting was the relationship of this previous generation (indeed, the “greatest generation”). So perhaps this film is somewhat valuable to counter the recent wave of sentimental crap about the forties from such as Steven Spielberg and Tom Brokaw. But in the end, as in “Far from Heaven,” the cinema's good intentions are undermined by the fact that the main character so ridiculously forgets about the social conventions of his time.
