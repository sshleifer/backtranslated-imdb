The film is somewhat interesting, but the biggest feature is the ridiculous performance of Shalom Harlow. It's been 4 years since this film was released, and hopefully Harlow has gone through a lot of training. Perhaps she should stick to more worldly, somewhat vicious characters that she generated in other performances.
