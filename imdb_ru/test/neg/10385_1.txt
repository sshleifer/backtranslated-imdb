When the metaphorical flies left this steaming, watery film chair, I really wanted to join them. <br /> <br /> From the first sentences you quickly realize that the actors are mediocre. The script editor was probably dead, and the director should be. Honestly, I didnâ€™t manage to finish this movie, because for about twenty gloomy minutes in front of the main actress running across the floor, like a Shetland pony, who was shot in the ass, was too much for me to survive. > <br /> I have never, and I mean never, seen such a sweaty film like this one, and I watch tons of crap movies. <br /> <br /> Turd.
