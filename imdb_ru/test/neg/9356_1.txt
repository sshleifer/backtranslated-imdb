I can not believe some of the comments here in the reviews. The film, of course, is dated, and from our convenient point of view in the era of the CGG, many special effects are now unconvincing. But even with this in mind, Elena Troy is so bad that it is almost ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Scenarios are terrible, just awful, without any characteristics. As a result, performances suffer, you can see how Hardwick and Andrews wriggle in the agony of embarrassment as they deliver the most ridiculous small banal strings of cod. The authors seem to feel the need to explain almost everything in a terrible didactic scenario, which allows the viewer to decide nothing at all for themselves. The beginning of the film reveals the historical background, as if no one had ever heard of ancient Greece; I know that they had an American audience to take into account, but a patronizing way that everyone tells us twice so that we understand that the action is really terrible. <br /> <br /> I honestly can't believe the comments above describing this movie as a great epic movie. Even with the relatively primitive cinematography and the relative complexity of today's audience, this film really stinks.
