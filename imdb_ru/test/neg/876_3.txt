A lonely, torn-away middle-class housewife in divorce seeks solace to reflect on her near future. On some bed and breakfast (well, literally at sea) by the ocean, which for some strange reason it substitutes for the owner. Get alone, arrogant Richard Gere. He is a plastic surgeon. He is the only guest in the hotel at sea. Diane Lane is a lonely housewife. You never guess that these two fall in love right away. Tropical storm makes them true lovers. <br /> <br /> The plots in this melodrama make no sense. Places, photos in order. Gere remains one of the most overrated actors in the movie and does not disappoint. Miss Lane must have needed the money, but her phones were elegant.
