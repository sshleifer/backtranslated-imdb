OK, so this movie is well shot. He has a good direction, but the simple fact is that he is undermining what all gays and lesbians have been fighting for all these years. The rectangular man, "deciding to become gay," and gay, "deciding to be straight," I enjoyed it until the last 20 minutes, after which I was really offended. As usually happens in these films, the main roles play the main roles, and the minor roles play the minor roles. The handsome men play the leading roles, but don't let this distract you from the fact that this film leaves you feeling unsatisfied. All the romantic relationships and relationships that you hope will not happen. Unless you are a priest, then God bless a straight woman who heals our homosexuals.
