Proceedings, well, there are many reasons to make them, but what Irvin Allen thought of to come up with such a boring idea goes beyond all logical questions. There are so many open answers to this film that it’s ridiculous ... like “Poseidon”, a monstrous ship with passengers, sailing on the sea, and only Michael Caine with his mini boat and the evil Telly Savalas opens the boat ... Well, in the beginning French marines hover over their ship over a sunken ship, but since a sinking cruise ship is an everyday thing, they just fly away ... What am I trying to say ??? Hmmm, Michael Kane goes aboard with Sally Field, and he could pick up everything he sees (diamonds) if the ship did not have Telly Savalas who is looking for a weapon ... My God, why do I actually waste my words here? This is ridiculous, and the knowledge that both Field and Kane participated in them makes one think about what they thought of when reading scripts ... of course, not diamonds ...
