he must surely be one of the worst gay movies ever. Who told any of the so-called actors that they can act. Bad sound - bad script - gestures so overboard that they defy reality. The scene in a nightclub with one actor and dubbed crowd scenes. <br /> <br /> After watching other low-budget films made in the same way, I was ready for something innovative, but not just pathetic. <br /> <br /> Parents and friends really should not encourage anyone to such mischief. <br /> <br /> And on DVD - there is no access to the menu; it's worse than VHS tape. After you start, youâ€™ll have to watch it all to the end - fortunately, the fast forward button - with this movie and DVD, nothing else works.
