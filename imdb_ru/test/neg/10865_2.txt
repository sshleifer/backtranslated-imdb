So, writer / director Larry Bishop obviously has some important connections and knows the right people in Hollywood to create his own movie and complement the actors with appealing names. Good for him! Now he really needs inspiration and talent to come up with a really worthwhile script, and not too pretentious and quirky tangled nonsense, which he composed here. “Going to Hell” is not a movie; this is a restless and hopelessly inept attempt by a fan boy to pay homage to the notorious biker films of the 60s and the recently revived cinematic film formula of Grindhouse as a whole. With “Hell Ride,” Larry Bishop is embarrassed by his failure to set up, and there are many obvious reasons for this. Does he have a story to tell ?? or at least not very interesting ?? but seriously trying to hide it with the help of numerous excessive plot twists, a multitude of unreasonable and very unfriendly women, too long and pitiful dialogues seeking to be steep and gigantic quantities of senseless violence. The plot looks complicated, but in fact can be summarized in one sentence. An ancient vendetta between two competing gangs of bikers erupts again with the arrival of a new member; a boy who may or may not be the long-lost son of a two-time girl executed in 1976. That's all serious! Everything else, starting from the betrayal of gang members and ending with the recruitment of old timer members and playing with his nymphomatic girl informant, is all completely meaningless and confusing material. Another serious problem in the “Train of Hell” is Larry Bishop’s own huge and seemingly insatiable ego. He definitely should not have rewarded himself with the role of a tough and merciless gang leader, as this only seems incredibly pretentious and limited; especially when there are so many other and more experienced stars in the film. Of course, Bishop starred in a pair of real films about the exploitation of bikers of the 60s (such as The Savage Seven and Angel Unchained), but that was a long time ago, and he, frankly, is not very good as an actor. Maybe it was Bishop's longtime dream of playing a character who always outwit his enemies and whom every hot babe thirsts for, and just wrote a whole script around him. Veterans in the cast, such as Dennis Hopper and Michael Madsen, really did not bother to leave a plausible impression, and I cannot say that I blame them. This whole performance is lame and miserable, and I can't bring myself to recommend it to anyone, no matter how many beautiful babies parade with bare breasts and bare asses.
