In addition to a few good moments of rather brutal violence, this painful film is most remarkable in that 68 minutes seems like two hours. <br /> <br /> It starts with an infinitely long introduction in which the Leeds family is represented, including two unbearable Tykes and their grown-up brother and sister, completely clichéd by Pa and Ma, and an incredibly annoying grandpa Sales). Sitting at dinner, the family is concerned about the sound of gunfire and rushes to the window in time to see two men shot by gangsters on the street. Gangsters run through the family house, leaving them as witnesses to the crime. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film consists of Walter Houston, who acts as a crusader, D.A. trying to protect the family from the mafia. Everything will end in a predictable way. <br /> <br /> The good moments of the film are some decent skirmishes and a really nasty beating, Nat Pendleton as one of the gangsters and gorgeous Sue Blanc in the little role of Leeds’s daughter. <br /> <br /> If you want to see how Houston plays its early attorney struggling with trademarks, try the 1932 Beast of the City. Avoid this if at all possible.
