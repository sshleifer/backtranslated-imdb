Honestly, I don’t know where to start when looking at such a pathetic film as Ernest goes to Africa. In addition to two or three good laughter scattered throughout the film, there is nothing positive in this hour and a half waste of time and life. It's incredible that someone was able to gather a group of people who want to play, remove and edit this piece of garbage, and even more incredible that this is the eighth release in the Ernest series. <br /> <br /> During the opening credits of the film, we see Ernest posing next to various African objects, such as wooden masks and heads of African animals, making faces and gestures that most third-grade students will probably laugh at. This opening scene gives the viewer a taste of Ernest's frequent attempts at humor and demonstrates how his comedy falls apart 95% of the time. <br /> <br /> The first thing that really struck me in this film is how bad acting is. Everything in the film is a typical C-movie actor, but Linda Kach stands out especially terribly. She is the epitome of overeating; all its lines are written with strikingly inhuman enthusiasm, which can only be found in a high school play. Most school theater students could probably replace these actors and give a more powerful performance. Jim Varney, at least, occasionally demonstrates some comedic abilities, but for most films he simply acts as a complete backward, trying to be funny, making stupid faces and speaking in different voices. <br /> <br /> Ernest goes to Africa, begins in Africa, where an archaeologist stole two priceless stones from an African tribe. Then the gems are returned to the United States, where an unidentified person running from several minions through a flea market is visible. He hides them in a bucket of “two for a dollar” items, and then runs off the stage. Ernest is looking for a gift for Rene, a waitress that he likes, so he goes to the flea market and, of course, buys priceless gems. Later, he takes them back to his house, paints them and glues them together to make a yo-yo. He gives Yo-Yo to Rene, and she explains that they can never be together, because he is just an ordinary person, and she needs an adventurer. Rene and Ernest are tracked down by henchmen, and then they are brought to Africa for detention. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie really does not make sense. When Ernest is in Africa, he falls out of the truck in which he is being taken, and lands in the river. In the next scene, we see him as a Hindu servant named "Hey, you." He has dark skin and is wearing a loincloth. At first I thought that Jim Varney was playing another role in the film besides Ernest, but I immediately recognized Ernest’s idiocy as soon as Hey began to speak. <br /> <br /> Another scene that was captured in my head as a completely absurd chase scene in the African wilderness. Rene and Ernest took away the ostrich farmer's truck and were pursued by minions. Driving at a speed of about 20 miles per hour on a fairly straight road, both henchmen shoot at Ernest, who is in the back of an ostrich farmer's truck. Ernest, on the other hand, throws ostrich eggs at minions and their driver. During the five-minute chase, the minions never hit Ernest, but Ernest can beat them off, hitting them and their driver in the face, forcing their car to turn off the road and explode in a giant column of smoke. I also have to add that Ernest shoots two eggs at a time from a large bra. <br /> <br /> The scenography in this film is also incredibly bad. There is a big part of the film in which Rene and Ernest are walking around Africa, trying to find a civilization. During their campaign, we see them walking in the fields and jungles, which probably could have been shot somewhere in the United States. The fields are just grassy fields, with no indication that they are somewhere near Africa (they could at least digitally add some African trees in the background), and the jungle looks like the forests of rural Connecticut with papier mache, skulls, vines, and thorns hanging from trees. According to IMDb.com, the film was actually filmed in South Africa, but I still wouldn't believe it. <br /> <br /> The film continues, Ernest jokes after Ernest. The rest of the film also makes no sense; all African tribes speak English for some reason, and Ernest is later called to the “Battle of Truth” as a leading accomplice, who suddenly wears clothes that resemble ninja clothes, but at the same time resemble enslavement. , The minion has a table with axes, swords, knives and clubs, and Ernest has a table with a sandwich, a teddy bear and several other useless objects. However, Ernest wins the battle and somehow saves the day. <br /> <br /> In general, it is painful to watch this movie. I could not handle it in one sitting; I had to stop halfway and do something productive for several hours to compensate for the loss of brain cells, trying to gauge Varney's humor. They really should put the Surgeon's General Warning on the box so that people know that in fact they will be a little more backward after completing this film. I have to say that, of all the films I've ever seen, not one comes close to being as pathetic as Ernest goes to Africa.
