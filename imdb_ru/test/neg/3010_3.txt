Professional production with quality actors who never touched either the heart or the funny bone, no matter how hard it tried. The quality cast, impeccable furnishings and excellent cinematography inspired you to hope for Fargo or Rogue on the High Plains, but sorry, the soup had no seasonings ... and no meat for that matter. 3 (out of 10) for the effort.
