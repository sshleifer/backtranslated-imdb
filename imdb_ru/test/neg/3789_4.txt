It starts with company loans informing us about this from the World International Network. I knew that I had seen a loan from this company before, but I could not remember where, but I knew that it was at the beginning of a really bad movie that I saw, so I seriously thought about changing channels, the only thing I saw was every other movie channels, which is one of the problems of being an IMDB reviewer. What the hell, I thought it really doesn’t matter if WANTED is good or bad, because I can still view it for this site. <br /> <br /> As I expected, WANTED was not so good. This is a story that I have seen so many times (too many times) before I drew the fugitive on the run, a bit like the TV series “INCREDIBLE HOOL” without breaking the shirt. Jimmy crosses the crowd in a completely contrived manner and goes on the run, and in a completely contrived manner discovers that he works in a Catholic reform school. Have you noticed the frequently used description in the last sentence? “Fully contrived” is the answer. Let me repeat with difficulty to think that this is a completely contrived film, where everything depends on a coincidence. Another problem I faced is the reform school run by the church - it is too compassionate and kind, they make me believe that such institutions make Alcatraz look like a country club, I say that this is a fact, but when the priest looks like a slobbering image of Donald Rumsfeld, you feel that there is a large amount of sugar coating going on there. <br /> <br /> To be honest, despite the ridiculous plot twists, etc. although terribly good too. I have never had the desire to turn it off, no matter how skillful it has become, which is a compliment on hand to the film.
