If it were possible, I would give this excuse for a movie with a zero star. It was a lot worse I've ever seen. As if it was a home movie that some bored high school students decided to make a joke. The "game" was terrible. "Actors" did not even respond to the fact that they were killed. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I bought this movie by mistake. In the Spanish title, Jeepers Creepers 3 was written, so I thought, um, maybe everything will be fine. Wrong. It was honestly the worst ever. I didn't get the last 20 minutes of a stupid movie. I missed the chapters, and nothing interesting ever happened. <br /> <br /> The operators were terrible too. It was like a home movie. I NEVER recommend anyone to watch this. A terrible terrible moron movie.
