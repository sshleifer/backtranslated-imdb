I am deeply concerned about some posts that I read on the bulletin boards for this film, people say that this is a really good film! The fact that this film is the best by far, Uwe Boll, does not make it a good film, for nothing! Far Cry is an ordinary mess, full of bad play, bad direction and a boring story with a cheesy script. This is Ball’s first clean action movie, and people’s news flashes, action movies aren’t that complicated, because for a basic action movie, all you need are explosions and gunfights scattered around a thin plot, and hey, Mr. Ball succeeds in doing that. House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark and Bloodrayne, all horror games adapted to Ball’s films are much worse (they have no redeeming qualities). Far Cry boasts two things that make it even better: two good leadership and a couple of well-made sequences of actions. Til Schweiger is pretty good, like Jack Carver, and Emmanuel Vozier has a strong female lead. Usually the great Udo Kier is demolished because the villain-cliché and the supporting squad are damn bad. At the end of the film, a surprisingly intense chase sequence takes place, which was a shock, considering that Ball was behind the camera. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the rest of the movie looks incredibly cheap, with poor computer graphics. Lame and one-liners on every corner. Oh, and the worst led to the sex scene, I think I have ever had a scene. They not only know each other for six hours, but all he needs is to say that he was warm while serving in the army, lying down to his fellow soldiers. He had already forced her to take off her clothes, just telling her about it. Then he took it off and climbed into bed because he was afraid of hypothermia. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a bad movie. This is a meaningless fighter who can kill 80 minutes if you are completely bored. It could probably have been worse than shoving it and seeing it, but I would personally say that I’m watching a classic action movie like Die Hard or Predator, and stay away from this derivative mess. <br /> <br /> 1½ / 5
