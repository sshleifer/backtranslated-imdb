This story had a good story about four older men who have the deadly secret of a young woman whom they met 50 years ago. After all this time, the young woman returns to take revenge on the men. This story from time to time made me fall asleep during the film in the midst of tedious lift music and constantly repeated thunderstorms. But, in the end, it is worth the wait when we find out who the mysterious woman who continues to haunt the elderly in their dreams and interfere in the life of a young man. Most of all in this film I liked the expectation when a young woman appears before men shortly before their death. The special effects were something. Every time I heard her call them, I thought: “Again, not that face.” But it was a good movie, I just want the pace to be not so slow, and the game is not so tedious. In the film, I also liked the memories of the 20s, very authentic, as well as original costumes.
