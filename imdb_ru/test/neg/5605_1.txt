I watched it out of curiosity. I liked Stargate SG1, and I watched many other TV shows and films that the main characters worked on. <br /> <br /> My expectations were not high, so I was surprised by such a monstrous disappointment. <br /> <br /> All actions are terrible, and the script is even worse. <br /> <br /> A zero study of bad science that flows throughout the film, or martial arts (in which several actors participate throughout the film, despite the fact that they clearly do not train in martial arts (the rotation of the baton is not warrior) to do)) learning makes the implausible plot even less credible. The same weapon (which Michael Shanks wears) when firing on the mountainside causes extreme damage, but when fired indoors on a wall of a wicker wall creates a small firework effect without damaging the braided structure - OK, I suppose Michael Shanks fans will be charged that they see it in Stargate SG1, where a regular weapon creates either a superficial burn of the main character, or explodes a hole in parts of the castle wall, as required), but still ... CGI bad snake 'God eats one of the faithful as eating a dog - snakes just do not behave. <br /> <br /> The basic premise of the cult of Amazon warriors on a distant planet is stupid at best. Matriarchal societies have always been based on a failure to understand that men need to reproduce the species — for example, the picts, who did not figure out the role of men in sexual reproduction before the ninth century — then the balance of power passed from women to men. They carry technological weapons and demonstrate some knowledge in the field of science, in particular, medicine, so the idea that a matriarchal society can exist with this level of scientific knowledge is based solely on the “wet dream” of the original author. Of course, several references to stellar science made in this film demonstrate that the author did not know anything about it either (except for a few key words that he must have heard in other films). However, it could have been done better — for example, “She” in 1965, which showed a matriarchal society with a certain awe, is much more believable, and even after 45 years, it seems fresher than this sinister exercise in stupidity. To march several women in “armor”, aggressively inflate and spit out their lines, like a kid looking for a fight in a nightclub (“Come on then! I'll make you!” Style), seems too simplistic. Difficulties of matriarchal culture. <br /> <br /> Cultural references are so simple - “everyone welcomes mother snake,” and generally sums it up. Even the smallest village shows more cultural variations. <br /> <br /> There is nothing clever, suggestive, interesting, visually exciting or remotely interesting in this film. Soundtrack of the same quality. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that some of the overly charitable positive comments that this film received were from Michael Shanks fans, who would give a great response to everything that he was involved. Do not be fooled. Low budgets do not cause film failure - cheap B movies can be brilliant. This is not one of them, and there is no reason to impose this film on yourself.
