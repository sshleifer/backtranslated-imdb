Lucille Ball can neither sing, play, nor dance. This makes the quality of her performance in MAME even more terrible. She is not allowed to do a slap that made her a hit on TV, so she must rely on character creation. Unfortunately, Ms. Ball never learned this skill, as none of the tender moments has warmth. How does she really feel about Patrick or Bo? We never believe the words she says. This vacant glance of Miss Ball should convince us that she emulates, but there is no chemistry between her and Bruce Davidson, Robert Preston or Be Arthur. For this reason, each scene in which it plays is flat. <br /> <br /> Moreover, when Miss Ball opens her mouth to sing, we immediately find out the reason why the studios voiced her voice for every other musical in which she starred. at the beginning of his career. It was stated that she demanded that her voice be used, so this is a mistake of both ego and leadership. Worst of all, when she sings voice-over, and she has to "act in a moment" without words. Who would have thought that it would work, forgot who played Mom. <br /> <br /> I understand that Rosalind Russell played a role on the stage and in the film “AUNTIE MAME”. In addition, I know that Angela Lansbury won Tony for her work in the original 1966 Broadway musical. None of these women was known for her singing voices, but both could cope better than Lucille Ball. Why they went with her is the worst in a glaring omission. <br /> <br /> The only person who remained unscathed was Bea Arthur. It is large and wonderful, large and ordinary in all the right quantities. Unfortunately, you continue to wait until this film is removed, and invite you to join in the fun. But the film is never made, and you can't. No one except Bi Arthur seems to be having fun. <br /> <br /> Another bad review is directed by Gene Sachs. Sachs is known as the award-winning director of musicals and comedies for the stage and screen, including the Broadway musical on which this film is based. None of these skills and experiences here will help. The poor quality of editing and storytelling in this film is below the director’s level. This blatant error in the performance of the film is not Miss Ball’s mistake.
