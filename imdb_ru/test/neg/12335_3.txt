This film could become a worthy thriller, but only a good twenty-minute script, which was mainly used at the beginning, prevented it. After this, holes began to appear in the history through which it was possible to drive a truck. By the end of the film, the film went on a downward curve from good to normal, from bad to funny. It is not recommended.
