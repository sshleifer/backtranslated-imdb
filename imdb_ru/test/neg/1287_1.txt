This is a really bad waste of your time. I would probably prefer to watch some documentary than this; this is really so bad. <br /> <br /> The game is really terrible and you can say that the manufacturers had a low budget due to the terrible image quality. This is definitely at the bottom of the scale; do not spend your money on it. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult for me to believe the person who made this film that he will live well. I had to watch it with the children when my mother rented it, because she thought it would be good for the children. Even the children (3, 4, 6 and 8) thought it was pretty boring. <br /> <br /> I agree with another commentator, it would be much better to watch Sponge Bob than this. <br /> <br /> Overall: just do not look. Not. Not.
