Pavel Mazursky examines this film. The script, directing, casting and acting (with the exception of Victorio Gassman) - all is not in order. I remember that the reviews from more than 20 years ago were mediocre, but I thought that they were worth a look. With such famous personalities as Susan Sarandon, Raul Julia (who replays in most of his scenes) and John Cassavetes, I, obviously, expected much more. The music chosen for the film sounds horrible, the gaps between New York and Greece are confusing, and the overall pace leaves much to be desired. Why Paul Mazursky felt the need to update this story or add his touch to it, puzzling â€” this retelling of Prospero and his daughter does little from the play, and adds little more. The game in any case is not one of the best in the play of Shakespeare, and, perhaps, its further development is not a good solution. Unfortunately, there is nothing to recommend in this film.
