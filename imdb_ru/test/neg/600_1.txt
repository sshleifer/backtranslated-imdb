This film is mostly ill-perceived by the old urban legend of the nanny, who receives crank calls, saying that she checks children, she calls the police, who tracks calls and finds that they come from home. when the killer's calls have such a simplified story, a little kid might write it. Not a lot of waiting, it becomes clear who the killer is halfway through the film. at the very beginning, when the first victim dies, it looks like slavery fetish scenes from a porn site or something. what's up with that? The film is about such a typical paid film with a plot about as original as the Beatles' concert. even by low-budget standards, his cheesy slasher. don't waste your time on this. enough
