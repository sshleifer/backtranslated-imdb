This is a complete piece of shit. This is an insult to the amazing book by Frank Herbert. They damaged the story and characters. Medium to bad acting. The only character who did the right thing and played well is the Duke Leto, played by William Hurt. Unfortunately, he dies quite early in this story, and then from there everything is downhill (not that it was a very high hill to begin with). <br /> <br /> The 1984 film was shot by the legendary David Lynch. The film did not impress me, but given the technological limitations of the time, they tried their best. Surprisingly, a crappy mini-series makes it much better than it. At least it was somewhat truthful for a book that I really love. <br /> <br /> This time they had the opportunity to do it right, unfortunately, this was not done.
