“The Cellar” is an unbearably boring and overly child friendly cheese parade from the 80s, directed by Kevin Tenney (who created the best films Witchboard and Night of the Demons) and starring incredibly talentless Patrick Kilpatrick, who is supposedly portraying a guy with feelings. The pace is really slow, the plot seems too familiar, the effects of the monsters are almost petrified, and the film opens and ends with a boring story that is somehow not related to the real theme of the film. The voiceover continues to grumble about the wind and creatures traveling downwind, but what the hell is there no wind in the plot? As in many horror films of the 80s, “The Cellar” tells about cursed Indian landscapes and completely real mythical monsters hidden in basements and swamps. Mance Cashen and his family moved to a house built on the site where the Indians once lived, but then white people came and turned the land into oil fields. Half of the script is wasted on explaining the monster's origins, but I can easily summarize it for you: an ancient Indian sorcerer summoned a creature (which looks like a huge rat made from paper-mâché) to destroy the white people who overfilled his land, but he buried her again, because, as I quote, SOB also kills Indians. The highly annoying son of Mans accidentally awakens the beast and, naturally, cannot convince his parents in a big hungry rat in the basement. Allegedly, the emotional family situation (dad always wants his son to love him) is very pitiful and superfluous, and the film urgently needs more bloodshed; children's film or not. The young hero (Chris Miller) is rather annoying, but we definitely saw the worst actors in the 80s. "The Cellar" is not recommended, of course, if you are not a fan of trashy and, as a rule, designs of monsters of the 80s. The big quirky rat is a real cry to see.
