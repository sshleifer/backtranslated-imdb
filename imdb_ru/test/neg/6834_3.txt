I was looking forward to meeting Bruce Willis, especially since I remember being hypnotized by the original when I was young. <br /> <br /> This film is an excellent example of how film companies can take a very good story and laze until it is just another formula for the hype about the legendary American law enforcement system / army of the Armed Forces (Russians .... don't the war is over, do it with the Russians) AGAINST TERRORISTS, about 50 other films. <br /> <br /> In addition, he treats his audience as a group of idiots. The choice of weapons, of course, ridiculous, can we seriously believe that the most terrible and experienced assassin / terrorist in the world will choose him to kill? <br /> <br /> The whole point of the original story was the intense duality of intellect between the ordinary detective who was responsible and the professional who develops a ruthless but elegant plan to achieve his goal and then leave. None of this has survived. All that we have is the old tired American CIA / FBI / army against the evil terrorist plot, we have all seen 1000 times before. <br /> <br /> But of course, the MBA of the film company realized that here a new intellectual corner would lose their income from a short attention group, so the answer is ...... Bruce Willis, BIG explosions and a crippled plot. They assume that the American audience will not be able to relate to the threat of a foreign statesman (where France is on the map at the end), so it will be American! <br /> <br /> Another example of a film desecrated by a meeting room. ,
