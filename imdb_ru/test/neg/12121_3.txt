Unfortunately, a boring click, and obviously the only way to see it is the bootleg version of Public Domain, which is so blurred and dark that sometimes itâ€™s hard to figure out where the screen is. Leading actors are a nuisance. The man spends most of his screen time trying to appear careless, charming and sexy, completely forgetting what the film is about and that he is suspected of being killed because of some lady who played it for goose. The lady herself just walks through the film, being decent if she is not busy looking sweet. These are pretty badly written things, never interesting and witty. No good camera work, no memorable soundtrack, no glamorous actresses or atmospheric decorations. It only scratches the surface of the genre, and nothing will happen if you miss this fully-clickable click.
