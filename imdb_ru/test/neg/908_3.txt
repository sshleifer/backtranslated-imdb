The film uses motifs that can be plagiarism from the movie Waiting Before the Dark (1967), a much better film of Terence Young with Audrey Hepburn in the lead role. “Dead Silence” is a pale paraphrase. There is nothing new here - a hidden object in the doll, bad people who want it, a bad guy posing as a good guy. The disability, however, has changed: Audrey Hepburn could not see, the child in DS can not speak. But both stories are handicap dependent. Where "Wait To Dark" created intolerable uncertainty, "Dead Silent" allows you to guess the outcome, and the story - such a stereotype.
