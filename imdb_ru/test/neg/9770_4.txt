I'm a big fight. As a story that is surreal, this film could be great (as big as it is estimated by some here), but mixed with acting skills (director and relatives playing the main roles, for financial reasons, I think) found here ... although calling it an action is not only part of the word, it gives it a new meaning! Brand new meaning! <br /> <br /> If you like surrealistic films (I really like some of them, for example, see “Japan’s strange circus”), you may overlook the flaws (see above) and enjoy it more. In the end, there are great ideas! A lot of wonderful metaphors and ambiguous scenes, but watching this (with a group of friends) almost all of us just could not stop laughing ... of course, not the director's intention! Again, everyone has their own sympathy, as can be seen from the high appreciation of this film, but I could recommend the film only if you know the work that Alejandro Khodorovsky and / or his fan did!
