The actors were not believable, the story was really weak, full and completely predictable. Really disappointed in Depardieu. It's a shame that they no longer focused on the struggle of the Canadian struggle for independence. We have seen this love story many times before, only with the best actors! We had to wait for the last 15 minutes for a bit of drama! The soundtrack was absolutely disturbing. An underscore hits your head with sentimentality. But really too much. The only thing we found was that they allowed the Indians to speak their language. And we found the cinematography of an Indian village relatively realistic.
