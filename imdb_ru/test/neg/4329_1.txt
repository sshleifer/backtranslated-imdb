Imagine that you are watching a slide show in which the projector lingers on each slide long enough for you to remember it three times. Now imagine that the images in the slideshow consist entirely of worldly scenes. small park; and an empty tennis court; piano. Now imagine that the people who run the slideshow are frustratingly slow, semi-clear talking about events that only occasionally relate to the slides they show you. Big ?? You have just realized the whole film “The Song of India”. <br /> <br /> The film is a painfully slow editing of images that do little but shout “Look at me! I am a PROFOND !! with such a blatant self-esteem that the pictures themselves and the film as a whole turn out to be not only deprived of depth, but also in a comical sense deprived of depth. Visual elements could easily be replaced with a series of static images, as described above, because people are so rare on the screen, and even when they are, people actually move only a little more often than furniture. Do they never speak or interact in any meaningful way? they just stand there, looking at each other, and sometimes cry. The most energetic moment in the entire first hour of the film is when three people walk slowly through the parking lot. In fact, visual effects could easily be completely eliminated, as the story is told entirely through the story. The story of a woman who hates India, because she is hot, and hates people, and does not hate India, because she is hot (this moment was covered several times). This also applies to a man who feels that he has the right to sleep with the above-mentioned woman, as she will sleep with anyone who asks her, but he cannot sleep with her simply because he never asks, and he is very upset about it. Therefore, he looks at her as a lonely tear runs down his cheek. Later, he looks at his bike, and a single tear rolls down his cheek. In fact, you can't see a lonely tear run down his cheek when he looks at his bike, but you still know that it’s there, just because it’s such a movie. <br /> <br /> Best of all, the narrative becomes the background buzz, serving as the perfect complement to the evocative visual effects. Just being conscious throughout the film would require the highest act of determination. Watching this and a really serious and meaningful idea of ​​what it should be would have caused the same migraine as an attempt to read long technical documents in the dark. This film is perhaps the greatest monument to a pseudo-artistic claim that man has ever known.
