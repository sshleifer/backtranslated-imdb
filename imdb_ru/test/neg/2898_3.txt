Ninja III is not as bad as Enter The Ninja, the first part of this “trilogy,” but it's still a very bad movie. This is unlikely to please fans of martial arts films, because there is not enough action, but even the action scenes themselves are often spoiled by ridiculous overkill and unnecessary violence. As if the film was not already weak enough, the filmmakers turn parts of it into the idiotic plagiarism of The Exorcist. The only redemptive value is the winning presence of an actress who plays the “dominant” heroine; she is a beautiful and athletic woman, whom the director does not forget to exploit in various careless ways - she is just an aerobic teacher. I don’t mind a little soft exploitation, but she shouldn’t pretend to be anything else.
