I remember all the excitement around this movie when Alia was killed. A fan of Ms. Rice’s novels, my first thought was: “How can they play Queen of the Damned without first performing Lestat Vampire?) <br /> <br /> Finally, after seeing the movie, now I see they did it. It. If you read these books, imagine that you are extracting the bloody parts from “The Vampire of Lestat”, combining Marcus and Marius in one character and removing everything related to the start of Lestat (the hunt for wolves, his violin playing, the Vampire Theater, and Louis, Claudia and Gabrielle), and then in the last 15 minutes, squeeze into the "Queen of the Damned." <br /> <br /> That we lose is a very important part of the character of Lestat. His inner agony from having to kill in order to live, the fact that he carefully tries to choose the killers as his victims, and his love-hate relationship with Louis, Armand, Gabrielle and all other vampires. <br /> <br /> It is also important that we lose the “Gemini Story”, which is the origin of the vampires Miss Rice. And although I am sure that cannibalism was too intense to show on the screen, they could have done something closer and show us more of ancient Egypt. <br /> <br /> Even worse, this love interest between Jesse and Lestat arose between us. "The Vampire Chronicles" is, in fact, the American story of Yoni. For those who do not know, Yoni is another form of Hentai (Japanese porn comics). But in the Yoni it is about the relationship of gays with men who are told by a woman. Although I am sure that many men object to the "gaiety" of the characters, in this film they went to the extreme in the opposite way. For instead of Lestat pursuing the murderers, he pursues young female fans. <br /> <br /> And the other flaws in logic and storyline are huge. First, Lestat comes out of the sleeping age, and then asks Marius how he went through the 1950s in red velvet. Marius has no idea who Elvis is, and says he overslept this period. Makes you wonder where Lestat knows about fashion and music of the 50s, as he himself slept at the same time. And nothing is ever said of Louis, Claudia, or Gabriel. I think this is a huge shame. It’s like watching “Snow White and the 3 Dwarfs.” <br /> <br /> In general, a film that I thought was really bad. The only good thing about this was the soundtrack. Most of the acting skills were bad, the accents made me climb the wall, and all the really deep parts of the book were removed, leaving us only with a hollow shell, like Enkil, after it was dry. /> <br /> If you want to watch a good modern movie about vampires, take Lost Boys, an original interview with a vampire or even a few old Dark Shadows episodes. Let it be alone, with a stake in the heart, garlic cloves on the neck and a bottle of holy water in the mouth. <br /> <br /> At the end, remember that before Aliya was killed, it was supposed to go straight to the video, no theatrical release was planned. Now I understand why it was. It’s just sad that someone as talented as she is remembered for this dog from the movie, instead of what it could really shine. <br /> <br /> I rate this 2 on a scale of 1-10,
