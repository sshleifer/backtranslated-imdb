Yes, of course, the film, its visual effects already looked awful and not very promising, but the premise and the cast looked good, so I still expected this film to entertain me. This is unfortunately not the case. The idea is good, but the story is full of incredibles and logically erroneous. <br /> <br /> This movie is potentially flushed down the toilet. The main plot is interesting and somewhat original. It's good enough to make a good adventurous movie, as you think. This film, however, does not entertain, and I think this is the biggest drawback of this film. Perhaps this in itself is too serious and a little more humor, of course, would not bring any harm to the film. Instead, now it is nothing more than an unconvincing and cheap film, filled with one unlikely event after another, which also steals from other, more successful films. Meinley "Jurassic Park", obviously. <br /> <br /> Characters also do not help make the film more attractive, or at least interesting to watch. I still think that Edward Burns did a pretty decent job as a “heroic” main character. The rest of the characters, however, are really entangled in the film, and they get very little to do. The film is rather based on the visual effect, which is extremely poor. Catherine McCormack also plays a very annoying character. In fact, all that her character does is to complain and talk about how right she was, and everything else, well, how wrong. Her character is simply not pretty. And the rest of the characters ... well, I already forgot their names, I think it says enough about them. Of course, it’s true that only Ben Kingsley’s performance makes this film worth seeing. He is truly excellent in his villainous role as a businessman, but from the moment he disappears from the film, the film really comes down quickly. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is very bad. He has terrible CGI effects, and they couldn’t even make the simpler “blue screen” effects look convincing in the film. Kits are also terrible and cheap, as they can fall and break at any time. <br /> <br /> The film never becomes tense, exciting or adventurous, as the plot is presented in the least interesting and attractive way. This is a very distant film with distant characters that is not impressive. There are many sequences of actions, but they all look so ridiculous and far from believable that they never become tense or good enough. <br /> <br /> So basically, this film lacks everything that is needed to create a film genre like this one, good and successful. It's sad to see low director Peter Hyams sank in the last couple of years after having shot some good films in the 70s and 80s. <br /> <br /> 4/10
