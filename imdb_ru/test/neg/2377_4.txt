This film is an excellent example of the fact that a film cannot be successful with a high budget alone. Obviously, a lot of time and effort was spent on this: the animation is smooth, detailed and excellent - the soundtrack is not too memorable, except for the final song of Celine Dion (at least I think it was her). Musical accompaniment is a powerful full orchestral material. Glory to the animators and composers! 9/10. However, the story and characters are crumbling. He feels very “out there, done that,” predictably and uninteresting. Characters have distinctive features, but nothing special. They annoyed me endlessly. I tried very hard to please, but I did not care about history - it was a cliché-adventure plot. There were "jokes" that were not funny. It was provoking vomiting, predictable from start to finish. The dialogue was cliché and terrible - especially the last line "This is not ... giving you wings, this is love!" Whatever it is, I remember cringing. I wanted him to hurry and finish. I was not the only one - the people I went with thought it was boring. Please watch the movie Asterix and Obelix Cleopatra if you are going to watch any. It was a waste of time.
