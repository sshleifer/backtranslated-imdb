This film is filled with so many idiotic moments that you wonder how it was done. For example, they fall into the sewer from the Capitol, and while they are in the sewer, you can see signs pointing to various government buildings, and then they come to the middle of the street! I very much doubt that government buildings will provide public access through the city sewer system. In any case, I gave it 2 instead of 1 just because of its comic value. I laughed all the way to the idiocy of all the participants in this film.
