The Touch of Death, born in 1988, is probably the most disappointing Fulci film I've ever seen, prompting me to join the horror horror choir who think his films are getting worse as you become later in his career. Considering the plot summaries, I expected some kind of bloody, vicious merriment with this, but, despite all its bizarre flourishes, it is tiresome even for a duration of only 80 minutes and suffers from nauseous wear and film production (or its absence). <br /> <br /> El Story: A widower-addict is a winemaker and dines rich (and strange) women whom he finds using lonely-heart speakers before offending them in a terrible way — sometimes eating them or feeding their animals — and stealing their money to keep their debtors at bay. Of course, it is unlikely that only one person would be the master of such a confusing pathology at the same time (drug addict, psycho / sociopath, cannibal), but this is Fulci! <br /> <br /> In fact, the touch is the cheapest and most rare Fulci film I've seen. There is almost no one in it, even against the background of shots in the street, for example. The reader of the news, who constantly appears on the screens of the films in order to warn the non-existent squad about the latest actions of the maniac, works in the most miserable television studio on the planet. He never even looks at the camera, because he has to read all the headers from the offset sheets of paper. <br /> <br /> In some scenes, the hero just mumbles, muttering to himself what he did or what he does. is going to do, but acting is far from good enough to endure this kind of thing, so the main result is the boredom of the viewer. The film also looks dull and ugly as a whole. I read that it was intended for the Italian telemo (was it ever shown in this place? Given the amount of blood, this seems unlikely), and it smelled of trashy old telema production values. <br /> This is also Fulci's first foray into frank black humor, but he is too reckless to make it work. Sometimes it is noticeable funny or "stupid" music is used to play against a terrible scene, for example, when a hero / villain carves a dead body in his basement. The effect is not really scary, not funny and not ironic, whatever you want - it’s basically just stupid and stupid. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are some salutary moments of blood (which you are waiting for, trying not to fall asleep), including the possible killing by the oven (!) of a woman who simply will not die, even after her face it will be completely broken by a bloody club and a homeless guy who has a car moving back and forth about five times. However, the most outrageous element of the Touch is the physical deformation of the widows who are pursued by a madman. Beards, hairy moles, dirty hare lips - this is not what he was looking for women with such features, it is just the way that all widows of lonely hearts, obviously. Mr. Crazy frowns when he embraces these women. Black humor such vivid misogyny can have some stamina or resonance, if the film was not so poorly executed as a whole. In the end, Touch Of Death just seems like a really lazy, inarticulate mess.
