One of those films where you bet on who will die first and who will survive at the end. There was something in the movie that made me disappear. I think because I look back all the time and think, "Yes, still on that tree ... still looking at the water." Bad character development. I felt nothing when they were in danger. I voted for the crocodile. It was hard for me to believe that the crocodile would first try to overturn the boat, and then when she jumped into the boat, I find it really unlikely. The crocodile sometimes seems too supernatural ("everyone knows, everyone sees"). Also, when a crocodile attacks, its behavior seems very unreal. This is a killing machine, and it will not allow victims to escape two or three times in a row, especially when attacking in the water.
