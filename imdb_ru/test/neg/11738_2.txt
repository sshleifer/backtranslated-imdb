This is one of the silliest ideas for a movie. Make a classic movie offscreen. I hope no one tries this technique again. In 1998, Goodwill director Gus Van Sant tried it, remaking the classic 1960 Hitchcock psychopath, and failed. What was Van Sant thinking about? This remake doesn't even come close to the original. The few changes that were made here did not help. If you want to see "Psycho", the choice is obvious. Watch the original. <br /> <br /> * (out of four)
