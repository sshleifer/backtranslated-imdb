The first word I can find to describe this film is “Awful.” <br /> <br /> This film is one of the worst films I have ever seen. First of all, this is a plot, a very subtle plot (I will not comment further on this part) and a plot that many films of this genre follow. It makes a movie so bad because you know what will happen. Secondly, there are many questions in the film that are never revealed. One of the questions (and this is not a spoiler) is the following: WHAT CHILDREN HELL ACT IN THIS CORN !!!!!!!!!! Thirdly, the characters are very bad not only because the film is bad, but also because of the miserable actors. They are bad as they can be. <br /> <br /> The last thing that makes this movie bad is that it is a horror movie. You must be afraid of murder or sudden shocks, but you are not afraid, you are not terrified, because you know what will happen. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: the film is as bad as the movie about killer ants! I was hoping that it was a very good film, but since the story is bad, the actors are bad, the film raises a lot of questions, and because it's not scary, the film is best not seen.
