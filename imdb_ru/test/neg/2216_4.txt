Of all the screenings of E.R.Burroughs, in which Doug McClure was filmed in the 70s, this is the worst of all. This is so informative that you can feel the taste of the sets and feel the emptiness of the lamps above. This thing looks like a very, very large budget school play, or, indeed, a very, very budgetary action movie, which actually is. In many cases, it was said that this was the last recording of the genre, and I hope so. The genre did not die peacefully, but in terrible agony, among smoke, false blood and lousy sound effects. Peter Cushing must have felt like a boy again, like a psycho, a professor whose shirt remains white like snow after gentlemen have dragged through slippery holes in the Underworld. What a sport he was to take part in this confusion and carry it so bravely. <br /> <br /> Shot entirely on the sound stage and accompanied then by the fashionable, now intolerable soundtrack to the synthesizer, this film’s main anti-attraction is cardboard monsters. Yes, there are always such monsters in Burroughs' adaptation, but they are rarely so funny, helpless, or deprived of any kind of trust. On several occasions, during high-level fighting scenes, when Mr. McClure heroically attacks creatures, you can almost hear a hollow sound when his head hits the side of a triplodacto-cryptosaurus. Fortunately, animals explode and rise in flames the minute they stumble and fall. Indeed, there are quite a few motivated explosions, as the film (and the genre) approaches the final. And sweet Miss Munro loses her underground accent. <br /> <br /> In the triple bill, which is currently on the market, there is this film, as well as two more films - “The Land that We Forgot, and the War of the Lords of Atlantis”. The first two are quite strong records, especially the first, with a lot of money invested and sometimes even exciting scripts. Don't expect any of these qualities from this movie. Drink with your friends and shamelessly laugh at what they see. In the end, manufacturers also had no shame.
