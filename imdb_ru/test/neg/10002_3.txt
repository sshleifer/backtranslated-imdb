Even the Beatles could not write songs that everyone liked, and although Walter Hill is not a prankster, he has no equal when it comes to thought-provoking militants. The nineties came, and the social platforms in music and cinema changed, the appearance of “The Rapper”, which became a movie star, was in full swing, the acting game was relegated to the overwhelming regional accent and transparency of the acting skills of each person. It was one of the many ice films that I saw in my childhood and loved, only to watch them later and cringe. Bill Paxton and William Sadler are firefighters with basic lives, while the tenant of a burning building, about to take off in a fire, hands over a map with golden meanings. I pass it to Walter to quickly and accurately set up the main characters and location. But I blame everyone who participated in performing on Lame-o. Ice-t and cube must have been red-hot at this time, and although I enjoyed their career as rappers, in my opinion they failed in this film. For about ninety minutes, one guy turns his ridiculous back to another guy to such an extent that you find yourself locked in several states of disbelief. Now this is a film, not a documentary, so I will not waste my time retelling all the stupid plot twists in this film, but there were a lot of them, and they led nowhere. I had the feeling that everyone on the set was confused and just played with hands. There are two more things that I still like: one scene with a needle, and the other - Sadler's huge pistol. As a result, this movie looks like a domino pizza. Yes, I eat it badly if I am hungry and I don’t want to cook, but I understand perfectly well what this shit tastes like. 3 stars, fur.
