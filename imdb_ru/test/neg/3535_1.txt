Why would a filmmaker with a track record like Wes Craven like to give his name to a boring collection of stamps, as you might guess. And if he still spent the money on it - all 50 pounds, judging by his appearance - he should have knocked on the director's door for a refund at that moment when the film came out. There are many "alien" robberies, and this is one of the worst. Even a reliable Lance Henriksen, burdened with a character who is blunt enough to allow his children to roam the dangerous government lab, cannot save him. As a cure for insomnia, it rates 10+. As part of quality filmmaking - forget it.
