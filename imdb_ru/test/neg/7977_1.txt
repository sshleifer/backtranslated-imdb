I bought this refund for $ 1.99 in Hollywood and overpaid. I did not expect much, but thought it would be something to fall asleep at least. I quickly noticed a very weak storyline, a rough replay by everyone (no one speaks like this, except in cartoons) and, it would seem, the direction “will do it the way we go.” I know that the participants in this mess should be very embarrassed by this, and I am sure that this did not help any career. As for the 35-year-old movie lover, he now gave a ready-made answer to the most terrible question from films you have ever seen. <br /> <br />
