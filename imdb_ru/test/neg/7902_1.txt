Wow, this is really stereotypical, terrible trash. I feel sorry for those who may have wasted their money to see it. <br /> <br /> I’m pretty sure that I have never laughed at this whole movie, I just can’t believe that they would make such a horrible movie. <br /> Now I will be more cautious when I watch night movies. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I'm not saying that this is the worst movie of the existing ones (although it may be), but I do not think that I have seen something so stupid and unfunny in my life. This makes the TV series "Scary Movies" look smart. <br /> <br /> 1/10 I would give 0 if they allowed me
