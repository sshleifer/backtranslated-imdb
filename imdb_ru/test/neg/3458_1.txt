SHIT! I accidentally watched this film, thinking that it was the Swimming Stream, which was released in 2003. I seriously regret having spent an hour of my life sitting on it. Shame on whoever gave this garbage a reward. I completely hated this film - in fact, I did not finish it. An hour later, I could not bear it. I am disgusted by the fact that people are playing with such a lousy scenario that tries to thwart a dozen other stories about human interest and such a game BA-AD. Painful. I rate it 1 star out of 10. An amateur can make a much, much better movie.
