This experimental silent film, made in Switzerland by an independent British film company, is mostly remembered as the first Paul Robson film. This is very artistic, with frames often seemingly meaningless for history, which in any case is difficult to understand due to the lack of a sufficient number of names. From what I learned, Robson's wife, Ada, makes interracial love with a white man named Thorn. This does not bother the owner of a cigar / bar at the hotel / hotel where Thorn lives (and she seems to have a lesbian relationship with a barmaid), but an older woman expresses the city’s point of view in the title: If I had my own way, we would Negroes were not allowed here. ”Thorn is also called the“ Negro lover ”by someone at the bar. Ada tries to reconcile with Pete (Robson), but eventually leaves him. Thorn’s cheek and dying in some way. Thorn must have been accused of murder because we find out that he was acquitted. As for Pete, he gets a letter from the mayor saying that it would be better for everyone if he leaves the city. Thus, the film is more about racism than about anything, but in a good note the owner tells Pete : "It is sad that they think they are right. We are like that." The meaning of the name is a mystery. This may be related to the fact that Ada is fair-skinned (borderline Negro) or to the border behavior of the main characters.
