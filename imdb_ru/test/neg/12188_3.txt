Has anyone else noticed that this version is basically a remake of the 1933 version with some scenes shot? It makes me think less about a film that demonstrates a certain lack of creativity. Frankly, I tend to lean in favor of Katherine Hepburn, but this version of the film looks like cinematic plagiarism. The 1933 version was pleasant and enjoyable, although from time to time it was a little awkward in the presentation and transition, and then this version took the script, music, and even a significant amount of scene blocking from the previous version. I donâ€™t understand the point of making a film again, when the method of reworking it was basically to remake the film George Cukor with all the same, except for the people working on it.
