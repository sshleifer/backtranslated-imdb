I went to see this movie because it was recommended to my wife and she wanted to go. <br /> <br /> We both tried to look at our watches long before the end of the film to see how much more we had to endure. Two hours and six minutes, it is. It is roughly equally divided between the battle scenes (about a dozen of them are more or less interchangeable) and the development of the plot. <br /> <br /> One would think that in this case the son of the younger leader of the tribe, who conquer half the world, the plot would be relatively easy. There are quite a few raw materials from which you can make a pretty good story. However, the writers have infuriated it completely. We have no real story. Instead, we get the Hollywood version of the story. <br /> <br /> What supports the young Temudgin during his long, almost endless, or, apparently, they seem to the viewer misfortunes? Why, of course, the love of a good woman. <br /> <br /> How does he get out of jail? Well, the old monk, who recognizes his innate kindness and greatness, is sent across the continent to bring to this kind woman a talisman, symbolizing Temudgin's love for her, falling dead close enough to her to find him where he lies. Talisman in his hand. And, of course, she goes and, inexplicably, having become rich and powerful, saves him. <br /> <br /> How does he escape from the shackles? Well, he goes to the temple of the great wolf god Tengri (or some similar name), and Tengri frees him with magic. Yeah, right. <br /> <br /> Why does he want to become the ruler of the Mongols? God-wolf again, apparently. Off goes Temujin to ask for guidance, and - surprise! surprise! - he gets it. "Laws," he says to himself. â€œMongols need laws. Good, simple. God, that was impressive. <br /> <br /> Finally, how did he win the decisive battle against the more powerful forces of his rival? Of course, the best tactic, but also with the help of the good old wolf god, who sends a storm at the height of the battle. All troops are compressed when the rumble of thunder and flashes of lightning (you see, the Mongols are afraid of thunder), but not our Temudgin. The troops, completely overwhelmed by his courage, proclaim him king! <br /> <br /> I do not know what motivates people to continue to produce this type of garbage. The funny thing is that it is interspersed with all sorts of tough realism: a lot of milk, dirt and violence. As if the producers of this film wanted to do the trivial things right so that the audience would not notice how infantile some of the big things are. <br /> <br /> In a graphic close-up, a lot of violence: slashes, traces, streams of blood, splashes of blood, clouds of blood - the guys from the blood had a great time, in fact. Despite the realism, this can not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> I have to mention the ridiculous final scene of the CGI battle. The way someone might think that all this looks realistic is beyond my power. They are not Oh, and all this is filmed in a standard Hollywood style - breathtaking landscapes for breathtaking landscapes and a super-close-up plan for Stedikam for battle scenes. And standard Dolby super-sound effects from shocks and blows and a constant low-frequency hum to maintain voltage. <br /> <br /> Tiring. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
