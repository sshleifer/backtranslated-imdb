There is nothing worse than science fiction created by people who do not feel it. Understanding the concept, which in itself would not be so terrible (a future in which cloning is so common that you need to be considered a crime that you breed someone who is too close to you on genetic grounds), the screenwriter continued to allow his cruelty. He had enough imagination. <br /> <br /> When Tim Robbins’s character was able to guess the security guard’s computer password, simply by forcing her to tell him something about himself, I realized that I would have problems. Later it turned out that this ability was due to the fact that Robbins adopted the "empathy virus", viruses used for instant (or almost instantaneous) advanced training of its users. Robbins' love interest complained about her own experiences with such a virus — the Chinese language virus in Chinese, which allowed her to speak Chinese, but, as she complained, “she could not understand what she was saying.” Well, firstly, sympathy, no matter how intense, not ESP. Without including any true aspect of mind reading (like, for example, an empathy virus that actively releases virions in the neighborhood, infects nearby people, collects pieces of their memory, and then goes to the original owner - which, as you can probably say, - a rascal from the impractical side) you cannot justify the possibility of determining a specific detail, for example someone’s password, simply “listening to what you didn’t say.” You also cannot acquire the ability to speak the language without understanding what you are saying - the virus cannot infect your vocal cords and translate for you on the fly, because the virus cannot * think *. So that you can speak Chinese, such a learning virus would have to change your brain. This would have to code knowledge among the neurons, and as soon as it is there, it is * your * - you, of course, understand what you are saying because you have to do it. To use your own brain to complete a task, you need to understand this task (for the most part). Unless, of course, the film assumes that the virus was deliberately designed to create some kind of strange mental split with several personalities, with some of your characters acting as a built-in one-way translator. <br /> The distribution of the languages ​​spoken by the characters is decent enough, although far from remarkable enough to justify all the love provided by other reviewers. Moreover, all the multicultural inserts in the world cannot compensate for a simple, frustrating fact: the dialogue stinks! It is slow, it is a burden, and it is unnatural. Again, I’m sure that the adherents have convinced themselves that boring weirdness is simply the result of an inspired genius who creates a truly futuristic (and therefore linguistic drift-prone) form of speech. I disagree. Good dialogue is good dialogue in any era, and the same can be said about trivia. <br /> <br /> Finally, I will once again return to the main concept of the film - banning sex with myself. Widespread cloning is a classic science fiction theme. Like global warming, leading to environmental destruction (which is also included in Code 46). Unfortunately, the two do not go together! If you have an environmental disaster that seriously reduces the available living space, you will not run around cloning people! You have enough problems with the population - you do not add them, releasing repeated issues. Regular old-fashioned sex and birth provides all the necessary populations, and any cloning will be ruthlessly suppressed. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the film was not a bad one. He had good cinematography. Perhaps if I looked at how muted he was, I could enjoy it.
