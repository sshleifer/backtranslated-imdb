But why? Among the directors who came out in the 80s and 90s, Gus Van Sant is one of my idols. There are several others. Stephen Sodeberg, PT Anderson, Tim Hunter, Danny Boyle, Martin Donovan, Harmony Korin, Wes Anderson. Peculiar, mad several times, but consistent, surprising, unpredictable. Their names make me turn on the TV, go to the video store, or even buy a ticket and go to the cinema. "Psycho" Van Sant, however, makes me think. What for? I think. Shot by shot massacre of one of the eternal classics. The color was harsh, the performances awful. What did Vince Vaughn do? Was it a parody? A bad joke? What the hell was that? Anne Heche how Janet Lee? Who dressed her? Viggo Mortensen with a cowboy hat. Viggo is a great actor, but in this case he could not make us forget John Gavin, and if Julianne Moore was introduced to the world through this performance, there would be no “Hours” for her, I renounce badly the work of one of my idols. There remains a crying question: why, Mr. Van Sant? Perhaps, according to President Clinton, because he could. I'm afraid this is no excuse.
