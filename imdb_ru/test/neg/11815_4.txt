Pam Greer is the sister of the 1970s super-soul, appearing in many blasting films that have recently been discovered and appreciated by the new generation. I can safely say that BLACK MOM, WHITE MOM is probably the worst Pam Greer film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Grier is Lee, and Margaret Markov is Karen; these are two female prisoners who escaped from prison after Karen's revolutionary friends attacked a camper. Chained to each other, the film becomes SIGNIFICANT for women, but there are three separate plots in it: a fatal criminal (Filipino star Vika Diaz) wants Lee dead, a cowboy bounty hunter (excellent Sid Haig) is looking for two girls; and revolutionary friends Karen are looking for her. The film eventually becomes so confusing and inconspicuous with two women that the title should have been “Men Pursuing Women”. Greer, the star of the militants, does not have the opportunity to participate in any of the many (too long) scenes of militants. Markov is great, as Karen and Greer are fine, like Lee, but both of them are ultimately forgotten in many scenes. In one interesting scene, a bounty hunter forces a policeman and his boss to drop his pants so that he can shoot a man with the smallest penis (judging by his whore), but he is easily forgotten amid all the mess. <br /> <br /> BLACK MOTHER, WHITE MOM starts superbly as a film about women in prison with lesbians and a scene in the shower, and then completely switches to the chase movie. If director Eddie Romero (known to have filmed horror movies in Philippines) just got carried away with the WIP theme, he would be fine. Instead, BMWM is getting very old and very fast, and the unexpected finale just makes the viewers wonder why they watched the 90-minute film so that it ended! Another problem: where should the film be installed? Although some accents are Spanish speaking, and the cities have Spanish names (Los Robles, etc.), All the natives are clearly Asian! Hmmm ... Recommended only for loyal Greer fans who will even then be disappointed.
