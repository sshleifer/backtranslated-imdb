A few years ago, I caught a pretty well-made television film called Linda. It was made in 1973 and starred in the title role of Stella Stevens in the title femme fatale. Imagine my surprise when, ten years later, I again saw the same story unfolding on TV late at night. However, it was the 1993 version with Virginia Madsen in the lead role. Don't get me wrong, I can handle remakes, even obscure ones. But this poorly written and poorly filmed retreat made me feel sorry for both Madsen and my colleague in the film Richard Thomas. Unlike the original, the dialogue here is crossed out, which makes me think: “Why did they bother to rewrite it?” Secondly, the work with the camera is very hard, and the film reserve is bad. At times I was reminded of the student film competition at the beginning of Christopher Guest’s The Big Picture. Finally, the cast is either bored (Madsen) or misery (Thomas). In fact, the only one who thinks he really enjoys working is Ted McGinley. Of course, with his perfectly styled hair and cropped teeth, he really pulls himself out of his previous work on The Boat of Love. The point is to borrow criticism from Opus Penguin in Bloom County: <br /> <br /> “This film does what Johnstown did for Kool-Aid for the film.” <br /> <br /> Thomkat
