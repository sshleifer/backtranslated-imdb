MGM Solyanka Jimmy Durante is having a big party for everyone in Hollywood. Large stars do not appear - we have "Three Puppets", "Laurel and Hardy", "Durante" and "Lupe Veles". I did not recognize anyone else - they were probably unknown (for good reason). The film contains annoyingly funny jokes and some really terrible songs and choreography. The only thing that saved him from a complete catastrophe was the “battle” of Laurel and Hardy with Lupe Veles and the wonderful Disney cartoon “Hot Chocolate Soldier”. This is a beautiful, very colorful cartoon that gives a huge boost to the film. Otherwise, the film is a huge bore. There is no director credited - what does this tell you?
