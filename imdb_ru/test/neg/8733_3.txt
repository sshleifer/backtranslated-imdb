After his career as a leading romantic man ended in the late 1960s, Rock Hudson starred in many different projects, including television shows and smaller films. Nevertheless, I believe that Embryo is his only move as a mad scientist, and this is probably good. I guess he needed a job. <br /> <br /> In one dark and stormy night, brilliant Dr. Paul Holliston (Hudson) beats and wounds a Doberman, whom he returns to his laboratory (which looks like a damp Midwest basement). Then he manages to raise an unborn puppy dog ​​outside the uterus, so naturally he decides to do the same with a man. He also brings up Victoria (the beautiful Barbara Carrera) from the fruit. Victoria is growing at an amazing pace and is soon turning into a gorgeous young woman. <br /> <br /> As expected, things are completely different. After a serene start, Holliston's daughter-in-law Martha (Diane Ladd) begins to wonder where the young woman is from, and Victoria herself begins to show signs of instability and violence. The final sequence is one long car chase straight from Smokey and the Bandit, after which Victoria, shockingly aged in just a few minutes, is attacked by the frantic Holliston, who tries in vain to destroy her ugly creation. together with your unborn child. All this is accompanied by a squeal of tires, the roar of engines, car fire and many sirens. The sluggish ending - a bunch of paramedics who are desperately working on Victoria, while Holliston writhes in regret - is more work than creepy. <br /> <br /> Although this film was just shot in 1976, it is very outdated. The only difference between this and many crazy films of the 1940s is that the Hudson is the main role, not Boris Karloff. The kits are pretty cheap and very outdated for the modern audience, to the extent that the Hudson tape recorder is the size of a refrigerator. Most of the action takes place in a poorly lit lab. Hudson sleeps through his abominable role, giving the impression that he is a truly insane movie star, and Ladd and Carrera are much more believable. Surprisingly, Roddy McDowell appears briefly as a chess player. <br /> <br /> Passport video transmission is very poor quality, as if it was made from a bad copy of VHS using home equipment. If you feel nostalgic for 1976, look at it once to say what you did. Otherwise, watch a football match or TV series.
