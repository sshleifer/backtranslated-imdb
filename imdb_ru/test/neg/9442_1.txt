I can not believe that someone gives this film a good rating. In addition to the terrible game, thin (non-existent?) Storyline and slow speed, this movie is worth seeing if you are really trying to fall asleep. The brain of the writer and director must have been scrambled to ever come up with something as disgusting as this. Based on the DVD case story, the premise did sound promising. But for the first ten minutes I knew that it was a hopeless affair. If you want to see the REALLY creeping idea of ​​Site 51, take a look at the remake of "The Hills Have Eyes." The country of dreams will soon disappear, as well as all its pathetic films. FOLLOWING!!!
