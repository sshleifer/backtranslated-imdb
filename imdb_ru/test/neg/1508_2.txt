The grandmother, director Boris Pavlovsky (who?), Sees eight friends going through a terrible night when a psycho-killer wearing an old rubber mask and nightgown interrupts their party. <br /> <br /> They say that you can Do not judge the book on the cover, but it seems that the same does not apply to the DVD: I was in the mood for a REALLY bad horror movie last night, and since The cover of Grandma was a stunningly photographed photo of the title killer swinging an ax, a terrible typography (they even use the Sand system font, a certain design no, no!) and credits with the participation of absolutely anyone I didn't hear about, I expected that it will be pretty lousy. <br /> <br /> It was! <br /> <br /> When a film starts in less than an hour, it really should not spend too much time before it takes action; Grandmother, however, spends the first 20 minutes or so with her ugly group of friends devoted to senseless games and an extremely banal conversation. Anyone who actually stays in the film long enough to start the killing (and I doubt that most sane people will worry) will be subjected to several horrible death scenes with amateur blood, a lot of horrible acts and an unexpected ending that comes as no surprise ( If you saw the April Fool's Day, then guess what kind of a turn, before it is found). <br /> <br /> Grandma is not inspired, uninteresting and almost unobservable. Avoid.
