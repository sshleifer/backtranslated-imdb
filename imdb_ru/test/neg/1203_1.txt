I remember watching it for the first time in the 80s, when I was a teenager. Dude, I read reviews about this garbage, and I was surprised by the vote. This film does not deserve four stars !!! This movie is NOT better than Topgun. Topgun has its own problems; do not get me wrong. This film should be banned only by its own stupidity. So many stereotypes, so many loops, so much bad dialogue. I cannot think of the one redemptive quality of this vomiting This is not an action / adventure. This is a bad movie joke. It seems like watching Plan 9 with F-16 stock frames. This film not only defies logic and common sense in the context of the military situation, it sends an alarming message. The military is not going to save your father from the inevitable evil of the Middle East. So go there and grab a multi-million weapon and knock it out of the sinister grip of backward anti-American Arabs. Because you can't argue with these animals. This is a Bruckheimer film without a budget. Soft direction, weak game, weak music, idiotic plot, equal ... Iron Eagle.
