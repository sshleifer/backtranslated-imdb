Perhaps the worst film in the genre of the existing ones. It was announced as a comedy, but just tragically pompous. I do not think that someone could achieve something more horrible and annoying if he had been specifically asked for it. This is a toilet humor at its very poor, I would not even watch a trailer. I went to see it, because it was announced that if you like Monty Python, you will definitely like it. Whoever wrote it was either biased or seriously abnormal. I'm still surprised how honestly you can believe such a statement. Rarely I leave the cinema, in fact, in order for the film to have such an impact on me, great efforts are required: this one did it in just 30 minutes.
