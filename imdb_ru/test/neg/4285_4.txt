4 of 10 <br /> <br /> A somewhat incredible storyline with some “shocks” like haunted houses that really don't fit. <br /> <br /> Gary Oldham game is very erratic ... not so much the quality of performance, but the sequence. His character does not behave in concert. Sometimes calm / relaxed / methodical / thoughtful, sometimes strong / loud / almost crazy. This is simply implausible. <br /> <br /> Are many 80s films out of date? Will they be more pleasant in 20 years? <br /> <br />
