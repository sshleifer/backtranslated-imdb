Perhaps this is the worst of the gangster Cockney genres that has destroyed the British film industry since Moknie Guy Ritchie released the Lok Stack and two badly leading barrels. In this “Real Life” about Carlton Leach (who has it?) There is everything that is wrong with this genre, a truly horrible scenario consisting of people screaming “Cant”, “Fahcking Cant” and “I will kill you, you Damn I Can't "nausea. Acting is equally awful with the two most recognizable actors, the two former soap stars, quite noticeable from their depths. For some reason, the film assumes that we heard about these people and I can assure you that anyone north of Essex did not hear, and that we should be interested in some kind of story with a low loneliness of life. Why? This is not Goodfellas, despite the ad on the cover of the DVD. The story around the football hooligan turned into a bouncer, turned into a gangster, whom friends eventually shot. A plus for this movie. It seems that in all action movies the camera was tied to a rope and revolved around, while people pretended to fight and the story of someone that most people had never heard of and that nothing interesting happens, is also a waste of time. People talk about how cruel a film is, as if it were a sign of a great film, and although there is violence in many great films, this is just a reason to show what it is capable of. In general, this film is a reminder of why the British film industry has ceased to exist, and the sooner we stop funding these pitiful abortions, the better.
