I saw this “movie” in part because of the large amount of good reviews on Netflix, and I learned a valuable lesson from it. However, not a lesson about ethnic diversity ... the lesson I learned is “Don't trust reviews”. <br /> <br /> Yes, racism sucks and people are complicated, but people who really need this film will be the ones who are least attracted to it and least affected by it if they really see it. The only reason I can come up with a number of good reviews is that they are viewed by people who are not used to thinking or who watched their first thought-provoking film and for some reason think that Haggis invented the concept. In fact, he basically made this film, which should be called Racism for Dummies, as emotionally painful as possible to give to people who do not spend much time thinking that they discovered the fundamental truth, was never covered in the film earlier. Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance is not ... A special after-school program for mindless people cut into pieces the size of a bite the size of a ham, making it easier to swallow without much introspection. <br /> <br /> As if they portray everyone as the worst of extremes, just to please us that we are such good people, because we don’t identify with the characters. Let's face it. No one identifies himself with these characters because they are all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or, as one would expect, reverse stereotypes). He acted well (even if the dialogue is brutal) and is cleverly executed, so much so that you do not even think to ask "where is the beef?" until you can say the movie ends. The glowing car scene was well executed, like most of the film, but in the end did not go away. <br /> <br /> The messages are very tough, and because of the behind-the-scenes commercials, the producers obviously watched another movie, because in this film there is very little to laugh at, even during the time funny details are intended. I have to emphasize that this is NOT entertainment, more like a lesson in high school diversity ... Call it "blood on the highway" of racism. They might even show it in high school if not for Jennifer Esposito’s naked snapshot. <br /> <br /> In this film, all the assholes, and all learn lessons (except Michael Pena). who will get the best role, but the most predictable plot). <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie, with a bad script and good actors .... a terrible cartoon created by Paul Haggis for people who can 'I can't cope with anything but bold strokes in telling stories .. picture painted with crayons. <br /> <br /> Crash is nothing depressing, it causes emotions, but it does not teach anything if you already know that racism and prejudice are bad things.
