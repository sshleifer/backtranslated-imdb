First of all, I just want to say that I am a very big fan of Naruto. I love anime and manga stories. In addition, the first film only confirmed that Naruto is all about great fun, great action, great story ... But then the second film came out. I was very promoted, because the first film was great. But it did not satisfy me at all ... The story was lame, the action was not so good ... especially compared to the Anime series ... The same goes for the quality of the animation. I found it very bad ... Can the story get some lamer ... ANY ??? Where is Kyuubi Naruto? He never turned into a demon ... I mean ... GO !!! My advice ... watch the show (before episode 140, then it's just fillers), and then read Mangu, because it's still great. Do not pay attention to this film and hope for the best in the future ... <br /> <br /> All I gave him 4, just because it is Naruto ...
