For starters, this film was sick. Here your wife is dying, and you walk around the city with this blond chic on your side. Then your wife dies and after 2 months you are with this chic. Hank (James Brolin) is definitely moving fast throughout the film. I called him Fast Hank. Fast Hank marries this beautiful lady, and before you know it, she has sex with her best friends. What turns me on is when she “does it” in the barn with Kevin and falls into the trap of another friend Hanks. Kevin gets up and leaves, she throws her clothes and BAM !! Straight into the arms of this other guy, and they immediately begin to "do it." I think he finishes what Kevin started. HOW GREAT !!!! I like this movie for life ??? This is a typical movie "OLD YOUNG WOMAN", which says that you can get my body if I get your money ...
