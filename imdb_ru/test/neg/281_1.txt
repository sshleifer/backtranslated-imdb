I felt obligated to write about this film after joining IMDb, because I thought it was the worst script I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The cast / director's / other aspects of the film are fantastic. I love Brad Pitt with George Clooney. It is working. The witty banter has been there since the first movie. My question is: how in the world did they release this script from the development process? I thought the plot was developing not only as slugs racing towards the end of the sidewalk, but also this turn? (can I call it that) was so incredibly stupid that I wanted to go and ask for a refund at the ticket office. I have never felt so played and used from a film in my whole life. Here I was expecting something similar to the first film (good chemistry, good acting, good direction, amazing plot), but I found that they took my $ 8 and made fun of it. <br /> <br /> I still care that this film has collected more than 125 million dollars. So I felt that this film insulted my intellect. I still feel that the only part that the authors have focused on is that Julia Roberts behaves like Julia Roberts. This film made me sad and angry.
