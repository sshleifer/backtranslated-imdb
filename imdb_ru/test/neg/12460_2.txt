SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> I gave this film 2 out of 10 for 2 scenes that I will never forget ..... by the way, my husband took this amazing, not exploded, almost girl-looking movie ... but I I figured out why when I saw the cover ... girls in school uniform ... yes ... laughs ... well, men, if you can't beat them, join them. .... ;-) <br /> <br /> Bijou Phillips, one of my favorites on the indie screen ... too cute ...... not only gets into bestiality (her toy dog ​​is the best lesbian) in the city according to her playful outrageous character) .. it would be the first standing scene .. <br /> <br /> Then she enters the restroom in a beautiful dress and enters the stall .... after a while she gets up, goes to a party where she and the pathetically sad “Cat” character, and gives the party owner a brilliant silver ice bucket ... the owner looks into his precious gray ebony bucket with ice and says: “Oh my God, this is a poo. "<br /> <br /> I love Biju Phillips for her creativity and unusual choice of films, this is definitely one of them .... and I would rent it for the stage, if I were you ... .. I'm not a big fan of poo jokes, but it definitely puts the "party-goers" in their place (they don't seem to have a good time anyway ..... laughs) ... you will never forget these two scenes ... hmm, but is that what we want in our data banks? .... Maybe you shouldn't follow my advice at all ... lol <br /> <br /> Dominic Swain is a little pale and sad in her confused meaningless Noah roles in “Pie.” I don't know, I can't decide if I like her because she is so into indie films ?? Indie movies are awesome, but couldn't she pick some good ones? I'm going to check out a few her films and reserve a judgment .... but this one was, (sorry link to the beasts) dog .....
