Last fall (in 2001) I took a lesson in cinematography, which was conducted by the director of this film (Mark Huger). His extensive knowledge of filmmaking, his ability to analyze any film scene and his Oscar award in some strange category seemed to give him more confidence than your average independent director. When he mentioned during one of his classes that he had just finished directing a film called “The Full Journey” and was in the post-production stage, my interest flared. However, this will be the last time I hear about this film project. Until last week ... <br /> <br /> Last week in a television listing I saw that "Full Ride" would be shown on the WB network. This immediately raised the red flag, since I cannot help but associate WB with teen shows, such as Dawson's Creek, Charmed, and so on. PLUS, the fact that Full Ride was supposed to be released directly on TV was not too flattering. by oneself. But, nevertheless, I set aside this time and sat down to watch the creation of my former film teacher. <br /> <br /> Two hours later, and the end credits began to roll, I thought long and hard about what I had just seen. What I just saw was a typical WB-quality show that stretched over two hours. In fact, it seemed that this film was made only for the purpose of showing only on the WB network. The criticism of this film will be basically similar to the criticism of a typical WB show. <br /> <br /> How to start? The characters are small, the story is cliché in every sense of the word, the scenes are completely invented, and the character development is forced and unbelievable. This film just screams "unoriginal." <br /> <br /> The main character, Matt Szabo, is a hot shot from the wrong side of the tracks (literally), who plays school football as a defender, but then fails in a criminal life. He is then offered the chance to receive a full scholarship instead of going to prison. Obviously, without much choice, he agrees to play football with a star football team, but this is not an exception among his peers because of his weak team spirit and bad attitude. <br /> <br /> Then comes a love interest. Of course! Where would this predictable fanfare be without love interest? She comes in the form of Amy Lear (performed by the beautiful Meredith Monroe). She is actually a nice character, unlike Matt Szabo’s very abrasive, so we almost applaud her when she rejects him first. But, of course, the inevitable comes true. She falls in love with him, changes his attitude towards everything, and everything seems to be good and happy. But now it's time for a conflict! <br /> <br /> Earlier in the film, Amy made it clear to Matt that she did not want to score with him, because it would be “shameful” for her and her mother. This is very disturbing to Matt and his football friends (yes, they ultimately warm him), who are betting that he will not receive them. But, of course, Matt eventually agrees to accept these conditions and decides that he is not entirely a novice. This is where the exciting plot thickens. If you do not want me to spoil this surprise, then go ahead. <br /> <br /> [BEGIN SPOILER] <br /> <br /> Matt learns from some local guys that, apparently, Amy Lear always tries every year to score a guy from the All-Star team so that she can try to use it to escape from life in a small town, working in the cafeteria (which, first of all, confuses), and get to the big city. Suddenly realizing that he was being used and that his love was a hoax, Matt wanted to return to criminal life and leave the football camp before the “big game.” Amy tries to convince him that she is really in love this time, but he is too hot to buy him. So what will Matt do? Will he take her back? Or will he return to robbing gas stations and being a versatile jerk? I will not spoil the super-awesome finale for you. <br /> <br /> [END SPOILER] <br /> <br /> So, if I have somehow pumped you up for this film, please understand, this was my sarcasm, and not real enthusiasm. This film is not an inspired version of "Varsity Blues" or "Summer Catch". And that says little. It is hardly possible to save the comedy, and the characters are too small to take care of them. So what do you have left? Not much. <br /> <br /> What I didn’t like most about this movie was how illogical the picture that Neger painted about Nebraska in this movie. It seems that he was trying to capture the essence of rural Nebraska and teenage life in small cities, but his approach is too stereotypical and superficial. The characters' high hopes for creating in the “big city” and the actions they are taking for this are greatly exaggerated, and this only further reinforces the stereotype that Nebraskins are a group of people living in farming communities. I'm not sure if Hoeger’s intentions were good at trying to show his native state in the spotlight, but I think he got a very shameful product. If Heger wanted to portray Nebraska in a favorable light, he would have to take a note or two from Alexander Payne. While Payne simply chooses to use Nebraska as a background for his films, Heger integrates it into the story of “The Full Trip” and is so confused in the awareness of where he shoots, which ultimately he throws out the surface garbage, which seems to come from outsider. If Heger really lived here, you would think that he would know better. <br /> <br /> In general, I'm completely disappointed in Heger's first big film, and I hope that next time he will be able to combine his knowledge with a bit of originality to create something different and thought-provoking.
