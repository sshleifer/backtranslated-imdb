Anyway, I really thought that I would enjoy this film, because I love pictures with mountaineering and a big mystery in the plot. I have to say that the photo was fantastic and there were some scary scenes that caught my attention. I thought that Nicole Eggert (Diana Pennington), “Thank you, good night”, 01 played a very convincing role of a young girl who tragically lost her life and meets some characters who want her to lead them up the hill. Mark Singer, "Angel Blade", '02, played a very unconvincing strange guy and too often starred in many scenes with a bad character that looked funny. This film was very disappointed and not worth watching, if only on TV there is nothing to ENJOY !!
