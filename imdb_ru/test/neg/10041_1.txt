BELL WITCH HAUNTING (aka THE HAUNT) is an American horror film, presumably based on real events that took place from 1817 to 1821. <br /> <br /> This is not to be confused with BELL WITCH: THE MOVIE, the film with Betsy Palmer in the lead role for the same events. However, I can say that I would like to see this other movie instead of the one I saw! I enjoyed the stunning performance of Betsy Palmer on Friday the 13th. Thus, I believe that even on a bad day, she would have done better than anyone participating in the parody known as “The Hunt.” <br /> <br /> With regard to my title, this film does not hurt. look because the content is disturbing. It hurts to look because it's just boring. <br /> <br /> Reading the positive reviews about this film, I was able to identify only three possibilities. The first possibility is that these authors were somehow involved in production. The second possibility is for the authors, although they were not directly involved, paid for positive feedback after the completion of production. The last possibility is that none of these authors have seen enough horror films and, therefore, has no experience in using successful attempts. <br /> <br /> The plot is Robertson, Tennessee. James Johnston is visited by two journalists who are eager to hear the story of the bell witch. The story is told as a series of memories. A series of supernatural events begin to take place in the home of John Bell and his family. It soon becomes clear that there is a vengeful spirit behind all this. <br /> <br /> At first glance, the plot seems to be a standard poltergeist affair, albeit based on real events. <br /> <br /> Where performance from a brilliant concept, however, concerns everything that can go wrong. And then a little bit! <br /> <br /> First acting skills. The game is almost equally terrible right across the board. This factor causes the greatest damage to the production, undermining any possible confidence in the beliefs or interests of the viewer. The voice of a vengeful spirit is more like a teenage girl experiencing adolescent fear, rather than a powerful demonic force expressing evil intent. I almost laughed when I heard some of her lines. Unfortunately, this voice became very quickly annoying! I may not have been alive in the 1800s, but it is incredibly difficult for me to believe that any young woman alive at that time spoke the same way as this “ghost”! <br /> <br /> Secondly, the direction, The direction is random and very uneven. Some scenes show promising results, but the potential is clearly missed by a clearly inexperienced director. Nothing is done with the camera, with the sound or with the lighting, to add intensity to the scenes that should be scary. The atmosphere is equally flat. Allegedly a vengeful spirit behind supernatural phenomena. Yet the effects are so incredibly inept that no one who has seen a proper horror movie would buy them. I will give one example. In one scene, the spirit attacks someone. See the scene for yourself. It is almost funny - almost. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the script. While this may be the case when the events shown correspond to real events, it cannot be denied that most scenes are incredibly flat and boring. Scenes in just two minutes are felt much longer due to poor dialogue — dialogue that does not add depth to the characters or the story. This film is too dependent on talk to promote the story. Although this style was in the case of British films from the heyday of British horror in the 1960s and 1970s, it cannot be denied that dialogue exchanges were always interesting to see in these more professional early works. For example, Peter Cushing could read a telephone directory and still attract the attention of viewers. You can not say about the actors in The HAUNT. <br /> <br /> Finally, humor. Bad attempts at humor in this movie are painful. Fat boy - the subject of many jokes. One particularly horrible scene sees that the boy is going to the street toilet. This scene should never have been included, but it is complemented by sound effects in case you don’t understand what it does! <br /> <br /> The only positive moments in the film are the location and costumes. The decision to take a picture near the original place helped add some credibility. The costumes were also well chosen. <br /> <br /> in general, THE HAUNT is a terrible movie. It's not even in the league "so bad, it's good." It's just boring. I advise everyone to save their money and avoid this film like the plague. Don't even hope to watch it for free! <br /> <br /> I have never seen another film about the White Witch. But it really can't be worse than a GHOST. Can it? I will give this other film a chance if I can track it. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, I would advise everyone present to watch some real horror films about ghosts and ghosts. LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, CHANGELING, RINGU, GRUDGE (Japanese original) and ONE MISSED CALL (Japanese original) are good places to start.
