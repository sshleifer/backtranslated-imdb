A truly boring scenario, and I was very disappointed with Mark Singer for agreeing to be in it. <br /> <br /> I really left the theater in 15-20 minutes and demanded my money back. I actually got out of the movie only 3 times in my life (I'm 43 years old), and this is the only one that made me go crazy to demand the return of my ticket. If I could, I would get a refund for popcorn too. It was a really lousy movie, and there is no excuse. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, how does a person who grew up as a barbarian technologist learn to drive a car? In California!!!? (Driving is a rather difficult skill, and in California, even a cheater ... I need to know, I live there.)
