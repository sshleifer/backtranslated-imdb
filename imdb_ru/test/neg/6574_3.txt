I guess that after Leonard Nimoy was successful in managing Spock's Search and Voyage House, William Shatner thought that he could also become a director. Despite the fact that he is a competent actor, he shows here that he is simply not a good director. <br /> <br /> In fact, this film is strong evidence in support of the arguments of Trekkis, who say that William Shatner is an arrogant egoist. Although his character, Captain James Kirk, has always been perhaps the most important role in the original Star Trek, in this film it seems that he is the heart of the film, the other two most important characters, Captain Spock and Dr. Leonard McCoy, just to support him, and the other characters just to add humorous relief. <br /> <br /> The plot is such that some kind of emotional outcast-Vulcan named Sibok mixes people and lets out the pain imprisoned in the soul. them from this traumatic event at the beginning of life that changed them forever. Grateful, they join him in his quest to make the whole world free from pain and, thus, in the world. Sibok and his followers run the building, which hosts a peace conference between a man, a Klingon and a Romulan diplomat. This lures the still under construction Enterprise, since none of the other Star Fleet ships had "experienced commanders" (to be honest, when operating the Starfleet, the Klingons and Romulans had to defeat them many years ago). Sybok adds the Enterprise team, except Spock (who, as it turned out, is the secret brother of Sybok), McCoy and Kirk. Sibok orders the Enterprise to go to the "center of the universe" to meet with "God", about which, obviously, every race has a word. However, it turns out that this is only an insignificant entity when it requires the use of the Enterprise, and Kirk asks: “What God needs with a starship.” The entity was destroyed, but not earlier than Sibok, realizing that he had been lied to for years, sacrificing his life and deserved Spock's respect after the photon torpedoes “Enterprise” destroy the essence, and also inexplicably Sibok. <br /> <br /> OK Sci-fi films are not known for realism, but at some point rationality must be ensured. Why do people follow Sibok just for letting out their pain? Why are all humanoids defined by one traumatic event? I, of course, led a life without injury. Why does Kirk not test his team for rebellion and treason after they join Shiboku? What is the point of Siboku sacrificing himself when torpedoes are still going to kill the essence? <br /> <br /> So the plot is weak. Another problem is that Sibok, although well played by Lawrence Lackinbill, is poorly depicted. The fact that he is an emotional Vulcan does not mean that he should behave in the same way as a religious man-fanatic. Shatner (who co-authored as well as the director) could at least develop a dialogue suitable for an emotional Vulcan. I guess he feels that any emotional being speaks like us. Gee, I think it means that the Klingons should say “no” and “not” more often than “no” and “no”. And the Cardassians should not extend their sentences because they like to talk (yes, I know, it's sad that I know this). Please ... every race ST uses a unique dialogue. Why Sybok is an exception. <br /> <br /> The only thing you shouldn’t complain about is acting. I always knew that there are great actors in Star Trek, and this film is no exception. Kudos also belonged to Leonard Nimoy, because in his old age it was difficult to play impassive Spock. <br /> <br /> Some other things I didn’t like: <br /> <br /> Shatner and the late DeForrest Kelly twice show how bad singers they are, performing in this film “Row, Row, Row your Boat ". I guess Shatner wanted to silence his detractors. He proved their point of view. <br /> <br /> Uhura performs a fan dance, putting only tree bark on to drag some men into the trap. In the end, the dreams of all of us men are filled with images of plump middle-aged women dancing naked. <br /> <br /> In a comedy, everything is fine, as long as it does not affect the nature of Star Trek. too much, but when Scotty encounters an object on the Enterprise and the knockout itself, it flies overboard. <br /> <br /> Kirk is the only member of the crew who can reject Sibok’s offer to release his inner pain and see God through the deception. Not even Spock can handle any of them? Perhaps these scenes were valiant from Shatner to his character, as many suspect. <br /> <br /> The concept of an entity posing as God was used in the “Star Trek” before this film more than once. Be creative, Shatner. <br /> <br /> Speaking of creativity, I didn’t care about breaking Star Trek: The Next Generation. <br /> <br /> All in all, pretty bad movie "Track." If you are a Trekkie, watch it once, because it is “Star Trek”. Otherwise, see Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan. This is much better.
