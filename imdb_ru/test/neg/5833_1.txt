It was one of the worst films I've ever watched. The story was about a woman imprisoned in space to try to save humanity, but in fact it turned out that the prisoner was put on board a spaceship with a commander-lesbian-nympho. The whole story was about having sex again and again. There was no need for all these frames - only to create a soft porn film. Of course, we had to see how the heroine of the film had sex for about 2 minutes. I do not know how it all was connected with the plot of the film, except for the fact that I make men watch it. I gave him 1 out of 10 just because there was no other rating. Do not waste your money or time - it has nothing to do with science fiction, but rather a film for young boys to watch, to see T & A. Poor reason for entertainment.
