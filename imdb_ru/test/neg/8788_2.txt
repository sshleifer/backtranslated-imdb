Hubie - like the troll Stanley from Troll Blut in Central Park - lacks a spark of individuality to be the main character who carries the whole movie. We have to love him because he is good, but that is all he is. <br /> <br /> His character design is not attractive. The top of his head is a kind of dome that is narrower than the plump lower half of his head. <br /> <br /> Penguins should not have teeth. I know that Iago, the parrot in Aladdin, had teeth, but perhaps it worked, because because of this, he looked like voice actor Gilbert Gottfried. Habi, with his small voice (as provided by Martin Short), looks funny with this large set of caterpillars in its beak. <br /> <br /> Tim Curry, who is usually adorable because he is angry, does some kind of meanness as an accent of a surfer dude as a villain (he may have been a good voice for a comic partner, and not an allegedly terrible main villain). <br /> <br /> The whole story revolves around the love of the hero and the villain for the penguin woman Marina, who is just as boring as her fans. <br /> <br /> Wandering around the worst. We continue to retreat before the villain to see how he threatens Marina even more - this time in dialogue, this time in the song ... <br /> <br /> Barry Manilow may be a great songwriter, but in such animated movies and Thumbelina, his songs seem soft and lethargic - especially ballads. The only song I liked was the song "Good Ship Misery" of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> I read that the distributor made several cuts in this film against the directorâ€™s wishes, and this could cause some problems. - although I suspect that the real problem is that they did not cut out the rest;).
