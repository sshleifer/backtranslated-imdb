In this film, a lot of action and little heart. Let us forget for a moment that he is mistaken in almost all aspects of the Russian revolution — after all, we only have an hour to tell our story. In fact, the king, who abdicated the throne after World War I, became a disaster for the country, and the interim government tried to rule as a pseudo-democracy until Leninists came to power nine months later, mainly because they promised to immediately withdraw Russia from the war. Now back to our story. <br /> <br /> Here we have “rumors” about the revolution in Russian newspapers in the country, which seems to be still functioning until violence suddenly broke out and ruined the life of a nobleman, Baron Nikita Nikki. 'Krasnoff (Douglas Fairbanks Jr). He leaves his home with his former maid Tanya (Nancy Carroll), and they start a new life in Constantinople. Before the revolution, the baron made the usual habit of making a play for a girl, not because of some real passion, but because of boredom, as a kind of entertainment. The revolution does not change this, and he continues to try to take advantage of the fact that, obviously, a very simple girl. Of course, the audience does not like the way this guy sees him playing with her like that. Tanya follows the Baron, because she literally has nowhere to go after the revolutionaries seize the house of the Baron, and she knew no other life but to wait for Nikki hand and foot. Once in Constantinople, Nikki quickly gets tired of living as a penniless worker, and it is then that he meets his former lover, the Russian aristocrat Vera Zimina, who has a plan to deliver them to Paris, where the queens gathered after the revolution. Unfortunately for Tanya, the plan of Faith does not include it. <br /> <br /> In this film, you will be able to fully spend the significant acting talents of the early actress Nancy Carroll. She is good at what they give her, but not so much. Lilian Tashman is an outstanding figure, although she plays only a small role of the Russian vampire Vera. Liliana was so often given minor roles as she is here, but her earthly voice and charming looks make her the center of attention in every scene in which she appears. Guy Kibby even with humor shows himself an American tourist who is interested in how Russian members of the royal family were forcibly expelled from their homeland.
