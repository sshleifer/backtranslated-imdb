John Sales, what have you done? <br /> <br /> In the “Silver City” there were moments when I could see the flickering hope of a good story, well traced characters, a dialogue that makes one think. And then these moments will be quickly covered with layers of bad writing, clumsy direction and terrible action. I really love almost all the works of John Sales, but the Silver City is terrible. <br /> <br /> I got the impression that the Sales may have worked to create a good story related to illegal labor and industrial corruption plot lines, but then he hurried and attached a secondary storyline ridiculing the Bush administration. These two stories are not really related to each other, and the weaker elements of the political theme dominate the first 3/4 of the film, with the result that I lose my patience in general. <br /> <br /> Another major drawback is the game of Danny Houston. His dialogues in each scene are presented with a grin, regardless of their mood. I hated that guy at the end of the film, I was reminded of every bad actor in every high school play I’ve ever seen. Not seeing Houston in anything else, I don’t know whether to blame him or blame him for sales. Despite this, he is the unfortunate focus of a very unfortunate film. <br /> <br /> Up to the last final scene with a thin sledgehammer, I was disappointed with the Silver City. Sales at its best, or, hell, even sales at a mediocre, can be much better than this movie. See ANY of his other works instead. It is not even worth renting.
