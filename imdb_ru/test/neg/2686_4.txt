Obviously, many people really liked this film, and that’s great. This is definitely a film with very good intentions, and I appreciate it in the era of soulless or emotionally destructive films. Unfortunately, the film has many problems, and I did not watch it with pleasure. <br /> <br /> The main problem is writing. This is just not very funny. When something tries to be quick or witty and fails, it is much worse than when it does not try witly at all. This film is largely a series of “instant” but gentle returns between adult family members, none of whom seem creative or successful. The film also has several central prerequisites that seem too frequent coincidences or motives of characters to be believable or to really work. Some of the background stories seemed more intriguing and served to adorn the story pretty well at the edges, but she could not make up for the instantaneous plane that permeated almost the entire film. <br /> Directing / editing does not support the film very well, although I do not know exactly how to explain it. Somehow, things always seemed to me rather fake, and the actors in most cases pushed unnatural material there. They tried, and I do not blame anyone here. In addition, there were too many small and charming roles outside the family. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is not a very good rental, although, again, it seems that many found it very charming (I'm 38 years old; I suspect that maybe people over 60 years old have this movie Will you like it more?).
