My wife and I remembered that this film is much better than it is. When we rented it last weekend, we thought if we watched the same movie that we saw 22 years ago or so. We both agreed that we probably remember the series, which in its one-hour segments was actually forced to complete the plot lines. This film leaves many free themes, as already mentioned by others here ... basically the plot line of each main character remains unresolved.
