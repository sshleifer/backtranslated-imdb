The last time I checked, the Nazis did not win the Second World War - not that you notice it. In the end, the Third Reich was quite large in issuing orders and demanding cold, robotic obedience from the public, and this is largely what we are burdened with today. But the method of delivering orders has changed. Instead of barking at the German accent through the loudspeaker, they are disguised as anxious expert advice and swim under your nose every time you turn on the TV or open a newspaper. The constant background rumble, the message of the middle class about self-improvement, whispered in the wind. <br /> <br /> "You eat too much. You eat wrong. You drink. You smoke. You don't have enough exercise. You probably can't even * sound the beep *. You will die if you don't change your way. Your health will suffer. You have no self-esteem? Look at yourself. You sick me. I feel sorry for you. I hate you. We all hate you. God hates you. Don't you understand? It's so sad that you doing with yourself. It's so damn sad. " This is a mantra. And it goes without saying that people who read it are usually depicted as saints. Last year, the media fell to their knees to give Jamie Oliver a collective blowjob over a series of school lunches, during which he campaigned to put healthier meals on school menus. Given the response, you will be forgiven for thinking that he personally saved 5,000 children from the jaws of a working pedophile. <br /> <br /> In any case, the series was a huge success. In fact, in terms of television, there was only one real flaw: it could not be returned. In the end, when you once saved every child in the country from certain death, you will not be able to do it a second time. The only solution is to find a new threat that leads us to Ian Wright's “Disabled Children” (cf. 9 pm, C4), the weekly graduation program in which a former footballer and famous grammar enemy forces a group of young people with being overweight in some extracurricular activities in physical education. <br /> <br /> In essence, this is an exact replica of Jamie Oliver’s show with more sweat and fewer shots of students who nestled fresh basil with a pestle: an inspiring fable in which Raity forms his team of losers in a lean, vile, exercising machine - struggling with apathy and lethargy, confronting lazy parents and trying to turn it all into a national problem in which moms of the Range Rover everywhere wet their panties with a clean hypocrite between trips to the Conran store. Oh, isn't it just awful that these plebs did some plebs with themselves? Not our Josh, as you understand: he eats only organic spinach and attends lacrosse classes six hundred times a week. <br /> <br /> I bet little shit, yes, it's nice to look at flabby, uncomfortable kids who transform themselves with a bit of simple action ... but there is something in the main message, "Eat your greens," which really stuck in my goiter, in case you didn't guess. <br /> <br /> What happened to the concept of CHOICE, you * beep * So a small run can increase the duration of your life - so what? This is simply equivalent to a few more years in a nursing home - damn it. And besides, I would prefer to fall dead tomorrow than to spend the rest of my life sharing a planet with self-satisfied throws, trying to outwit each other. <br /> <br /> In the second series, video games and the Internet stand out like villains in a war with laxity: they make children too sedentary, you see. Oddly enough, the TV, which is equally inactive and unlike these two activities, actively encourages you to atrophy your mind along with your physique, avoiding no noise. It's funny. <br /> <br /> Well, listen here, Channel 4 - instead of forcing children to eat ferns or doing squats, how about teaching them to think more expansively so that they would reject the cunning, sullen nature of programs like this? Or will it be too far?
