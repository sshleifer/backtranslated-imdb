The action was episodic, and there was no narrative flow to link the episodes and promote the story. The plot is given together. With few exceptions (for example, Graham Green), acting was boring and at best pedestrian. The actors seemed to have something on their mind besides the scene they were in. It is boring to watch a man who drives a car in a semi-desert country where this film is made, regardless of whether it drives badly or well. Such scenes are typical for the voltage level in the video. So there was nothing in this video that would attract or attract an observer to get him or her to take care of the characters and the results. Iâ€™m doubly disappointed because I made this film based on the reputation of the executive producer (Redford) and the author of the novel on which he was based (Hillerman). I note that the jewel box reports that funding is provided by PBS and the Public Broadcasting Corporation, as well as Carlton International. I hope this video was just as disappointing for them as it was for me and my wife, to the extent that they will no longer fund disasters from the same source.
