I liked the Takashi Miike films that I have seen so far, but I found it rather disappointing. I bought it, but I will not store it. <br /> <br /> I saw it on the Adness DVD, in which there are only two episodes. In the first case, the killer kidnaps women, cuts off the top of their skull to expose the brain, plants them in the ground to the chin and plants the flower in the brain. You can tell it from the DVD box. In the film, the crown of the head is clouded by digital television. If you didn’t see the DVD box, the viewer wouldn’t know what people are looking at until the young policeman later produced a small body model. Oddly enough, there is a flash on the woman’s head later, and she is not censored. Besides, I'm not quite sure what's going on. Some women receive phone calls, and when this happens, a jerky animated character jumps around. An animated character also sometimes appears on TV screens. It is unclear whether anyone sees this. <br /> <br /> In the second episode, pregnant women are found cut, and their children go missing. Again, the policeman creates a model of what the corpses look like, which is useful, because again the actual body is censored. The film also has a natural birth, but, oddly enough, even this baby and the umbilical cord are censored! According to the DVD box, uncensored versions were not saved when it was originally made. Maybe even if they had, if they knew that they would be censored, maybe they did not bother to show anything really ...? Not sure. <br /> <br /> If I hear that later episodes are better, maybe I will look for them. Like this, I will not worry.
