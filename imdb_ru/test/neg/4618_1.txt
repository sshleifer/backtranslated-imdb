** One could consider some soft spoilers, but no more than in someone else's review of this film. ** <br /> <br /> I knew that nothing could compare with the absolute brilliance of the original “Carrie”. it was more a film about social criticism than about arson gym. Carrie White was the embodiment of the "victim", and her story conveyed the helplessness that the truly exploited must experience. <br /> <br /> Whoever conceived the character “Rachel” for “Rage”, he must have completely missed the subtleties of “Carrie”. ". For the audience to genuinely share the victim's anger, he / she must be a sympathetic character - a true outcast who is more a victim of circumstances than his / her own vices. Rachel is too unpleasant to convey any emotional depth and connection to Cariss by Sissy Spacek. And she looks and behaves as if she should be close to the “attractive and popular brigade”, which she eventually sets on fire. She, like everyone else, has a soul that is just as spoiled, while Carrie was completely innocent. <br /> <br /> This just does not work. There is no satisfaction in seeing pretty children - even the boy at Home Improvement - breaking at the height of the scene of this film. And this is so unnecessarily bloody! There was no real bloodshed seen in the burning gym! <br /> <br /> And in particular, there is one person who shouldn’t have the courage to kill this film ... but I won’t tell who it is. If you saw the original "Carrie", then this character unfairly dies. <br /> <br /> At least they REALLY made a connection with Carrie; this is explained as it should be. But this, as well as the tattoo on the arm, which was made quite beautifully, is almost the only thing this film does for this. <br /> <br /> Another screaming "scream", but it spoils the reputation. one of the most compelling films ever made. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10. I did not expect much, but I was still terribly disappointed. An unsympathetic character, a series of annoying references to pop culture, added without good reason, and a final scene that fades away from Carrie’s shocking tombstone.
