I was lucky to read the book in advance, and I know a little about Tudor England. <br /> <br /> The directing and editing of this television film was for the most part really awful. It seemed to me that I was watching a really bad drama document about the movie “Period”, and then a movie. <br /> <br /> At first there were too many gaps between the important parts. And, excluding the important events that took place at that time, we can say that Henry quarreled with Rome because of his desire to divorce Catherine from Aragon, which led England to break away from Rome and set up her own church. they barely stuck to the book. I'm all for creative freedom, but to the limit, especially when you are dealing with a well-written book as a starting point. In the book, Mary first gives birth to young Catherine, and then she gives birth to young Henry. Both of their fathers are Henry Eight. in the film, they show Harry first, then Catherine. And suppose Catherine's father is William Carey. <br /> <br /> There are too many bad moments in the film to write them all. <br /> <br /> I will say, however, that Jodhi May and Natasha Makelon portray as the Boleyn sisters were probably the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> If you haven’t read the book yet and don’t know anything about Henry’s trial, then I recommend staying away from this film. And for those who read the book, the film will annoy you because of the lack of details and an important plot.
