Alexandra Maria Lara: Very beautiful and seductive woman, but not a good actress. In all the films in which I saw her, she seems to me to be exactly the same character. Whether in DOWNFALL, NACKT, VOM SUCHEN UND FINDEN DER LIEBE, and now Iâ€™m already FRED! She always (plays?) A young, kind-hearted woman who is a little naive and does not know how to deal with what is happening with her. She has a repertoire of perhaps five different facial expressions with which she works in abundance. Personally, I find it hard to believe that she can play a mysterious and slightly unpleasant character, because he is not here. So, she is a typical girl next door for who she is, but, again, she is not going to smell when it comes to the cast. Til Schweiger: Same! The film: downright stupid. Since it was an American film, it would be a great role for Adam Sandler, which I don't like either. I was not offended by the fact that this is a film with people with disabilities, I just thought that the jokes caused by this were not at all funny. I laughed two or three times, but when I was halfway through, I was just bored and annoyed, and I wanted this film to end.
