How sad it is when such a wonderful film as “The Jurassic Park” slowly rushes through the battered and mediocre territory throughout its franchise. The most recent sequel, Jurassic Park III, did not reflect on characters, history or largely scenarios, and instead relies on the dinosaur's nonstop action, which is neither exciting nor very interesting to watch. It looks like dinosaurs looked incredibly unreal compared to the technology of 1993, after 7 years of CGI achievements, it only gives you a better feeling that the film was pumped out for the summer, relying only on its name. The introduction of pterodactyl is not a good film. <br /> <br /> Look again at Shrek. <br /> <br />
