Hulk Hogan and Zeus are terrible wrestlers and terrible actors. For some reason, Hogan was popular enough to make a deal with the film. If it were not for Vince McMahon's money, this stupid film would never have been made. Maybe someday someone will make a good film about professional wrestling. No Holds Barred is not a movie.
