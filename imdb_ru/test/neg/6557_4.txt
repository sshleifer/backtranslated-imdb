I have been a big fan of the original Enterprise team since I was eight years old. I watched all the films and appreciated each of them for what they saved from the old series and for the further development of the characters (and the Star Trek universe as a whole). Even in the “Undiscovered Country” I thought that the aging of the characters coped well, and the story deserves a theatrical release. However, saying that "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier" is probably the worst of a series featuring the original team. I agree with many that the camaraderie of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy is well maintained, but the general scenario, the direction — William Shatner — and special effects are not worthy of anything more than a television episode. This is a "friendly film", and sometimes practically unrecognizable as the film "Star Trek". Sequences of actions are not supported and, therefore, create little or no tension. The dialogue is weak, although it provides for a few laughs, both intentional and unintentional. It seems that the Klingons are added as an afterthought. The whole concept of "Sha-Ka-Ree" is just stupid, and Lawrence Lakinbill, the wonderful actor in everything I've ever seen him, borders on the absurd in this film. The scene where Sibok conjures images of Spock's pain and McCoy's pain destroys the images of the characters as we know them. Spock would never have participated in such nonsense, and McCoy, trying to save his father, is full of tasteless, excessive dialogue and completely loses the acting ability of Deforest Kelly. The whole scene is wasted and really does not show us anything new and nothing that we want to see from these characters. I understand that Shatner did not have the luxury of working with ILM for special effects, and that the budget for this film was limited, but this does not take into account such a bad story. In some respects, I think this story really fits into the old TV series, but films, including Star Trek: The Movie, are much better quality than this one. It is a pity that most other characters have so few lines and so little in common with most of this film. It’s nice to focus on Kirk, McCoy and Spock, but too much. The old team really seems out of place. I liked the old Klingon general and the sultry Romulan in the bar. I liked the humor and the idea that Spock has a stepbrother, but that's all. If it was a television episode, I could accept many shortcomings. Like a movie, it's just a bad, boring movie. This is also a shame, because I want this film to be a good one. Even if it was Star Trek III, I would be happy, but this film makes all the other films in this series look like Shakespeare’s works.
