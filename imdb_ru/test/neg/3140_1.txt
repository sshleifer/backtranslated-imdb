You know, I always like disturbing or strange films, especially when they are shown at a science fiction film festival in Hamburg, Germany. but subliminal cruelty was probably the worst movie I saw this year. Will there be any spoilers in this comment? <br /> <br /> No, because I just did not understand this movie. but what can you expect from a film that was presented to the festival viewers? “We (the guys from the festival) know that not all of you will watch this movie until the very end” ... <br /> /> I like splashing films and also films with a strong graphic language. but this? There are a lot of bloody scenes in this movie, but why? what is the director trying to tell us? Does he say that we have lost all morality and all religious feelings? or does he say that incest will always end in disaster? who knows, I don't know. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie that makes you think for a long time, watch it. but do not hope to think "wow, I received a message" - I did not understand ...
