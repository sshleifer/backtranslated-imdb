I'm not sure who is having fun, the people who wrote the reviews or the film director. I could no longer read these comments or watch this movie, I had to say something. <br /> <br /> I see a low-budget western film made with passion and interest in details, but using an art deco garage, pastel colors, actors who seem to fall asleep because the script is so boring and booming into the camera every two scenes, which is definitely not my definition of “one of the best western films shot in the new millennium”. <br /> <br /> Please, if any of you had friends in the film, just say it!
