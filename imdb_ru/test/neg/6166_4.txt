Based on Elmore Leonard’s novel of the same name, Killshot suffers from a lack of focus, focus and creativity. all the elements that probably had the original story, and the negative test impressions forced major changes, (including the complete removal of the character), which led to a film that almost did not look like Leonard's story. Too many characters fill the storyline too simplistic and straightforward (not a typical feature of the author’s work), and the focus constantly switches between two hired killers who are hard to love and a problem couple that doesn’t make us like. While the story itself contains very few twists and turns, unfortunately, by the end of the film its appeal still remains a mystery. <br /> <br /> The washed assassin Armand "Blackbird" (Mickey Rourke) follows strict rules during his missions, which inadvertently spoil his latest assignment. Now, on the run from his former employer, he accidentally joins forces with the inept criminal Ritchie Nix (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) in order to quickly earn extortion from a wealthy realtor. When the struggling couple Carmen and Wayne Colson (Diane Lane and Thomas Jane) are involved in a rough plot of thieves, they are forced into hiding, because the crazy killers will stop at nothing to silence two witnesses. <br /> <br /> Killshot argues that, based on Elmore Leonard’s novel, this is not a reason for immediate success or even a promising adaptation. Characters, situations and even resolutions in the film are all tired and unoriginal, and only very casually hint at something more. The point is not that there was no potential, especially when the black, calm and collected assassin Rourke performs a great hit during the debut? Purpose and principles are simply useless, as every minute ticks. The style and manner in which each character is presented is the most intriguing; Visually, the roles of Byrd and even Wayne are set out properly, giving immediate interest and depth to characters who usually end in a creative dead end. <br /> <br /> The combination of a cold and calculating Black Bird with an irrational and explosive Richie is a tempting combination (comparisons with Fargo would be too kind), except that each character seems to be slowly losing the traits that made them originally interesting. When Richie begins to understand the habits of a more experienced killer, Bird weakens control over his methods of killing. Regardless of what he sees in his instantly frivolous communication with Donna (Rosario Dawson), it is hard to imagine that his latest confrontation with Carmen’s panic would provoke the recognition of his true nature and subsequent negligence, which would drastically affect his outcome. Likely or not, is it an unsuccessful Killshot drop ?? and from these characters you can get a little entertainment, which constantly lose their originality, constantly contradicting the habits that once forced them to intrigue. <br /> <br /> - Messi Gemini
