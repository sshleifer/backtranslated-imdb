I watched a film director last night ... glad that it was a free rental, even a dollar would be too big for me to pay to watch this “noir film” attempt. Anachronisms (modern phones) annoyed me, did not know how, they were more like budget constraints than anything else. “Unconventional” casting also seemed distracting to me. If I have to stop following the story to ask the question: “What the hell is a black chick / transvestite doing there?” Then the narrator let me down. Again, not smart, in my opinion, but annoying and annoying, and very film school, the final of the project. And for Pete's sake, if you're going to shoot in black and white, at least use some of the methods used in older films that take full advantage of the lack of color. The lighting did not use nuances, shades of gray, no depth, no texture ... just black and just white ... boring!
