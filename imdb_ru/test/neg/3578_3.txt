Good actors, good director, well played, good director, but ... Where is the film? Did they have a script or was everything just improvised? At least, this is a short film (just 80 minutes, including credits). Nothing happens in this film, nothing at all. A few small traffickers got into minor trouble, but you will never understand what is happening, and even what they are talking about in some episodes of the film. Tons of "f *** 's" and "motherf *****' s", but nothing more ... <br /> <br /> For people who love Abel Ferrara films, such as Funeral 'R Xmas will be a big disappointment, as it was for me. What was he thinking about? Did he really think it was a good movie? And if he did not, then why did he do it?
