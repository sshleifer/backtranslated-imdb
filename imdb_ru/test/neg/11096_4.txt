If you thought it was French The Mummy, and if you are hoping for another "Vidocq" ... well, look elsewhere. It has the same story as in “Mom” about this book of the dead, and about the soul, which needs to find 7 missing pieces that are scattered in the Louvre. It seemed to me that the film was a bit interesting, mostly boring. The special effects are not bad, but there is nothing impressive about this, since I expected big explosions and, perhaps, a crumbling Eiffel Tower, until I realized that such scenes were in Mummy, and this is Belpegore. Apparently based on the French cult series, Belphegor could be much better. I voted for this 4/10 film only for the beautiful Sophie Marceau ... she should be almost 40, and she looks amazing!
