Do not watch this film under any circumstances. This is terrible for a number of reasons: No plot No structure No direction No acting to talk about No visual style No voltage <br /> <br /> In a word - no. > <br /> The best thing about this box and the fact that it eventually ends. Who would have thought that 85 minutes could feel so long. <br /> <br /> Once again: under no circumstances watch this movie. It's horrible. <br /> <br /> No plot No structure No direction No acting to talk about No visual style No voltage <br /> <br /> In a word - no. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this box and the fact it ultimately ends. Who would have thought that 85 minutes could feel so long.
