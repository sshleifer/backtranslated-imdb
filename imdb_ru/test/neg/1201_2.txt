In fact, without giving my age, I first saw it more than 20 years ago, when he first appeared on video (maybe it was a beta record?), And I was old enough to drink (barely), and I may have had a few, because I remember thinking how good this film was! Since then, I have seen it sober and must admit that it is a pretty bad movie. As mentioned in other posts, the plot is absolutely ridiculous, and a bad game only aggravates the situation. This is a bad attempt to fantasize that teenagers can also be “Mavericks” (although I’m surprised to learn that he really should have been released at the same time (approximately) as Top Gun, and in fact was not a bad imitation .) But, in spite of everything, I see that I watch it, if it is on, and I have time. This is one of those films that you watch, because it’s just ridiculous and desperately trying to take yourself seriously. Like that other “great” movie - “Moment by moment” with John Travolta and Lily Tomlin ... don't make me start with that!
