Stay away from this movie at all costs. I hurried to watch this film in a bet to see which of us knows "the worst movie of all time." Needless to say, this one won the hands down. It is long and stretched, and has no purpose or plot from what I can gather. A film about a killer child growing from an embryo grown outside the womb simply has no place in your VCR. If you are very bored and have no life, watch this movie. But if you prefer to maintain sanity, stay away.
