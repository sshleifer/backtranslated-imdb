I made this film when my friend was out, hoping to see some serious military / special actions. <br /> <br /> After 10 minutes of watching this “movie,” I was so scared and scared and tired of the quality of everything. In this film, I was ready to destroy the rented disc with a flamethrower. Fortunately, I could not find one. I have seen a lot of bad movies. But it’s not even a bad thing, it’s a complete rubbish, and you shouldn’t even consider it a film on IMDB. <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for the people who participated in the making of this film. total shame I hope he wins several Oscars, though: D.
