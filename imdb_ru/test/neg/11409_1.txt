In another of the horrible horror films that seem so masochistic to me, we have a group of friends stuck in a haunted house who slowly kill one by one because of a horde of zombies who throw out yellow blood and have very serious dental problems. However, the first 45 minutes are all conversations, and, given that young fans cannot get out of the paper bag and are given the most banal dialogue that has ever had an impartial reading, this is especially painful. If you manage not to fall asleep because of this nonsense, things will not get better ... with a bad abundance of make-up and damp, cheap (not very special) effects. As for the conclusion ... well, what are the stakes that the old-timers, who warned them not to go to the eerie mansion, will first of all find and save the day for the last two survivors (the boy and the girl, of course) with his mystical powers? Please ... life is too short for such films. Donate the time you would otherwise spend to see how this joke helps the community, to make a couple of shifts in the dining room or something like that. You will feel that you have actually done something productive in your life, and you will not invest in the pockets of studios that throw garbage that cannot be exchanged, such as this one. <br /> <br /> Sorry, this is already too late for me .. now, where did I put this copy of the "Pumpkinhead"? 1/10
