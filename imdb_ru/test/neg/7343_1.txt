Is the man alive, is this game bad or what? The graphics are far below par, even if it were on a PlayStation 1, not to mention a Gamecube. Gameplay is pathetic, and camera movements are disorienting. What a useless game! <br /> <br /> I really like the Warner's Batman animation, and it's great that they make all the games that way. Batman: Vengeance could have been great if they started well, keeping all the gothic visual and voice actors, but they seriously stumbled when it came to playability and graphics. The result is a boring game that looks incredibly cheap, and playing it is not fun at all. I really have to stress how bad the graphics are. Don't let the color scheme fool you. I have seen the best things on Commodore 64.
