Maybe it is unfair for me to watch this movie, because I came out long before the end. This is strange, because I usually like Shakespeare on the screen, and once, many years ago, when I saw him on stage, I liked The Midsummer Night's Dream. <br /> <br /> I think I was struck by two things: this squeaky crap with the name of Shakespeare Calista Flockhart and Michel Fayfer sitting in a giant folding bed. Well, I suppose you could say that this is a comedy, but when the scene is funny and the actors are not, I would say that we have a bad movie ...
