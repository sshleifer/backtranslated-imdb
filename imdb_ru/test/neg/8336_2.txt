A terrible mess with predictable storylines and stunning poverty brought computer clich√©s to nausea (races working together, the heroine is smart and pretty, the guy sacrificing herself for saving another life, the relationship of father and daughter, etc. And so on. D. And t . D.). The film looks like something created for network television, and probably should have stayed there. Even the gifted Tommy Lee Jones cannot save this bomb. I urge you not to spend money or time on this cinematic death since the time when disaster films wandered around Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Two stars are given exclusively to CGI people and the ability of PR people even if one moviegoer sits through it.
