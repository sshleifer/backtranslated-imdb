Once again, I was fooled by seemingly intellectual reviews, making seemingly intelligent comments about an apparently crappy film. I actually put on my shoes, got into the car, burned expensive gasoline and drove to the nearest rental center after reading the reviews mentioned and paying the required $ 4 and changing it to rent this thing. I tell you, it’s not worth the tiny calories spent on raising your index finger to change channels on the TV remote. <br /> <br /> I even gave him a few more minutes after seeing all the tell-tale signs of a tribal heap of dogs. They are presented as the clinical symptoms of the director, who is. becomes senile or b. only slightly interested in the film that he / she is obliged to create. Over the past few years, I have seen a similar deterioration with a series of funny cartoons by John Carpenter. <br /> <br /> Here are some episodes testifying to the charges. The priest had a disturbing dream ... supposedly a forerunner of disgust ahead, since he seems to be obsessed with discovering the archaeological structure in which the demon is located. Dream is a stupid collage of disparate images directly from the stock video recording of the Twilight Zone. A ticking clock penetrates the darkness of the dream, implying that?, An incomprehensible mystery of Time? .... big deal! The bodyless head, painted in the features of a demon with a quality Halloween make-up in the store, flickers back and forth in convulsive madness. Every time I see this effect, a big fat passage from Jacob's Ladder, it infuriates me. This in itself almost instantly discredits the film. <br /> <br /> The whole process of creating an archaeological site is ridiculous. Everything is so obvious ... so tired and exhausted ... the only possible answer is boredom. At some point in the excavations, the priest commented on the finding of the statues of angels surrounding the sarcophagus ... they all point their weapons at the crypt. He asks: "Look at these surrounding statues ... as if they are holding ... something ... down!" This should create tension ... a critical mass ... but it doesn't even come close! How can uncertainty arise if you treat the audience as a group of morons who need to EXPLAIN uncertainty along the way. First, the images are overworked, but the added comments, in my opinion, only add insult to the wound. Shortly thereafter, the tomb was “decorated” with the remains of soldiers placed there to guard the main atrium (by the way, another shameless robbery from the fortress). Who, screaming out loud, made makeup effects for this movie ??! The blood really did have that rosy quality that could be seen in films of the 70s in Tromeville. At this point, I almost made sure that they simply forgot their makeup and had to go to Wal-Mart in the interest of time and money. <br /> <br /> DO NOT Listen to luminous comments about it! I, too, will be suspiciously watching Schröder. Looks like it's time to hang up the gloves. Perhaps a close friend will offer a gentle warning to stop smoking, while in memory of past films there is still dignity.
