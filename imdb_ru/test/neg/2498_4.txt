Well, since it's called Porno-Fiber and directed by Joe D'Amato, I went into this film waiting for immorality ... and while I understood a little, Porno-Scallop was a massive disappointment, as it is so damn boring. The name suggests that the film will feature pornography, and this is not the case - Porno-scaffolding pretty much just porn, and most of them are just the same stuff over and over again, I was fast-forwarding to the end. The first scene of sex between two women, and he got my hopes, but after the fact that she just degenerates into ordinary porn, and the rest of the film (for the first hour!) It consists of talk, and you can imagine how much fun it is to sit it is necessary! The plot focuses on a desert island where, believe me or not, something strange is happening. Naturally, it is not long before a group of people consisting of several men and several scientists, all of whom turn out to be sexy women, land on the island. They have sex several times and strange things happen, and an hour later they are attacked by a mutant zombie creature with an eye on the ladies ... <br /> <br /> This should have seemed like a good idea for the original porn zombie who loves to get it, but surprisingly it does not work well at all. The film starts just ten minutes before the two-hour mark, and itâ€™s too long for such a film. I have no idea why Porno-fiber is as long as it is; if they shot one minute from each sex scene, the film would be less than ninety minutes, and that would make it much more tolerant! It seems that the zombie seems eternal (quite a lot of time before the sexual break comes, enough for him to really go to the island), and when he finally appears, this is a huge disappointment! I understand that this is a low-budget rubbish for B-movies, but D'Amato, of course, could try a little more and come up with something better than this! I'm not even going to mention the acting, the atmosphere, and so on. There is no point in this. Pornhosting is basically just your average dull porn movie with a little sprinkling of horror, and I can't recommend it!
