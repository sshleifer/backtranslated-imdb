In this film, there was a rather interesting story about clones and the use of organs, but it failed, because the lead actor is so annoying and complaining that you want him to die. Not that someone else was very good at it, but when you hate a character who should be sympathetic, the film just doesn't work. Oddly enough, it seems that in the near future there will be a film in which there is a plot that reflects this film with a lot of action and better cast, although I can’t think of anything else except this film if I were to watch . There is a super stupid clone in this movie that is smart enough to understand that something is wrong with its camp, where people ride a bicycle at a speed of one mile per hour and fight for no reason. Consultants tell them that when they are ready, they go to America, but our “hero” has doubts, so he tracks and learns the terrible truth that sends him to flee from the bad guys who repeatedly shoot and beat this guy. He goes in search of the person from whom he was cloned. It contains Peter Graves and Dick Surgent, but they add nothing to this film, which is similar to what was made for television. On the other hand, when “Island” comes out, the creators of this film can proudly say, “we thought about it first”.
