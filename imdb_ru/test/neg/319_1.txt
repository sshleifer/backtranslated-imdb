If you are looking for masochistic feelings, rent this movie and show it to sober friends. This film - just a plane, slop, but not entirely useless. Short tits are nice, and the death of one victim is pretty darn funny. In addition, it is direct garbage. But it's still better than the "Grim" or "Spookies"
