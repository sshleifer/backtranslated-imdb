The sound in this film is a nightmare. This is the best I can say for this movie. Any chance of a good story is lost when this film begins. The premise of the film sounds good. Playboy who agrees with the people around him. The plot is predictable and very boring. The wet t-shirt competition is perhaps the worst scene I've ever seen, and almost worth a look at the Mystery Science deal. The sound is sometimes hard to hear, and the main actor does not seem to know how to speak clearly. His accent makes him very difficult to understand. The only bright sport is the Penelope Ann Miller game. Her role is underdeveloped, but she plays her well. In a word, do not waste your time.
