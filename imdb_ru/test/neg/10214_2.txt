A new show about wrestling opens the way for the most terrible wrestler you can imagine, the giant Zeus. Network president Brell is doing everything he can to bring WWF champion Ripa into a circle to fight Zeus in the Battle of Tough Guys championship. But Zeus is not like any other rival that Rip has ever encountered. <br /> <br /> Normally, I would give Hogan some leeway when the fighter switched to a movie role, but this film didnâ€™t ask Hulkster to do so much of a stretch, he just asked Hogan to play himself, which he miserably failed "Tiny" Lister put a lot of effort like the mighty Zeus, but even in his work the film lacked something, namely acting skills! <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, if you like, with a bit of salt and a sense of humor, otherwise you may have to turn it off in a little over ten minutes.
