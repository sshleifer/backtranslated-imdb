Looking for a film for your film festival in Turkey? THE ROLLER BLADE SEVEN are on my list of the ten worst films of all time. The plot, the story of the post-apocalyptic video of a samurai warrior, is an intricate jumble of movie links to everything - from STAR WARS to SEVEN SAMAURI. The action ranges from mild to terrible. The scene where the villain tempts the old master, confuses to mocking laughter. Frank Knight Black St Knight is very reminiscent of the black knight John Cleese in Monty Python and the Holy Grail. (Advice on Counsel, Frank: when you start acting in such a film, your career ends.) I accidentally stumbled upon this little stinky bomb on a low cable channel and couldn't stop watching. It's like looking at a train wreck, you just can't look away.
