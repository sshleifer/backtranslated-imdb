“Patriot” with Stephen Seagal is a thriller / thriller of the late 90s, which is not really a thriller or a thriller; rather, it is Stephen Seagal, who plays Stephen Seagal under a different name, but this time he is a Native American country doctor who now and again strikes. By exposing obvious holes in storylines, the film itself is absolutely amazing in terms of a blatant disregard for character development. <br /> <br /> From a marketing point of view, I was asked the question: “Who are they targeting?” The bio-thriller plot is far from being suitable for a crowd of Central American countries, and Seagal, like a silk cowboy, will never sell to anyone deep-fry it and place it between donuts with creeps. The whole movie is just a way out, even for Segal fans, because it simply does not work at any level.
