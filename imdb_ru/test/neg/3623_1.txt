This is a children's series about Mary-Sue, which is at the same time evil and bitchy. I could not bring myself to sit in 3 episodes of Zoey101. Not to mention that Jamie Lynn Spears can not save his life! What message does this show bring to children? If you are not perfect, like Zoe, you are unworthy * rolseyes *. <br /> <br /> It's absurd that Zoe's character is the very person who is despised in real life, but she manages to become so popular, Then there is Chase who mostly loves a puppy who worships the land Zoe walks . Then there is the fact that all the other characters seem to be stunned to stop them from overshadowing Zoe. Sorry, but feature in this show = extremely unreal.
