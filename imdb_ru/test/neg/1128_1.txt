This must be the worst shit I've ever seen. Randy Quaid is funny as a supporting actor in the original, not as a moderator. Too much, Eddie. The original is classic. Like the original, the actor was carrying the show. Ed Asner was very funny. He is Eddie Christmas Vaction 2! As it turned out, after all these years, Snoz looks the same, and all the others in the original look 14 years older. After 15 minutes of watching this movie, I do not believe that I even laughed. The island just did not work. If it were not a good looking South Pacific island guide, the film would be a total loss. I sat on this review for a week, and yes, I still think that the film should never have been made. Hopefully THIRD does not exist! <br /> <br /> Sean Jilin
