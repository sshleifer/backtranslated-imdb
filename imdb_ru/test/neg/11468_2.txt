I was looking forward to this movie. Being an old fan of Robert E. Howard, mostly from Conan's point of view. <br /> <br /> I did not expect much and thought that they could not spoil too much ... Oh, dear, how wrong I was .... <br /> <br /> The main drawback was quite boring. It was necessary to jump along with the pleasant help of supernatural events, sword fights and the like. <br /> <br /> You have some blood, but everything else was just lifeless. The middle part seemed to take 40 minutes in a muddy forest with slow rumbling carts drawn by horses, and even slower dialogue and character development! <br /> <br /> On the positive side = The costumes and effects were good, but not enough to keep you interested. <br /> <br /> I think it would be better to lower the tone, increase the pace and get a rating of 12A. As a ten year old boy, I might have liked this movie. Probably at the age when I first read the stories about Conan is quite funny. Maybe it says a lot about my expectation of the film? <br /> <br /> Or ....... A truly “Art House” with tones, directions, etc. But it is rather risky, as far as box office is concerned. <br /> <br /> Oh well .... Maybe the next film about Conan will work?
