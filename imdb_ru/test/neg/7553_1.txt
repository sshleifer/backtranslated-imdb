Not surprisingly, so many young people have attention deficit disorder. It seems that staging (dancing) these days is all about how many cameras and camera angles a director / editor can squeeze into a one-hour show. Is there a special Emmy category for this feat? Try to find them sometimes for something else to do it, otherwise a completely unforgettable show. <br /> <br /> I tried to see at least a few faces of some of the other dancers in the production. It was impossible. They seemed to have no faces, only blemishes — it was only Michael Flatley’s face, Michael Flatley’s bare chest (good shine!), Michael Flatley’s legs, and Flatley’s patented glance “over the shoulder-here” repeated infinitely squared. Since he was the executive producer of this work, I think that was to be expected. You do not need to think too much about who his target audience is. <br /> <br /> Riverdance was much better, as he tried to present the show almost as it can be seen from the audience, and not the podium, side wings or the prospect of a nail on the floor. If I am not mistaken, I believe that Sir Michael has resigned. Praise God for some small blessings.
