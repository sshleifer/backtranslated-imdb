Step-by-step exile exercise with disappointing inaccuracy and the use of the term “black water”. Cinematography comes straight from the MOW main cable line, which removes any vision of a swampy, dark atmosphere from the process. In addition, there is almost not enough blood, sex, or attractive young things to satisfy most of the target viewers of the film. In this case, the leading actress who plays the obsessed, has a sexy olive face. What else needs to be said about this non-winner? Do not rent out if you have nothing for middle-aged adults who mourn their past and are suffering from clichés of priests, asylums, Spanish grooms who regret their past actions.
