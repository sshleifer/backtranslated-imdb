It’s hard to imagine how Dan Brown’s fascinating Angels and Demons could shoot as bad as this version of the film. Here are ten reasons why the film failed. Because of the spoilers, please do not read further if you have not seen the movie. <br /> <br /> (1) There was no love relationship between Robert Langdon and Vittoria Wind in the film. Worse, there was no chemistry between the two leading actors. <br /> <br /> (2) The breathtaking places in Rome described in the novel were not realized visually in the film. I know that director Ron Howard has had difficulty shooting on the spot. But on the historical channel there are excellent photographed images of Rome than in this film, where the Eternal City was featured in the video on the eternal stock. The great works of art described in the novel were briefly depicted in the film. Bernini’s magnificent sculpture The Ecstasy of Saint Theresa was seen only for a moment, and the relief of Western Ponente on Vatican Square was not visible at all. <br /> <br /> (3) The most tasteless choice made by the filmmaker was in the image of the late pope, who actually resembled the beloved John Paul II. In the novel, the pope is obviously fictional, not like any real dad. <br /> <br /> (4) One of the brightest (and important) characters in the novel, Maximilian Kohler, director of CERN, was cut from the script. <br /> <br /> (5) There were many cases where the lines of the dialogue were not heard due to background noise. <br /> <br /> (6) There were moments when the faces of the characters were not visible because of the shadows and the light of the film. This technique worked in the films “The Godfather,” but Ron Howard is not Gordon Willis. <br /> <br /> (7) The College of Cardinals was a rather motley team, one of the voters spoke in the southern district. This dude would feel at home on a Texas ranch, not in the Sistine Chapel. <br /> <br /> (8) The most important relationship between the Camerlengo and the late Pope was not identified in the film. This relationship was central to the theme of science against religion and the significance of the Illuminati for the conspiracy against the church. <br /> <br /> (9) In the novel, Hassin’s character was an unforgettable villain. In the film, the role of the killer character was a villain from a cardboard cutout. <br /> <br /> (10) In general, the filmmakers did not trust the work of a successful novel. <br /> <br /> In the novel, Langdon makes an impossible fall from the sky and into the Tiber River. In the Ron Howard film, it was the film itself, which landed in the Tiber.
