On paper, this film has some trash: a street child who overcomes a past trauma, rebuilds his life and succeeds when the world would write him off. Great stuff, everyone likes a happy ending. <br /> <br /> In the theater there were some omissions that left the film dead inside. The dialogue was empty and uninteresting, the characters were almost caricatured due to lack of size and complexity, and why should everyone be gay? I have nothing against homosexual themes or characters in a film, but when it is used in this way, it not only offends homosexuals, but also simplifies the way of life and makes the film cheaper. If the story works without this cheap trick, it should be cut out. <br /> <br /> It seemed that all the characters were coming out of the same shape of cookies: each had one major flaw and one minor flaw, each character was kindhearted. whether they were successful or not, and each of them had or has an offensive relationship with someone. <br /> <br /> The most unpleasant fact of the film is that they will never allow you to overcome this name “peep” comes from high expectations. They give it to you once, and that should be enough. This story is similar enough to the classic Dickens to make this fact obvious. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of the film is the story of the grandfather and the tape that he leaves for Pip, and how Pip, the main character, learns to grow in the lessons learned from the tape. In the end, with lessons learned, Pip is confronted with his dark past and films with his life.
