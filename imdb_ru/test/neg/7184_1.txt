I'm still not sure what this film is about. I guess the boy was afraid to go blind and began to imagine all sorts of strange things. however, this does not explain why he wanted to kill his new younger brother or the inexorable boredom found in this film. while watching this movie you will want to go blind, so that you donâ€™t have to see this experiment in vain. skip this hover heap and select something else in the video store ..... something else.
