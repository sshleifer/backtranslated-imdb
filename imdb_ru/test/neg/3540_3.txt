I was really disappointed with this film, on which I had high hopes. Looks like he was abandoned to take advantage of the success of comedy jokes at the time (including his own MGM "Libeled Lady", which featured two identical stars) and the success of William Powell and Myrna Loy. Three years later, they were attractive to watch and full of fire in their scenes together, but a weak script and a hasty premise ruin any chance that this would be a great continuation of the previous year’s “Libeled Lady” and two “Thin” Men’s films that they shot before of this. “Double Wedding” tells the story of clothing manufacturer Mirna Loy, who intends to dominate the life of her sister (Florence Rice), her future son-in-law (John Beale) and her own servants (including Sydney) Toler and Mary Gordon). When independent energetic William Powell enters her life, distracting Rice and Beal from Loy's constant control, Loy meets her match. Sounds good, right? Yes, an interesting premise does not justify itself, unfortunately, because the character of Loy is so one-dimensional that it is difficult to even like her, not to mention Powell falling in love with her, which, as we know, will happen soon. This is another attempt to put in her place a professionally-minded woman, changing her views on what life she leads, what Hollywood often did during her golden age. When Loy says that she doesn’t have time to do her own thing and have a man in her life, it groans. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, except for Powell, there is a freedom-loving Jesse Ralph on board. Salty rich elderly woman who helped Loy start a business, she is familiar with Powell and can immediately see Loy's cool statements that she hates him. Rice and Beal are a boring couple, and Powell’s whole package between them is meaningless. Then Powell's ex-wife appears, who is not really needed at this late point in the story, and the final wedding scene (where a crowd of people are trying to get into Powell's tiny trailer) is a weak attempt at some kind of farce. (It's funny, however, that Powell continues to run into objects designed by Loy to hit Edgar Kennedy; these chuckles are welcome because there are so few of them.) Powell and Loy will better show themselves in two later comedies with screw balls: “I Love You Again "and" Love Crazy ", which are complex, witty and funny. This film tries to be all three, but ends with a complex bore.
