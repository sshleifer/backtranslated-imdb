I saw this movie shortly after watching Moonlight & Valentino with Elizabeth Perkins, Gwyneth Platrou, Whoopi Goldberg and Kathleen Turner. There are many similarities between the two films. They both have great actors and good acting. Both of them have the characteristic features of sisters, who are very different, insulting stepmother, girlfriend / confidant, emotionally inaccessible father, dead mother and surprise mistress. In both films, the characters experience life-changing implementations, and both films suffer from a kind of “love conquers all”. They both add a bit of surprise with Cameron Diaz in black underwear and a partial back shot of nude Gwyneth Paltrow. <br /> <br /> Both films seem frivolous, as if the authors of the works on which the films are based were engaged in market research and said, “Well, there is a market for stories about relationships between women, so I'm going to write about two sisters with the coming stepmother ?? ”In other words, instead of a drama arising from the truth of a relationship, relationships are invented to fit the dramatic situation. It seems compelled, the characters do not seem real, the relationship is incredible. <br /> <br /> Resolving the contradictions between the characters is simplified: simple apologies completely destroy the years of rage, leaving everyone feeling warm and indistinct. ever after. This is just unreal. Romantic fantasy. <br /> <br /> The characters “in her shoes” are slightly inflated than “Moonlight” and “Valentino”, especially as a stepmother. Sydelle Feller is so evil that it is hard to believe that her father will stay with her or even marry her. <br /> <br /> If you liked Moonlight & Valentino, you would probably like it. In Her Shoes as Well. In fact, the pleasant performances in both actors bring depth to their roles, which goes far beyond the contrived sentimentality of the scenarios.
