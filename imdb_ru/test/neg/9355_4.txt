Go to any movie fan and ask him for the title of the film, which was shot by Robert Wise, with the direction of the second block Yakima Kanutt and Sergio Leone, designed by Ken Adam and voiced by Max Steiner, Sir Stanley Baker, Sir Cedric Hardwick and Brigitte Bardot were shot in color , swing and stereo, in Cinecitta in 1955, with a thousand extras - and they will tell you to leave and stop being stupid. <br /> <br /> They will tell you that such a movie does not exist. That the names you quoted NEVER worked together - they were not even contemporaries. And that you just accidentally chose the names from the publication of the film and try to confuse them. <br /> <br /> At this point, you can send them to IMDb and show them to the actors and the Helen film crew. Troy ". They will be amazed! This lesser-known epic about the sword and sandalwood has ALL of these names and even more - Nile MacGinnis, Janet Scott and good old Harry Andrews. <br /> <br /> And this, of course, is strange. After the war, 1000 Italian extras cost about $ 25 a day, and the dramatic dramas were one of the main products of Italian cinema. Orgy scenes were filmed twice - one with tops, the other without (you can guess what version Britain and America got.) I suppose that even "Sophia" is in this supplement. <br /> <br /> In any case, the names They reflect the mind, but this is really just a coincidence. All the names mentioned either simply ended their careers (Kanutt, Steiner), or started them (all the others). <br /> <br /> Only Robert Wise and Nile MacGinnis were in the middle of their careers <Br /> <br /> For reference, Leone was not enrolled and studied his profession - Adam still had to invent a downward circle in the ceiling of the sets (a trademark he would like to include in all early bonds) - Baker had yet to play a major role and help create films such as “Zulu” and “Ograbl of "and then lead the Welsh broadcaster" Harlech ", and then die tragically young. <br /> <br /> While Harry Andrews Continues Become one of the favorite characters in Britain - Janet Scott (daughter of Torah Hird) would never bother, but she can forget her in “Day of Triffids” (although her bit was added later - for stuffing and happy end). ) or "Crack In The World"? <br /> <br /> Sir Cédric worked in the theater, but he knew how to act in films, and Bardo ... was Bardo, for gawdsake! <br /> <br /> But what did these star people do in this old nonsense? Don't Ask Me The two main stars were nameless Italians - Helen had a mustache, and Paris had a beautiful face - while the British were there only for support. <br /> <br /> To summarize, I think you can just mark this as Major FLUKE. In stereo. To be honest, if I had not seen this - I would not have believed OR!
