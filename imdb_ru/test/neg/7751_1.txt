This film is a bizarre fantasy tale, which, I am sure, does not suit anyone older than 10 years, but too strange for children. The plot is stupid, and acting is one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 25-year-old Kathy Ireland plays a teenage girl who behaves like a 9-year-old. It seems that she got her character's voice while listening to Alvin and the Chipmunks. Her shrill, childish voice is annoying when she begins to speak. All the other actors are bad, but in reality Kathy Irish is the worst. The plot is also terrible and is a kind of mixture between Alice in Wonderland and Mad Max. Wanda Saknussemm (Ireland) receives a letter stating that her father, who left her a long time ago, fell into a bottomless pit in Africa, and when she goes in search of him, she ends up in an underworld full of strange Australian accented people. This is one of the dirtiest films you've ever seen, with horrible lines all over the place. <br /> <br /> This is an annoying effect that this film uses for character development. Cathy Ireland is a nerd who does nothing and won't go anywhere. She flies to Africa .... Wow, what a development! She throws her glasses, and then does not need them. Why dropping glasses means they don't become a nerd. This should represent her descent into blindness. This is just stupid. The only positive thing I can think about is that there are semi-good special effects and camera work, and the music sounds fine. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a funny family fantasy that will appeal only to those who do not expect anything from the film. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 of ****. 84 minutes GHG for violence.
