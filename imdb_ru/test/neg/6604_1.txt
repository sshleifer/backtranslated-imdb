not many people outside of Poland had the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the brilliant works of Andrzej Sapkowski. He is very popular in Poland for his fantastic short stories (I believe that none of them have ever been translated into English. Alas!). In short, Vedzmin is the protagonist of Sapkowski’s books - the killer of monsters, a man of extraordinary strength and skill: he is largely your favorite cool guy in Tolkien’s style. Unfortunately, no one will know about it after watching the movie. “Wiedzmin” is nothing more than a collection of random scenes featuring wiedzmin and other characters from Sapkowski’s works, but not resembling the plot and the dramatic pace of the original. The fact that some shots in the film show attractive naked women does not add any quality to this. the film is getting worse and worse by the minute, and does not even meet the requirements of the category “so bad it is really good.” if you really enjoy fantasies and want to learn something about wiedzmin, read books instead.
