It must have been such a bad movie for a long time. I have to say that it’s really hard to make a good and / or realistic film about an air crash, but this film was such a waste of time and money. I also think that this is an unofficial way to get a bad reputation on Airbus. Firstly, the cabin is very similar to the Airbus cabin, secondly, you got a stick, thirdly, with the help of computers to control the rudders / elevators / ailerons using the “flight over wires”. When I watched this film, I thought that the goal of the film was “not to fly with computerized airplanes such as Airbus, instead use Boeing, which has a direct connection between steering and rudders”. <br /> <br /> All I can say is: bad story, terrible acting game (most actors), the worst movie trick ever ...
