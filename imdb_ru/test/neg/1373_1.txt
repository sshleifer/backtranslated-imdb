while Mensia's mind can be thought of as nothing more than a clone of the Chappell show, it is really worse than that. First of all, Carlos Mencia is a jackdaw **, just as funny as the original, about which it says little. The show contains weak parodies of American television advertising and political issues, and Mencia’s “comedic” understanding of politics is reinforced by the poor quality of this show. To top it off, Mencia throws more stupid ethnic jokes and stolen Jeff's feverish lines than I can count on with one hand. while from time to time Carlos is laughing badly, the rest of the time he spends insulting everyone in sight, which includes the exploitation of his own viewers. With the exception of the South Park, gathered together, and the Friday evening party, this show marks the end of the glory days of the Capella show, which for those of you who have not heard, was before his departure to Africa.
