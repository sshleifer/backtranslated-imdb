I have a friend who works in the blockbuster, and he gets 5 free movie rentals a week, so one day when we were combing the aisles for something interesting, I came across 18 types of kung fu weapons, and judging by one box, this film seemed rather strange, but, nevertheless, we succumbed to temptation and rented it - after all, it was free ... and thank god it was ... this is by far the worst movie I've ever- either saw ... The budget must have been a cucumber and a piece of rope ... the plot was ridiculous, the only pack The commemoration of “18 weapons” is that there is some book that tells how 18 weapons are being pursued by some bad guy - and that’s all! there is not even fighting with a weapon in this film ... this sequence of actions is just BAD ... 9 times out of 10 blows and blows of another guy go about a foot from landing on another guy, and there are MANY times when the movie skips frames ( the result is ridiculously bad editing) .... duplication is also ridiculous, and it is hardly even understandable .... and we will not even get into acting. ... the ending definitely makes you say "slurred ??", however, to be fair, I have to mention that the fighting techniques used by the actors were somewhat decent, and the old man is a crazy fool ... but that's about it ... Fortunately, I did not have to pay for this film, but I think, at least, now I know for sure how bad a film can actually be ....
