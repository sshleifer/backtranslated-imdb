I want to believe that all the new horror films that come out of Japan these days are sharp and make them enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> “Spider Forest” is not the one. <br /> <br /> I rarely end up watching something and end up spending a lot of time, but Spider Forest was an exception in this regard. I was very detached. The filmmakers have succeeded on the same level; throughout the film I could not stop because I wanted to see the answer to the riddle revealed by the plot. I could not stop watching. That's why I got so angry when the movie ended ... did they drag me all the way after 2 hours of tedious work for this POC? ATTENTION: "Spider Forest" is another one of those Japanese "ghost" stories, although you do not understand that this is happening. <br /> <br /> I never want to see the Japanese ghost story again. They are fake and contrived. “This is a ghost story” became like a big carpet, under which you can hide any insoluble holes in the plot that are in your story.
