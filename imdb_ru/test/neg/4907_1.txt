It was one of the most contrived, tedious, and clichéd films I've ever seen ... and, yes, I saw Pearl Harbor. Even people like Gene McKee couldn't get out of the horrific dialogue. It has been described as an “art house”; it can only be a euphemism for boring, horrible and, frankly, unsophisticated. Why when the film is devoid of plot, critics believe that it should be called art? But it is far more incomprehensible why America liked it? Without you, this film would remain on the shelf, where, perhaps, he belonged.
