After a good start, it turned out to be worse than you, the propaganda I have ever seen. This film is an open insult created to make you feel bad because you do not read the “holy bible”. <br /> <br /> To resume ... Well, let's call it a conspiracy ... In fact, aliens are not abducted by humans (we already know this ..). No, in fact, his demonic forces kidnap people who are in the new age thing or witchcraft, or read a porn magazine (as one hero does). <br /> <br /> This is complete with a bit of emotional piano music, when the protagonist of the realization he must blindly follow Christ to be saved. <br /> <br /> quotation sums up everything, imagine the fine piano music in the background: “You cannot allow others, even those you love, to prevent you from following God” > and we have to live in the age of enlightenment ... still work. Boycott this piece of shit
