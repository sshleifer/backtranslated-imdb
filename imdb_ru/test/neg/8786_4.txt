I rented it when it appeared on videotape in 1995. After re-checking, my understanding of this has not changed much. <br /> <br /> Then I was an adult, and now I'm still an adult! LOL <br /> <br /> Illogical elements mentioned by other reviewers did not bother me. This is not a documentary, this is a fantastic story in which animals can talk! <br /> <br /> Although I didn’t like most of the songs, I liked the song at the end of the picture, where she sang Barry Manilow and another person. <br /> <br /> Some people seem to justify their primitive animation by saying that CGI was not often used in animation functions, but let's not forget that THE LION KING was released for about a year. earlier, and it packed, perhaps more superiority than any animation function that was before !! <br /> <br /> But I think it would be fair to say that the pebbles and pingoins were made cheaply, while the LION KING wasn’t .... <br /> <br /> For me in 1995, as in our days, the important points are the expectations caused by several dangerous (mostly) scenes of underwater hunting. <br /> <br /> I also liked the opening scene, which takes place on the page of musical notes and a little love story. But most of the time, the story stretched and was boring. <br /> <br /> Worth a look, if you like the animation, but if you are an adult, and not at risk, go instead of the film Walt Disney. this!
