Is that a bad pile of garbage? Of course. Anyone who does not understand that when he takes a box in a video store, probably has no right to judge films in the first place. Thus, now I will evaluate the aspects of the film that really concern us on a scale from 1 to 10: <br /> <br /> Violence and blood: 4 - There are very few deaths in this genre, and there is almost no Mountain. Anyone looking for some blood should probably look elsewhere. The only redeeming quality is the fact that children do these terrible things, which raises the bar a little. <br /> <br /> Suspension: 1 - Well, I feel bad for those who are scared by this trio of stupid looking for children. <br /> <br /> Nude / Sex: 7 - Lots of crazy people from three different women, one of whom is MTV vj Julie Brown. There are two scenes of sex, but they show little. <br /> <br /> Unintentional humor - 4 - There are some good laughter with children who try to act scary, but on the whole it's just bad, not funny, bad. <br /> <br /> Overall - 4 - It is not impossible to see. There are some funny moments and enough nudity to keep your attention on the whole movie. However, watch this movie only if you are a big fan of movies of the 80s. It definitely falls on the lower end of the scale, but it is not quite down. The real disadvantage is the disappointing finale. It almost ruined the movie for me.
