“The Capture of Bigfoot” by Bill Reban is one of the worst horror films ever made. Harvy Olsen (Richard Kennedy), the greedy owner of the sawmill, decides that he wants to catch the snowman at all costs. that the snowman was used to living in a world upset by a geological expedition, and intended to protect the creature. This shit is nothing even remotely interesting. The film is extremely boring and filled with terrible songs and cheap special effects. Mountain, no waiting - just gigantic boredom. Avoid this terrible stuff like the plague.
