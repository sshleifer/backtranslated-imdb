There are so few films where only the title tells you everything you need to know about the film. Such a film, I was a communist for the FBI. Another example would be "I married a monster from space." <br /> <br /> Whatâ€™s really interesting about this film is how, in the name of heaven, he was nominated for an Oscar in the documentary category? This is not a documentary film in every sense of the word, it is not even the hybrid category of dokram. This is just a pretty exploitative film about the work of an FBI undercover agent named Matt Tsvetik, who infiltrated the Communist Party in Pittsburgh and became active, trying to seize the Union of Steelworkers for the Communists and report these actions to the FBI leaders. <br /> <br /> A documentary about this work might be interesting, but we got a film that was appropriate for those paranoid times. It struck me that when Tsvetik finally broke its cover, the case was in the Committee of non-American activities of the House of Representatives, and not in court in New York of the leaders of the Communist Party. There was a moment in the film when Chief Communist James Milliken told his followers to begin disseminating information that the Committee on Action of the US House of Representatives consists of a group of right winged women who want their names to be in front of the camera. Now, what could give him this idea? In any case, just connect the dots, and, without a doubt, the word they received came from J. Edgar Hoover, who tried to give HUAC some confidence by providing an effective secret agent, and not in actual testing. The little thing there was called cross-examination. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers, who produced the film I Was a Communist for the FBI, later produced Big Jim McLane, in which John Wayne starred as a HUAC investigator in Hawaii. HUAC earned praise for the work done by the Honolulu police to destroy the communist spy ring among the dockers. But at least in the John Wayne film, no one claimed that it was a documentary. <br /> <br /> Frank Lovejoy plays the lead role of Svetik, and his assistants in the FBI are Richard Webb and Philip Carey. Dorothy Hart plays a school teacher from Pittsburgh who says there are 30 or so in this school system that educate young people, including Ron Hagerty, Lovejoy's son. She changed her mind about the Communists, and Lovejoy should save her from the fate of the killings planned by his superiors. Ironically, Hart left the films and went to work in all places. The United Nations, which, as we know, is often accused of being a communist nest in the United States. <br /> <br /> More than half a century later, and we really have very little objective work on tape or in print about the US Communist Party. In fact, they were a very active group in the labor movement. The real heroes in their stop were labor organizers, such as Walter Reuter in the UAW or David Dubinsky in the ILGWU. But since they were left-wing people, they simply do not have rights to appropriate campaign materials. <br /> <br /> In any case, I was a communist for the FBI - this is exploitative work, a real-life character and evidence of those paranoid times.
