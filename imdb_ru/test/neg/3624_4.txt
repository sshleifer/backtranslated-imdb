It was another one of those shows that I watched to eradicate the positive elements, and because I was a fan of Nick for many years. Some of them will be stage productions, B-plots, guest stars and a few of the main actors that were good. I indulged in a show in high school, because I quickly began to despise Jamie Spears, as well as other chicks on the show who could not play. The only characters I liked were Dustin, Quinn, Stacy, Michael, and Logan. Quinn is the perfect outcast who eventually began to fit in; Stacy is a complete freak; Dustin falls into a bunch of strange, random situations; and Michael is a kind of comic assistant Logan. There is a noticeable difference between the quality of performance and acting skills of B-plots that attract them, and A-plots, which featured a bunch of screaming girls and the cult «Miss Perfect», repeating bad lines and obsessed with guys. This show would be great if the main plots contained the quality of side plots, but the main plots simply do not give anything. When he recently returned to re-performance, and I tried to watch him again, I was more inclined to the horrible actions of the girls, and I had to change the channel. Nevertheless, I will pay tribute to the previously listed characters, because they made the show more or less worth my time.
