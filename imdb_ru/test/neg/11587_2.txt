Laughter would be a good term to describe this film. But, since this film does not deserve anything good, I will use the term "terrible god." <br /> <br /> Focusing on the adventures of a group of eco-warriors who investigate the heinous actions of the military on a semi-tropical island, the lack of a budget quickly becomes apparent. Michael Pare (real actor! But only in the sense that Pinocchio was a real boy ...) leads a group of fools through a series of monsters in which you can chase and swallow the unfortunate victims. In pseudoscience there is some vague attempt to explain the presence of giant reptiles, but she convinces the viewer in what the acting is doing. <br /> <br /> As if that didn’t insult the viewer enough, the film also has what I’ll call “Weapons of Endless Ammunition”. I have never seen Mickey Parrott or his female clips of side shocks once for the entire film, but I can say with confidence that they shoot at least 40 shots each in any scene where they have to shoot their weapons. Forty shots may not seem like a lot, but here we are talking about standard pistols. I draw 15 round clips, tops. And remember, they never change clips or even carry any extra ammunition. <br /> <br /> This is a dumb build like this one that sends movies to the eternal lights of celluloid hell, and rightly so. CGI of the third level does not help much, and it is better to laugh at acting, otherwise you will start crying. Why channel SciFi constantly releases this mess, we can only guess. <br /> <br /> My advice ... give it a wide place ... a very wide place!
