I love musicals, everything from joyful Oklahoma to Poignant Porgy and Bess, to touching romantic “damn Yankees”. And I know most of the songs, sometimes singing them spontaneously, with a crowd or singing them alone. <br /> <br /> In the “real” musical, in contrast to this show in vaudeville, each song is carefully thought out to correspond to the exact moment. This expression of sadness, regret, love, joy, or delight is a natural extension where simple words fail. So, in “Guys and Dolls”, “My time of the day” describes Sky Masterson's adventurous life, since she is going to be compromised by the most unlikely woman. Each song in this brilliant sample of the genre sets the mood or develops the character, creating a fantasy place that has become absolutely believable thanks to the song's self-revealing memories. <br /> <br /> For this fan of the Broadway musical and their adaptation to the screen during the last half of the 20th century, Mama Mia is somewhere between satire and fierce house-style entertainment. There the songs of these musicals put forth often complex, often delightful storylines. While here, the songs, simply taken from the collection, only interfered with the shaky background of the film. <br /> <br /> Perhaps most of those viewers who make this film a monumental success simply have nothing to do with the artistic form of the 20th century musical. They have no idea about the magic done by the writer and lyricist who can turn a dance hall into someone we know and love, as was achieved in Sweet Charity. <br /> <br /> Let me apologize for the arrogance of this review. Perhaps on another day, in a different mood, I could have fallen into this, and was not so critical in this review. <br /> <br /> But I can't help but imagine that Richard Roger, Oscar Hammerstein, Cole Porter Irving Berlin and many others could even cope with this stupid premise. I think about it, while the memories of watching this film are fresh, and I can't help but grieve for the big loss.
