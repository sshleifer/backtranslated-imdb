Proof, if you ever need proof that Hummer had to firmly leave his vampires in the Victorian era. After all, vampirism is associated with repressed sexuality, so this concept does not matter in London in 1972, when its thirty-something years old pretended to be abnormal teenagers. <br /> <br /> Remember that by this time Hummer was wringing hard. The audience was tired of the horror of the living room of the 1950s and 60s, so the studio tried to bring them back, including nudity (LUST FOR A VAMPIRE, etc.) and updates of their characters - none of which clearly worked like Hammer in significant degree rested in the grave just two years later. Shame ... <br /> <br /> But I still really love the classic Hammer period from 1957 to 1965.
