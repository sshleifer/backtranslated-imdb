As you would expect, there is a pretty good reason why this film is so obscure and unknown, despite the fact that it deals with the always popular premise about zombies and starring in the 80s movie of Queen Linda Blair, namely: sucks! "Cooling" is trying very hard ?? too hard ?? to be a story with a depth and actual background, while it was supposed to be a frivolous and blood-filled horror film about frozen zombies. It takes an incredibly long time before something remotely interesting or meaningful happens. In cryogenics, a lot of talk, which I learned in physics lessons - is the study of products and their behavior at extremely low temperatures. Therefore, naturally, in this film, a group of people is studying the behavior of human corpses in a deep freeze. It goes without saying that it is extremely boring until two dumb night watchmen decide, during a power outage, that it is a good idea to place metal built cold cells outside at thunderstorm heights. The coolers are obviously affected by lightening, and the bodies spontaneously unfreeze and come to life to fall into the frantic zombie. Cooling is boring and surprising (at least in the late 80s) a horror film without blood that doesn't even use a quarter of its potential. All painful attempts to create an atmosphere of uncertainty and eeriness fail, and I canâ€™t think of any reason why zombie attacks should have been so bloodless. Even despite the low budget, they could have done better. The scenography, makeup effects and costumes are regrettable. For example, a research lab looks like a real apartment, while zombies can't look less threatening with their green faces and foil-clad outfits. How Linda Blair managed to get involved in such an awkward low-budget horror film is a complete mystery. She is attracted to lousy bi-movies like honey bees.
