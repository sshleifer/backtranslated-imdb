I laughed twice while watching this film, and if you are interested, I didn’t have a bad day, and I was not exposed to anything else that could distort my opinion when watching this cinematic bowel movement. This movie is bad. I wanted to enjoy it, and I just could not. With all this talent, do you think it would be at least watchable, right? Wrong. <br /> <br /> Let's play sucked and not suck! John Travolta- Very pleasant. Although he was clearly bombarded with too much makeup, I found it pleasant to look at. Did not suck. <br /> <br /> Uma Thurman - After killing Bill 1 and 2, the girl deserves more than this horribly written character. An important point of this character was to show someone how to manage the T-Mobile Sidekick. Sucks. <br /> <br /> Vince Vaughn - The moderate role of a white guy who thinks he is black goes to Vince "Money" Vaughn. Is this character pattern still considered funny? I love a guy, but I want to see him in something better than that. It seemed to me that he was sleeping. Sucks. <br /> <br /> Cedric Entertainer - This guy is good. He put on a great monologue after he was called a racial insult (you can probably guess what it is), which was probably the best part of the film. He was funny and really elevated the material that he was given only by his presence. Don't suck. <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel - Sucks from talking on the phone. <br /> <br /> James Woods - Sucks, but through no fault of his own. In fact, yes, it was. For some reason I was reminded of his role in the Casino. I don't like insane James Woods, I like the slow burn of James Woods. A victim of bad writing maybe? Andre 3000 - Sosal, but he staggered. I think he has the potential until he is burglary on his next picture. <br /> <br /> Christina Milian - She is absolutely beautiful and obviously talented, but this film will not make her a star, Does not suck, but needs the best vehicle for her talents, which is not directed by burglary. <br /> <br /> The Rock - This was supposed to be the role that led him to the glory of the movie, but on the instructions of F. Gary Gray, after all, sadly fails. In this film, Rock projects this charisma, which makes him so enjoyable that I felt sorry for him. He tries his best, and although he does not achieve success completely, he gets A + for his efforts from me. This guy is not afraid to embarrass himself and go completely against the font, playing gay bodyguard with an eye for glory. I really want to see how he succeeds. He has what's needed until he goes burglary. <br /> <br /> This brings me to what I consider to be the weak link in this production. I could just go out and say it, right? The direction of F. Gray was about as strong as diarrhea. Wow, that was bad. Who had the bright idea of ​​letting this guy direct? The negotiator was good, but what else in his resume convinced people that he was the man for the job? Between his leadership and the cruel letter, I am ready to throw both criminals to get a good lead salad on my knees. Want to see John and Uma dancing? I could think of another movie with these two, which I could recommend watching instead. Not worth ten dollars and fifty cents, I had to get into the theater. <br /> <br /> With this movie, everything could be fine, and it wasn’t even “just good”. <br /> <br /> RATING: * out *****. <br /> <br /> PS It is worth mentioning Fergie from Black Eyed Peas. Sizzling!
