I read and enjoyed many of the secrets of Robishaw by James Lee Burke. When I read "In an Electric Fog with Dead Confederates," and Tommy Lee Jones played a major role, I was delighted. Watching him last night, I ended up turning it off in about twenty minutes, not wanting more people to shoot or beat. Do not misunderstand me, I am not against blood and blood - I love Untouchables and the Godfather Trilogy. Perhaps it was just that I had seen “Birth” and “What happened” before seeing this. I know that Burke’s books are cruel, lyrical, and especially in the case of “In the Electric Fog”, may look like the Kajuna bogs he writes about, full of things that are never fully explained. In the book, this is normal. In the film, this is confusing. Many of the previous reviewers are also ardent fans of Dave Robish, making it more understandable that they really liked the film. Or are they fans of Bernard Tavernier or both. Even as a fan of all the actors (and especially Vince), I felt that it was such a waste of their talents in general - they gave good performances in a film that did not stick together. Now I say this, seeing only the DVD in the USA and hoping that the Tavernier cut will make a huge difference. On the other hand: the soundtrack was wonderful. The scenes in the Robishho house were perfect - as I imagined what the bait shop looks like. Mary Steenburgen was great in the role of Bootsy, as was Walter Broe in the role of Batista. If you are reading a book, you know why Robishho is a balanced person at the beginning of the film, and then starts beating people with various tools. In general, I would like them to shoot more of the Electric Fog and Confederate Dead and miss most of the Robishho interrogation methods, explaining the gifts of Elrod and his relationship with Dave, as well as Dave with the general. Then I would not feel today the same as last night when I turned off: “What just happened?”
