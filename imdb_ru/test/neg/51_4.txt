One of the last surviving great horror screens - Konrad Radzoff - is dying, and his body is placed in a mausoleum with fragments of the great Conrad passed before his death, welcoming you during your visit. Unfortunately for him and his captors, Conrad’s body was “lent” by a gang of four boys and three girls and taken to a huge estate where they drink with him, drink for him, dance with him, laugh at him and above him, and then put on him sleeping in a casket that just happens to be lying in the room upstairs. The news of the missing body reaches the widow Radzoff and her friend (who, as it turned out, is experienced in the black arts), and she holds a certain ceremony that brings Conrad back to life so that he, in his own words, can get an eye, a tooth for a tooth "Well, Frightmare is an interesting" bad "film. Of course, it's cheap. The sets look as if they were borrowed (which I am sure they were). Special effects and blood and guts are made freely and with little confidence. Acting from Medium to Medium to Low with a few exceptions. Jeffrey Combs from Re-Animator is but in fact he does little in this rather ungrateful role of a horrified teenager who needs to steal the body of a dead man for kicks. None of the "children" except a pretty girl playing Meg is good. Nita Talbot plays with " friend "Radzoff with a fading interest. In addition, look for a big one - I mean a big one - a guy who plays a policeman. This is Porky himself from Porky glory. But, fortunately for all of us, one performance is above the material. Ferdi Maine, a frequently overlooked German actor who had the features of Christopher Lee and played the role of a vampire in the movie Fearless Vampire Killers, does more than commendable work as an icon of the horror of aging in public life and a real human demon in personal life, Konrad Radzoff a bad person in life, living solely for his own pleasures, and we see how he kills twice before he even dies (obviously, none of the rocking teenagers at that moment). Maine can look very regal, speak very elegantly and easily transmit a threat. If for any other reason, you should see Frightmare for its execution. I do; However, believe me, when they showed black and white clips of Radzoff, they used the shots of Christopher Lee (did anyone have any thoughts?). In any case, one can guess what is happening, and this is indeed the case: Radzoff comes out and goes after the children who disturbed him. Again, the formula is banal and abused. Acting for the most part anemic, and the direction of oh is so funny. But Maine gives good results in a sea of ​​ineptitude. Definitely worth a little peek. Watching Maine continue to appear on the screens in his mausoleum, every time I got a wry smile.
