“Kite Runner” began as one of those “important” films that most people hunt, because they are told that they have to, if they want to be among the elite, and quickly go down into an idiotic film of absurdly outlandish sizes. <br /> <br /> I have never read this book and never felt the need for it, because, frankly, I don’t care. Of course, they call me ignorant of what I am saying, but I'm really not interested in anything else: “Pull your heart strings, copy all the other storylines to get emotions from the novel of readers”, even if it is set in Afghanistan. <br /> However, I watched the movie. I heard good words about its beauty, how touching it is, and decided why not? As it turned out, there was a very good reason why not. Not only was the so-called protagonist completely non-sympathetic (I understand that he was young and this was a ransom film, but frankly, he was terrible. I hated him and not in the good way of “Antihero”, he was just stupid, idiotic, self-absorbed character, to whom I felt nothing), but the rest of the story was so absurd that I could not believe that everyone else admired how beautiful it was and how they cried and it moved by them. Sorry, but I only feel touched by what seems realistic. It is known that Sci-Fi touched me, fantasy too ... but is it? You are welcome. It surpassed many other films in pure absurdity! My biggest callus, Hassan was Amir's brother ... right? Are you sure you haven't just ripped it off from thousands of other stories? It’s positive that this particular piece wasn’t just added to try to draw more tears from your audience (you know, the type of people who are looking for reasons to cry during the movie)? I rolled my eyes when this “turn” opened, knowing that from there it could only go down (not to mention returning to Star Wars: “Amir, Hassan is your brother”, “Noooo, this is not true , it is IMPOSSIBLE! ”) Oh, and it certainly did. Filled to the brim with cliches and just plan a stupid story. For example, “a good guy miraculously escapes from a bad guy, despite everything, with the help of a brave guy who, despite the fact that he is viciously sodomized and has no idea who you are, is ready to help out with a conveniently located weapon, which has a special meaning for you. ” Oh, and don't forget about that idiotic "finally get revenge on the guy who teased you when you were small, who, surprisingly, turned into an adult psychopath" (believe me guys, I understand that you love living in the movies but it will never happen. You know this guy who teased you in high school ... he is not a terrorist, he is probably an accountant.) <br /> <br /> Oh, and I should mention CGI-tastic kites! I think they were on par with the films "The Matrix" and "Transformers", bravo guys! Bravo! <br /> <br /> It seems that this film was created only for a western audience who needs a reason to care about the Middle East (hey, the story of an overly emotional friendship will work!) This is one of the most superficial films. I had the misfortune to see, it looks just as good ... but when you go straight to it, there is nothing special about it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the core of the American audience will do what they 'repeat and follow "This is about controversial materials, so this should be good!" way of thinking.
