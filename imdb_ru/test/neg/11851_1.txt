On the bright side, it's over. Of course, this is the only thing in this film. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I have seen some bad ones. This film is actually so terrible that I went and changed my rating for “Children of the Living Dead” to 2, simply because I am not a predator. <br /> <br /> The official single-line rating is: “Come with me to another movie if you want to live.”
