I mean, nothing happens, 5 stupid kids go to Oklahoma to find the magic forest of marijuana ... it could be fun if it were not for the 5 worst actors in the world. And the dialogues were not even half an inch of fun. The only thing I almost showed my teeth was when dumb cops stopped teenagers in Oklahoma or Kansas ... The plot could have been funny if it had not been for a terrible interpretation. If you even think about watching this movie, do not. How stupid that a guy runs away from the policemen, telling them that he is gay, like his friend (he just did not pretend ...), and that this silly joke about the multiple meanings of the word "gay". ‚Äù I laugh at my hair ....... NOT ....... Anyway ... A GOOD FILM THAT I EVER saw!
