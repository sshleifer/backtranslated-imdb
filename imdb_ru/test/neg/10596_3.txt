The DVD cover explains the premise: "Three troubled teens are sent to prison," and "they will have time until Captain Greer offers them a deal for him - under cover." The film begins with the definitions of the words "Mod" and "Detachment", so you do not have to look for them in the dictionary. For a visual definition of “Cool”, find photos of the original trio: Michael Cole (as Pete Cochran), Clarence Williams III (as Link Hays) and Peggy Lipton (as Julie Barnes). <br /> <br /> One black. One white. One blonde As soon as they decided cool. <br /> <br /> The three who made up Scott Silver’s version of Aaron Spelling’s “The Mod Squad” are two dozen: Claire Danes (like Julie Barnes), Giovanni Ribisi (like Pete Cochran) and Omar Epps (like Link Hayes ). They can't do much with this material. The image of Mr. Ribisi is the most “far”, which means that he is most distracted from the original characterization. Miss Danes is filmed in Josh Brolin’s novel (like Billy Waits), which looks as if he might be in a remake of “Markus Welby, MD”. You will not believe, a hefty Michael Lerner is dancing with Mr. Epps' Link. He explains: “I'm not a fairy, I just love to dance!” And asks: “Spin me up!” <br /> <br /> *** The Mod Squad (1999) Scott Silver ~ Claire Danes, Giovanni Ribisi, Omar Epps
