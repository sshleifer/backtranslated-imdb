“Based on a joke once told by Jim Vinorsky” ... this is what I read at the end of the closing credits. Well, then Mr. Winsky must have a terrible sense of humor! This movie is terrible, really. I liked the first two chapters of the Bloody Party series. The third film was completely useless, but quite watchable compared to this shit! There is not even a "killer drillers" and the plot, acting, characters, locations, events ... everything is boring, absurd and ridiculous. The only good reason to watch this turkey is a girl: if this movie was in porn, I think it would actually work a lot better! There is also no blood in the film: the first scene (in the tent) can be more bloody, and the scene with the headless guy knocking on the door lasted one second! Some moments of light excitement can not save a non-existent plot. Buzzy (Lank Johnson) seems to be the only real actor here: I found him the only tolerant character in this film! Oh ... there is a pointless part with Brinke Stevens, who sang "Linda" in the First Massacre at the Pajama Party: the police prevented her from finding out more information about the killer; but we only get some footage from the first movie! Neither dialogue, nor monologue, nor anything from this still traumatized adult girl, who is forced to revive the worst 30 minutes of her life (as she says), without giving us any clues about the killer! <Br /> <br /> Watch at your own risk.
