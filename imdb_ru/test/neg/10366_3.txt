This film has some flaws, and most of these flaws are the lack of anything happening. Perhaps the greatest film showing all the gloom in the country of flights, Rolling Kansas is a movie in which nothing happens and you don’t care about anyone. As life, it begins, it moves, and then it ends. There are several attempts at humor, but everything is very bad. The casual cameo just reminds the viewer that they could spend their lives on something other than watching this movie and one rock song they bought and used in each case. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and go watch a good movie. It's free and often at Comedy Central, because no one went to look at it, no one wants to see it, and it's a little better than dead air. Not damn laudable, but it’s worth hearing a movie’s rock song. It is a pity that the film is not worth watching.
