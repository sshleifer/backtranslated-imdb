What could be a good story was destroyed by a ridiculous time travel scenario. If something had changed in the past that had changed evolution, and people had never developed, the time machine would never have been built. If something from the past was transferred to the present, it would not affect the past. <br /> <br /> I would really like the producers to do their ideas in front of a real scientist before finishing the script. Even if you suspend reality and assume that time travel is possible, you must adhere to logic. <br /> <br /> OO Ben Kingsley seemed to have a great time demonstrating excellent performance. All the other actors seemed to be doing everything they could. It was a letter that made them curl in the wind. <br /> <br /> “Back to the Future” handled it better.
