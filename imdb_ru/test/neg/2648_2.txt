I went to see “Random Hearts” with 3 friends, and at first I thought that maybe I just didn’t like the movie. In the end, I did not like it as well as how it turns out, and this film received all kinds of awards. Well, it wasn't just me ... none of my friends liked that either. It was incredibly slow, very much like tooth extraction. The only action in the film is that in the preview. We did not leave the theater, because everyone assumed that something else would happen. We weren't as smart as the 7 or 8 people who left. I never went to the movies in my life, but I definitely had to do it. It's hard for me to write, considering that it's relatively easy for me to give pleasure when it comes to movies. I need a lot to think that the movie is awesome, but not so much that I just like it. This film did not even come close in this category. The film was not only about 2 hours longer, it looked like two separate banal stories in one, but they were not stitched smoothly. Plus, the “soundtrack,” so to speak, was so annoying. For example, Seinfeld has the same riff that sounds over and over (the difference is that I like Seinfeld) ... this film had this jazz riff that he continued to play, which sometimes sounded extremely inappropriate, especially dealt with the death of the plane crash. It's hard to explain what I mean, but believe me, it was terrible. I can not say enough so that people do not waste their money. After I left the theater, I sincerely wanted to write to the film company and demand my $ 7 back ... you can go bowling or something for that money.
