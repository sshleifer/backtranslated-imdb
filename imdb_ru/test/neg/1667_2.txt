Tommy Lee Jones was the best Woodrow, and no one can play Woodrow F. Coll better than he. He was not only the first and best, he was the only person who could portray his grief and confusion. It was a bad disappointment, and I am surprised that I even forced myself to look at it. I can even start how sorry they did Woodrow. I understand that by that time he will be old, but everyone knows that he will NEVER allow it. The first film was the best and the only one I ever watched. I hope that God no longer plans to direct the filmmakers to continue or remake the wonderful classics without Tommy or Duval. Without them, films are a waste of time and money for everyone, including the director. If you are planning to make another single movie about any kind, take mine and billions of others, do not waste time. To continue films is to simply rub the first one into the ground. Thank you.
