This film is a standard stupid sci-fi board of the 50s. In his favor, the plot manages to carry out an invasion of aliens, without actually producing the aliens themselves. But come on, if aliens need energy and can absorb it from sources like hydrogen bombs, why should they come to the earth? Why don't they just suck it out of a STAR!?!? The only reliable reason for the presence of Kronos is a direct attack on earthly society, and not just a collection of energy. Nothing like that even hints; Kronos may have been built by a superior race, but his activity on Earth is the most primitive. The end that hero-scientists plan for Kronos is based only on pseudoscientific nonsense. This is tantamount to the “reverse polarity” gambit, which was so often used in bad fiction that it itself became a joke. Low and behold, it causes our unwanted visitor to release its collected energy. It seems that none of the influential people do not care what impact the environment will have on the release of this energy (which, after all, includes, among other things, the entire output of the hydrogen bomb) And, unfortunately, by the time the movie ends, Of angeles Oops!
