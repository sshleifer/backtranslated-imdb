When I first saw this show, I thought to myself: “What is it !!!!!?” This is one of those shows where there is a perfect fake school world with silly problems that are considered “huge”. Then there is Sadie. This is a complete mismatch for her friends and her family. She is completely obsessed with nature, this is not bad, but she compares high school students with animals! like what is it ?! In addition, they made her another Lizzie Miguire clone (yes, because the world definitely needs one more of them!) She’s also very perfect, like most television girls, that makes me sick! So, please, this is a stupid show, there is no point in missing it if you didn’t like Lizzy McGuire or any other similar shows.
