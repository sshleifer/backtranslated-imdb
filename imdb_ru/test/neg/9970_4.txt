It seems to me a chore as far as television films go. I can believe that it is based on a true story, because the plot seems too clumsy to be written by someone with storytelling skills. <br /> <br /> For example, good old John Ritter (now a rather bulky and bearded villain) poisons his wife enough to make her sick, then accuses her of being psychosomatic and leaving to marry another young woman. to the woman. Fourteen years passed before the story resumed. Why fourteen years old? I believe that, although the narrative does not require it, the story requires it. <br /> <br /> However, some specific scenes are so cinematic that the author almost certainly came up with them. Scrolling through her attic, Helgenberger, Ritter's first wife, stumbles upon an old electrical appliance and has one of those black-and-white memories with stings on it — she suddenly remembers when fourteen years ago she discovered Ritter's shaving files with selenium. from the rectifier, carefully collecting them and placing them in your shampoo and eyelash liner (or whatever it is called). It later turns out that he also put it in her coffee. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I don’t believe it. I do not believe that she had that particular epiphany in the attic, or that Ritter put selenium chips in his shampoo or eyeliner. Selenium is referred to in the film as “toxic metal,” and I believe that it is in sufficient quantity, but it is also an antioxidant that is sold over the counter in pharmacies and is swallowed. Someone will have to demonstrate - as no one does in this film - that this is actual poison. Many people have tried nicotine patches and failed. So why is selenium in her shampoo causing immediate and severe headaches in Marg Khelgenberger? And her eyes become as painful as boils when she applies makeup? I think that anthropologist E. B. Taylor called this ingenuous idea “the magic of sympathy,” but I am not sure. <br /> <br /> Mais je divage. In any case, Ritter is obviously trying to do the same with his second wife fourteen years later, although no evidence of deception ever arises when she becomes ill with the same symptoms. Wife number two was taken to Mexico and apparently cured, but suddenly drops dead soon after her return. Irrefutable evidence is piling up against Ritter, who plays the villain with all the stops - when his first trial is terminated, he smirks at Helgenberger, who triggered the investigation. <br /> <br /> You see, Helgenberger was good friends with Ritter's second wife and was terribly concerned about her passing and her manner. (I bet.) And she wants to prevent the same thing with a rich young woman who seems to be in third place in Ritter’s marriage schedule. (Of course.) Is the guy who plays Detective Mauser Lawrence Dane giving the best performance? All others act by numbers. They project emotions and thoughts with the subtlety of a warning at a railroad crossing. But Dane does little things that are original. “I was told that you want to report the murder. (A long pause while he sits down and waits), then abruptly turns his face to Helgeberger and asks in a reasonable and curious voice: “So who was killed”? the bare bones of historical events, nothing prevented the characters or their actions from being drawn differently than they were in real life. I mean, what the hell, Ritter is still in prison, convicted of murder, and the character Helgenberger is dead, so who is the object? I would like a forensic examination to be clarified. Ritter seems to have used so many poisons and toxic metals — let me see, selenium, cyanide, a huge dose of chlorine, and perhaps something else — that I was confused about all of this. Not that I supported Ritter. Here is a mathematician with a doctor of science who insists that people call him "doctor." He even corrects people who refer to him simply as a “professor.” Most doctors of science get this narcissistic problem behind them very quickly. “Jess, call me White, although I know how to get the standard deviation, and you don’t.” Average TV cost.
