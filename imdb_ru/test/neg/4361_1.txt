...the first? Killjoy 1. But here's a review of Killjoy 2: <br /> <br /> (contains spoilers, so be careful with the readers) <br /> <br /> Oh god. Oh, my, my, my I will begin by telling you that I had no hope that this film would be good. Given that the film “Killjoy” (the first film), without a doubt, the worst film ever made, the sequel did not promise much success. <br /> <br /> As expected, it did not bring success. <br /> <br /> Mortality was even better than in the first film. There were absolutely no eye candies, and each leg looked so fake that I would not be surprised if they had a kindergarten class. <br /> <br /> Listen, I don’t even know where to start, Hm, for starters, the film wasn’t even long. It was only an hour and eight minutes (68 minutes), but again, the premature termination was actually a postponement. In fact, this is the only reason why this film was not as bad as the first one, because the first one was longer. <br /> <br /> I usually don’t give spoilers in reviews, but since I don’t give I want one of you to go through torture while watching this waste of a film, I'm going to spoil everything. Not that there is something to spoil. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the final. Killzhoy - the most murderer. Wanted explosions, incendiary bombs, weapons, etc., to kill all the usual serial killers in horror movies. Guess what it takes to kill a killjoy? F *** ING WATER GLASS. Do not lie. In the end, the girl took a cup of water and threw water into Killjoy's face. Then Killjoy started screaming and they tried to make him look as if his face was melting, putting dried rubber cement on his forehead. Then he lay there, and the people went to sleep. <br /> <br /> Now let's start playing. VERY HORRIBLE. No man was believable. I don’t even know what to say, except that they seem to have just hired a few strayers living on the streets to play in this film. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I sincerely doubt that they spent more than $ 100 in total to make this film. They had nothing. Most of this happened in the woods, which would not cost them to shoot anything. The actors did not make any effort, so it is obvious that they "worked" for free. They had no special effects or good details, and they probably used blood ketchup. Damn, who am I kidding? They probably didn't even spend $ 100. They probably spent $ 3.29 on a bottle of ketchup, that's all. Film-strength film, shot with a budget of 3.29 dollars. <br /> <br /> For Bob’s sake, they couldn’t even afford to rent a police uniform. In the end, after Kiljoy’s death, the girl wakes up and says: “Where is he?” And the main woman replies: “He’s gone.” Then, suddenly, some fat, stupid guy with scars on his face appears out of nowhere with a mobile phone, saying, "You have a phone call." The girl answers and says "Oh, hello, mom!" and smiles. Then a fat dumb guy goes to show that this is a policeman. However, he wears khaki pants and a plain green button-down shirt with a lame badge on the front pocket. Hell, that was probably the badge the director got when he was in security patrol in 3rd grade. Then they all sat down in a tanned jacket and left when the loans rolled. They couldn't even get a police cruiser, so they just got a tan. F ** Kin 'Lame. Killjoya didn't even have an ice cream van that he had in the first movie. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, Kiljoy is the brightest gay slasher. If there was a slasher with hot pink spandex and a rainbow flag, he would ALWAYS not be as cheerful as Killjoy. Killjoy is also not funny (and believe me, he REALLY tried to be like that). <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this film is the extremely weak threat from one of the criminals. Someone comments on the boy passing the third class, to which he replies: “I will show you the third class!” In a threatening way. It must be the absolute worst threat I've ever heard. “I will show you the third class!” <br /> <br /> This film does not even work at the level “so bad, this is good”. This is dirt. If you have not done something bad and feel so guilty that you want to punish yourself severely, DO NOT watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Just remember; if a flaming homosexual clown with a huge African-African American tires you with mortal jokes (and tries to kill you at the same time), just pour him water Case is closed. <br /> <br /> FINAL RATING: .1 out of 10
