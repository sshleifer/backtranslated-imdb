Stunning blonde Natasha Henstridge is a young, not very distressed widow in a mansion on a hill telling her story to a television journalist in Monroeville, Virginia. And among the noble horses of the community, she is suspected of being involved in the death of her elder husband. This is James Brolin, trusting like a baby in arms. The memory of a Canada-made telehedram is based on an article that appeared in Vanity Fair magazine. This must be true! However, this is much more romance than mystery, and a very familiar story. Longstart star Henstridge as a nurse in hospice? It can happen, I think. And it's nice to see that Brolin plays a significant role after his catchy turn in Antwone Fisher, even if he doesn't reach the end of the picture. The end of the picture? He does not even reach the beginning of the picture. That is why memories were invented, of course.
