Sorry guys, but these rave reviews on this prestigious site about this Respiro film are very strange, to say the least. Is insanity picturesque, I asked and did not find the answer. Of course, the film is beautifully shot, in part it is almost a documentary. But on the other hand, the fact is that when it comes to the women of Grace, she shows all the signs of a deep illness, and I was wondering throughout the film what her crap was. Her behavior is completely anxious, and the (shocked) villagers are really right, wanting to send her to a proper institution to see what can be done with her condition. Urgently need treatment! Such behavior as hers is hellish for everyone around, her husband, poor children (especially) and fellow citizens. Let's not be falsely romantic about it! I hated this permissive portrait of a mental patient. WHY, for God's sake, shouldn't a husband want to cure her, or at least try to do it? Why the horror of a trip to Milan (a big city, of course, but many possibilities of capable people to cure it)? Narrowmindedness? Irresponsibility? Anyway, I inspired myself on this site to make a film on a DVD, and when I saw it, I had to publish it for others to form my own opinion about it. Honestly, I understand why the film did not get further as an indication of the choice of Cannes ...
