There is nothing to watch. It was all done (and better) before. Who cares about this woman - imperfect in all respects - as a mother as a wife and as a friend? In an instant, when she could have gone on a big road - she jumped into a new relationship with both feet and held her breath - not for a better reason than “me too!” If she had not been a handsome and young man whom she portrays on the screen, - it was more like real human wreckage that our family members, neighbors, and friends who are really suffering from add-ons represent, we would change the channels in a nanosecond. /> <br /> This movie starts from the bottom and goes down. Nothing redeems, no lessons are taught - nothing inspires. None of the main characters even cause sympathy, not to mention sympathy. (Well, maybe a snake.) It would be more fun if I closed the door on my arm. Who needs drift like this?
