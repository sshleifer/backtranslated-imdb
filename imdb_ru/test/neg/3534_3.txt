This is Wes Craven in its worst form! this is the worst horror, if you can call it horror, you will ever watch, especially from one of the horror masters Wes Craven, Bad Leadership, Bad Behavior, Bad Set, Bad Atmosphere makes this the largest pile of garbage in history! the bad guy is completely unconvincing, the guy is not even sorry! the blood and horror involved in the film are ridiculous, it's just crap! The only good moments I can think of is that Natasha Gregson Wagner, Giovanni Ribisi and Lance Henriksen were shot in the films, but even this cast would not let it get out of control and become one of the worst horrors in all a story. If you still don't watch it, don't worry, you just hate it.
