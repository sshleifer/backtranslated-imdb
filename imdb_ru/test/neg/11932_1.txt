This film is a cash contribution. The monetary contribution depends on the incendiary theme created for the earlier classics. Yul Brynner has long jumped from a ship and therefore has most of the production values. Lee Van Cleef takes on the lead role of Chris. I can't remember a single actor who looks less like Brynner than Van Cleef. Hey, he could at least shave off his hair and lose his mustache, just for the sake of continuity. Some correctional centers show this film to punish offenders. One step out of line and the Magnificent Seven Ride! brought to the fore and owns. They didnâ€™t even try to make this movie look like a television movie! Fierce.
