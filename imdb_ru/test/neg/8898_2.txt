Although I rarely agree with Filmkrönikan, I have to say that this film, although not terrible, just didn’t bother me ... and it all just seemed out of place ... it had its moments ... three or four that made laugh at me ... but most of the time I just sat and wondered why? why did the characters do it? even the Hot Shots characters felt more thoughtful and contented ... <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a good film about norrlands, watch the Pistvakt movie. There were more than random ethnic groups that simply walked, shooting each other on the Swedish tundra ... <br /> <br /> I am so disappointed ...
