I just wanted to say that I was very disappointed after watching this movie! I was expecting a biblical story, visualized with a great special effect, etc., But during the film I found out that this is an absolute disaster ... this is not a biblical story at all ... only the boat and animals are like the story ... if you want a visual "Translation" of the biblical version of "Noah", then do not watch this movie!
