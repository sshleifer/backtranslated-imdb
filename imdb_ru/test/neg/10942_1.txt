Shakalaka Boom Boom is an excerpt from the movie Amadeus. I personally appreciate Amadeus as one of my favorites, not only because he is about music, which is my favorite subject, but also because she tells us the real story of a musical genius, who is remembered not only for the volume works of beautiful music that he created during his life, but because of his own self-destructive nature and his tragic death at the young age of 35, which was hardly observed during his life because of the policies that some people, especially Salier, play, the Italian component Ithor, who was jealous of him. <br /> <br /> Personally, I was shocked to see Shakalaku ... because the director invariably cut out most of the scenes from the movie Amadeus. I see the worst kind of plagiarism in this film and am skeptical about the films that Bollywood continues to produce day after day. The film is a disaster, the two musicians in the film do not give you a sense of realism, the film is tasteless, meaningless and a complete failure in all respects. The only person who has an impact is Bobby Deol, who at least knows how to act. Otherwise, the whole cast looks like a group of lovers. <br /> <br /> The irony is that while watching a movie on the first screen of the movie it says that all the characters in this movie are fictional and that any resemblance to someone is a purely random lie, because all the similarities are very clear and intended for all. I would like to bring Darshan and Co. to the court not only for copyright infringement, but also for injuring a beautiful work of art.
