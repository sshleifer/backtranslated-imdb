There is something in the story about white hunters captured by a tribe of white women in the African jungle / plains. This is turkey and some. What it really is is wildly mismatched footage from early sounds and silent films mixed with poorly filmed recent (pre-release) footage from people on safari. There are scenes with a man in a gorilla costume, people from the southern seas in the sea (they used to represent people in the center of Africa), women in bikinis, a horrible story and a guy in a loincloth with makeup all over his body (racially insensitive I think so). This is a film in which you can sit and laugh - but only with a lot of alcoholic drinks and witty friends. At any other time it will be a chore to pass. This is a bad bad bad movie. Besides that, I am speechless.
