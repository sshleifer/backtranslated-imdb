Although I am a fan of shock and blood, I found this film at least disappointing. The effects and the puppet work were impressive, yes, and the humor was timely, but ... something was missing. You see, the first act of the film is dedicated to finding out the nuances of Jack Brooksâ€™s character, despite the fact that everything we need to know about his aggression is delivered within a few minutes after the appearance of the first title cards. As for the story and many other memories: not necessary. <br /> <br /> Pacing during the second act was tedious. Most of them are focused on eating Freddie Krueger, then tearing, then eating more, then waving his arms and saying something harsh or rude. At the same time, the chock is interspersed with short scenes of Jack discussing his rage problems with the therapist. (Definitely the entertainment scenes in the film are a great dialogue that costs a lot of laughter.) Then, without warning, Jack decides to kill several monsters. And then it's over. <br /> <br /> In general, as a return to the horror films of the 1980s, Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer has great potential, but it is useless and is prepared without conflict or adequate resolution. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, these problems will be resolved before Jack Brooks VII: Jack goes to hell or Jack against Ashe enters production.
