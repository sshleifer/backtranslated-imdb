Simarron was sick to sit. Although Irene Dunn copes well with a complex scenario, Richard Dix’s pompous and overly active role is cruel. Over time, the character of Isaiah, as well as other racial and religious beliefs, are not considered, although the film is somewhat progressive regarding the role of women and the mistreatment of Native Americans. Editing is especially weak. This is without doubt the worst of all the “best” paintings.
