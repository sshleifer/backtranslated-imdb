It seems all guys are sexually excited by Mandy Lane. All girls seem to envy Mandy Lane. But nothing seems to happen to this, and this viewer wonders why? Mandy is beautiful and attracts everyone she meets, but we will never know Mandy or the other characters in the film. Mandy accepts an invitation from her student friends to go to a secluded ranch. Three boys and three girls drink and use drugs. In the film, teens drink a drink, like its water, and take drugs to experience a psychedelic journey. And there is absolutely no sex. Meanwhile, the teenagers disappear one by one. But everyone else is drunk and high. No one, including those who watch the movie, cares or is concerned. No one, including the audience, seems to give a damn. Emmett, a fellow student, is the initiator of the whole event. There is a guard, Garth (charmingly and beautifully played Anson Mount), who guards and protects the ranch. In the middle of the movie, the killer opens up, the tension is suddenly removed, like air released from a balloon. The events are completely predictable, and the film is simply completely exhausted. Mandy meets her match, but we never know why - and at the end of the film there is still no sex. Is Mandy hypnotizing the boys, or is she just tired of all the boys and girls before they die? This totally bewildered viewer can only conclude that Mandy wants to get rid of female and male competition - by killing manipulative girls and dirty boys. <br /> <br /> Is Mandy worth all the attention? The director (Jonathan Levine) seems to think so, but this viewer is not. A capable cinematographer (Darren Janet) gives some amazing images, but in fact his attention seems to be focused on Garth, who is a real stallion. Not all boys love Mandy or not? If you want to be bored enough to find out how this movie ends, I suggest you sleep in the middle of the movie until you see the seductress Mandy and Gart's crotch crotch. But don't wait for something to happen. Yes, you guessed it. Mandy remains a virgin, but sex is still not there. I rate this movie as 3 out of 10, but not because of Mandy. What for? Because all girls love Garth, and all voyeuristic looks seem to look at Garth in a compromise position. But, unfortunately, girls and boys, this film never goes beyond a frustrating and incomplete sexual fantasy. Mandy goes to a secluded ranch, and nothing sexy happens. The audience is horrified at the ranch - and can not help, but I wonder why?
