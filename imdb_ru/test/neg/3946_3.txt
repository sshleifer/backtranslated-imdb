This film was not very good, in my opinion. Although it was not a complete waste of an hour and a half (fortunately, I did not have to pay $ for it), it was not very scary. There were episodes in which I jumped, and a few minimally violent / bloody scenes, but in general, only someone who is easily frightened would consider this film scary. <br /> <br /> In general, the script and the game were very weak. Characters never developed and did not grow as people. Even at the end, the main guy, whatever his name, did not get up and should have been saved from the fire at the last minute. The plot also had inconsistencies. The policeman who was killed was NOT killed just like he died in the game. October girl mentioned that in order to kill the evil demon lady, you need to read something from the correct text. It's funny that they never bothered to do it and still managed to escape. Malcolm died in the middle of the game, but did not die "in real life." In addition, the creation of the gameplay itself was a very weak spelling. It would be good for the death of a brother, just to make them play again. But you have to play video games and stay alive, and 3 people die before playing again ... why do you need a game at all? If you like movies like The Ring and it's scary and fun, watch this movie. If you know someone like that, you can watch it with a laugh, do it. If you like horror movies that make you laugh out loud, and you have the opportunity to watch this movie for free, do it. Otherwise stay far, far away.
