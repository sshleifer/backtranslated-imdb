I was looking for ATTACK on 13th Street. There the film is SO memorable. Who is the star of this? Ethan Hawke or Matt Dillon (I can't tell who the lead actor is, this is quite an important point against the movie right here) her amazing body. It took me forever to finally realize that she is Joey's sister from Friends. I agree that the so-called special forces attacking the station are pretty crappy in terms of tactics. We were even taught better basic skills than this in basic RAF training. <br /> <br /> Avoid this, even the snow does not want to fall on a bus full of prisoners! Very bad continuity. <br /> <br /> Avoid the plague!
