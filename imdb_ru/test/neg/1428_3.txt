Strangeland is a terrible / technological thriller. Dee Snyder plays Carlton Hendrix, a hideous computer fan who prays to young girls through chat rooms. His ridiculous views on pain and suffering are erroneous and completely groundless. The ideas presented in this film have nothing to do with reality. Rather, it’s like Dee Snyder sat down and tried to come up with the strangest things to hit horror fans and perhaps some of his old fans, but the end result is just awful. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for me, as a horror fan, the cover of this film looks very good, and it immediately interested me, and this is the main reason that I was deceived and watched. I assure you, this is not a quality horror movie. This is a disturbing, but boring attempt to suggest what can happen in the minds of people who treat themselves the way Carlton Hendrix did in this film. The sad part is that no one does this stuff for themselves. Marilyn, hell, Manson doesn't even go that far, and the fact that he had a song on the soundtrack makes it clear that the film was not meant to ridicule his music (that would be a blow to Snyder himself). ), it’s more like Dee Snyder trying to rise from a dead career and re-imagine himself as a sick person. Dee, it seems the time has come to let it all die ...
