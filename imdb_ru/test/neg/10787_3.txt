I think the manuscript of this film was written on a piece of toilet paper. No respect for the many important details that essentially make the film. For example, the names of some Serbian terrorists (whom I remember) are Karadan Maldic, Ivanik Loyvek and Leo Hasse. What are these names? Of course, not Serbian! By the way, Karadan Maldik !!! What a name, I laughed all day, thinking about it. Probably, the consequences for Karadzic and MladiÄ‡. Secondly, there have never been cases of terrorism perpetrated by the Serbs. The journalist, as the main character, should have known this. Thirdly, the actors playing the Serbian terrorists are not even Serbs and do not speak Serbo-Croatian language. All this aside, this film is well played, but the story is thin and full of holes. Sometimes it makes no sense!
