I usually don’t watch Hollywood drops, but some friends and I were dragged in to see this one, which turned out to be funny in some places, but completely devoid of any originality. Don't worry, you don't have to think - the storyline, similar to Tarantino, leaves enough obvious hints that we can correctly predict where it will go about fifteen minutes before each “turn” - I sat there, worrying that the film was being built not bad for a Hollywood movie, but with no climax. And boy, my fears were realized - YMCA could not save it, but Liv Tyler almost saved. I suppose that being a man and I was in my twenties helped, but she showed a really good performance - obviously, she didn’t have to do anything except look completely amazingly sexy, but what she did, she did well! McCOOL'S will certainly not decline as one of the greatest successes of Hollywood (or should I say "should not"), because the dominant American film industry is nowhere to go now and at least for a decade, except for the strange beat like AMERICAN BEAUTY, TITANIC and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, and even they had serious drawbacks), but if you're a teenager, do yourself a favor and see, Liv - she's a hot chick. Rating: 5/10. See also: anything from Quentin Tarantino, any American teen movie for the past decade, anything with sex as the main selling point.
