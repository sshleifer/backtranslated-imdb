Imagine a film completely opposite to Lawrence of Arabia, instead of playing all the men, all the women in it. Instead of being established in the barren deserts of Arabia, it is set in the bulging capital of New York. And instead of being one of the greatest films ever made, it is one of the most senseless, boring, and forgettable films. <br /> <br /> The film tells about Mary Haynes (Meg Ryan), the ideal wife and mother, envy. of all others in her high society Manhattan social circle. She is depicted as a woman carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders, despite the fact that she needs a nanny and housewife life to cope with her one child. But I do not want to be too hard with her, Mary does all this, taking a close attention to the work on the design of clothes that her father gave her. This idyllic lifestyle cannot last forever, and everything starts to crumble in a very real way. <br /> <br /> Husband Mary cheats on her, and her father dismisses her for not working hard enough. She is quite naturally upset and breaks a little. <br /> <br /> Mary needs to recover, for the sake of her impressionable young daughter and for herself. She does this by rehabilitating, straightening her hair and creating her own clothing line; although surprising for such a film, not for editing. Mary succeeds; her daughter loves her, her mother loves her, her friends love her, and her husband decides that he loves her now. She decides to take her cheating husband back, realizing that it is her fault, that he had deceived, because she was not obsessed with him enough. <br /> <br /> The film that saves one highlight is that it does not go down the “all people are evil” route.
