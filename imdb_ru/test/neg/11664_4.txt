Everything that you do in this world should have at least some meaning. Unfortunately, very few “delusions” have any meaning. Jennifer Rubin is adequate in his role as the main compression killer Kyle Sikora. Secor on the other hand replays until irritation. Jim Metzler, yuppie predator is very incredible as a novice, seeking revenge, the enemy. When Jennifer Rubin returns the money she carefully hid, all authority flies out of the window, and the weapon indicating the final standoff between Secor and Metzler is ridiculous. Avoid “delusions” unless you are so delusional that you believe there are false positive reviews. - MERK
