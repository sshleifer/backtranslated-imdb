I remember watching channels on HBO and saw it. This, my friends, is one of the worst television movies I have ever seen. There is no excitement in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the fact that Drew Summers (Candace Cameron Bure) goes to a small town while in a trance. She lives with a couple who, by coincidence, has a daughter named Laura Fairgate, who looks exactly like her and is played by the same actress. Even the townspeople agree that they are similar to each other. The fact is that Laura was killed over a year ago. Her boyfriend went missing around the same time that she was killed, giving the impression that he had killed her. <br /> <br /> After settling in this city for a while, Drew begins to see visions and nightmares. These visions and nightmares can prove that Laura's boyfriend is not a killer, after all. Throughout the film, you learn that Ray Ordwell, Sr. (Denis Arndt) often raped and killed her. <br /> <br /> The film is too long and very boring. The film just stretches and so on and so forth. Surprisingly, after this movie “Cloned” in 1997, I saw another television movie that was good, but I will tell about it later. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 1 star out of 10. Avoid this television movie. It is not worth your time. This is the worst television film of 1997!
