This is not “so bad, this is good” - this is “so bad, this violates the prohibition of the Geneva Convention on cruel and unusual punishment”! Only after reading “Synopsis” you can understand the “plot” of this catastrophe “Directly on video”. This is a hodgepodge of grainy videos, glued together with the most terrible actors of all the time you have ever experienced. To compare this incompetent, inconspicuous, humorless mess with “The Dead do not wear a blanket” is like saying that “Gigli” is like “Citizen Kane”. The mediocre actors are dressed in cheap clothes by JK Penny "Goin 'to Church", and there are not the slightest attempts at hairstyles or make-up. If you really want to see how this kind of “respect” can work, see “The Lost Skeleton of Cadaver” - it's clever, well written, and best of all, performed by real actors who are not so painful for a watch. In this regard, look for the work of the artist Phoenix Paul Wilson, whose sci-fi short film "Attack of the 70-foot Lady Courtesy" leaves this film in the dust. People in “Horror in the Tropics” look and sound like they were removed from the street and given scripts for reading during the same take. This is an insult to Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, Lon Cheney and everyone who participated in the films they cannibalized to stage this festival of slokas! Money is not a problem - a lot can be done with minimal cost. A good script, decent actors and Z-Grade costumes and production design had to be given before the so-called director created this smelly bunch of cinematic by-products. Let's hope that the "promise" of the sequel will not come true - it was the scariest thing shown in the whole movie !!
