Swoon focuses on Leopold and Loeb's homosexual relationships - an aspect of the case that has been largely (and unfairly) ignored since their trial, even by Leopold himself in his autobiography. But even in his treatment of this swoon makes it far. Worse, he distorts, unites and directly changes the details of the case, which will annoy anyone who knows a lot about him, and at the same time has managed to confuse those who are not familiar with him. Although it is an interesting film, Swoon stinks. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 is terrible.
