My God, how bad it is. Who is this impostor pretending to be Ali G? Avoid this at all costs. He replaces the clever multi-layered satire and humor of his show on a toilet with a bad mood. <br /> <br /> This was obviously an attempt to show him in the States before he released his show there on HBO. <br /> One commentator here states that we do not judge the film on the merits of the show due to the difference in mediums. Although it is true that the standard format of the show could never be transferred to the big screen, Mr. Sasha Baron Cohen could have made reasonable use of his comic style in the more usual plot of the film. Instead, we have this mess, which, frankly, has nothing to do with Ali G, except for packaging. <br /> <br /> Terribly disappointing. Go and find the DVD from Innit, Aiiii or Bling Bling to find the real Ali G.
