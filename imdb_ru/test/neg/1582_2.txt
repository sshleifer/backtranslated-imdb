It's beyond me, why two million Danes sit down every week to watch this horrible show. The dialogue is terrible and unreal. The characters are empty and simplified. There is a tough man, a tough woman and a sensitive man. The authors actually say that they modeled the characters according to Greek mythology! Give me a break! All characters, of course, brilliant police. When I watched this show, I really wanted to see Hill Hill and NYPD Blue. These are brilliant shows, and Reyscholdet is a lousy copy. This program is a symptom of the disease that Danish television is currently suffering from.
