Of the several alternative titles in English, “The Sexorcist” is by far the most appropriate, since basically it’s just a shameless excerpt from the classic horror film by William Friedkin, in which they replaced 13-year-old Linda Blair, 19 she could freely show her amazing naked body. I'm not sure what exactly Satan is trying to do here, but he seems to have a young girl who can play with her sexually! Poor Danila is masturbating around the clock and trying to seduce priests and even her own father to have sex with her. A young girl imagines herself to be an intelligent and ambitious theological student with a strange-looking guy (driving a silly yellow car) and loving, although adulterous, parents. When she takes her particular crucifix home to repair, the ancient relic comes to life and no less than Satan himself (played by Ivan Rassimov from the "Jungle Holocaust" and "The Vampire Planet") begins to torment her. Too long masturbation sessions and some weird nightmares cover about three-quarters of the film, and finally, director Mario Harriazzo begins with actual exile. This last segment is even more embarrassing and amateurish! The priests actually do nothing, except to say some vague prayers, but for some reason Daniel seems cured suddenly. There is not much blood, the dialogues are terrible, and the producers seem to compensate for every little flaw, adding even more meanness! This is one of the strangest Italian exploitation attempts in the seventies (why the hell do they refer to Rocky Horror Show?), But definitely not one of the best. If you like The Exorcist clones, I recommend Demon Witch Child, Beyond the Door and The Antichrist.
