I watched this movie in a video last night and found that I was dozing off at this boring festival. First of all, one of my favorite blisters is when films like this are described as horror movies. This is a thriller! get it right! There are no monsters or anything supernatural in it. It's just a movie about a confused serial killer. (Actually, a very small number of corpses, so this is more like a movie about serial torturers, and he tortured me well.) The main premise of a person who lures teenagers into his home. Horror through online chat rooms could be a great movie, but we see him luring one couple of teenage girls over the Internet at the very beginning of the movie. One of these girls turns out to be the daughter of a local detective, and he is emotionally involved in the case. The film quickly turns from a potentially intelligent sadomasochistic thriller into a boring old cat-and-mouse game between the incredibly dull detective and the psychopathic captain Howdy / Carlton Hendrix, who was adequately played by writer / producer / frontman Twisted Sister, Di Snyder. Random attempts at significant poetic statements about the positive effects of pain and the like from Snyder are ridiculous. If he tries to get people to subscribe to these opinions with the help of this film, he fails and (inadvertently) covers them. The direction of John Piplow (whose only previous directorial effort was “Jurassic Women,” and I let the title speak for itself) was not inspiring, and there was something wrong with the editing, which led to the film being divided into several scenes, completely unrelated to the plot, unless the script is to blame (which is quite possible). This film is a completely unsuccessful thriller attempt that turns into a horror film, the only achievement of which made me squirm at the sight of several graphic piercings on my body. If you see this in your video store, do not waste your money, but if you need something to laugh at one night, and Strangeland on the cable, you can also watch. 3 out of 10
