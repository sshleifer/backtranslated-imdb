After reading the reviews, I was relieved to learn that I was not the only one who was very disappointed in this film! I'm a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks, read ALL of his books, most of them more than once. Of course, I loved the notebook and the walk to remember ... I have not yet seen the Message in a bottle or nights in Rodanthe, so I cannot comment on these ... <br /> <br /> But I did go see dear John last weekend and I was terribly upset! The film was not at all good! Looking at the movie alone and not thinking about the book at all, it was a terrible movie. I did not feel the surge and the range of emotions from this film, which I received from other films that I liked, especially The Notebook. I did not smile, did not laugh, did not cry, did not worry and was not afraid ... never! From the very beginning I could only notice how they changed everything! The only thing that looks like a book in this film is that there is a guy named John, who is in the army, and a girl named Savannah, who is not ... the part that his father is obsessed with coins is the only other the part that went along with the book. Everything else was completely off !!!! First of all, in the book, Allen was Tim's younger brother, NOT his son! WHY they had to change it, I do not understand. There was a lot more sense in how it happened in the book when Tim was a little older than Savannah, and they grew up together, and Allen inspired Savannah to want to work with horses and autistic children ... this did not happen in the movie .... ugh ... And in the book they spent much more time together than just those first 2 weeks and then 1 night ... why did they miss that time ??? I could go on and on, but then I would not have enough space! In general, if you are a big fan of Nicholas Sparks, do not waste your time or money on this film ... just read the book again ... because it is terrible and does not look like a book!
