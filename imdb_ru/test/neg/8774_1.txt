I waited a long time until I could see the movie "Lone Ranger". Today I finally saw him on the Lone Star channel and was very disappointed with the whole movie. Clayton Moore and John Hart acted better than Tony than the two stars in this film. Very bad acting was made by everyone in this film. Even the plot was bad and tedious. I believe that the horse portraying Silver was the best actor in this film. I am glad that I did not come out and did not buy a copy of this film when it just came out, since I feel that it is a waste of good money. I sincerely regret that the characters that Clayton Moore, John Hart and Jay Silverheads played and brought to life on the silver screen were so stained. If in the future they do not find actors worthy of portraying characters just like Clayton, John and Jay have done so well in the past, I wonâ€™t spend money buying a movie. I will no longer watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Wayne Davis
