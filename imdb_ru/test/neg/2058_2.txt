This movie is just crap, I can't say it any other way. From the very beginning it is known that it will be crap. <br /> <br /> History, dialogue, acting, special effects, make-up, almost everything sucks. I like movies about vampires, and I know that they will never be films that won an Oscar, but this film is not even worth watching, I can not believe how someone created this thing. <br /> <br /> It's not even about vampires, it's more about a dream / reality experience. The development of the film is incoherent, the motivation of the characters ... It does not exist, everything seems like a big joke. Maybe this is what they tried to do, but I sincerely doubt it. I wish I knew that they were trying to pull out, but it just turned out, this is definitely one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life (and I have seen many bad films, but nothing compared to this) do yourself a favor and not watch this. <br /> <br /> P.S. It is also full of cliches! Postscript 2 Bad script, bad direction, bad cinematography. Postscript 3 I bothered to comment on this as a service to all.
