I like the concept of CSI, but the show is spoiled by some serious wooden game. The Medical Examiner has the best lines and delivers them in a bend, arrogant manner that animates history. Unfortunately, he has little time on the screen. <br /> <br /> Also, why does George Fox always look and behave unhappily? I know that forensic investigation is a very serious matter, but the characters, for the most part, seem to confuse seriousness with insensitivity and complete lack of personality. I cannot imagine whether to meet with Sarah Sidle or Catherine Willows; what would you talk about? I wait for the episode when, at the end of the shift, Catherine takes the remote control, sends it to Grissom, closes it and rolls it into the cupboard until the next day.
