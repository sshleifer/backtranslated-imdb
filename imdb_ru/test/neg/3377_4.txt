Having already seen the original "Jack Frost", I never thought that "Jack Frost 2" would be as absurd as now. Boy I was wrong! On the other hand, A-PIX movies have a way to show incredibly bad material, even worse than you might expect. I believe this is the first sequel to A-PIX, and it may indicate what to expect in the future: more A-PIX sequels. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to watch without laughter, especially during the later parts of the film, in which the descendants of Jack Frost (who are essentially snowballs with eyes, hands, mouth and sharp teeth), start killing people with a typical comedic dialogue and stupid voices to go with him. They are shown as puppets (with a stick at the bottom to move them) and as computer animation, which, I must say, looks very silly. Computer animation surprised me, since the first "Jack Frost" had no such effects. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend that you see the original “Jack Frost” before seeing this (both of which it would be preferable to watch with a group of friends) to get full entertainment from it, and because it had it would make more sense (“meaning” is a relative term). <br /> <br /> Now, only if it was "Uncle Sam 2" ...
