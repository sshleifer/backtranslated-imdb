The plot: <br /> <br /> - a chair from EBay <br /> <br /> - random people <br /> <br /> - random people say (“Dude, that's right.” “I feel it. "Let's get married now!") <br /> <br /> - If you're a hippie, you will like this movie. (You must be tall or drunk, otherwise you will question your life while watching this junk. ) <br /> <br /> This film was clearly not thought out from beginning to end, and other comments are likely to complement the feedback team. If it wasn’t aimed at my demographics, I don’t know what this is about. found the plot every day boring This is what I would have done, and, believe me, you shouldn’t shoot. Going on a trip and taking half the silence, the film doesn’t work!
