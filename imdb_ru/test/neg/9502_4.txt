(There are only light spoilers) <br /> <br /> Sinatra's theft is a comedy with half a farce about the uninformed kidnappers, the ignorant victims and a few other side stories you can eat. <br /> br /> In this film you will see bad performances everywhere. Drama is forced, but humor does not make sense. Do you observe how the kidnappers threaten the victim who does not shut up, or the victim's father, who responds to the death threat of the criminal “Take care of tea?”, None of them is plausible. It quite comfortably fits into the “imitation film” category. <br /> <br /> You will also listen to a repeating silly musical composition in almost the entire film. This is quite unprofessional and adds nothing. In fact, this is just a sad attempt to make such a horribly unfunny movie somewhat witty. <br /> <br /> However, if you manage to look beyond all this and suspend distrust, an adequate plot can entertain you. <br /> <br /> I voted 4/10.
