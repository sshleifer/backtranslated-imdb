I was looking forward to the opportunity to spend part of my weekend on Independence Day, while watching a good film about Jefferson. This film was not that. It was quite a long time, stretched, sad and unbalanced. Too much time was spent exploring Jefferson’s relationship with Cosway, and not enough time was spent on his relationship with Sally Hemmings. The lady who played Sally, Tandy Newton, was absolutely terrible. Her game was so bad that it was like watching A1 try to read Shakespeare. Her constant whining voice tormented nerves! Nolte's accent made Jefferson sound like an ignorant person, not a genius. Jefferson’s relationship with his daughters and their feelings for slavery were also underdeveloped, but the rebellion of his older daughter (Patsy) was a key event at the end of the film. The film was too long, and the script lacked energy and excitement. On the other hand, the costumes were very beautiful, and Greta Scacchi played the role of Kosvey well. If you want to watch a film about the revolutionary era and / or Jefferson, then look in 1776, it is much better than Jefferson in Paris.
