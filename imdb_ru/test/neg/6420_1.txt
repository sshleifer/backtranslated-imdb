A few years ago, Sarah, a young girl, witnessed the murder of her parents; now, as an adult, she suffers from various mental illnesses (did I already mention that she has an imaginary friend?) This film puts the viewer to sleep, and not a feeling of stress, notice Rather a feeling of sleepiness. Fatally boring, it was difficult for me to sit, because I felt my eyelids getting harder and harder with every endless minute of meaningless chatter and supposed “secrets”. Is Sarah going crazy? or is it paranormal? The best question would be: who cares and no one has the answer to this. There is not anyone. Skip this movie, save time, suitable for other more important tasks. <br /> <br /> My rating: D-
