Bulletproof film is quite disposable. Where the bullets pierce the good guys and the bad guys are scattered all over the place, so much so that you really shouldn't see them as people. The yawns between the lines of Vayans and Sandler are really extensive. They try their best, but, alas and alas, the persona herself does not make a good film. Jimmy Kaan plays an elegant villain, but he always has this edge of the bushman at the ready. My favorite scene is repetitive fragments of television advertising, in which Kaan talks about the merits of America, showing the world 2 cars in each garage. In addition, this is a buddy film with a weapon for the brain. Go through this.
