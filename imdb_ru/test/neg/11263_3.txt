This is a bad movie. There is no denying this as much as I would like. Tommy Lee Jones copes as best as he can with the scenario they gave him, and he had some decent militants who seemed really irrelevant because of their acceptable quality. <br /> <br /> Somewhere nearby Someone thought that all the flaws of the scenario could be counteracted if they hired every working horse in the business, unfortunately, even really talented actors such as Goodman, Beatty, Sarsgaard, Gammon, Steenbergen, MacDonald, Pruitt Taylor Vince And so that we do not forget that Mr. Jones himself can not correct the wooden dialogue and build a story that did not lead to anything. <br /> <br /> In fact, at some point I looked up, confident that the film was preparing for only the last 2 hours, I found that it took me 51 minutes. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most painful moment in the film was the story of the ghostly soldiers of the Confederates, who seem to be of little help. story. Besides a little distracting from the confusing business at the end with the picture. * If you have not seen this film, not paying attention to this past statement, which may seem painful, and you know that this is not so, you will not understand it better after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing is that this film is a continuation of the film “Heavenly prisoners” with Alec Baldwin playing the main role in the same role that Tommy Lee Jones played in this film. Maybe I will have to watch it now, firstly, to see how bad it is, as in “Electric Fog”, and, secondly, because I cannot (no matter how hard I try) break my husband who is in love with Alec Baldwin.
