This film was bad. I believe that Elton (or this is Mike) Wong starred in this. In any case, it was Wong, who did not have that stupid smile and looks more angry. He plays a man who was hit on the head and he suffered brain damage. He is recovering and taking revenge. Gordon Liu is the only one worth seeing in this film, but he can do little. But due to the fact that he does little, others turn pale in comparison. In addition, there is some kind of stupid rubber hawk in the film, run by a Wong guy. This film is not worth renting or buying.
