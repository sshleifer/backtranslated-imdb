Crazy director .... Yes, you have to be crazy to make a movie nearby. Rob Lowe was bad in his character, Ice-t was always bad, and Bert Reynolds had nothing to do with the film. Crazy Six is ​​an unknown film, with some famous actors ... it's pretty weird. Bad movie with good actors. It seems that a bad movie had an impact on their performance ... It did! Crazy people ..... I give it * a half out of *****
