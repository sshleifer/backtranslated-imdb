G & M made a strange couple downstairs in Man About the House and continued to amuse the nation in their own sitcom. <br /> <br /> With the typical small personal charm of steam chemistry on a small screen, the G & M broadcast to the big screen was as terrible as Morcombe and Wise Genuis, and countless beautiful television shows. <br /> <br /> Not funny. Dissatisfied and showing a sick Yota Joyce, who died before the film was released.
