While in Madrid, I was able to see a modest copy of this film. Blimey! Gallo is amazing at this. He gives a very unusual performance. In addition to Gallo's genius, the film, however, is a boring film that I have ever seen in my life, and sometimes it is so poorly made that it borders on laughter. I am also a fan of Val Kilmer, so he was one of the reasons why I put so much effort into watching a movie. The problem is that Val is really only in one scene. Having his name in the title role is an insult to my mind and other actors. I have only seen the dead from directors of other films. Both films are far below average, but both contain very interesting Vincent Gallo performances. If you're a Gallo fan, like me, then watch this movie, no matter how bad it is. If you do not like Gallo, it means that ZERO left to love.
