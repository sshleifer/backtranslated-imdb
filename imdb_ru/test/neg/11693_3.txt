I'm a horror movie fan, no matter which hemisphere it is from. I know what to expect from the West, the East and most of the horrors in the middle. Thus, I received the Acacia DVD in this post and looked forward to the slow growth of ever-growing tensions and scary children with strange, scattered movements hiding under blankets. <br /> <br /> The main selling point of this film is that it has a much more linear storyline than many of it, you understand who the characters are, where they come from and what they do. You get basic information (a good couple, you can not have children) and you understand that the premise is too normal for something strange to NOT happen. <br /> <br /> And then comes bad. The number one complaint is that the story is obvious. I realized this at the moment when the child hugged the tree. I knew where the film was going, and even could predict the order of death and for what reason. <br /> <br /> Editing is shocking and, unfortunately, not in favor of the film. Even if I was still thinking about the events, the tension did not allow to build up, because the director seems to have received a new editing kit for his birthday and wanted to use it as much as possible. <br /> <br /> And my last grip is .... the tree was unnecessary. It would be a very good story about the subtle horror, when the couple was upset because of the death of the child - the title tree did not buy anything new or exciting in the film. So I’ll finish where I started - I got the general impression: “Oh.”
