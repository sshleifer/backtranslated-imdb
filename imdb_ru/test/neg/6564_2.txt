No one expects Star Trek movies to be high art, but fans expect the movie to be as good as some of the best episodes. Unfortunately, this film had a tangled, implausible plot that just made me cringe - this is by far the worst of nine (for now) films. Even the chance to see famous characters interact in another film cannot save this film, including stupid scenes with Kirk, Spock and McCoy in Yosemite. <br /> <br /> I would say that this film is not worth renting, and it is hardly worth watching, but for a true fan who needs to watch all the films, renting this film is the only way to see it - even cable channels avoid this movie.
