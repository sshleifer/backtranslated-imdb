I love watching Australian movies, but this steaming pile of crap was just embarrassing. The DVD cover looked promising, but you know what they say, don't judge the DVD by the cover. <br /> <br /> I also noticed that he received the award for the best male role, but the competition must have been really bad, because the acting in this film is pathetic. It just seemed like the director thought he had enough talent to lead and act when he really had to focus on one part of the film industry and do it right before it spread too thin. The music was pretty ordinary. The story really has not gone away. It was just a sequence of battles involving a bad script and a cheerful dialogue. <br /> <br /> I will say this to all novice directors. Watch this movie. This will give you hope that your film will win something at some festival. <br /> <br /> However, they are good to get there and try. Hope they learned some lessons, and their next venture will get a little better.
