I was once a big Olsen fan. I received this film when I was six years old, and I watched it almost continuously until I was nine years old. Then he lay on my shelf, gathering dust until yesterday. I stayed silent. <br /> <br /> Mary-Kate and Ashley play Ellie and Mel, two twelve-year-olds, who are sent for spring break to Paris with their grandfather-ambassador. Along the way, they meet, as one would expect, two cute French guys who show them a more cheerful side of Paris. I guess everything was fine with the two boys, except for fake French accents. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable, humor is petty and banal. Mary-Kate and Ashley play two little girls with too much makeup on their face. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie if you donâ€™t like the Olsen twins or family films.
