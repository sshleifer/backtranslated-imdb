I only saw this movie because Sophie Marceau. However, her acting ability is not enough to save this film. Almost all the actors play their character badly, with the exception of Sophie and Frederick. The plot can give the best film, if the right parts were in the right places. I have seen some good French films, but I donâ€™t like this one.
