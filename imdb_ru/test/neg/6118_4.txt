1993 was a time of change in WWE, but for this Restlemania they decided to turn back the time when Hulk Hogan returned with his good friend Brutus Beefkeyk, who was out of control after the paragliding accident in 1990. <br /> <br /> This was not a very good event. Only two matches had some kind of real build, and it all went off in a hurry. The action in the ring was not great, and the turn at the end, which I will discuss later, was not really a terrific moment when WWE hoped that this would happen. <br /> <br /> This unforgettable night began with Sean Michils defending his intercontinental championship against invincible Tatanka. Tatanka beat Michaels several times, leading the battle. Michaels got a new manager, Luna Vachon, and Tatanka was accompanied by former Michaels manager and the future WWE Hall of Fame Sherry Martel. Tatanka won the DQ. Michaels retained his title and returned to his feud with Marty Janetti, who was suspended only for Wrestling. Why, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> Then the Steiner Brothers (Scott and Rick) defeated the Hedgekivers (Samu and Fat) when Scott scored a pin after hitting Frankenstein herself. Good match. <br /> <br /> I think the clown needed the help of another clown to win him in the match with Krush. The second Doink distracts Crush when he is in full control of the situation, and allows Doink to get a pin and a win. Doink was a funny character who caught the trick and quickly grew old. <br /> <br /> Ramon Ramon easily defeated the returning Bob Blacklund in the next match. <br /> <br /> This leads us to the first in our double main event. As a megamaniacs team from Hulk Hogan and Brutus Bifcake, with the convert good guy Jimmy Hart in their corner, they met with former friends of Hart Money Inc (Ted DiBiaz and Irwin R. Schister). It was a rather sketchy end. Beefcake, as already mentioned, had an accident on a paraglider, requiring complete facial surgery, and fought with a match in a mask. Shister ripped off his mask and beat the steak with pulp. The judge fell, Hogan grabbed a mask and knocked out DiBize and Schister, and then Hart, dressed in a referee’s shirt, counted three. Another judge refused and reversed this decision, declaring the winners of Money Inc the winner of DQ. <br /> <br /> Next is Lex Luger or a narcissist who was also known when he defeated Mr. Perfect. This match took place due to the fact that Luger was managed by the old Perfect manager Bobby Hinan. It was ideal when he was chained to his feet, but the judge missed him. <br /> <br /> The Undertaker scored a weak DQ victory in a rather unfortunate match against Giant Gonzalez. The Undertaker earned the wrath of manager González Harvey Wippleman in 1992, and Tucker defeated his big monster Kamala in the Survivor series. Wippleman swore revenge and took him to Royal Rumble when Gonzales attacked Taker, which cost him a match. Gonzales dominated Undertaker in this match, but was DQ'd to suppress Taker with chloroform. It is strange to end in a bad match. <br /> <br /> This led us to our main event, since WWE champion Brett Hart, who for the first time received a serious champion title, put his title on the field with the unstoppable monster Fuji Yokosuna. Yokodzuna controlled the early movement, but Hart resisted and then took control. He had Yokozun in a sniper, he will probably give up, and Hart will become a heroic hero after the destruction of a large monster. But Fuji had other ideas: throwing salt in Hart's face, making the Canadian helpless when Yokodzuna got hit. <br /> <br /> What a bad ending. But wait here comes Hulk Hogan. He checks Hart to make sure he's fine. Suddenly Fuji immediately challenges Hogan to the WWE title. Hogan accepts. Fuji throws salt toward Hogan, but instead hits Yokozunu. Hogan hits his leg and wins the match and title. What did I just look? So, what most fans thought would be that night when we saw Hart assert himself as a gigantic killer, or Yokozuna would become an invincible monster, instead we saw how Hulk Hogan won a meaningless title gain. A title that he will not defend for three months. In fact, it was the only match in which Hogan fought for WWE before the King of the Ring PPV in June 1993.
