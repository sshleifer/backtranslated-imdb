This is a weak combination of almost everything: refugees, relations between Croatia and Slovenia, globalization, sexual orientation. A very big clumsy metaphor that Slovenia is at the crossroads between its past, which is symbolized by the fact that all the “virgin” becoming becomes the queen of the household and its future, which symbolizes listening to music in clubs, a lesbian and the absence of children. <br /> <br /> She plays on a rather recent Slovenian legend with the participation of the virgin and the “forest”. The “king” takes the form of a goat (the images of Zlatorg Bera are also based on this legend), but unfortunately the treatment is very inconsistent. Weiss seems to think that the end justifies the means: she can use all kinds of “dreams” and then choose which ones are true and which are imaginary. How can a jeep ride with a “forest king” be real for all three girls, but the scene outside the tent can only be real in imaginary Simone? The ending just drags on (I can't believe that the length of the film is only 98 minutes, I watched the director's film, not knowing about it?), When three girls looked at the camera for about 10 seconds, looking scared and happy at the same time (so obvious). <br /> <br /> I never thought that I could notice a bad game in a film, the language of which I don’t understand, but it didn’t take long for Simon to play most of the time, as if she was playing in a silent film. <br /> <br /> Everything was not so bad, because I continued to think that the director was just starting, and wanted to make what she was. I thought her generation was a movie, half experimental, until I understood, that the director was actually 37 years old when he was making a film, and that her work was probably “serious.”
