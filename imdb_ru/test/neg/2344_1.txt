I watched this film on Telly that night, and little did I know what a terrible holiday it would be ... I knew it would be stupid, but not so bad! This film illustrates everything that is terrible in the Australian comedy. In addition to the most tedious, boring scenarios and characters I've ever come across (except for those dubious French comedies that taxed in American!), Most of the situations were boring, incredible, stereotypical and so not funny just ... terrible! <br /> <br /> One such scenario that really annoyed me was nerds on the bus scene. From the point of view of the script, the scriptwriters used the most uninteresting — not to mention the incredible — scenario for these three to be stranded without baggage ... They are on vacation of their life and are going to risk it all (including $ 300). bail, luggage and room) to exercise your rights to dance on the bus? I mean, they are about half an hour from the destination! At least they could get the bus driver to drive them out, but no, they voluntarily leave because “they can’t take him anymore!” And destroy their holidays ... In any case, I cannot believe that the authors did not teach this Awful script. I think a ten-year-old child can come up with 5 installations that are smarter, more amusing and believable. <br /> <br /> I can continue with many others - a truly unimaginable stereotypical psychopath, a whole relationship with a furious evil girlfriend and mark the virgin, “Wow! Over there, goth, breathes things in the train - EVERYTHING was just awful! I can't come up with one feature of this film, except that maybe the third wheel nerd was pretty sweet. Spoiled his career by appearing in this trash can!
