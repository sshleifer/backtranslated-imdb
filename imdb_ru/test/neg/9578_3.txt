They call this movie "the horror of the euro trash." <br /> <br /> Well, it's not terrible. The action of the film takes place in Europe, so yes, it is “Euro”. Trash? Oh yeah, it's rubbish, it's all right. <br /> <br /> You know that a great movie is waiting for you when, at the very beginning, the DVD gives you the text on the screen, apologizing for the quality of the text you print. going to watch. Expect a crash, strange sharp cuts, and the film does not fit on the screen. Plus there is a sound - at first I thought that I was watching a dubbed movie. Then, carefully watching my lips, I realized that there was no, the fact is that the sound quality is terribly bad and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> The plot itself is pretty dumb - an old, disfigured woman named Dr. Bannister kills a scientist for his formula for youth. I will not give much, because when you see the "old woman", it becomes quite obvious that she is under a layer of thick, poorly applied cosmetics. Anyone with a sense of humor, seeing a fake old age, knows what will happen next. <br /> <br /> Yes, the “old old woman” miraculously turns into a beautiful young woman - complete with makeup for the face and a long hair wig! Sounds! <br /> <br /> When I say that the old woman is disfigured, I mean that corn flakes are glued to her face. The film is not trying to explain how corn flakes got there. In this regard, there is no attempt to explain anything at all about any of the characters. They never develop above the level of puppets. <br /> <br /> Two policemen stalking our anti-heroine just wander, obviously bewildered by the simplest evidence. The murdered scientist worked on the youth serum, the old woman disappeared, and we continue to encounter a young woman - how do these pieces fit together? What does all of this mean?! One of the policemen is sweating heavily and stroking his face with a cloth. The other is smoking a pipe. This is almost all we get, by nature. <br /> <br /> Dr. Bannister (old woman, now beautiful) walks in strange costumes and then takes them off so that we can see her flesh. She has business with men. She enters into a fight with a young woman in a nightgown. She is going to Geneva so we can see the lake there. She rides a little water skiing, then removes her wetsuit to show off a strange bikini-curtain of beads. She again takes off her clothes in a strange striptease ninja. <br /> <br /> End? Well, without giving anything away, this is just a strange conclusion, made just as little as the rest of the picture. A writer encounters such things when the director wakes him up at 4 am and says: “Quickly! We need an end for our movie! What will happen next? ”<br /> <br /> The author mutters half-woke up and the director runs with him. <br /> <br /> What's good about this movie? Some music is hiking and fun. This classical organ music of the 60s is so banal that it is enough to make you laugh out loud. There are several strange scenes of seduction, strange dialogue, silly moments. <br /> <br /> This is very close to being bad, this is good. I managed to observe it from beginning to end, without throwing out my eyes and not sobbing. I suppose that is some kind of praise.
