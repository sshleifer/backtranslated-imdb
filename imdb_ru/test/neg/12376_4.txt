I saw this movie when I was about 12 years old when it came out. I remember that the most terrible scene was a big bird, eating people helplessly hanging from parachutes from the air. Horror. Horror. <br /> <br /> When I was a little kid going to these funny B films on Saturdays, I was still tired of the formula for these kind of monster films, which usually depicted a hero, a beautiful woman, who is the daughter of a professor happy decision when the monster died eventually. I was not very worried about the romantic views of a 12-year-old child and predictable plots. I love them now for the unintended humor. <br /> <br /> But about a year later I saw Psycho when it came out, and I liked that the star, Janet Lee, was injured at the beginning of the film, I sat down and noticed at that moment. As the writers make up a story, make it as scary as possible, and not from a worn formula. There are no rules.
