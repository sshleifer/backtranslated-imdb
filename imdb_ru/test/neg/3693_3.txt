The plot in this film is very thin, and there is little acting in it. Val Kilmer — I don't know why he agreed to make this film — plays a minor role as a gang leader. In short, watching a movie is boring. <br /> <br /> One guy who looks like a professor of archeology / religion explores the underground region of Moscow, whose history is connected with the construction of the railway and the Bolsheviks revolution. In this story, the tragedy of the church makes the study "spiritual", and the spirit of evil intent pursues underground ruins. A friend of the professor decides to find his friend in the underground and hires a couple of Russian guides. The whole film is based on this plot and contains many repetitions of the underground and some camera effects; very similar to what can be seen in the Day Watch, Night Watch, etc.
