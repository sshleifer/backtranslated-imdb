I love these horrible films about the 80s summer camp. The best part about "Party Camp" is that there is literally no plot. He just dumps a weak party of "characters" in the location, and then things sometimes happen. The cliché is limitless here (SPOILERS): botanists against athletes, a secret chamber in the dressing room for girls, tourists found in a nudist colony, a contest in custody, secretly excited camp administrators and embarrassing stupidity insinuation is littered everywhere. The only missing cliché is Cory Feldman’s presence. This movie will make you laugh, but never intentionally. I repeat, NEVER. Last note, be prepared to break the gut, watching the nonsense, which is the "dramatic" scene, where Jerry Riviera and D.A. share a beer late in the evening, spilling guts to each other. The dialogue literally does not make sense, and acting belongs to high school. This is a classic.
