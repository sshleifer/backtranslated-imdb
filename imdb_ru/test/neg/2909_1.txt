And I can be generous. The vast majority of the film consists of looped videos ... a trembling monster, two women involved in sports, again a monstrous monster, a group of people in the pool, again a trembling monster, and no worse to wear, despite injuries ... you get a picture. I didn’t allow myself to shout “GET IT ALREADY” several times. <br /> <br /> And this does not help the fact that the footage was poorly prepared. The sound does not match the synchronization with the image. And in one scene, where they tried to show “artistry” with the help of lighting and camera methods, a guy with a flashlight that provides the only lighting of the scene is clearly visible on the frame. <br /> <br /> My hope is that the production was the victim of some terrible catastrophe, during which the original soundtrack and most of the footage were destroyed, but they decided to release it anyway, gathering together with the installation floor, in memory of the heroic members of the team, gave their lives trying to save * a real * movie - with a plot and an interesting dialogue. Unfortunately, there is no evidence of this, and I have to conclude that, according to the immortal words of Joel and Bots, they simply did not care. <br /> <br />
