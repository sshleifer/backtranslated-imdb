Stanley Kubrick, the director, whom I highly appreciate for his masterpieces (“A Clockwork Orange”, 2001, “Murder, Radiance”, “Doctor Strangelove”, etc.) pulled the film out of circulation, leaving it only for hardcore. fans and finalists. Having seen the movie for myself, I understood why. At the age of 24, Kubrick already honed his photography skills for LOOK magazine and made several short documentaries. Like many novice directors who came decades after him, his desire for “Fear and Desire” was, in general, just to go and make a movie, cheaply, more than likely, to see if he could do it . At this level, he was successful. However, the film itself is definitely not. <br /> <br /> I can’t say that the film failed because there was something in it that I liked. Even when the story of the film went into the background, and the actors (which Kubrick had no idea how to direct, not being a man of the theater), his dexterity in creating and shooting some great images gets his seeds in this film. From time to time, there is several close-ups and quick shots in the waiting / action scenes that attract attention. Unfortunately, this is all good that I can say about the film. Although the film has a couple of “named” actors (Frank Slivera, who also appeared in The Killer's Kiss, and Paul Mazursky, the director himself), the performances are generally boring and very routine. <br /> <Actually, for me this is the main death of the film; whenever I watch a Kubrick film, even his early films about the movie Kiss and Kill, I can tell who did it, because his style had become clear by that time that would continue as he developed as an artist . It was not “pretentious”, as I could imagine (which usually happens with such new directors like Scorsese and Spielberg), but watching this film not only seemed like it was not Kubrick, but also very At that time I was watching some film of category B (or even C) of the director, who at that time forgot - not quite “Ed Wood”, bad, but close. The music is as standard as possible, the attenuation is pedestrian, and the plot doesn't seem to attract as much attention. <br /> <br /> In short, as others have said, and with which I can agree, this is a “drawing pad” for the future novice, which shows several pictures and several edits that attract some attention (the best scene in general, when soldiers take a stupid girl hostage), but not enough to truly recommend, except to those I, who ultimately see everything that Kubrick does (or perhaps every military film ever made ultra-low budget), at least out of curiosity.
