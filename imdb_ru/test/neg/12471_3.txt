"Pie" is a good illustration of old Berra's yoga, saying: "If you don’t know where you are going, you will probably find yourself in another place." Writer / director Christina Way (in her first role) managed to make a film for 3 million dollars, which ultimately will be in another place. “Pie” is either a story of adulthood, in which there are no characters that a rational person can communicate with, a black comedy without humor, or a film about sexual exploitation without anything especially sexual. <br /> <br /> Unlike the standard In the movie Swain's “Pie,” a literate and experienced producer actually worked. Good enough to make two very good shots: Swain and Barton taking a bubble bath and Swain in the park showing a nice montage of the Alice in Wonderland sculpture. The symbolism inherent in these elements confirms the possibility that Way (despite the absence of linear logic or unity of tone) really possesses some far-sighted talent and the desire to make a quality film. <br /> <br /> It is even possible that Way tried to combine several expressionistic Metropolitan and camp classics Brutal Intentions, which also deal with the upper class of Manhattan. There are many cameras framed by windows and doors, but few narrow shots of faces and eyes. The first technique hints at symbolism, and the second at deliberate distancing from the characters and their motivation. The Pie seemed to be on the verge of deviating from the camp’s territory at least twice, and it would have been nice to keep going in that direction. First there was the scene where they are trying to throw the apparently deceased Swain into the garbage disposal. In addition, the fact of the matter is that her father was Jewish (he played to the same extent as Joel Gray, who danced with a Jewish partisan in the Cabaret). <br /> <br /> In her other films, Swain’s acting technique is to suppress every scene in which she appears (insert a chewing scene here), but in Pie she actually shows an ability to restrain herself. This is the best performance in her career. It also gives some clues about her physical deterioration from the willow super-sweet in The Girl to the hulking, lumpy face in The Pumpkin. This transformation was almost half complete by the time she made Pie; so go destroy time. <br /> <br /> Mischa Barton (“The Sixth Sense,” I Feel Better, Girl) and Lacey Shabet, they play great roles. The rest of the cast is terrible, although some of the blame for this should go according to the script and instructions from Way.
