In 1904, Tangier, a rich American woman and her two children, were abducted by Berbers, murderous desert pirates, who despise the Moroccan government and thereby kidnapped “American seasickness”, which attracts the attention of US President Theodore Roosevelt. The fictional historical epic is not so much a grandiose adventure, as a peculiar, somewhat exhaustive return to the films about the desert-sheikh of the 1940s (besides, with the addition of a small amount of "The King and Me"). Depicting a hidden, mustache, bloodthirsty leader and his arrogant, arrogant captive, Sean Connery and Candace Bergen could play in two completely different films (neither of them seems to know how far to carry away the elements of the camp of their characters and dialogue, and both seem unusually without the right direction). The various (and anonymous) cuts and beheadings that take place are arbitrary: we don’t know any of these victims, and the big fighting scenes become blurred, noisy montages of sand-blown horse riding. Pros: Jerry Goldsmith's highly acclaimed musical score (nominated for Oscar, but lost to John Williams' Jaws), beautiful filming and cinematography. * 1/2 of ****
