** of **** stars <br /> <br /> Let's see ... 14 divided by 20 times the square root of 13 is 23, which was my late grandmother’s favorite number and the year of her birth, 23 minutes after the 23rd hour. Assign a number in any way that you choose, and the company will be very scared. Be extremely scared when you add a mentally retarded fool to go with 23, and you have Schumacher's last attempt at a dark unknown festival with The Number 23. Oh yes, 23 is also my entry in Cuervo footage during my favorite dive at 23- I'm a street in the 23rd state of the state. <br /> <br /> Kerry brings the movie to the middle, and then we lose sight of it, not caring about it. Don't look for any crazy expressions from comedian Kerry, as you saw in Mask and Me, Yourself and Irene. Not. And do not expect the character to translate, as he did with Andy Kaufman. This role is the sad and peculiar transfer of Jimbo. Where is Riddler when you need him! I know we don't need him. Virginia Madsen, as usual, is underestimated as a supportive, speculative and peculiar wife. Her talent, like Kerry’s, is depressed, and it is almost painful to watch her try to save her underdeveloped character from near-anonymity. <br /> <br /> In order to pay tribute, in “Number 23” there are several interesting scenes in which very sly cinematography is shown. They are arresting enough on their own, without being entangled in the rambling narrative of this stupid story. <br /> <br /> I don’t know about you (and I understand that this is a work of absolute fiction), but I don’t know anyone who often reads his novel in a damp dark basement or regularly spends time at cemeteries like Kerry in this movie. Schumacher keeps his film dark, blood red, gloomy, rainy and smoggy, gloomy, rainy and dank, and so on and so forth, from beginning to end. Even the Flatliners and The Lost Boys had a little more daylight, and we are talking about medical students who are obsessed with death, and about teenage vampires! <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, even if it’s not just curiosity ... make sure you do it while enjoying about 23 cat flies, so you can kill 23 birds with one stone.
