Being a former MST3k supervisor, even I found this film inaccessible for viewing. Terrible attempts at humor - terrible attempts at acting. No one needs to read the guarantor about this piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> I just like how all the positive reviews were clearly written by the crew or family friends. Just click on their other reviews and wow - they all review Modern Vampires. Give me a couple bucks and I can make a movie better than that. One of the most incompetent works of cinema I have ever seen, and that says something. Take a look at your own risk. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0/10
