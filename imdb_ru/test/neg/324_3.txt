In Halloween, three friends are looking for a fun ancient cemetery in the suburbs and remove the cross from the tomb where Jack-O was buried many years ago by farmer Arthur Kelly. The evil creature is unleashed, kills the trio and seeks the descendants of the Kelly family for revenge. <br /> <br /> A shoddy "Jack-O" is a combination of a terrible story with a terrible game. I was curious to know the name of John Carradine in the credits, and I can not imagine how a relative allows to use the footage in such a bad film, showing complete disrespect for the name of this great actor. It is impressive how bad the acting is, transferring the film to a comedy instead of the proposed horror genre. This is a type of film that is pleasant to watch among friends, drink beer, comment and laugh a lot. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): â€œJack-o ?? Demonio before Halloween "(" Jack-O ?? Halloween Demon ")
