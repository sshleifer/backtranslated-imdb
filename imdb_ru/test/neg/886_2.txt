Wow. Not because of the 3D images that were used from time to time to provide good deep images, but what a bad ending! It seems the end of the film just exploded. This film should be one of the most stupid movie monsters ever and one of the most pitiful attempts to explain it. Misogyny of this film is also painful. If you are looking for a bad science fiction film from the 50s that you can laugh at (it's a bot feed), do it. Otherwise, look for the best movies.
