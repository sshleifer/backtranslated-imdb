Not as bad as Billy Bathgate, but close. No matter how hard you try, Warren Beatty just could not be considered Bugsy. Whenever he left, instead of being shocked by the violence, I found it rather embarrassing, because it was so fake. Other actors also do not live. Annette Bening simply does not have what it takes to play seductive women; she is better off with safe characters. As many have noted, Joe Mantegna would be better if in the script he was more believable by George Raft. Only Harvey Keitel remained unscathed, but again this guy can shoot these films in a dream. And Robert Beltran, with one line, steals one of Beatty's big scenes, Bening. With these films, Iâ€™m never sure if the director intends to make the bandits look like ordinary businessmen, or it just happens. In any case, I do not like it. These guys were killers, and no matter how much Las Vegas is in debt to Bugsy Siegel, I don't think there should be a film that glorifies the guy, especially a film with great studio support.
