It looked cool on the cover of the film, but after five minutes we were not sure that it was a homosexual documentary with a western history without any female interest. The quality of the film was poor, and there was hardly enough fighting between gangs to keep the interest of even the most drunk person long enough to watch the entire movie. May God have mercy on the souls of both the actors and the directors who are responsible for what I can call only my new and only reason for which I never want to see (or trust) the Australian film again. I have to write more, so I’ll say again that the actors were so bad that I’m sure I could have made a better film with fifteen dollars and a box of Trojans. Please do not watch this movie for your own sake.
