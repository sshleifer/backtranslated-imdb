Such a BS movie. It's just some stupid anti-Russian propaganda, with an absolutely clear story, not related to the book. <br /> <br /> It seems that the film crew received from the people who ordered the film more money than they could ever get from the sale of the film. The plot of the film includes links to some of the real recent events in Russia and other parts of Eastern Europe, but sets them out in a way that has nothing to do with reality. It seems that the film is a brainwashing tool that helps to portray Russia as a place inhabited by evil people who always dream of killing someone. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are hundreds of silly mistakes, such as using the USSR map instead of Russia when publishing news, demonstrating a crowd with Ukrainian flags and commenting on elections in Russia, etc. <br /> There are also many strange episodes (that is, the character runs across Red Square in Moscow, and in a second he is in the center of Sofia, Bulgaria).
