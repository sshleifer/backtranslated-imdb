Just awful. It’s almost incredible that the characters and situations provided by Dashil Hammett can turn out to be such an unceremonious, passionless confusion. But this television for you - filler between advertising. The first warning signal sounds because of the fussiness of recreating the period, which screams "1928" in the form of a banner. Flivvers and touring cars, fedoras and vests, Cloches and Speakeasy jazz (playing a joke) - with all the attention paid to senseless, tricky details, important questions are ignored. <br /> <br /> Like clarity of storytelling or credibility or proper spelling and action. The plot establishes one of Hammett's operatives ("Hamilton Nash", so, regardless of whether his name is "Ham" or "Nash", we think of "Hammett" or "Dash") investigating the bogus diamond theft. Thus, a young woman is introduced who allegedly carries Dane’s curse (the mediocre and mediocre Nancy Addison, who returned to the soap where she belonged); she belongs to the religious cult of psychos, led by Gene Simmons, and seems also to be addicted to “drugs”; there is also a mysterious gaseous drug that penetrates the rooms ... <br /> <br /> But this is enough. A letter is never more pedestrian than when it reaches out to be poetic or stilted, and the actors scare it in the only way they can: grotesquely replaying. Simmons is treated like the petty kings of Old Hollywood, but the grand lady does not bathe. For some reason, Hector Elizondo uses the second billing (after Coburn) for the mandatory part. Other familiar faces drift, bringing little benefit to their resumes. <br /> <br /> Actors don't even take pictures to look good; Jason Miller is especially scary, but Coburn's extreme closeups are also ruthless. Coburn probably coped with this role, because with a mustache, he strongly resembles Hammett. He needs more guidance than this; no one gave him a vague hint of how to play his character, or on the tone of the plot, or on how the different threads of the plot fit together (at least in this story). Thus, he highlights his big smile of the Cheshire Cat, regardless of whether he is in demand or not. <br /> <br /> Dane’s Curse is available on video tape of various lengths. For those who are foolish enough to “see for themselves,” the shortest abbreviation is the kindest of all.
