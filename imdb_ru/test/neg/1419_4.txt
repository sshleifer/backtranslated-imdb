I saw this movie on Saturday in a matinee with a friend. The theater was about 70% full. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that there are quite a lot of funny lines here, this is more of a drama / tension with humor sprinkled on top. Robin Williams gives a decent performance, as does Laura Linney. Being a fan of the Daily Show, Lewis Black is very good at it. Christopher Walken also gives good results. <br /> <br /> The film begins slowly and lasts for about the first thirty minutes, then the tense part begins and begins to annoy you a little throughout the film. Suspension in prospective comedy film? I know that I, like everyone else, have struggled a bit with this. The character will joke during an unknown sequence, and you will hear one or two laughs in the theater. <br /> <br /> Honestly, after the film ended, applause rang out. So, definitely, some people liked this movie. <br /> <br /> I gave this film four out of ten, because I think that the comedic aspect does not work very well in an unknown / dramatic film and acting. albeit not bad, just decent. <br /> <br /> Again, this film is not the one that was advertised.
