Let me start by saying that I never wanted to watch this movie; I had to watch it once, and I thought that I could light it up and enjoy what I had, and it might be interesting. What I got with this expectation was one of the worst films I've ever seen, without exception. First of all, there was nothing funny about it. The creators expected humor to be ridiculous / tolerable if they include sarcasm in every line coming from the Underdog mouth, and use the scene after the scene sluggishly, playing aspects to “charm” the audience with a carefree side, while making them "" And "ah" for more, with boring action scenes and tasteless, dull actions that made me want to scream at everyone in the audience who enjoyed it. The action was boring, the humor was tedious, and the characters / plot felt they had spent around 10 minutes and the creation of his whole personality, which didn’t give the boring actors / actresses any idea how to portray their heroes. This film is simple and just awful in every area, and in fact only children under the age of 10 can enjoy it, , despite what age range he was directed to, does not justify him at all because he is so weak-minded and I feel so repentant. Parents, spend your money on Up, Wall-E, The Spiderwick Chronicles, The Water Horse or Hotel for Dogs for a better, recent family / children's movie, or sales f on Alvin and the Chipmunks is better than this dirt!
