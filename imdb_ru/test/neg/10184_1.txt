Films about U.F.O. - it's always a good way to kill time, so on a rainy Sunday evening I made this film, waiting for what to expect from direct video on DVD U.F.O. secret. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong! About halfway through the film, it becomes very obvious that U.F.O. A theme is a deceptive way to attract unsuspecting viewers to this Christian propaganda. And this is not just a film about Christians from an ordinary Christian. No, this is Christianity of an extremist fundamentalist sense. Scary look. <br /> <br /> At the end of this film, non-believing leaders cheat on their colleagues using a practical joke, thinking that the Rapture began (which Christians consider to be happening). at the end of time, when true believers are going to heaven, and unbelievers are left behind. <br /> <br /> When a joke is explained, it is assumed that it is always better to become a true believer. ‚Äù just in case, we Christians are right. " If you ask me, this is the worst reason to become a Christian! <br /> <br /> This film is still trying to convert non-believers using scare tactics. "Believe in God, or you will go to hell!" This message here. Simple, but pretty annoying. Especially since this film is sold as something completely different. <br /> <br /> Now let's assume that you yourself are a Christian fundamentalist and it is unlikely that you will be offended by the themes of this film, is this a good movie? I'm afraid not. No, in fact, I'm lying: I'm glad, it is not so! The action is terrible, the pacing is terrible, the plot is terrible, especially the ending is ridiculously bad. As soon as the film starts, you will immediately feel that it will be worse than you expected, and you will be right. <br /> <br /> In the first half hour, at least, an attempt to set up a tolerable UFO secret, but suddenly they introduce into it a double counterpart, who begins to talk about the devil. At first you just think that this dude is just a crazy maniac, but as it turned out, he actually represents the real views of the creators of this film. As soon as you begin to understand this, you know how it will end. But in fact, everything ends worse. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
