Thank God, this has not been extended by ITV. <br /> <br /> This series, although popular (God knows why), is very simple: “Look, I found another body behind flowers / bushes / trees / wherever they work - for the sixteenth time the story of this series . The dialogue is so simple, as if it was written for children - he talks to the viewer and explains each plot. <br /> <br /> They just “get close” when someone does something unusual - and no one notices them. <br /> <br /> Every time they study and investigate someone's murder, they interfere with everything else - they ruin the lives of everyone - including the completely innocent. <br /> <br /> They break down and enter people's homes, steal objects and evidence (even firearms), are curious and penetrate people's lives, watch them and look at their things. They never apologize, never get captured and not arrested (and if they do, they can dissuade themselves, even if another character who does the same thing goes to jail !!!). <br /> <br /> They always come up with trumps. Now I know that this is a quiet series, but I think that in fact it should not have gone through the first few episodes! Simply put, it is unreal. <br /> <br /> I think they have found enough bodies in the thickets here and on the continent (where they are once every two weeks), so I hope that he will never return. <br /> ITV should get some action on the screen, instead of humming all the years - a TV series like "someone was killed at a village fair - again."
