After the suicide of his father Charlie Kid Davis (Ray 'Boom Boom' Mancini) accepts the invitation and advice of his friend Tini (Michael Chiklis) and goes to Las Vegas with him, trying to become a boxer. On the way, they meet Gina's hitchhiker (Jennifer Beals), they drive her up and she becomes Charlie's girlfriend. Johnny Ticotin (Rod Steiger) is convinced that Tini is Charlie's couch, and influential agent Alex Dumas (Joe Mantegna), watching his fight, becomes his manager, contributing to Charlie's career. This film is so boring that it really does not deserve to write about it a lot of time. I don't like boxing, but sometimes I watch some decent movie on this topic. But this is terrible! Predictable, full of clich√©, with a terrible lead actor, a waste of time. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Corpo e Alma" ("Body and Soul").
