many people said that it was a great movie in which Hoffman showed a great performance. I moved from suspended disbelief, to fussy boredom, to almost exit. there are none. <br /> <br /> Hoffman is doing his best. he is committed to performance. but sometimes the way he plays the injured person looks like an amazed actor chewing on the scenery. <br /> <br /> no characters in the film, except for the hood, are much more than fillers - Nell, Jack, Perry, Sean, the sheriff are all one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film demonstrates the manipulative, clean and dishonest sides of the hood. it shows them so many times that I start to wonder why the directors think that we need to state everything? and again? and again? This often refers to the genius of the hood, but does not show it. it shows him surrounded by fans and flatterers, but he never convinces us why. <br /> <br /> but my goal is not to deconstruct the film. I'm sure others will have other interpretations. for me it was a two-hour film that looked like five.
