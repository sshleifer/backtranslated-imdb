This typically overly simplistic and idiotic Stephen King film takes an eternity to finally get out of the starting blocks. About half an hour is spent on unnecessary acquaintances with various boring characters and their insignificant personal problems that may excite bored housewives and apathetic pensioners in soap dramas, but this should be a horror genre (or so naively I thought). A fool cannot look so scary, which Leonard Maltin would not have agreed with, a deliberately senseless / hopeless and always-smiling film critic: he considers Kujга “truly frightening.” (I often wonder if Maltin is really fat — or just loves to do favors to his Hollywood friends ...) It is illogical and inconsistent as Wallace survives the attack only with a leg injury. And, of course, her car fails precisely when she needs her to save her life: this is one of the oldest horror movie clichés; Trust the king to use it with minimal effect. The premise is banal, too banal even for a horror movie: a mad fool attacks a family. This is it? Such things barely make up the 3-minute relief story in your regular zombie movie. I think even Kujё must have felt that he was playing the main role in the turkey. Fools have horrible agents ... But what I really don't understand is how can people rush into the book "Cujo" and read it from cover to cover? These SK fans must be immortal: this is the only explanation, that is, why they regard time as such a meaningless commodity. <br /> <br /> Bodycount: 3.
