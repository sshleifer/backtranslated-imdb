This is one of those movies that you watch because itâ€™s bad. Such a film that you watch, just to see how this shitty mastery. Presumably, the horror, I can not imagine how someone can be afraid of clay errors, especially translucent in nature, where you can see the legs of the actor. <br /> <br /> A little without a budget, a little attention to detail, and even an attempt to make this film believable - would have sucked the pleasure out of it, because they would have to replace all the actors and the whole story with this. If I had nothing to laugh at during the game, I would stop it after 10 minutes and make some kind of quality show, such as Spunge Bob Square Pants (HAR HAR HAR). <br /> <br /> I highly recommend that Brett Piper get Quintin Terrantino and really pump out some feces. <br /> <br /> :)
