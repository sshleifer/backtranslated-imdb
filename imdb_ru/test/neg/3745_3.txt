Unfortunately, many other detractors of this film are influenced by previous biases. (that is, being angry at gay characters, thinking that French thrillers are bad, etc.) I admit that I am not familiar with the novel, but like the movie, after about 45 minutes I rolled my eyes. I hope I can eloquently state my complaints in writing before I get bored of spending more time on this film during the two hours of its duration. (2 hours, which looked like 3), don’t get me wrong, I can sit an hour with a half silent films, three-hour epics, I don’t have short attention span, nor am I so shocked by the mtv generation that I can’t appreciate the thin and slowly building a film. here goes my shopping list of complaints. first, the end. yes, he had a scooby-d-esquire, the character explains everything at the end. now I really think that for this film it was necessary ... there were so many plot twists, emotional revelations, new facts that could be found and found ... one reviewer said it well: "... yes, this is very logical history, but without a very significant background (their children's stories, the relationship between the three parents, the relationship between two birds in love and the son of Big Man), it just does not feel right. I felt deceived, "I won" I can not add too much here sing Lera, I can name specific revelations that, in my opinion, were unnecessary, but according to the reviews here, there are a lot of people who seem to really love this, so I don’t want to give anything away. Personally, I hate soap operas. , and turns, for me, extinguished ANY influence that the final revelations could give.In the end, I didn’t care! There were no gaping holes in the plot; it seems that it can make a great book, in LETTER it is completely logical, but if I have to believe that it is REALITY, then then something is wrong with the fragments that have been accidentally inserted. all too often, I felt that important characters that we could never recognize were added to further complicate the plot, amplify emotions, and uncover the mystery. I didn’t have any complaints about acting, yes, not bad, but the plot, and especially its development, is INTENTIONALLY not enough. sorry to those who felt that it was a perfect thriller, but I could not get into it. I gave it 3 simply because I do not want to seem completely unfair, and he had moments of easy intrigue and excitement. <br /> <br /> * THE BASIC SPOILER * and I should mention this ... but when the father makes his revelation to Alexander and JUST, when you think that the plot cannot fit in another turn ... "your father is not did not die in a hunting accident "... I ALMOST DIED! .. When did a father ever develop or even mention a lot in history? !! are you serious!! as already difficult storyline with the participation of characters from all families and their relationship to each other was not enough !! Does the main character NEED another emotional cry more than he has already fed ?! I'm sorry, I had to add such a spoiler, but it bothered me as much as ANY film bothered me.
