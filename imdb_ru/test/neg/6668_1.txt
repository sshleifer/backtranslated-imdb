I felt I should have added a comment after seeing another comment with bated breath. My unsuspecting parents took me to see this film as a child, waiting for the normal comedy "Norman Wisdom." Instead, you get this tasteless British sex comedy of the worst type, where Norman (Norman!) Plays a swinger, trying to get as many “birds” as possible. Absolutely typical of the genre - poorly filmed and filmed, not like the script for the worst kind of double meaning, and very vague hints of "prank". And all this is similar to the special reserve of granular films, which is reserved for British low-budget films of the 1960s - 1970s. The only memorable thing is the annoying catchy melody of the theme, which still pops up in my brain in over 30 years. <br /> <br /> Finally, in the last scene, you can also see a naked Norman running around in the sand and looking frozen. In any case, I think so - at that moment my mother pulled me out of the cinema. I saw it again, many years later, and guess what, it was still terrible. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan or are interested in a little man and his career, you will apply the 10 foot Barge rule to this. Believe me, you don't need to see the opposite side of Norman Wisdom.
