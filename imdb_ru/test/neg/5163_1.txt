What was the purpose here ... I started to look at it, but then I realized that he had no goal ... bad game ... no action and no story ... I finished listening to it while I was surfing the web reading about David Beckhamâ€™s $ 250 million American football galaxy contract. Do not rent this. Do not lend it DO NOT DOWNLOAD. I have seen so many films that I felt it would be crap from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> War films must be accurate and, if possible, have some artistic significance and do not actually feel like a Christian melodrama ... This film fades compared to any I have seen before. I have to say that I am really disappointed with this film ..
