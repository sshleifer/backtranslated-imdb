A remake of a successful movie can be, at best, a difficult affair; remaking a real classic, especially one that really is the final film of a director such as Alfred Hitchcock, is something else again. And after watching this version of Psycho, directed by Gus Van Sant, two things immediately come to mind: what's the point, and what did they think about? Especially in light of the fact that Van Sant used the same script (Joseph Stefano, taken from the novel by Robert Bloch) that Hitchcock used. The final result here highlights some of the subtleties of the art of filmmaking: first, the "remake" should be just that; re-equipment of the original, not “copying” using new players; and secondly, that color photography, the use of more blood and a little more graphics, distracts a little from the effects of the film. Although it was a noble effort by Van Sant, ironically, in the end, he suffers from the same flaw that Norma Bates suffered: the “mind” of the film was divided; half was Hitchcock, half was Van Sant. And, despite the fact that they met, they will never be connected. Van Sant, even working on the original script, would have been better off making his own film - all over - instead of trying to exactly repeat what Hitchcock did with certain scenes. For example, the first frame of the film, and especially the “soul” scene, is perhaps one of the most famous scenes in film history. I am copying Hitchcock, from shots, looking directly at the shower head to the drain, and using the same “scree”! skree! skree! sound effects - even as a tribute to Hitchcock - again, just distracted from the story. And, if you take into account the performance of William H. Macy (as Private Eye Arbogast), you will have another split in the psyche of the film. Macy is a terrific actor, one of the best characters in the business, and his performance is excellent here; but no matter how good it is, attitude and delivery are pure David Mamet (with whom he worked many times), and seemingly out of context with what Van Sant does. Thus, the film ends with a triple personality disorder: Hitchcock, Van Sant and Mamet. I felt that I was watching The Psychological Games of the House of Goodwill. <br /> <br /> With regard to the performances, Macy's was just as solid as them, and Anne Heche (Marion Crane) did a good job creating the original character, avoiding an attempt to imitate Janet Lee. The weak links were Viggo Mortensen (Sam), who made the boy Marion so clever and unattractive that it made him wonder why she even had something to do with him; and Vince Vaughn, who, if you can say so delicately, was just as terrible as Norman Bates. His entire performance was an actor playing a role (and not very convincingly); the effect on the feminine manners and the accentuation of his speech by “spontaneous” bursts of manic laughter made him Norman rather a caricature than a character, generally unbelievable and pretentious. This gave the film a feeling of re-creating the “True Incident” that you will see in a television show; it would be entirely in keeping with the film’s meaning to cut off from Norman, sitting alone in his living room, before a sober-faced Peter Graves shot, saying: “That was the mood of Norman Bates regarding this fateful rainy night when Marion Crane left the of his car and entered his life: “Starring Julianne Moore (Leela), Robert Forster (Dr. Simon), Philip Baker Hall (Sheriff Al Chambers), Ann Heini (Mrs. Chambers) Chad Everett (Tom Cassidy), Rans Howard (Meister Lowry), Rita Wilson (Caroline), James Remar (Pa Trullman) and James LeGros (Charlie Car Dealer). Van Psycho's “Psycho” is nothing more than curiosity, which shows that having a good director, mostly an excellent composition and a script that is a proven product, does not necessarily guarantee success. Of course, today's psychotic era, “American Psycho” and Hannibal Lecter, to some extent, drifted away from a character like Norman Bates; but in this particular story about the relationship between Norman, his mother and his victims, there is still a special intimacy that will forever remain alarming and terrifying; but Van Sant can not convey this feeling of fear, this throat fear with this film. If a movie has ever been made that should have been highlighted right on the video, then this is it. Even better, if he had never been born. I rate it 2/10
