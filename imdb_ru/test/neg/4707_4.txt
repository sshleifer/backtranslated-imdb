I just finish watching Goliath waiting for what I ordered in my library. I vaguely remembered it many years ago and wanted to see it with my son. In any case, the film lasted less than 2 hours, and I thought that it was much longer when I first saw it. On the back of the VHS box, it is indicated that Goliath "throws out a Nazi file, the secrets of which can destroy the free world forever." Divers allegedly performed a covert mission to retrieve a demonic document. On the receipt of this document is not even mentioned. It is also written on the box that “the insatiable boiler of the beast ship feeds on human blood.” It would make this horror film, and nothing was said about it in the film. I can't remember the details when I watched it many years ago on TV ... but can the back of this box really be true? Maybe the 3-hour film showed more details? <br /> <br /> Just wondering, does anyone know anything about this.
