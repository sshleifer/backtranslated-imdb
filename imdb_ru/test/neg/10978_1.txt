It was difficult for me to take care of these characters, who were either annoying or tasteless, all living in their incredibly fun urban life. <br /> <br /> At times the dialogue was painful, and in other cases the narration seemed difficult to understand - was it me or whole scenes that were deleted? <br /> <br /> It felt like a bad comedy movie had somehow turned into a movie. Stereotypes and jokes about “male groups” would probably be funny in the early 90s. In fact, this is where most of the film’s humor comes from - and boy, he quickly gets old. <br /> <br /> Aside from the attractive Irish - this film was stupid. And not even "so bad, it's good." The last 20 minutes were especially painful. Maybe if you have never met gays before or have never thought about homosexuality, then this film can say something meaningful. Otherwise - dear, you still do not need to rent The Boys in The Band or Beautiful Thing.
