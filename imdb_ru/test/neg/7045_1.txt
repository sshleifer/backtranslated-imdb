Can you believe that a college professor made this film ????? <br /> <br /> The same person who made the DHOOP movie <br /> <br /> A terrible movie that has some weird scenes that have ever been. /> <br /> The main message is nice, but poorly presented <br /> <br /> The film looks like a collage of amateur scenes, miscasts.etc and bad performances <br /> <br /> Direction and all that Poor <br /> <br /> The music is in order <br /> <br /> Emraanâ€™s naughty series works, and he is doing well. Tussar bad Tanushri and Isha bad Paresh annoying when looking in the mirror
