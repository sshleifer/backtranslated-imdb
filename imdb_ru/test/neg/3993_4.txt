I have always watched the efforts of the Italian horror maestro Dario Argento as a producer with a certain suspicion, and they were confirmed only after my recent viewing of the terrible DEMONS Lamberto Bava (1985); the fact that it should have been his third release did not sound promising, but I decided to rent the movie, despite the fact that we are in full swing of Halloween. Did I check the Anchor Bay's theater trailer before watching the main function ?? which undoubtedly the striking visuals made me intrigued to be sure, but that the film itself (which makes no more sense than what is presented in this frantic two minutes of editing and, looking back, you can see that reasonably composed most of his highlights) proved a certain disappointment! <br /> <br /> Opening a fairly promising medieval prologue straight from Alexander Nevsky (1938), he quickly goes down because he relies too much on surrealistic images at the expense of the narration.

You see! In the end, the film is even more disappointing (although the terrible effects of Sergio Stivaletti are at least noticeable), considering that I fully enjoyed the only other title Soavi that I watched ??
