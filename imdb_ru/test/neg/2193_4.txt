Now I have seen two films directed by Chen Cage, very good (Goodbye, my concubine), and this bad one, the Murderer. Both films tell about the most important events in the history of China: FMC in the 20th century and TA - the first unification of the entire Chinese nation in the 3rd century BC. FMC does well with memorable characters, great cinematography, compelling scenery, good acting and an interesting story. The assassin fails at almost every level (well, the sets are great, the cinematography is good, and several battle scenes are pretty exciting). But ... pathos. Call me a cynic, but too much is too much. If you felt that “Saving Private Ryan” was too pathetic, know that it will make you sick. The dialogue is lifeless, many lines seem to be political statements, elusive or entertaining, is this photo not so. The film is obsessed with its bombast. I'm really surprised that Killer gets such high voices here on IMDB. 4/10
