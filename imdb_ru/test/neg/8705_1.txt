I appreciate the efforts that filmmakers wanted to portray the story of Moses and the exodus of Israel, and that the film helps viewers put themselves in the place of Moses and get an idea of ​​the heavy burden on Moses' shoulders. As much as I did not want to watch this film, I was very disappointed with the plot. (In this review, I will omit the videography, special effects, and artistic abilities.) What is most disappointing is the historical inaccuracy of this film and its difference from the historical descriptions from biblical texts. One of the comprehensive principles of the Bible is that * God * brought His people out of Egypt, and He promised that he would take them to the land where milk and honey flow. He not only made this promise, but also led His people to a cloudy pillar by day and a pillar of fire by night. He never left them; He was always seen by the Israelites. The film, however, portrays God, who remains silent throughout the journey through the desert. This film has changed the nature and theme of the biblical text and instead depicts God as a silent, cruel, disciplinary void. <br /> <br /> Also, the description of Moses was just as wrong. Moses was known as a believer (otherwise he would have been such a father in Israel throughout the Old and New Testaments, even if Moses is known as a man of great faith). Nevertheless, the film portrays him as a pragmatic, evil, insecure loner, who despises the vocation that God has endowed in his life. Well, I will allow creators the freedom of creation in the story of Exodus ... but it is beyond creation — this is heresy.
