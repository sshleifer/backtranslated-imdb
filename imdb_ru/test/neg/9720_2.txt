The story was fragmented, the acting was not one of those calliburs that could be decomposed. More serial pilot than a real movie. I wanted this film to be liked, but I just could not find anything like it in it. Whatever it did to make the Lost Boys so cute, there was clearly not here. Alto tried it. Hooks for the plot were clumsily placed among what could be an episode of the Dawson Creek with dark clothes, and the storyline soon went nowhere. Very disappointing me. The final scenes were special effects, controlled by convenience, and how the villain of this story planned his whole scheme ... who he (or she) tries to deceive, to talk about the naive. Stick to movies of this genre since the eighties, when they had more ideas.
