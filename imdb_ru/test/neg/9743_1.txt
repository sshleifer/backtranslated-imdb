I vaguely remember this movie. I remember this for one good reason, that this is the only film I ever went on !! and since then I have never seen it available for rent anywhere! I can't spoil it for anyone because I barely remember it !! If you think about it, looking at the cast, he seemed to be the winner under the direction of John Landis, but, my God, they must have paid a lot for this nonsense !! All I can remember is that Dad goes missing, and the family is trying to find it, trying to insert a real photo into the computer's drive. I got out in about half an hour of this. I have to admit though, I would like to see if I can get a copy, just to see if it was really that bad! <br /> <br /> I won’t be surprised if it’s against the black background of every actor’s list! I mean, what was Christopher Lee in this ?? Legend of all the bad guys who were in Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings ?? As I already said - black list movies, Fools!
