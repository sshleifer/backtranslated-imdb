Personally, I have no problems with either the acting or the script. I have a problem with a giant bird. It was just awful. Simple and clear. <br /> <br /> The first impulse is laughter around when you see it. What were they thinking about? Budget damn it. The monster bird was a monstrous joke. <br /> <br /> Of course, in my opinion, if producers could get actors like Ankrum, Corday and Morrow, then they would have a special effect that people would come up with a much better beast. Well. What is done is done. It will be a case of an eternal joke on them, which was unintentional.
