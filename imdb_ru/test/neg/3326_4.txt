I thought this film was too absurd for me to finish watching it. The premise was too stupid and predictable. I did not make it far to the cinema. <br /> <br /> Let me see. She is clearly older than the taxi driver (unless she is much younger than she looks). He is black and she is white. She makes more money than he (he's just a taxi driver). These are 3 of the most statistically failing unions of society, they are all united into one, and we must pretend that they have a chance in hell. She would be better off marrying a boy she doesn’t love. <br /> <br /> I only watched it partially, because I love MJW as an actor. His game was excellent. Her, IU! It was good, but the premise is too stupid. I did not see the end. I couldn’t do it there, so I don’t know if it ended differently than I had predicted that there would be an ending. I can't imagine some black woman who loves this film. There is something nasty when I watch a dark-skinned man who treats such a white woman. And old in it. YOU ARE WELCOME! Not in the real world!
