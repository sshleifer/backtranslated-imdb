I LOVE Sandra Bullock — she’s one of my all-time favorite actresses — but this is the film she had to pay a long time ago to be a trash can. I understand that she is almost 20 years old, but my dead grandmother can act better than these people. Beware - it doesn't even cost WalMart to stand for $ 5.50 ... You know that when the game stinks so bad that it doesn't even cost a couple of bucks - the sound quality is terrible - there are no hidden credits to even hear the disgusting dialogue, it looks like it was shot with a budget of $ 1.98. I thought I would see Sandra in an early role to see how she became an actress, but YIKES is too kind a word to use ...
