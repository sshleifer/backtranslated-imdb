My friends and I watched it so many times that I lost count. It’s worth seeing to those who are in the right mood, which means that it’s not so much a good horror movie as a movie to use its funny quotes and bad effects. This film is best to watch along with other like-minded people, so you have something to laugh about. <br /> <br /> You will laugh when Greg jumps and shuffles around the lab, caressing his beloved rabbit, and his hunchback moves to the right to leave on his back. “Greg, stop fooling around!”, Dr. Brandon scolds. You will laugh like J.G. Patterson signals his hand to direct Greg to the other side of the operating table while his hand is in the frame. And you will probably laugh when you realize that the last woman does not have a single trait that he used to build it.
