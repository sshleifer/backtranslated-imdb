It sounded so promising at the box office, the room sounded great, and I couldn't wait to go home and see it. It was Apolling, “The Diologue is Terrible,” “The Action is Extremely Poorly Written,” and the plot takes a dive from the very beginning. Gutenberg poses a pitiful idea, Sean Bean tries his best, but with such a bad scenario he could do little. <br /> <br /> It's not even worth watching, even if you can get it for free (borrow it, for example, from a friend) Do not regret it and spend 90 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> 0/10
