This is completely different from the WWF and WWF “This Position”. I have always been a loyal fan of WWF and have never seen its competitors. Now I regret the day when I wanted WWF to take responsibility. At the very least, WCW will always try something new and radical, instead of supporting the real intentions of the show as a mask, and this is true for ECW. WWF has always been dedicated to Hulk Hogan, Andre Giant and other such old fighters, and the “Era of Relationships” only accidentally caught up with radical ideas of competition. WWE is the same rubbish it was before the Age of Relations only stalled and demoralized. The wrestlers are terrible, the split of the brand is a mental struggle, and the plot lines and conditions are absent. WWE is so bad that it ceases to be even the former shell, suddenly pushing characters and fighters to the main event and retaining the barriers to creativity. Undoubtedly, the show shocks the brains of cute, innocent and easily washed children's brains and meager, lousy, outcasts, stupid people from the Internet struggle community who really see the company as something good. Anyone who even shudders and relies on the idea that this show and product is good can go straight to hell.
