It seems that whenever the main film company wants to make films for teenagers, it concentrates on only one thing: sex. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a bigot, but the fact that these people seem to think that getting rid of my stones is all that interests me is very disappointing. “Take the Covenant,” a film that so relies on the fact that you find the main characters attractive, he thinks he can leave without a plot and / or script that was not written by a six-year-old child. This is essentially The Craft with (presumably) hot guys. And yes, that's all. I'm bored to tears. Even my friend, who usually takes us off the shit, hated it. This is really amazingly bad, to such an extent that it can be funny. I would have laughed if it were not for the fact that several women who visited the movie seemed to like it. They were accompanied by several excited guys who confidently curled up and died when (really cliche) the boy kissing the boy happened closer to the end. Watching their meanders was really the highlight of the film. I don’t think that the mainstream, Hollywood cinema will ever produce good films for teenagers (or, in general, for everyone), so I think I’ll give up. Unless you're a teenager who likes The Pussycat Dolls, you think Paris Hilton is hot and watching MTV, it's like some kind of wasteland. Life is hard when you're fifteen, and you like art house. :( PS Someone had to tell the director that not all teenage girls think that they are members of the group "absolutely HOLE LOL !!! 111 !!"
