Whatever it takes, this is a pretty decent cartoon Road Runner, albeit a bit short (just under 6 minutes). The gags are, at best, adequate, the animation is literate, and the new, restored DVD master looks good. However, this quality ends. Let me give you a little background: in 1958, thanks to a labor dispute, the World Bank took possession of a bunch of canned music to be used in 6 cartoons of the year. <br /> <br /> There is only one phrase to describe the music of this short plot, and that “it has 4Kids sound”. I use this phrase to describe music that is completely inconsistent with the action on the screen, and it seems that it was recorded by an orchestra consisting of members of the Sonic Youth cover band. The music in this short film seems hopelessly tied and incredibly unpleasant, especially when you consider that in this short film there are scenes (namely, a piano trap) that would work best with virtually no music. <br /> <br /> I didn’t do this I think that the WB cartoon will be destroyed by terrible music (even Lava’s scores aren’t so nasty), but considering that the cartoon isn’t so remarkable, in any case, to watch with music it almost hurts. This is similar to how the Doctor Who episodes could still be bad in the late 80s, yet still become invisible thanks to Keff McCulloch’s incredibly awful music (it sounded like he was pressing the demo button on all 5 of his Casio keyboards) . <br /> <br /> I’m going to ask people to call me crazy because of this, but I’ll easily see one of Larriva’s cartoons about this. At least the canned music was usually synchronized with the action on those.
