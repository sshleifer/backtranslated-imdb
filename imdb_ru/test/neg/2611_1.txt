This film may have been the first Puppet Master, but it must have bothered me to death, when I saw this stupid film, I wanted a refund. It was a bad show for the Puppet Master, and I’m sure that I’m not the only one who thinks it's terrible. For some, it was great, but for others it was a ticket to a snoring person, and they are right. Dolls did not do anything and did not kill people. People should not see him, so I warn you not to see him. You will be disappointed even by fans who love Puppet Master, it was a waste of time and did not bring so much money. No one even got a kill, except for one or two, very pointless. <br /> <br /> 1/10
