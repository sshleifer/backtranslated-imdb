When I first saw the preview of this movie on TV, I thought it might be a funny movie. I was wrong. Although I am not entirely against films that make fun of others. Some of them are actually funny, such as the first scary movie. This was one of many that have been made recently that are not. The humor in this film was not at all ridiculous and rather boring. <br /> <br /> I feel that one of the biggest problems is that they made fun of many films, such as Varsity Blues, Friday Night Lights, Stick it, etc. And if you look like me, you're trying to choose each movie, and not pay attention to what is happening in this. Even the adult humor in this film was dry. Do yourself a favor and save your money and time, and do not rent this movie
