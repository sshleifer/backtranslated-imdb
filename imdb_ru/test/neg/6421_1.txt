Oh my God! This film should have a new classification on the cover of “watch only if you have nothing more to do!”. I'm sad. I was looking forward to a good horror movie on the weekend ... I needed an adrenaline rush, and this amazing tingling sensation felt through my spine. But this film did not. Pretty good story, but pretty awful game, dialogue and shooting. It was incoherent and sometimes just silly. We had actors who were looking in the wrong direction of the camera, people were talking loudly (by themselves) and telling what they felt and what was going to happen, equipment shadows on some frames, stupid cliches like “I just need you to hold me” in completely wrong places and situations. Thank you for allowing me to unload and sorry if I offended someone, but it was a waste of time and money.
