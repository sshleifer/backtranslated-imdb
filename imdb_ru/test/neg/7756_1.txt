The only thing I regret is that IMDb cannot evaluate a movie from 0. “Sina ...” definitely deserves it! At least. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER? * The film begins with a group of people entering a crypt to wake an ancient vampire. When a guy cuts himself, and his blood drips and falls on the putrid and dried corpse, which is supposed to be a bloodsucker, a metamorphosis occurs, and a vampire with an ANIMATION effect (you believe in it!) uniform, only to show that he wears a tuxedo and bow tie! Yes Yes. Red, if memory serves me right! I tried to check random scenes by skipping a bit, but it didn't work out better than the initial sequences. At that moment I turned off the movie, cursing him for making me hope to see a movie about vampires. This, of course, is not one, if you are not 5 years old, and you can be serious about such nonsense. <br /> <br /> So, if you like vampires and you do not want to be disgusted or even disgusted, take lessons from my mistake and understand, did not even try to see this garbage!
