Six stars for the image of Paul Newman Paul Groves, negative four for the inclusion of an extremely fictional event, where the truth is well documented. Michael Merriman was not really there. His character - or at least his fate - is largely based on the character of Louis Slotin, a Canadian physicist who came to Los Alamos only after the war. He conducted his deadly experiment “Dragon Tail” in May 1946. This is a critical moment. The effects of hard radiation on the human body were not known until they were observed in victims of the explosions in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. If someone died of radiation poisoning in Los Alamos before being tested in Trinity, it is possible that scientists would suddenly stop their work and history would change. For better or for worse, we can only guess. Someone has to ask the producers and the director if they have added a Merriman character for a dramatic effect or for an anti-nuclear message. For a more impartial and accurate description of the events in Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project, watch the television film First Day or, even better, read the book by Peter Weiden on which it is based.
