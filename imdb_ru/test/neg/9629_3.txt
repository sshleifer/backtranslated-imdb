So many people loved this movie, but there are some of us IMDb reviewers who find Mirrormask painfully inconvenient to watch and bored up the ass. I get to the last of these two camps and try to explain what so unpleasantly twisted my nails. <br /> <br /> First, to set the record straight - I like the books of Neil Gaiman. I sometimes find him knowledgeable, sarcastic, “screaming aside” humor a bit defiant, and I actually prefer his work when he plays it straight and leaves the joke alone - but, even with his occasional setbacks in foolish jokes, “Papa “I can find something special in his creativity and imagination. <br /> <br /> It is interesting that one of the strongest works of Guyman - “Gorald” - is “Goral fairy tale for children”, in which there are very few jokes and a lot of tension and eeriness. His latest novel (“Anansi Boys”) overdone the fun and sometimes reads how Terry Pratchett performs The Sisters of Charity (not the nuns, but the band). The mirror mask dwells in a territory similar to Coraline, and when I saw stunning visual effects in the trailer, I was a little excited that someone had managed to transfer Guyman’s spectacular vision and imagination to the screen. <br /> <br /> In praise for the film, some episodes really look amazing. However, visual effects are sometimes destroyed by CGI-animation, which looks like a student project Media Studies. Backgrounds and landscapes are often incredible, but some character animations look awkward, amateur and cheap. In the early sequence of dreams, the spider is beautifully animated, but the cat-beast that eats the book looks badly drawn and very computer-generated. Compared with the standard animation, such as "The Bride of the Corpse", Mirrormask sometimes looks really very amateur. However, in defense of Mirrormask, the budget was so tiny for such a grand vision, and several squeaks in effects can be understood and forgiven. <br /> <br /> What cannot be forgiven is a swaggering, prim, deft and pretentious dialogue. Actors desperately struggle with dialogue - and there are so many of them that they constantly get in the way and stumble. The conversation seems completely unnatural, the jokes are not solved again and again, and the unsightly speeches seem to the writer to be the only method of narration. Combined with the fact that the actors are working against the blue screen (which always adds the element of "Ghost Threat") - this makes the film almost imperceptible. In such unrealistic conditions, actors need to work twice as hard to believe, and basically they fail terribly. The girl who plays the main role, valiantly fights the impossible dialogue between the school and sometimes shows real promises, but this is never enough. The terrible cod "Oirish" of Valentine’s character (with which she is forced to spend an inordinate amount of screen time) pays any chance to this young actress to rise above the material. Looks like Valentine's work is to explain the plot to young viewers and add a bit of light relief. Personally, I would not want him next to my 15-year-old daughter. <br /> <br /> What else is wrong with this movie? The answer is .... Rob Bridon. What annoys (for us, the British, anyway), we know that Rob Bridon can act! We saw how he held the screen for half an hour on his own (makes these monologues "Marion and Jeff"), and in the first episode of the film "in the real world" he is fine. However, put him on a blue screen, and he will lose all sense of character and turn into the worst person I've seen in recent years. This shame. <br /> <br /> What else is wrong? Answer ... a stinky percussion, a sub-Courtney Pine saxophone and an inaudible, too high in the mix soundtrack that never stops. God, the music is continuous, loud, distracting, irrelevant, and, if that's not enough, it has a stinking, weak bass. This complicates the dialogue, but it can be a hidden blessing. <br /> <br /> What else is wrong with him? Answer .... Artist with a whistle. In modern society there should be no place for pantomime, except for some secret places in France. Every moment when the camera lingers on a nagging, whistling, moss-juggling, idiot-weaving yoghurt, I understand why the people of Edinburgh are getting a little agitated and restless when the festival time comes again. <br /> <br /> My last criticism is that the film is pretty boring. Surrealism is often boring ?? it either requires his audience to plunge into a fabulous, Zen, receiving state, or the audience is constantly surprised by more and more unexpected surprises. A story with a small number of topics in which the characters participate, in which we could believe and which could be taken care of, would greatly contribute to giving this film an emotional center, which, unfortunately, was not enough for him, and at the same time not allowing lower eyelids. <br /> <br /> Finally, apologies to all who have found depth, meaning and surprise in this film. You managed to suspend your disbelief, you saw behind the squeaky CGI, ignored the crappy dialogue and terrible ideas that, as a result, realized the great, creative vision of the creator. I wanted to, but I could not see the past flaws of the real world that pulled him down. <br /> <br /> I hope Neil Guyman gets it right the next time if he gets (or even wants) an opportunity.
