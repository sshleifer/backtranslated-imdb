Well, each in its own way, but I thought that Gibson’s “Hamlet” was the most horrendous performance I've ever seen ... a subtle touch like a paper bag, and as inspiring as a telemarketing call. The only reason I watched the movie to the end was because I had a hope that it would either get better or be unintentionally funny. Bad luck. <br /> <br /> There is no disrespect to the auxiliary composition or to the formulation of Zefferelli, but nothing can compensate for the confusion of the protagonist. I saw Hamlet, who was well portrayed as an African prince, as a lively lion, a rough warrior, a romantic poet, etc. And so on. And so on. But IMHO this image was just an abundance of mind along with most of the weak ham.
