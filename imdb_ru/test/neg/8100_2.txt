Bela Lugosi is a real mystery. In the early 1930s, he was on top of the world after appearing in Dracula. And yet he made lousy decisions about his career again and again. Maybe he had a bad agent, maybe his use of alcohol and drugs was involved, or maybe he just lost his mind. Despite this, he ruined his reputation by appearing in almost any film, from excellent horror films (such as THE RAVEN) to high-budget films (for example, NINOTCHKA) to Z-class films for the cheapest and worst studios. Interestingly, although he agreed to make this terrible film, he actually abandoned the role that Boris Karloff would later play in FRANKENSTEIN! As for this film, this is a very stupid, horribly shot propaganda film of the Second World War, which featured stupid stories and poor editing. Lugosi spends most of the film killing saboteurs - not bad at all. But in the end we learn that he himself is a Nazi plastic surgeon, and all the Americans he killed were actually Japanese !!!! The funniest part of this is during the flashback. You see Lugosi talking to a group of Japanese men before he changes them to men who look like Americans. When the camera scans them, the men are clearly Asian. But in all the other pictures taken not close ups, they all look VERY Western - many with a bald head !! They looked absolutely NOTHING like Japanese men. I suspect the plot should have been rewritten, and this would explain the obvious mistake. Or it may just be substandard production values ​​and editing. In fact, at the beginning of the film they show a street scene in the city, and all the cars (circa 1942) are old T Ford models - obviously, from the screenshots !!! The bottom line is that the film is bad, but very boring. Unlike PLAN 9 FROM EXTERNAL SPACE, it is difficult to laugh at this ineptitude - just put it to sleep.
