Let me first state that I rarely review films, I comment only if I am shocked or disappointed that, in my opinion, it will be good. Killshot was a big disappointment on many levels. The script was terrible, the acting was poor-quality (especially because of the heavyweights such as Rourke and Lane), and the editing and effects were ridiculous (car explosions, etc.). Rosario Dawson had a terrible role, I can't. I believe that even accept it, it was such an abuse of her talent that I can't even put it into words. I should have known after I saw the trailer for this film 3 years ago, and he was always on the shelf, that it was a serious problem with this film .......... In the film, all the way .. . ...... do not worry if you are really bored ........
