Today's film was the film “The Legend of Surama Fortress”, and in 87 minutes of work he managed to quickly get into the top five of my most difficult films of all time. It is difficult to watch; the films are so different from everything else that you see something completely alien. A brief overview will be as follows: a group of Georgians are trying to build a fortress to protect themselves from invaders, but every time they are going to put the final touches, for no apparent reason, it collapses. Therefore, they go and see a fortune-teller, who advises them that if they want the fortress to remain standing, they need to find a young man, a tall blond blue-eyed boy, who will be buried in one of the walls during construction and his presence. will ensure that construction work will be completed smoothly. And, of course, in these final moments, he is happy to cover him with cement and eggs, giggle while he is buried alive, and only his mother grieves. <br /> <br /> This is actually a pretty simple story. But director Sergo Paradzhanov, who worked in Soviet Georgia in 1984, shortly after completing a fifteen-year prison sentence, does not follow any of the filmmaking rules to which we are accustomed. There are very few close-ups. Very often, the action we have to follow is hidden in the lower left corner of the landscape shot, which is easy to miss. There are very few big plans, and sometimes it is difficult to say who does what and why. From time to time, the film is shot in retreats that are not related to the main plot and, as a rule, confuse the viewer. The music is completely crazy, with the found sounds, on-screen instruments and church organ, apparently casually peeking. At times, when it seems that nothing is happening, someone breaks into a jig, almost playing time, until the next scene appears. But, unfortunately, behind all this there is an obvious cinematic voice, so you have to try to understand the message, whatever it may be. One of those times when your eyes are focused on the screen simply because you can not believe what you see.
