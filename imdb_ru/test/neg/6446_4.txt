My 15-year-old daughter asked me to watch this movie with her on cable television. As a person who saw "Revenge of the nerds" in the cinema, I found this film an extremely predictable remake. The nerds were simply replaced by Dorx. I drove her crazy with the fact that I could accurately predict what would happen in each scene. The cast was cute, especially Amanda Bynes. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter Chad Chrysi should be ashamed of having written such an obvious remake of the film of the early 1980s. The name was supposed to be simply “Revenge of the Fools”. Perhaps the sequel will be Revenge Dorks 2.
