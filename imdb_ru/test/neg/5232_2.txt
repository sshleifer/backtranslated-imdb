Needful Things was one of my favorite books by Stephen King. But this film is one of the worst books on the film version I've ever seen; they changed so many things that it made me sick. Even the notion that the book is deceptive, things that do not always resemble what they resemble throughout the book, were not shown in the film. Although it was pleasant, like many of Stephen King’s films, but like many of Stephen King’s films, this film did not follow the book and became part of the Hollywood trailer. 2/10
