This film was nothing more than an exploitative fun cheesecake. It was not a feature film; just an excuse to show some unfounded, exploitative, excessively scenes with nude naked male sex life. There was a scene in the locker room with more than a dozen naked men. The camera focuses on male asses and penises when they are portrayed for several minutes with their members in full screen. In this film, there are several scenes showing the penis after the penis. He quickly becomes redundant and makes it impossible to take this film seriously. I was wondering if I watched the Playgirl video by mistake. If the same scenes were shot using women (for example: completely naked and showing their vagina repeatedly) it would be quickly rejected as only porno erotica and a reason to show a lot of candy eyes ... which is all this film. Any artistic merit was washed away by the gay ghetto mentality. The themes of class distinction, homosexuality, desire, etc. were simple and superficial; no more advanced than one would expect from a freshman. Just cut a chase and rent gay porn instead.
