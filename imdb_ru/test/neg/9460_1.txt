Before I watched this movie, I believed that there are two kinds of bad movies. (1) Your average, totally uninspired fare (that is, “Konstantin”), and (2) a job that is charmingly bad, or so bad is good (a la “Manos Hand of Destiny”). Now that I have watched "Doctor Gore," I know that there is a third kind of bad movie: a sandwich with complete shit. This will be permanently tattooed on your memory. Work that is stunningly doable. Anathema. <br /> <br /> I hated some films before, but I never hated the film so much that my hatred reached my doorstep and became the most Hate! Have you seen a film that not only makes you regret that you lost the hour you spent watching it, but also makes you grieve for another hour after that? Pupils of the mysterious Theater of Science are wary, this is a heartbreaking movie. Instead, you can rent a "Circle of Iron" or "Resolute Killers."
