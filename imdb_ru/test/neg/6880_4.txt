I definitely would not call it a good film, in fact it may even be a bad one. <br /> <br /> BUT there are at least two good reasons to continue watching this film, these are the performances of AGNES BROKNER. (Eden) and Jonathan Jackson (Eric), who both demonstrate solid results. <br /> <br /> They are much better than the rest of the actors who are pretty bad, especially MEAGAN GOODE (cousin Skeeter). <br /> <br /> BIJOU PHILIPS performed well in the HAVOC drama “Suburban Children Go to the Hoods,” but here she is far from being on the verge of irritation. <br /> <br /> HISTORY is decent enough, although nothing special, BUT it would be much better, because in LUSIAN, what happens is that any of the children actually had an emphasis on the south, but they do not (!) . <br /> <br /> Especially in the film, where the “monster” is in fact so deeply connected with the folk art of Louisiana, with voodoo, and it’s just nonsense to not include this emphasis in the characters. <br /> <br /> The only thing is WELL, this is a rapper METHOD MAN, he plays Deputy Turner and highlights a pretty good accent in his several scenes, and I mean that if the rapper is able to do it, then why are “professional” actors can't do it? same? Mr. Tikal, he Met, is very pleasant in his VERY small role. Who knows that the Stallion of Tikalion will ever become a cop? Even if only on the big screen. <br /> <br /> In any case, besides the fact that it is a rather stupid, but rather pleasant film Slasher, but if BRUCKNER and JACKSON were as bad as the other young actors, it could be really bad, Fortunately, they are, as usual, good. <br /> <br /> 4.5 out of 10, well, BUT there are hundreds of the best slasher films.
