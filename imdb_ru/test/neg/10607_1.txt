Pure crap, decent cinematography ... I liked some colors. In addition, it was one of the worst films I have ever seen. Boring, lifeless, I have never become interested in any character. I kept waiting for the real story and the film to pick up the pace. Nothing happened! I think they worked too much on their hair and wardrobe, and they forgot that they were making a movie at the time.
