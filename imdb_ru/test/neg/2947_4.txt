This film reminds me of Harry Potter - not a style, but a marketing strategy. Maybe part 2, part three ... until one day the product life cycle ends, of course, on condition that part one will have commercial success. so many things seem to be hidden, and so the story looks rather unfinished. action design is boring. Scenography is fine, but not fine. Perhaps one day, Edison Chen will be a big star. He really looks charming even on the big screen. The most impressive is Anthony Wong. 4/10 <br /> <br />
