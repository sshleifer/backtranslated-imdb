I was excited to see this show when I started seeing promotions on A & E. I was fascinated by ghosts and paranormal phenomena from my very childhood, and I like to catch Ghostbusters when it is on (SciFi channel). I tried to watch three episodes of “Paranormal Status” and only spend my time commenting on it, because it’s so bad and perpetuates the idea that anyone who believes in a paranormal phenomenon is a gullible freak. "Paranormal condition" goes beyond cheese. Shoddy off-screen inscriptions that make you want Captain Kirk. Trashy teasers are going to commercial breaks, which are taken out of context. Everything paranormal on this show is automatically considered "evil" and the work of the demonic spirit. Then come the exorcists, demonologists, psychics ... as in Poltergeist, you almost expect the team to leave and say, "This house is free." I really appreciate the Ghostbusters approach when they refute the allegations, and then take what they can ... and they almost always reassure the client (if they find something) that the victim is not equal to evil. “Paranormal condition” is not “so bad, it's good” ... it's just bad. Didn't A & E mean “Arts and Entertainment” before? The artistic part is long gone, and the entertainment factor is now also decreasing.
