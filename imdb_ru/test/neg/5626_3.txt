The “Ring of Freedom” may have been well-intentioned, but it sends a curious mixed message in the final product. <br /> <br /> People in the western city, through which the railway passes, are stunned by the arrival of immigrant workers who work on the railway and are funded by the robber baron Edward Arnold. There are several ranchers and farmers whose land stands in the way of the railway, and the people hired by Arnold are briefly dealt with by these people. One person who does not give up is Lionel Barrymore, whose son is returning home from Harvard, a lawyer and is ready to take up the job of the ranch master. <br /> <br /> Only Nelson Eddie decides that the best way to fight is to go to Zorro. on the bad guys. But besides Charles Butterworth, no one knows that he is the Wasp (by the way, a very interesting choice of names). <br /> <br /> What Arnold did was using tried and true methods of political bosses in the east, forcing immigrants to vote. Nelson's idea is simple: if the immigrants knew only the truth about what a bad guy is, Arnold, they would vote for the original settlers and knock out someone else's urban political machine among them. He kidnaps newspaper editor Raymond Walburn and takes him with the press to a mountain cave where some subversive newspapers are printed and distributed. <br /> <br /> Railway workers are really a mixed group of immigrants, not Irish, working in the west or China, working in the east, as the story goes. This is a real United Nations working on the Arnold railway. The workers are lined up by master Victor McLaglen, and Nelson has an unenviable task - to give it some meaning, as John Wayne did in The Quiet Man. <br /> <br /> Of all the films that Janette and Nelson starred in, and they surely went down in history as a duet, this was the worst thing they did at MGM. Nelson is going to hang with Barrymore for crimes that, at best, have not been identified, but are definitely not worth hanging. And Virginia Bruce, who plays Nelson's girlfriend, saves the day with the performance of "My Country Tees Thee", joined by immigrants. In the face of the uprising of his paid immigrant voters, Arnold rather rationally collects things and leaves the city to build his railway somewhere else. <br /> <br /> I'm not joking, that's the end. What is the message, vote with the settlers and lose your job with Arnold? But somehow you get here? <br /> <br /> Sometimes I wonder if 20 years after the incidents connected with this film, the city settled in the sunken west, and some cities that the railway passed through became steel cities. that the good inhabitants of this city did not rethink what Nelson Eddie did. If they do, they will probably chase him away on the railway. <br /> <br /> Nelson is, of course, in a good voice and can sing many concert and popular pieces, including a ballad for immigrants, written by Sigmund Romberg. Where else, but here. The song is a sincere tribute from an immigrant who has succeeded in his adoptive country. It is a pity that he had no better place. <br /> <br /> Almost platinum blonde Virginia Bruce, I am sure, is called here. And I’m sure that Janette MacDonald was just as happy that she didn’t accompany Nelson on this trip to the west.
