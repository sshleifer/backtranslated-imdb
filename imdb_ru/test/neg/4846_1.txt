I had never heard of Bounty Dead Man when I saw him at the DVD store a few weeks ago, and it seemed to me that I had stumbled upon an unrecognized gem, because Val Kilmer had a really unique role in it. Unfortunately, no more than ten or fifteen minutes of the film passed, and I realized that this was a catastrophe of epic proportions. The first clue you will see about how truly awful this film is comes to the beginning, when you have a lot of bags of dirt in your old salon, laughing like hyenas, in a scene that lasts about five times longer. It is incredible how bad it is. And, unfortunately, it does not get better. <br /> <br /> Val Kilmer is depicted on the cover of the film, perhaps to make you think that he plays a role in the film, but unfortunately his bizarre role as a dead man is overlooked in favor of focusing on a bunch of imbeciles and the most inept conceptualization of a unique city sheriff I've ever seen in a movie. He is played by Bohuslav Linda, who is not or not interested in covering his Polish accent, which immediately makes it impossible that this film will take place in the American old west. <br /> <br /> Does Poland have such a border past? I dont know. My knowledge of Polish history is not my forte, but I can tell you the following: “Sheriff,” as they call him in the film, is the worst law enforcement officer I ever remember in the movie. He is introduced into a really funny scene, where he wears some kind of blindfold, and many men take turns beating him in the face. Before they start hitting him, he explains that each of them can hit him once, and then, after the first round, each of them will hit him again, and if he can determine who hits, they lose. What the hell is this shit? I absolutely can not explain why such a scene could be inserted into any film. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the sheriff continues to seem more and more beaten, beaten, drunk and beaten, until, in the end, he does nothing, but from time to time he appears, stumbling on the screen and mumbling “ without .... law? "You see, a lot of talk and preparation for hanging, the details of which are just as meaningless as the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> By the way, this happens in a city that is nothing more than of two dilapidated wooden buildings facing each other through overgrown mud, which is more of a walkway than dear. As I understand it, this is part of Poland, which should look quite acceptable, like an American southwest, from where none of the characters, except perhaps the dead guy, could come. <br /> <br /> I have I heard that Val Kilmer accepted this role because he was intrigued by his unique role, as well as the minimal use of dialogue by director Uklansky in favor of relying on skillfully synchronized matching of images in unique visual edits. <br /> <br /> Yes, whatever. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that Kilimer was unable to overcome what must have been a really satisfying feeling, which he must have got when he was offered the role. Personally, I would really feel that I had reached a certain level of success if someone came up to me and offered me, probably, several hundred thousand dollars, so that I would come and lay motionless for a while. I like to think that he didn’t even read the script for this mess, because if he did, I’m at a loss to understand why he accepted the role. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film opens with a man bringing the corpse of the person Kilmer plays in search of reward. Soon he finds himself drawn into a ridiculous love story with the participation of a city prostitute, an alcoholic sheriff and a host of riots involving a number of stupid, stupid characters. <br /> <br /> There is also a vast and absurd misunderstanding of American rituals. In one scene, a man cuts a cherry tomato in half and presses the halves into Kilmer's eyes (for what reason I can't imagine), and then later the man gives a short speech over Kilmer's corpse, in which he explains that he was “one of the best people that we have ever had, ”and then he throws back his head with a shovel. What the hell?? <br /> <br /> Still not convinced? Here are a few more reasons not to watch this. In one scene, the sheriff seems to be covered in ash, except for perfectly clean areas around the eyes and what can only be described as bright red lipstick. A person gets a wound on the head, which has filled his head and body with blood. In a daze, he cauterizes it with gunpowder. Smart. Toward the end, a broken arm appears at the Sheriff. Sitting at the bar, he pulls the rope around his neck and joins it with his injured hand, and uses his good hand to pull the rope, raising a shaking glass of beer in his bad hand to his mouth, rather than using it to drink. Also smart. <br /> <br /> Why doesn't he just use his good hand? I have no idea. This, like everything else in the film, makes no sense, just like the title. Summer Love? Are you kidding me? Avoid this mess at all costs. <br /> <br /> For now, is there anything for the IMDb Goofs page ?? <br /> <br /> Mistakes made by characters (perhaps deliberate mistakes made by filmmakers): this film is made. HA!
