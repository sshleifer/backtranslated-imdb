A terrible deception: the controversial film, the winner of Teddy in Berlin in 2003, Mil nubes de paz was a fiasco. Actors read everything (well, they are not really actors); the film tried to be high, but in the end it turned out to be doubtful: it rests on the surface of two kisses of a boy and a boy whose lover left; it has no purpose: nothing to do with homosexuality presented in other films (for example, “Before Night Falls” (2000) by Julian Schnabel). Technically, the only thing that works is photography; otherwise, the camera is at strange angles (to make it more “art film”), and the entire film moves in a black and white atmosphere. The film is so pretentious that it bothers. I mean, it's good to be pretentious when you have the talent to support it. Or maybe it is so art-cinema that it is incomprehensible. The story flows slowly, slowly, slowly. For me, more form than essence. Excellent edition? It was good. Excellent direction? Do not think so: the film is weak. It was an interesting project. It's a shame. This is a flaw. One star out of four.
