To think that it could only get better was the worst guess I have ever done .... Drivvle does not properly describe this film! <br /> <br /> Not only the plot is thin, but I get a more emotional game from my favorite fish! <br /> <br /> I was ashamed to see Pete Postletway, whom I respect as an actor trying to do everything possible with the little one he had to work with ... <br /> <br /> I think cardboard , carved from Stephen Baldwin, would have done better, and in fact would have been more lively. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs! It can be dangerous for your health!
