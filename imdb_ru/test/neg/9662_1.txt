Kalou, what now? Yes, I also thought it was a stupid name. Chris Carter remains in bliss, unaware of the filth in his writing. This episode begins with the usual fun teaser "The X-Files" (a child knocks down a train), well, I can not say that he is going downhill, because, frankly, he never went uphill. <br /> <br /> Poorly written, because we do not feel any pathos to any of the characters (except, perhaps, this child in the beginning), the writer makes us hate the characters before brutally killing them, this is the worst technique in the whole story. Should we pity the characters who hate them? Don't ask me. <br /> <br /> Not only is it boring and not scary, but it’s like watching a really bad sequel to Omen with bloated and disgusting death episodes and rotten special effects (although, frankly, it’s the least I'm worried about ). <br /> <br /> Sarah B. Cherno began her career in The X-Files with a whimper and, fortunately, also ended it. <br /> <br /> Verdict: <br /> <br /> In the words of my math teacher Mr. Laverak: “Terrible, terrible ...”
