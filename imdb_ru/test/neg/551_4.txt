In 1984, The Karate Kid had some kind of charm, even if it was a little more than Rocky for a poor man. Alas, producer Jerry Weintraub could not understand that it was better to leave the story in the place where it ended, and convinced Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita to make additional efforts to turn the film into a trilogy. Part III was the final low in the franchise, but someone must have thought that the series still had potential. What else could be the explanation for the existence of The Next Karate Kid? <br /> <br /> Wait a minute. Following? Yes, Macchio left (at least he was smart enough to stop at the end), and his replacement was Hilary Swank (!), Playing a troubled teenager (what else?) By the name of Julie Pierce. Now the girl has problems with her family. She also has problems at school. This school has a sadism teacher (Michael Ironside). It turns out, however, that one of his students is actually a good guy, and Julie falls in love with him. Of course, this gives her more problems than before. Fortunately for her, she currently lives with Mr. Miyagi (Morita), an old friend of her grandfather, who knows how to get revenge on the bad guys. <br /> <br /> All these factors make up seven cliches, and this is just a general summary of the plot - imagine what the detailed scenes should be! From start to finish, The Next Karate Kid is a tired, flat and boring marathon of idiotic lines and arrangements. Fortunately, Swank has such as "Boys Don't Cry" and "Million Dollar Baby" to atone for this disaster, but why did Morita agree to return? He may have received an Oscar nomination for the first film, and he was quite pleased with the sequels, but here he has nothing to say - even the revival of the wax wax gag is not yet born. As for Ironside, it is slightly better than Martin Cove and Thomas Ian Griffith in the third part, but this is hardly strained. <br /> <br /> So is this a terrible picture? Not really. There is one sequence that achieves strange beauty, but when the best part of the whole film includes a group of Asian monks dancing when they first hear pop music, this cannot be considered a recommendation to see the rest.
