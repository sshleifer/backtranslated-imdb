The only reason I rated this film as 2 is because Channing Tatumis is beautiful, but the whole movie is devoid of emotion and it was boring to watch. I usually love a good novel, but it was just a waste of time, I didn’t shed tears, despite the fact that it contained sad content, it just didn’t act very well. I'm not a film critic, but I just advise the girls to really avoid it, unless the only reason you are watching is Channing Tatum, the rest of the film is rubbish, and if he wasn’t in it (not that his game would be good) I would stop looking much faster. It's really a shame, because if the right actors were chosen for this film, it could be a real jerk. .. If you're looking for a good cry or a movie for a girly night in ... let it skip !!
