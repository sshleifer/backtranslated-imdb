I like Steve Buscemi. I really like his work as an actor and director. You could say that I am Steve Buscemi. Steve Buscemi is a freak. I am following Steve Buscemi. <br /> <br /> I remember the first time I saw Bushes' full-length debut "Trees Lounge". I liked the movie, although it was not as good as it could be. It was almost everything. Most often this itch was scratched, the desire to see "small" films about "little" people in "small" bars, which are in "small" cities. It was close enough to the place where I would say that it was a very good film, which with a few changes could be great. But it normal. I like the movie, and I watched it more than once. <br /> <br /> But this review is not about Trees Lounge. This is about Lonely Jim. When I saw the description of the film, and then I saw who it was, I was excited by the prospect of finally seeing the film, which I knew could be Trees Lounge. But what I really experienced was not much different from leaving one of those small bars with a belly full of cheap whiskey and a bunch of cheap slut, and heading to my soft-brain apartment full of exciting prospects that inevitably fall into the reality of alcohol-induced impotence and dizzying regurgitation. <br /> <br /> In other words, this film left me indifferent and unresponsive, and I regret that I wasted the time and money I needed to get to this state - the equivalent of waking up next to this cheap mucus morning, or if you happen to be crazy, wake up next to this smelly, farting and unshaven weak-minded. The film was all about the essence of a stale white sandwich with bread (no less, with brand white bread) and the emotions of a corpse. I'm not sure what the meaning of this film was, and since it was supposed to have some point of view, and was not an exercise in abstract surrealism, without which you can do, then the lack of a point is a sin of inaction. The variety likes those new cars that no longer come with ashtrays, although there are millions of people who smoke and buy new cars (I'm not one of them, but hey, I can sympathize). In general, it was a boring film about boring people doing boring things, and there was nothing in it that could save and save such a film. I mean, Trees Lounge was about boring people doing boring things, but it was interesting. <br /> <br /> I blame Affleck for all this. Why do people continue to cast these afflexes? They suck the life out of everything they are connected with. One Affleck was in one decent movie (and was not even the reason that the movie was decent), and suddenly every ass named Affleck stinks as many films as they can. And Liv Tyler is no better. Being the daughter of a rock star doesn't necessarily make an actress. It is as lifeless as Affleck. These people simply do not rise from the flat page of the script. People pay to watch movies, and they deserve to see actors and actresses with a bit of charisma - these two breaks together do not have the spark of an old guy who hand out shopping carts at Wal Mart. I always thought that Steve Buscemi was one of those guys who would rise above this type of pablum, but, O Steve, you let us down. This film makes me want to shove you into another wood crusher.
