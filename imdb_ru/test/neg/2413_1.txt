So I give him one star for true quality, but I would give eight and a half for pure pleasure. "Young Warriors" - an incredibly strange hybrid of sexual comedy and action movie "Young Warrior". This is just a bad movie that you usually hope to find when you pick the video, but it rarely happens. It starts at about half an hour of stupid hin-hinks, sexual jokes and youthful machinations (including an olive in a joke with martini, which is hard to believe). Then the younger sister of the main character will be raped by a gang of dark bikers (an unpleasant scene that does not give me 10 points for entertaining value - rape is not entertainment!), And the main character gets the rest of his insane brother. brothers to help him in an attempt to clear the city, find responsible bikers and kill someone, slightly criminal, whom they will encounter along the way. <br /> <br /> This is a fun, non-stop fun, except for the Unpleasant rape scene itself, and it is necessary for any serious bad movie fan to watch. Believe me - I spent a lot of time on this, and this is one of the best. Highlights include a wonderful library visit, a superb slow flew down in slow motion at an obscene bar (with an impressive shot of a guy tearing off his own leg), a pair of decent dormant actors (Richard Roundtree, Ernest Borgnine) Linny Quigley) and a couple of relatives of famous people (Mike, brother of Chuck Norris, clan member Van Patten James). He even has one of those great "What have we become?" Type in the end of the moral lesson, although the turning point comes when a vigilant Fratboys shot a couple of children robbing a toy pistol shop. I always wondered why this particular catalyst made the hero think; After all, whether they were children, not hardened criminals, and whether they had real weapons or not, in fact they still robbed the store, so as far as I can tell, it was just another job well done for ours. druzhinnika. guys, right? Wonderful things. Highly recommended, just don't blame me when you like it, despite yourself.
