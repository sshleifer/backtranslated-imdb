I thought that Sliver offered the most boring and banal stunt, ending in the history of cinema, but, of course, I was wrong. I was not disappointed that this film would be good. Unfortunately, it was worse than I expected. Worst of all, the obvious ending is so ridiculous and terrible that you can't believe it until it really happens.
