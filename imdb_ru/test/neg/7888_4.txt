Leon Errol does an excellent job with his dual roles of Uncle Matt Lindsay and Lord Basil Epping, but I donâ€™t like the Mexican Spitfire series, because they were all designed to make erroneous names, and they were wired beforehand. Errol is funny like the sultry Lord Epping, but I would prefer a lot more wit and a lot less repetition. <br /> <br />
