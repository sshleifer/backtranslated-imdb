Your time and brains will be much better spent reading or listening to Charlie Wilson’s War. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the most enjoyable character in the film “Gast,” a Greek, and plays him like a eunuch. The rush, in the book, is a hard core and is completely free to speak out. In the film, he didn't even seem as important to Charlie. And poor Charlie was never shown blood donation (which he did every time he visited camps in Pakistan). In short, the film is too soft, and the story is too old for our modern times. We do not care about the end of the Cold War and the defeat of the Soviet Union (which occurred despite Reagan, and not as a result) of a well-funded group of people who were extremely ready to fight. Not exactly the lesson we need to hear and see, considering how well the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are going. (When I read the book, I continued to experience this feeling of deja vu, except what was today).
