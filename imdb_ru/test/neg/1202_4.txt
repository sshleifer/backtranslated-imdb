... But it definitely still deserves only 4/10 stars and no more. The father of a stupid stupid child is a fighter pilot who was shot down by some Arab country. They never call the country in the film, it's really funny, they just vaguely belong to some Arab nation, this film is really ignorant. But Lamar of Revenge of the Botanists is here, he is friends with the main character Doug Masters. Well, Doug Masters, who lives in an Air Force base, his father is an Air Force pilot, but he fails to get into the Air Force Academy, he is plotting (with the help of his backward friends) to steal two planes and go save his father. Yes, exactly - this is one of the greatest films in history !!! Louis Gossett Jr. is great in his role. You can tell he basically wanted to hit Doug Masters in a hell of a movie. Well, anyway, you can guess how the plot ends, I can't believe they made 3 sequels of this film.
