When I was browsing through the channel, I came to channel 124. This is a city channel. I watched this movie and decided to try. I almost became a mass murderer because of this movie. I starred in home movies, and they are really high-quality compared to this huge mass of Duki. The lighting was terrible, and the game was absolutely mercilessly bad. I would prefer to see Star Crystal ....... Holy cow, maybe this is not a good example. The main question that I have about this film ... It was a film about morality? The reason I ask is that on one of the lines this woman in a wheelchair said: "I would be different statistics gang." Oh, my head starts to hurt. Hearing this line, I went to the kitchen and pulled out a knife, ready to strike everyone who dared to watch this movie. But there was some meaning, and I just switched the channel to watch the man with the afro paint. Well, that's all I can say about this movie. If you want to endure this pain, go on, but not recommended for those with short fuses or a bad case with tourettes.
