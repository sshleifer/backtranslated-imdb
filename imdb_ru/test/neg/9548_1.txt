* Criticism mentions spoilers * <br /> <br /> I rarely make user comments, but this is one movie, I have no problems with slander. This film stinks, and its mediocre rating of 6 and a half stars is probably too high for such a flesh. Bone Collector is not at all the same film as Silence of the Lambs or Seven, despite what its advertising claims. This is a great example of how not to make a thriller. The pace of this film was very slow - I actually walked about 10 minutes halfway and returned to the same scene with the exact same character without any progress (I mean the part in which the character of Angelina Jolie discusses Denzel o cut the hands off the corpse). The film is not at all terrible, but it is trying to compensate for this with a love plot, albeit a sexy character by Angelina Jolie and Denzel Washington. Of course, what you get is comparable to the relationship between a mentor and a student, as can be seen in the diamond epic “The Silence of the Lambs” with Hannibal Lecter and Starling, but even this lacks efficiency, and I personally was going to kill the villain. Denzel turned off to avoid the funny laughs between them. With this shitty movie, I almost expected the plot to turn around or some exciting situation to end up giving the film some merit - things that made mediocre movies like Arlington Road and Scream. Anyone who has education in the 4th grade can see how the final will be decided (a situation that mimics Alfred Hitchcock's rear window). The cliché that the killer explained his motives was dull enough, but the reason was so ridiculous and stupid that I cast a latte on the screen. Speaking esoterically, I even think that the killer's intention was completely lost, since Denzel gladly recovered after losing in the well-known “chess game” and gets his favorite project of Angelina. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of movies with original ideas and truly dynamic concepts (like me), you will not appreciate this movie. If you have not visited a single film in your life and would like to catch up on every Hollywood cliche ever received (the night knocking on the window from someone other than the killer, the ridiculous serial killer and the main investigator, is a terrible woman trying to do workforce, which is dominated by men (SOTL), watch this movie ... but even then it is too slow and you will be bored.
