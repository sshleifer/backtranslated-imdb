What did Rajiv Rai do to himself? Once a well-known director of such films as Tride and Vishvatama, he is now making one bad film after another. At first I was excited by the thought of returning Rajiv Rai to the action genre, but it soon stopped. As a Rajiv Rai fan, I thought that I should at least try, but I left an hour later. One of the reasons why I left the film so early, so many packbacks in the film, it was not in the previous enterprise Paradise. <br /> <br /> Many directors have tried pakibashing, but I didnâ€™t expect it from Rajiv Rai Music was another disappointment. Rajiv Raja has always had good music so far. There is only one good song - Tere dekh dekh Ladgayan. The performances are not from scratch, even from Paradise Loyalist Nasir-Uddin-Shah. Inexpensive fare from my favorite director.
