Anyone who writes that this is some kind of good child may have worked on it or invested in this terrible experiment in college. It was lousy, slow and painful to watch. Duration only about 84 minutes, he felt like three and a half hours. The only person who is to blame is the director who knows nothing about how to direct the scene, where to place the camera! 95% of this horrible movie was shot with long master shots. Two or three people in the frame are talking or shouting forever (or what seems to be eternal), no close-ups !! No medium shots! There are two so-called battle scenes that any cinematographer with brains would have to take several large or medium shots for them. They looked very amateur. Scenes in which father and son shouted at each other would work better if there was a separation only from the father or only from the son acting or reacting. Tri-C must be very distressed to show it anywhere. At one time I saw a bunch of bad movies, some of them funny, because they are so bad that this is not one of them.
