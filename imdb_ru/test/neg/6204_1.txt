I just don’t know how this stupid, crappy, trash, junk and useless movie is a blockbuster. It was so boring with a very, very weak (or not) storyline and it wasn’t even funny. The film had about 135 minutes of just a paragraph of the story that Prem (Salman Khan) is a love guru and helps the unfortunate and romantic Bhaskara (Govinda) to find the girl he wants. I don’t say that I didn’t like the film because it wasn’t funny or something else, I’ll accept a movie that is not funny but has a decent story. The only two reasons why I can say that this is a super hit: <br /> <br /> 1. Salman Khan and Govinda together on the screen together, but there was Salaam and Ishk for the first time, which was a failure, therefore be. But it was a really good movie. <br /> <br /> 2. Salman Khan's name is Prem, and all the films with this title were a hit, including Men Pyar Kiya. So this is just luck. <br /> <br /> I heard that this is a remake of Hitch, I did not see it and I am glad that I did not see it. The music is fine, the only good songs are: Do you want a partner, you are my love and Sonya De Nahre, but what's the use of it in a really bad movie is that too, if you have someone like Katrina Kaif, who is dancing with two left-handed legs? She's totally crap. Neither she knows the acting skills, the language (her voice is always called her), the dance and is always unable to make an impression. I did not like her, she even disappointed Kuffi with Karan. The general partner is a one-time film with a one-time actress Katrina Kaif. It is good that she was expelled from Bollywood and never returned.
