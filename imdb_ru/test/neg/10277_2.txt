after all this nonsense, it is difficult to make a negative statement about how great the poll is, how beautiful the actors are, and so on and so forth. I did not like the movie. this shit! <br /> <br /> There are orgies, they have forbidden sex (gay sex, bi sex, oral sex, rape, anal sex, masturbation, brother-sex sex, brother-sex sex, drug sex, sex without drugs , sex, sex, sex seems to rule their world. I think the director desperately needs to be fired.) The story is just dirty and shameful. I wonder what made these people get up with this story? and above all: who cares? <br /> <br /> technical things did not satisfy me either. the sound is bad, so there is no editing, but no “direction” the actors are admittedly fine, but guess what! this is their job! their job is to act! no need to jump from their seats if the actor has done a decent job. Do you applaud when the bus driver takes you home safely? can you see <br /> <br /> I gave 2/10, because after all this there was something that I cannot express in words. b movie charm? fun camp? nudity? I do not know.
