Another tedious bore from Anthony Minghella, who seems to thrive on these big bloated superproductions that take more than two and a half hours to do what any sensible director does in ninety minutes. <br /> <br /> The story centers about Inman (dubious Jude Law), who goes into civil war, barely starting a love affair with Nicole Kidman, the daughter of a preacher who recently arrived in a beautifully photographed provincial town. The story intersects between Inman’s ordeals in war (that is, guess which boys and girls? HELL !!) and Kidman’s trials and miseries at home (which, as expected, are incredibly boring). Renee Zellwegger shows up at Kidman's farm to help Kidman regain his form after Holy Father Kidman dies from the inconvenient illness of the characters. Zellwegger acts very meticulously and imperiously in this manner of Granny Clampett, distributing tough enough love and wisdom in their homes to turn the stomach of even the most hardy spectator into the film Touch the Angel. <br /> <br /> This movie is quite simple painfully. Avoid this as a big, bloated Oscar-lure "Fake pretentious literary adaptation."
