"Catchfire" or "Backtrack", as it is sometimes called, is not very good. That is, it is bad. Jodie Foster has now won an Oscar. Why did she agree to do this? I dont know. <br /> <br /> Relations between hostages and kidnappers are not plausible, even if it is a common psychological phenomenon in real life. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, this movie is a scene where Hopper and Foster ride a boat under the Fremont Bridge (Seattle Bridge), which means that the movement had to stop so that the bridge could open. I had to wait many times until this bridge collapsed, almost all on the bus. This is not a pleasant wait. This film caused an unnecessary wait for the bridge, and the world became its worst place.
