I'm a fan of bad movies. I own "R.O.T.O.R." and Boa vs. Python, and I'm working to replenish my collection with such great games like Troll 2 and How are you doing, Superdoc? But Attack is not bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully awful movies. It just sucks. The guy who said he had the best dialogue with his potted plants is all right. Everything in this movie is stupid. When the robot guy smashes into the car, it seems as if he knew that it would explode, there was no reason for which he ever ran in that direction. “Judge, Jury and Executioner”, “Perfect cop ... but they went too far,” I mean, come on, why do people no longer want to make these films? R.O.T.O.R. It does this because it's hysterically terrible, but the Storm Trooper is just a waste of a movie, because it's not even bad enough to be so bad that it is worth watching. It belongs to someone’s home movie collection, something they can be proud of, but that’s all. I think it was on the HBO channel (only with 1 star, that's why I watched it), because it did not belong there. Even if you like bad movies, don't watch this movie. This is shameful.
