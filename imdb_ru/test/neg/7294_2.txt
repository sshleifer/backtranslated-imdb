I will not talk much about this film, because there’s not much to say, because there’s nothing to talk about there. The only good thing about this movie is that our favorite characters from "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" are back. A few bad moments of this film are that he has horrible characters, a terrible comedy, terrible animation, and James Arnold Taylor is trying to copy the wonderful, sole and only Michael J. Fox, like Milo James Thatch. The reasons for my criticism are that all the characters are transformed into something that they have never been and should never be, animation that has been reduced to the lowest possible degree, and finally, why should someone who made a wonderful voice acting work for Obi -How does Kenobi in the Clone Wars want to copy Michael J. Fox? I have an answer to this question. Because they are the same person who thought he needed to copy Eddie Murphy from Mulan in Mulan II. Yes, unfortunately, this is true. <br /> <br />
