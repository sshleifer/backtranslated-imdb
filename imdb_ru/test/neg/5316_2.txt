Get Shorty was a great movie. It was fun and had the perfect balance of a very funny game and a serious conspiracy. “Being cool” is like a cheap scumbag trying to continue. John Travolta in the role of Chile Palmer seems to have forgotten that he was ever in a crowd. He plays it as if he were a bored film-exclusive, and not a bored film-excursion, which used to be Shylock. Uma Thurman, gorgeous in almost every role she ever played, looks tense and confusing. Should she be bad or smart? The chemistry between her and Travolta is tense and uncomfortable. In addition, just add every movie cliche you can think of. Well-educated rap producer Cedric the Entertainer, an incompetent gangster wannabe in Andre 3000, a girl with a heart, a soul and a good set of tubes in Christine Milian, a useless black dude wanderer in Vince Vonn and a stupid famous cameo Steven Tyler. The only funny part was Rock, who invented his own new cliché as an actor, gay bodyguard. Probably the biggest crime is conspiracy: THIS IS NOT MEANING. Get Shorty was clever with Chile playing one group against another and coming out on top. But in this film about a million different characters. And even Chile does not seem to know what is happening. Fans of Get Shorty should be warned: this is a completely different, very worst movie.
