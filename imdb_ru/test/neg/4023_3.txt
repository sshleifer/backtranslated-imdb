The original story had all the ingredients to make a fully engaging Film. But in this version it failed miserably, because even Sheri Lungi was a pale imitation of who she was supposed to be - so much so that I suspected that she should be an accomplice to the end. Was Sherlock Holmes turned into a warrior, not at all like what Sir Arthur Conn Doyle had proposed? In fact, it was Dr. Watson, who showed what small common sense it was. The black boot from the Andoman Islands looked like he couldnâ€™t get out of a paper bag, and what the villain did when he took tea on Baker Street for the denouement was outside of everything old Scotland Yard could imagine. So send this TV movie to their Black Museum, please.
