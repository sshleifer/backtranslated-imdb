Several things become apparent after the first few minutes of this film. First, the scenery and the special effects are incredible - the best, and if everything else worked the same way, his harsh presence could make him a great movie. <br /> <br /> But as soon as the actors open their mouths you suddenly realize that you are sitting in your lair and are watching a movie. The story itself is full of bluffs and melodramas, and the dialogue is one of the worst I've ever seen. And as if it wasn’t bad enough, they made a fool out of the main character, and in my experience you don’t want to do it unless the film is a comedy. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: It was difficult for me to understand this, and I would not recommend it.
