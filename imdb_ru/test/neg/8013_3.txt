Well!! In the film Catherine Zeta Jones. This is the Hallmark TV movie. This is from the novel by Thomas Hardy. In it is Catherine Zeta Jones. She is definitely the only one in the film that performs better than in my school drama class. Oh yeah, there is Clive Owen in it. I'm not British, so it means almost as much as being a Thomas Hardy novel. Except that he was in Bourne's Identity, and I liked it. It just wraps people up. This is really all that was. I become repetitive, but I like CZJ, so I did it to the end. The computer tells me that I do not have 10 lines, and I continue to count them. I always count 11, but maybe I just donâ€™t like my style, but this is also my opinion on the film.
