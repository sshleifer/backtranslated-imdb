This is another film that I missed on Italian television as a child: it is known as the quintet of aging stars, most of whom have never starred in horror films (Fred Astaire, Melvin Douglas, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., John Houseman and Patricia Neil), speech It is about the long hidden past crime of men, which pursues them. It takes the form of a ghostly bell for a girl they all loved (Alice Krieg), but which they had to throw out after an unsuccessful incident when she humiliated their ego! Fairbanks, who was responsible for the cause, has twins (Craig Wasson), and Creege directs his revenge on them too. Soon one of the last, Fairbanks himself and even Douglas and Houseman, are dead. Therefore, the remaining Wasson and Aster decide to confront the ghost at the crime scene, where they also have to fight with a pair of sinister vagrants who somehow execute the order of Krij! I was looking forward to seeing these veterans on their last legs (Douglas died before the film’s premiere, although by that time he had performed another role, while it proved Aster’s own unfavorable swan song), but GHOST STORY also went through many changes moods - while maintaining a slow pace in everything and turning into a bargain for too long - can be anything but failed curiosity. Watching sex (including nude nudity from Wasson!) And the terrible effects of makeup tangled up the water and overshadowed the old-fashioned elegance inherent in the cinema of Jack Cardiff (another well-known old one).
