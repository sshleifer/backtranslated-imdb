This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen, it was badly made, it didn’t show, it was very changeable, because many people didn’t understand the movie at all. I had to watch this film several times before I got an idea of ​​what was going on, well, that’s how a child stole someone’s car, and running away from the police, he summarizes it, for some reason the police let him go, and he had to face his parents, who sent him to live with his uncle in the desert, there he meets a girl who loves climbing, and he goes in for sports and should ask his uncle to let him take part in a climbing competition, and yes, it’s about I said a horrible movie.
