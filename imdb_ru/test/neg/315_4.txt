Well, I could find only three reasons to consider this film worthwhile, given the extremely low budget. <br /> <br /> First were Linnie Quigley and Rachel Carter. In fact, two of them gave me four good reasons to look, and see how I did it. <br /> <br /> The only other reason to see this is that many were filmed right in the future. I did not know this in advance, but I saw an Orange County car tag and said: wow! This was filmed in Florida. <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the memories of the past and the ancestors of the young child, but this was indeed the case. Pumpkin man kills were pretty flimsy, with the exception of the biker. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Quigley and Carter, then everything is fine, but the Return of the Living Dead will bring more thrills.
