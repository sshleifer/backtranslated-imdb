I have never seen TV shows or previous films. Perhaps that is why I did not get much pleasure from this. Boring and just not funny, pleasantly summing up. <br /> <br /> Considering the budget, which the film seemed to have, it is embarrassing that they could not even do a decent job. <br /> <br /> We went to the cinema with no exceptions ‚Äùand hoping to see a somewhat funny movie that would not be too burdensome for the mind. My friend fell asleep halfway through the film, and I spend the next 2 hours in the hope that he will finally pick up. Hope that died with the end of the credits.
