For all his wonderful images, for all his good intentions, it just looks like another disgustingly one-sided, illustrious, self-developing propaganda. <br /> <br /> The idea is simple: "All the Japanese on the Kokoda Track fought sadistic, angry goats who loved to gut all Australian soldiers, cut their throats and beheaded them." Not only does Kokoda pick up the only flaw in Gallipoli (that the enemies are faceless, nameless and clearly inhuman), but it turns out to be completely opposite to the Weyr masterpiece. Instead of giving us the perfect movie with one drawback, we have a terrible mess with one redemption function. <br /> <br /> Let's start with this: we, without any convenient adaptation to the characters, became acquainted with these characters. apparently rather calm, two-dimensional people whom we never ... SHOULD sympathize with. We are at such a distance that even when we can communicate with the characters so easily, they find a way to keep us aside. One thing is a disgusting trait, as it pushes us away from the plot itself, helps a terrible rhythm to leave an indelible impression on us and makes it much easier to see the contrast between the clearly sentimental ending and the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> In other words, he pulls us through a painful journey (not only for us, but, apparently, for them), and as soon as it should end, we are thrown into another eye-clip skirmish, which ends faster, than started. So, for the present STILL uninformed: when it has to end, it starts up again, only to end, when we expect more. S ***! It's just a confusing and painful pace! <br /> <br /> This brings me to an ultimatum: it is intended to tell us about events on the Kokoda road. It is not close. Not only does he detail a very small, insignificant part of the campaign (scattering a small "partnership" from above, trying to make it relevant), but he succeeds in doing one thing that is as important to a film as it should be, it is NOT worried. <br /> <br /> To be honest, my eyes were constantly on watch. The audience around me, all proudly Australians, were arguing about how wonderful the film would be, moaning, moaning and whining with frustration, as each of the agonizing ninety-five minutes was buzzing (not for long) was like Apocalypse Now: that Apocalypse Now was a good film and deserved the three hours he had), and to such an extent that suicide could be an alternative if it were to be watched. <br /> <br /> Although, considering how much TV advertises this garbage, I would say that it is necessary, in the subconscious sense of the word. <br /> <br /> See if you like beautiful pictures. Although it is still better for you to watch Permanent Gardener or Gallipoli because they have excellent cinematography and real stories. <br /> <br /> Overall: *
