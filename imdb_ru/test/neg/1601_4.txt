I have been looking forward to watching "Wirey Spindell" since Schaffer's "Fall" happened. Unfortunately, I discovered that “WS” is a wandering, uninteresting, boring pack of pops, coupled with what is evidently Scheffer's signature, a mixture of history, narration and poetry. The film tells about the sexual and other experiences of a man from Manhattan who is going to marry through self-recollected memories. Like beads on a string, Schaffer apparently tied together every little sexual experience, neglecting the beauty of the necklace. The result is a rambling incoherent story about a boy who grows up, who does not cause sympathy and leaves the viewer detached, dissatisfied and with a bad aftertaste, which spoils the mechanical ending of good health. Indie mediocre and a step back for Schaeffer.
