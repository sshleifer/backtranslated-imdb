Personally, I didn’t win much from the act of seeing with my own eyes. I noticed a lot of really highly regarded reviews of the film, and I'm a little surprised. I may have missed something that other reviewers felt “touched”, but I found the film rather tedious and mostly meaningless. <br /> <br /> The “action” of the film is a bunch of autopsy shots taken in the art-house style — a lot of extreme close-ups, weird editing, etc., without sound or dialogue. <br /> <br /> I believe that the act of seeing with my own eyes can be considered a study of human anatomy or maybe (if you really want to dig a little) some comment about the fragility of humanity or something else - but I personally I found it to be a bunch of semi-interesting, but ultimately boring, personnel for the autopsy. If this is your thing, then this will be the winner for you. As for me - I saw more interesting footage of ER. Not a “bad” film, as it is not a “film” in the traditional sense - I just didn’t find anything special about it - 4/10.
