I have to admit that, despite the entire media campaign and the fact that I was nominated for an Oscar, my expectations for the film were not so high before I watched it. And I really found what I expected; a film that tries to appeal to both conservatives and liberals in Turkey, trying to be genuine for foreign audiences and fun enough for everyone. But it should be understood that it is impossible to be profitable for everyone, so the film remains average for everyone. <br /> <br /> The whole movie tells a story that happened within 24 hours. To put a short story in a feature film, some scenes are added without reference to the main plot. Basically, these are scenes from selling ice cream to eccentric locals (i.e., goat herders, elderly women, etc.), and each of these sale scenes tries to interest viewers in scenes with comic dialogues. This topic is referred to as a universal problem: the struggle of a local manufacturer-trader against holding companies and monopolies, but this topic was interesting twenty years ago. Most readers will recall the Hero of the Grocer versus the supermarket Ferhan Sensoi in the 1980s. It was the right story at the right time. Soon the story is not strong enough and does not deserve to be a film like this. <br /> <br /> With the exception of some acrobats due to the local accent, the cast is so successful. The leading role is played by Turan Ã–zdemir with excessive body language, but in any case he is also successful. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, despite the limited budget, the considerable efforts of the director and players clearly give a good mood to the film. But this does not lead to the fact that the film is good enough to compare it with the Italian neorealists, or if you are nominated for an Oscar. <br /> <br /> Note. Usually in real life, the seller of ice cream stops its own production. and be the dealer of one of the competitors of the brand Manda.
