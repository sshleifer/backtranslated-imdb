Smart common story / place for story. The action is respectable. Children are annoying and their motivation is unclear. The lead villain was a good change, but it could be better. “I love you” was more exaggerated than “you complement me”, but at least Van Damme got a chance to show a little tenderness. One of the best films of Van Damme.
