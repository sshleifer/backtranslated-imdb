I have seen many Japanese horror films, and I must say that some of them are really interesting, but they are all pretty much the same. This one is no exception. A ghost is a black-haired girl who scares her victims by not doing anything but walking and looking dead ... the only difference is the motive of the persecution. the rest is the same as always: a black-haired girl, strange things happening with some media (photos), a terrible game. While watching this movie, I constantly asked myself why I spend time watching things that someone had done a lot better before. although some of the scenes are pretty cute, I will give 3 of 10
