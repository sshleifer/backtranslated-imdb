If you're not old enough to remember Yoram Globus and Menachem Golan, here is a brief summary: these are a couple of film producers and financiers from Israel who created the Cannon film company in the early 1980s. The only Israelite who received the press worse than these two was Menachem Begin. The start was probably deserved by a bad press, but Globus and the Golan were God's promise to filmmakers, because no matter how bad your script was, they would gladly fund your film and usually hire directors who could not be directors and actors who could not act. In fact, you often had the impression that people would just go up to Yoram, and Menachem asked them for some money, and they would oblige without seeing the director’s resume. If only the producers in our time were so trusting. <br /> <br /> THE YOUNG WARRIORS are not the film “Cannon”, but “Globus” and “Golan” financed him, and all their signatures on it. It is badly directed, badly operated, badly edited, but this is a script that jumps out and attacks you with its horror. It all starts with a bunch of school jokes involved in all sorts of pranks, in fact the first 20 minutes of the film are played like a sexual comedy, and it becomes a shock when YOUNG WARRIORS turn into a film about the vigil, But this is not just some kind of vigilance film like EXTERMINATOR 2 or DEATH WISH 3 (notice the connection? They are both sequels and both are vigil films made by Cannon films), no, this is a ridiculously bad film about vigil about high school cute boys and their poodle going on a mission to destroy scum . This film is proof that Globus and the Golan gave money to people, regardless of their ability to make films, and you need to worry about people who seem to be spending all their reserves on making films completely dedicated to the warriors.
