This very carefully created film makes an unforgivable (which is ironic, given the theme of the film). No one in this film knows what they are for. Worse, on 3/4 of the way to the film, nobody still has any idea what they are for, because everything up to this “moment” is a different film. <br /> <br /> As a fan of Dutcher's first two films, competing easily for the best 2 Mormon films to date (competing with Saints and soldiers, and now with the New York Doll - saw it at the show), Dutcher asked me to watch his movie for a very long time. I was here. I wanted to believe, to believe that I would see the next wonderful Mormon film, which will hold the place of Numero Uno for a very long time. But no. Three-quarters in the film took the coolest of the left turns and dragged me through something I never wanted to go through. He takes on Mt. Everest of all moral problems, yes, they both have little time or emotional abilities to adequately address them, but instead they wave at both of them with a nod toward Jesus, as if it would instantly do everything well. (It’s true that Jesus saves. Do not blame me for not believing in it. This is not Dutcher’s problem.) <br /> <br /> Was the film well made? Indeed. Are the actors acting? They took off their pants. Was the music suitable? Everything except what was above the final loans. Everything about this movie was great, except for a story that was so raw and wrong that everything else doesn't matter. (By the way, I learned the "chilliness" of the New York doll, a very decent show.) The third act of the film was neither desirable, nor pleasant, nor a confirmation of faith. I know that Dutcher leaned back to make it so, but at that moment I was so driven out of the film that nothing, nothing could bring me back. The absurd improbability of dozens of details in the last minutes did not help. Anyone who was on a mission knows what I am talking about, especially anyone who, "Alert Spoiler", is familiar with events related to the fact that someone is sent home from a mission early for moral and / or psychological reasons. It is as if a parallel universe suddenly appeared, where the usual rules or behavior do not suddenly apply. <br /> <br /> There are a million good things in this film, but they were created and decorated just to be crushed and thrown into the "oh, it really gets them" elitism. Therefore, unforgivable. I can only hope that when Dutcher finishes work on his next film (“Fall,” apparently), he will remember that film critics can only buy as many tickets, and fans pay the bills. That is why God's first Army had such an unqualified success. <br /> <br /> Dutcher’s shocked and reverent approach proves that when it comes to Big Problems, he is above his head, having neither spiritual, nor creative maturity, nor the business sense necessary to take over. I pray - I pray! - he learns a lesson, and after a few years he and we all look back, with chagrin and glad that he pulled his head out of the place where the Light does not shine and really, successfully, takes on these and other issues and changes the world forever. for that.
