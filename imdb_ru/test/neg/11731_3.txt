The first review I saw about this in IMDB says that Vince Vaughn is much better than Anthony Perkins in this role. Makes me wonder if he saw the original. It’s hard to revise “Psycho” if you don’t have any idea how revolutionary the film was in 1960. You have a heroine who is not very pretty and killed not far from the film, and a villain who is terrible, but who makes you feel about him. Add to this a bit of graphic violence, and you will have a blue print for some of the slasher films of the 80s and 90s. <br /> <br /> Where does this movie go wrong? Let's start with the casting. Anne Heche is good as Vivian Crane, but as Norman Bates, Vince Vaughn is mistaken. On the one hand, he looks too young. Secondly, he has no idea how to play roll. His nervous laugh reminds me of Ron Howard trying to play a tough guy on Happy Days. Everything he does is screaming, I DID IT! The original film, even for those who know everything about him, makes you feel embarrassed due to the influence of the mother on Norman and turns it into a real individual character. How about a scene in the shower. When I finally saw the 1960 film on the big screen, I was surprised by his ability to scare me to hell. Bernard Herrman’s score becomes incredibly shrill and loud and goes further to scare you than interpreting synthesizer Danny Elfman during a scene. This scene in the shower just shows us the naked body of Anna Heche and a bit of the pleasant color of blood. Which brings us to the choice of film in color. Did not work. <br /> <br /> There is something in the remake of classic films that will hardly ever work. Some may regard this as a noble experiment, but, frankly, if Gus Van Sant has nothing to add to this film, he should have left him alone.
