Giant Claw is in tough competition with films like Robot Monster and Plan 9 from Space for the worst film of all time. The fake-looking giant vulture attacks Lionel's Train Trains in this completely unconscious film. The script is so bad that everything that the characters say to each other is ridiculous. It is not surprising that this film is the main goal in the film “It came from Hollywood”, where this stone is slaughtered over the line “Bird as big as a battleship” with a joyful, endless needle. The line steadily emerges in the course of the film, so that there is no escape from it. There are several shots from "The Beast with 20,000 Fathoms" and "The Earth Against UFOs", among other science fiction films from the 50s, to reinforce the attacks of the clumsy vulture. At some point, the large vulture is responsible for several deaths, so the military introduces martial law to the whole world, and no one is allowed to leave their homes. Of course, the huge buzzard is mainly associated with the pursuit of the stars of this classic, Jeff Morrow and Mary Corday, wherever they are. And yet the director is so lame that he does not even give a few honey shots of the pretty Mary in a decent dress and black heels to ease the boredom of this thriller with a zero star. This is the second time this error has been made. In the movie "Tarantula" Mara Corday pulls together hot dresses for the whole movie, but wears Giant Scorpion pants everywhere. The budget of this film was supposed to be no more than thirty or forty thousand dollars, and I doubt that Morrow or Corday received more than three thousand dollars to create it. Looks like it was all killed right from someone's garage.
