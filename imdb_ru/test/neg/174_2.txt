I heard people compare this film to Sideways. As this comparison was made, I never guess, because this film was in no way similar to “Sideways”. <br /> <br /> These 2 films were as different as Star Wars and Thorny Birds. The only thing they had in common was that there was wine in both objects. <br /> <br /> Although the interviews in this documentary were semi-interesting, they were spoiled by the worst cinematographic work in history ... an attempt. In my life, I have never seen the worst camera work, and I compare it with home videos, accidentally filmed 5-year-old children. <br /> <br /> I give these two stars, ONLY for interesting interviews with French wine types and for showing how persistent and corrupt are American wine-making companies (isn't all companies persistent and corrupt?) I would give him -10 stars (yes, it is NEGATIVE 10) for the regrettable, terrible, terrible, terrible VERTIGO-LOOK, the 5-year-old "could have made the camera mess better."
