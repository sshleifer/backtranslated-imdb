Hey, I'm a fan of such bad and good movies, but there’s nothing so bad, so good about Rise Of The Undead. It's just so bad and everything. No expiatory cheese, no unintentional humor, nothing! - a boring apocalyptic zombie (“Undead”: a few people who have almost no makeup), nonsense with inconclusive special effects (if you can call these effects), dull plot and annoying actors. They also have the courage to rip and quote from other (best) films (Resident Evil, Dawn Of The Dead & The Night Of The Comet) and they managed to put me to bed. However, it was Rise Of My Eyelids as soon as the title ended. My advice: save your money. It’s not even worth renting, unless you want to part and / or put some people to sleep, then go ahead and give it a chance. You were warned;)
