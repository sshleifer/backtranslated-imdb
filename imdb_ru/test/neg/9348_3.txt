Wow. The storyline to this was just incredibly stupid. I understand that this film was supposed to be a comedy genre. But, nevertheless, even nonsense should have at least some vague meaning. <br /> <br /> Water has become an incredibly rare substance? <br /> <br /> Well, this is odd, given that hydrogenated oxygen (or oxidized hydrogen) is one of the most abundant substances in the universe. And pretty easy to do. Put together the atoms of hydrogen and oxygen and voila - water. <br /> <br /> Instead of water, the rarity of crystals of dilithium or something such that could be used as a conspiracy, like the fact that the pirates will go in search. Water as a plot device was just stupid, stupid, stupid. <br /> <br /> Comedy seemed exhausting, contrived and forced. The comedy on the Red Dwarf series was difficult, contrived and forced, but in fact it was funny. Here, instead, I wanted to say: “Haha, it was so funny, I forgot to laugh ...” <br /> <br /> Sigh ... all this money was invested in sets, costumes, actors ... What for a waste of time? <br /> <br /> Instead of just whimpering, whining and complaining about his lameness, I recommend doing it better: 1) Use a believable plot device. 2) Get rid of the "comedy." None of the actors were really good at it. The film would work better as a “serious” combat adventure. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers obviously wanted to make a parody comedy, but they did not. I hardly ever look again. This is too difficult hacker work.
