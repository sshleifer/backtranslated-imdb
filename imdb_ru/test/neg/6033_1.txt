It has some of the wackiest fight scenes of all time. If I were a veteran of any war, I would cry when I saw this film, not because I would remember that I was in Vietnam, but because this is a bad representation of any veteran of this war. Despite the fact that the troops carry M16, this film does not look like Vietnam. Even the Vietcong military uniform resembles the old Japanese uniform from a film about the Second World War. The setting is clearly some kind of stupid Hollywood back party. The worst scene is an American soldier fighting from hand to hand, as in a bad martial arts film. After he sends several enemy troops, he says: “Hey, come here and let's kick your ass!” To the helicopter in the air. Then he is shot. This film is rubbish.
