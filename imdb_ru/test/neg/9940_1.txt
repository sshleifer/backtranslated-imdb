Heftig og Begeistret (intense and enthusiastic) - a documentary story of a male choir in Berlevåg in the northernmost part of Norway, where cold and hostile weather, dark winter days and cities encounter young people moving to more populated areas in southern Norway, where the climate is warmer and more opportunities . <br /> <br /> The most beautiful part of this film is the people themselves. People in the choir between the ages of 30 and 95 have a unique, vibrant life and very pleasant creatures. They are characterized by a harsh climate and recession of the North and have adapted to the necessary lifestyle. Throughout the film, we learn a little about many people in the choir and accompany them with songs, some events in the church and in the harbor, and finally a trip to Murmansk. <br /> <br /> The environment shot in the film is very beautiful and is characterized by Norwegian nature. Scenography is also natural and taken directly from the choir and from the lives of the people with whom we meet. Their living room, bathroom, kettle in the oven; There is nothing artificial in this film, neither people, nor the environment, nor their music, nor their feelings. Everything is as real as possible. <br /> <br /> It all loses when it comes to storytelling. It is very beautiful and real, but why do we see it? Is it because of the songs? Is it because of nature? Or just to see the story about the male choir of Berlevag, about their life and some of the trips that they have. The meaning, if any, is that this small society copes with life through social events such as the choir. The choir kept people together for many years. <br /> <br /> Everything is fine, but despite its popularity, which was seen by almost 200,000 people in Norway, something is wrong. There is no beginning or end to this. No one gains or loses anything, no one reveals any messages or tries to convince the audience that this is good or that life is great there. Why was this movie made? <br /> <br /> Sorry. This is a good film about good people, but compared to the average European, Scandinavian or Norwegian film - it does not deserve 9 out of 10. It is closer to 4 out of 10, and this is what I will give him. br /> <br /> If you watch this film in the theater, you should expect that the average age of the audience will be about 55-60 years. It is reported that it is consistently high in all theaters. Perhaps this is also the reason that he received such high marks in the news and good marks also on IMDB: this is a film about elders, for elders. This is the film “I don’t regret anything in my life,” and the story that life in such a small town as Berlevag can also be enjoyable.
