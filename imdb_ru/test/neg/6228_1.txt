I must say that in this “film” there is one redemptive speck. It firmly fixes the bottom of the trunk. Now the filmmakers know what to strive for when creating a movie. In addition, I am sorry to watch this defeat. What shamelessly left the creation of this "film" was. What a waste of 100,000 dollars (that's right, guys, a hundred thousand dollars). This “film” reminds me of the Adult Video Awards show, in which from the group of “industrial prostitutes” they themselves are praised, believing that they are real actors, actresses and directors. Ironically, as I watched the blue films with the best play, directing and writing. It also seemed funny to me that the executive producer, Justin Ament, just had to be in the movie. He plays Deputy Jake Barker. I am sure that his "acting" career took off ... Ted Piffer, a writer, has his own role. He, no doubt, lay in the created cliché of fame. It should be noted that Carrie Finklia plays a major role in the film. You may remember her from “The Elephant” by Guus Van Santa. Although I am not too sure that she will want to write this film in her resume. And I'm not sure what is the more depressing point; money was spent to make this film, or people would watch it. Along with “Torque”, “Godsend” and “Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow”, one of the worst films of “If not the worst movie” of 2004.
