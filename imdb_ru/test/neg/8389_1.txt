This film was so bad that it looked like a home movie. In one scene, the camera very slowly and gradually bends, then returns to its place. The sound is hoarse, sometimes disappears, and then again. In another scene, the operator is just visible in the mirror. <br /> <br /> Then a scene appeared with instructions on how to put up a tent ... which, believe me, lasted for ages and was completely irrelevant to the plot. Most of the scenes were drawn to conversations that were also not completely relevant. In my opinion, it was only to fill the film and make it longer. Even with the addition of these scenes, he was very short. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this is a severed head that looked quite realistic.
