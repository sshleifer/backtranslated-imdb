The title of this documentary is very misleading. Never during the documentary film did they show how the hit of the Nile perch in Lake Victoria caused any problems that the city of Mwanza, Tanzania was facing. The film is trying to put the problems of Tanzania on an environmental cause, but the truth is that the problems stem from external parasitic forces. The documentary is very slow, without narration. Instead, it relies on small pieces of text between unrelated segments to display bits of information, which add little to expand or expand the subject. There are only two attempts to discuss the environmental impact of Nile perch fish. One of them is a short length of about 10 seconds where they interview the managers of the factory where the fish is processed, and he briefly mentions how Nile perch was introduced into the lake 50 years ago and absorbed other types of fish. The filmmaker does not make any attempt to understand this issue or to delve into it. The second attempt is when, in this documentary, they shoot another documentary that discusses the environmental impact of the Nile perch, and again no real attempt is made to explain how destructive the problem has become. <br /> <br /> The subject matter of this documentary is not related to perch fish itself and is more concerned with the problems that most African countries face. The film attempts to connect the perch with fish with AIDS, poverty and pollution in Tanzania, but never establishes a direct connection. Like any intelligent person who is familiar with problems in Africa, the problems shown here are not unique to Tanzania, but affect most of Africa and have nothing to do with fish. It would be great if the directors showed how the local economy or life was before the fish was introduced, and how it negatively affected the introduction of the fish, but they do not. The fact is that many of the respondents say that the fish has provided work and opportunity for many. Yes, things are going bad in the city of Mwanza, but they are much worse in other parts of the country and the continent. <br /> <br /> Documentary makers have a weak attempt to link fish with hunger problems in Tanzania. quickly discredited by the documentary itself. First of all, Tanzania is a very large country, and Lake Victoria is only a small part of the country. Many of the respondents actually say that they can find work and feed their families in Mwanza, a fishing town on the lake, because everything was so bad in other parts of the country. <br /> <br /> This documentary is very weak, has no narrative and does not actually attempt to link anything that they show to Nile perch. He plays on the emotions of people, showing images of the devastation of poverty, hunger and AIDS, not trying to show you how this is unique to Lake Victoria in Tanzania or directly related to perch fish. The fact is that most of the problems are more connected with the war, globalization and Christianity than with the influence of the fish on the environment.
