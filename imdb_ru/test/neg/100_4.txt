I was looking forward to this movie. Credible actors, interesting plot. Great atmosphere then ????? If you are going to try something that is meant to include the meaning of life. The first. Know that. Well, I didn’t expect that directors or writers really know the value, but I thought they might have offered crumbs to peck and treats to add fuel to the fire. they almost did. Things I didn't get. A woman wanders through dark places and lonely parking lots alone - without noticing the consequences. Great riddles that fell by the wayside. The promise of this knowledge is contained in the original so-called criminal. I had no problems with the budget, and I enjoyed the wait. I understood and can lyrically comprehend the fool and found the role of Adrian Paul crucial and insightful, and then ????? Basically, the storyline and script were good until a certain point, and this point was the last 10 minutes or so. What kind? Out of ideas! Too bad this film has let us down so much. He may not understand the meaning, and I really didn’t expect the authors to understand this, but I was hoping for an intellectual, if not spiritual ride, and got hit on the road
