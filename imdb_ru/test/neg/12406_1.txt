The direction of Wong, perhaps the worst in the history of cinema, which I have ever seen. This movie makes my worst film of the year 2000, Dungeons and Dragons, by Courtney Soloman looks like an Oscar winner. The flaws in this film defy explanation. The biggest of these is the lack of depth. Each scene does not fully develop, as if the editing room does not know how to do its job properly. It is a pity that with such a stellar composition of talents and famous popular traditional history this lack of vision can be destroyed. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m so disgusted and hope that some great director, such as John Woong Lee, decided to remake this film and do a little justice. I'm not even sure if I can rate 0/10 ??
