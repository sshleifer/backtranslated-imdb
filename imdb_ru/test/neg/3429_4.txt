This film about the Second World War, shot in Borneo, is doing its best to work on so many levels, it is a shame that it fails on all of them. <br /> <br /> Nick Nolte is a fugitive American who witnesses the execution of his fellow Japanese. He wanders deep in the jungles of Borneo, lost. Kyi Nigel Havers, who finds the adoptive Nolte tribe. Nolte, now similar to Robert Plant, became the new king of his tribe. He defeated the faithful warrior in a bloody battle, and on his chest he had an impressive tattoo (dragon). Now, before you go out and get a painful tattoo and a one-way ticket to Borneo, things are not going well in Nolteland. Havers wants to help the tribe in the fight against the Japanese, who invade the island. He teaches the natives how to use machine guns, and a lot of shooting begins. As the tribe becomes more successful, they encounter a new squadron of Japanese, who are not like others. This squad cannibalizes the villages they conquer in order to maintain their strength (talking about their land), and they move through the jungle even faster than the tribe. Since we know the outcome of the war, we know that the tribe ultimately triumphs, but with heavy losses. And here are the spoilers: Havers was injured and returned to the "civilization". He gives the location of the kingdom, and Nolte is captured. After that, Havers is faced with the problem of freeing Nolte, and throws the last title. <br /> <br /> Milius’s direction is certainly adequate, but the scenario here is rather vague in its motives. He presents the ideas of the story, and then abandons them to move on to the next idea of ​​the story. Nolte is terrible when a soldier turned into a king, desperately trying to convey the spirit of Colonel Marlon Brando Kurz. He talks about the freedom, beauty of the jungle and the wealth of his people, and you will not for a second believe the words he utters. He is often unintentionally funny, especially his original mistake in the jungle, and he spends the rest of the film, looking like a hippie. Nigel Havers conducts the film, looking at Nolte, as Raquel Welch. The vague homosexual overtones between these two concepts go beyond friendship, not just sex, and enter into tacit relationships that the locals must have talked about. <br /> <br /> Havers often stands around and has an internal conflict, reflected in the hunt for the heads of the tribe, but heats himself in the attention of Nolte. His colleagues from the British soldiers with straight hair go faster than the landing from Bounty to Tahiti, but all I saw in Borneo is that it is very wet and a lot of green. <br /> <br /> Climate betrayal, where Havers gives the location of Nolte, is completely devoid of any reason. There is no single thought about why Havers does this, except for the continuation of the film. I was angry when Havers and Nolte happened to be on the same ship, heading for the Philippines, accidentally the ship ran aground, and Havers ran into the hold to free the newly shorn Nolte. Not a farewell kiss, but Havers says goodbye to the king, explaining the name. <br /> <br /> If you were fighting a war, and the enemy squadron ate your allies, wouldn't it scare you? This elite Japanese squad is not sufficiently shown, although their eating habits are so terrible that I would immediately become a denial of military service. The same type of ghostly enemy was handled much better in the "13th Warrior". <br /> <br /> Other interesting ideas are discarded. How about the fact that modern technology leads to the death of so many backward people? Why did King Nolte allow the British to use their objects without much hesitation? Why can't Hollywood find a worthy actor to play General Douglas MacArthur? <br /> <br /> In the end, “Farewell to the King” is a disappointment, not tied to a strong leadership, and trying to be too many things without thinking and not studying their options. I can not recommend this. <br /> <br /> This film is rated (PG13) for strong physical abuse, gun abuse, some blood, profanity, some sexual references and situations for adults.
