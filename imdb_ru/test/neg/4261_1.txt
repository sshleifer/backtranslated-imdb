And the worst part is that it could be good. But something is terribly wrong. First of all, they should never have made Amitabh Bachchan in this film. He is too big an Icon to deal with such a delicate and controversial topic, not to mention the role itself. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Ram Gopal Varm should be ashamed of taking the classic Lolita story and turning it into a pitiful predictable fucking holiday. His Lolita is called Jia (played by rookie Gia Khan), and when we meet with her, she is deprived of any suspicion about a stolen innocence or that delicate naivety, which is usually associated with a complex story about the original Lolita, which in the original story gradually becomes a nymphet . Varma Jia is already a whore with an eye on the prize even before the camera meets her. And he does not show chastity in the way his films are his leading nymphet. From constant panning shots of her crotch to fixing on her vulgar gestures and manners, Mr. Varma ensures that he does not leave a single person in the audience less than embarrassed by his views on the voyeur pedophile camera. <br /> <br /> Oh, and let's not talk about the nonexistent chemistry between Jia and her so-called friend Rita (the daughter of Bachchan's character). These girls should be best friends, but look like the worst enemies, even if there is something wrong between them. Nothing of what they do together is incredible, until they become enemies. Perhaps Mr. Warma should have worked on this aspect of his script, and not focus on destroying any authority that Amitabh Bachchan could have left as an actor. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the film is, perhaps, a subordinate image of the character of the wife of the character of Bachchan. Her role was so signed and ridiculously wooden that it is really impossible to feel pity or concern for her. I actually felt that I wanted to reach the screen, slamming her for not responding as an ordinary woman. Instead, she just stood there, looking Riley and Helpless, as I guess most viewers of this film might feel after watching this train wreck. Take a look at your own risk.
