AVP2 is a terrible movie. The dialogue was meaningless, the acting was pathetic, there was practically no storyline in it, and you cannot say exactly what the hell is happening in half of the cases due to continuity errors and gaps in the plot. <br /> <br /> BUT! You still like it. Because he is pushing the boundaries of blood, violence, death, destruction and chaos. In this film, they even kill children, newborns and unborn children. You will sit there and think: "My God, this is disgusting." And they surprise you by killing "the sexy chick that always makes it alive," when the predator and the aliens fight in the hospital. <br /> <br /> As if the film industry said: “We know that what we did in the first movie“ Alien vs. Predator ”was bad, so we do it again, but this time the psychopaths with bright imagination. " It is predictable, idiot and downright meaningless .... but you will think about it for a while after you see it.
