I usually like Casper in his films, the real merit of STARSHIP TROOPERS. But the cover of the box on this video SSOOOOO rents to tenants. In my local video, people shoot it while waiting for (PERHAPS) Borg, like a vampire, and instead they get a bad rework from Lon Chaney. He had great potential, and he fell very evenly. I actually think I could write a better storyline and script. Why in EVERY sci-fi film do they (actors) constantly call the solar system a galaxy? Didn't any of these screenwriters or authors wake up in a science class? This is my favorite dog, but the solar system is one star with planets, the galaxy is a whole bunch of solar systems. It is like calling a can of Coca-Cola gross of six packs. Makes it sound even dumber.
