I don't think this show is funny at all. I really think it's a lot worse than any of Disney's other horrible comedy channels right now. Charlotte Arnold is an interesting choice to play Sadie because she cannot play. The jokes on this show are horribly unfunny, and that makes it even worse when the only cast that has a little (and I mean a little) acting talent is Justin Bradley as Sadie Hal's brother. Jasmine Richards and Michael D'Asenzo portray Sadie's friends. There are really stupid, and just terrible actors. Two words that can really describe this show are very trite. This is a humorous humor that only little girls consider funny, because their brains are not yet developed. Now I explained my hatred of the game and the terrible humor, what next? The whole premise of the show is a stupid idea. She changed again (not so scientific and loving Ben), and suddenly no one would recognize her? This is a moron. To sum it up, I hate this show, but little girls who have no idea of ​​funny things will like it, so I guess this is what they are about for quality. Although I can say as much, the first season is clearly better than the second. <br /> <br /> LOWER LINE: JUST NOT TO VIEW. <br /> <br /> My rating: Awful show. TV G. 30 min.
