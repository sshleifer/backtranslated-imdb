This review contains spoilers. I had no expectations about this film. I took it from the stand of the video store with the movie "White Noise". <br /> <br /> First, the credits for this stupid film took about 5 minutes. The pace from start to finish is unjustified. The main characters do not like to wear a bra, and the director seems to enjoy the swaying effect when Anna Paquin goes down the stairs. If you like movies for boobies, this movie has a low level of buzz. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it's nice that the film breaks off elements of Lovecraft and other horror genre mechanisms, but there is at least some rational or consistently irrational behavior in the best films. This bastard is trying to establish some sense of modernity and reality, but then you have situations where no one calls the police, even if they have discovered a treasury of potentially incriminating evidence, and otherworldly rituals are beautifully laid out in a comprehensive book about the other world. rituals are like buffy. I waited for Miles to appear and give some advice on how to kill a certain type of demon of one or the other. <br /> <br /> It is assumed that you can open an era of Darkness, where creatures that crawl on the ceiling can cut the throat or turn the effect of the meat grinder on you. Ho hum To do this, you need to have a sacrificial circle, and then have seven children, who should be cut by the people who love them. This opens up the world in an era of darkness. At least that's what the book says in ancient occult rituals. That raises an annoying question, well, well, how did those who wrote the book know, and if this is what is happening, would you really leave this information in a book that you can take from the library, much less get it? from a library in a world that has not yet been illuminated in darkness, an era created by crazy people who could have done this much earlier, using “Occult Practices to Take the World into Darkness for Dummies, 2nd Edition”? It turns out that the father in history is the seventh child who escaped from the ritual 40 years ago; he was released by his father, who is a doctor / grandfather in a film who wanted to try the ritual, presumably with other stupid parents who just wanted to see if the stupid move that opens the world to darkness really works. Grandpa let go of his father because he "really did not love him." Aduh. Stupid, stupid film written by a moron director who seems to think that he is some kind of Eurofilm author. The film also has a scene in which the child appears with large spots on the face, and the mother grabs him and experiences a complete lack of reaction. The whole movie is like that. People see really weird things and don't react to it in any normal way. Must be a bad plot and direction. <br /> <br /> Anna Pakin does her best to realistically play her character without smirking, and she looks broken in the top, but at some critical moments in the story her character did not bother to call for backup. You know, to a greater extent, the same thing: “I’ll get into a probable demonic evil situation without any knowledge of protection or help from others carrying flashlights or firepower, even if I feel impending doom.” And even more stupid, as it may seem, even if you are approaching the Age of Darkness, these creatures that make you bloody cannot attack if you have a light source, but they appear as people you know and tell you to turn off the source Sveta. Reminds me of the video game "Alone In The Dark"; maybe this film is a break from the concept of this game. <br /> <br /> The best actors in the film are a young guy and Anna. They both die at the end. The whole family is dying. Creatures of Darkness lead them to death, but in fact the stupidity of the characters in the family was the main cause of death. Other adults could be interchangeable with any of the other actors in the Red Shoes Diaries series of beautiful cinemas. <br /> <br /> So, the worst thing about this film is the folly of the characters who blindly stumble upon a clearly abnormal situation, really a shitty plot (this story has an old architect who designs a house with a sacrificial altar - the architect from the very beginning suspected that there will be occult sacrifices in the house, but no one says, because, well, for some reason, they could not find the children, but he did not tell the authorities about the hidden rooms that he designed in the house, but he likes hang around the house for 40 years. because he used to rest on what is going on inside ... derrrrh ... duuuuh), the hackneyed use of intimidation mechanisms (more children standing around in the dark or just appearing in photos, and blood on wallpaper), and the director’s selfishness, which, when you see its DVD features describing his shitty work as a new and original performance, you understand what the real horror of this film is. <br /> <br /> Is it interesting? At double speed on a DVD player with subtitles on, it can be interesting, until you reach the end and realize that the film is crap, otherwise it will play. Cinematic equivalent of a fatty cocktail; empty calories are terrible. <br /> <br /> In the film it seems that the director must have seen The Ring and wanted to try to create something similar in mood, which in this respect the film failed, and also, in this respect, Jaume Balaguero, I believe that you do not love what you do.
