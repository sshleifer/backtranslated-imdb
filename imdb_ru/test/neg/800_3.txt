A box with a button gives a couple the opportunity to get financial freedom, but value is the life of a person whom they have never met. This is a very tedious movie to watch. Richard Kelly, who wrote and directed it, decided to make a film without any benefit. You get into a slow building, one after another, at best, with minor revelations. At certain times, I thought, it would make a big difference at the end, but it means nothing. The film makes you wonder: “This story could be told in 30 minutes without any stretched nonsense.” I will hope that you will avoid this horrible film and preserve your sanity by doing this.
