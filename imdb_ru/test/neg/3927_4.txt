I am the preface stating that I am a big fan of JJL and not Patrick. So I watched it to see her performance and, of course, it was excellent. I do not feel that the director was adequate to the film, as several very bad decisions were made: shot angles, blocking, etc. If the director tried to give him a “realistic” look, he failed and lost some good performance because . It was almost always felt that the camera was too static, too far from intense reactions to the faces - and so many times when the action depended on the proximity of the main characters, the dialogue was slow and loud. This could easily be solved with the help of cutouts or changes in camera angle. But I got the impression that the budget was too small and only one camera was used! I also got the impression that perhaps the scenes were shot several times, and the energy emanating from the actors was ... used up.
