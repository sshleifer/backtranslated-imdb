This film was terrifying. Sorta, how casually watching gay porn is waiting for girls, but they just do not come .... I waited almost 2 hours for the damned stuffed animals .... they just did not come .. Instead, it's just some kind of stupid the ass wandering around a dead cornfield with a camera is a mixture of Blair the Witch and some bad episode of the twilight zone. And the best part is that as of October 23, 2005, they began to shoot a sequel, please do not be fooled by the box, although it looks exactly the same as the first dark crop, which is not a lion's gate, bought the rights to corn: and I had a brilliant idea to release it as a continuation of the original dark harvest, which, it seemed to me, was funny ... The only thing they had in common was that they both were shot dead in a cornfield ... WILLLLLL film does not scare you like first so stay away !!!!!
