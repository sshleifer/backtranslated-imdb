As you can see from other comments, this movie is about the worst movie ever made. Let me see how many different words I can use to describe it: Boring, Unbearable, Laughing, Lousy, Stupid, Awful ..... <br /> <br /> I could continue with such descriptions, but you, probably get the point. <br /> <br /> I would give 0 if it is possible - a bad game, bad direction, a bad production, a bad plot. <br /> <br /> This was done in 2001 and looks more like 1965. Very low budget, boring plot, terrible game, really bad special effects, etc. I rarely ever watch a sci-fi film that I absolutely think is bad. I mean, this is pure trash. This also means nothing. As for the "B-cinema", this is the lowest place. <br /> <br /> I think it would be much more interesting for me if I looked at a blank sheet of paper for 90 minutes. Similar stuff gives a bad name to good low-budget films "B". This makes Ed Wood films look good. <br /> <br /> When watching movies directly on the video, it’s important that when you think you’ve seen the worst, you see something worse! <br /> DJ Perry is a terrible actor, and he does not have individual characteristics that set him apart. <br /> <br /> Avoid these losses at all costs! O mankind!
