Are you kidding me? The music was so loud in this show, I often didnâ€™t even hear the dialogue. And there was nothing great in music. Does anyone know what Jake's mother said when he entered the door ??? And the mushroom cloud looked pretty close, to have so little instant devastation. Anyone who investigates the effects of fallout before writing this. I felt as though a bunch of sit-com actors were sent into place and did not know what to do with the dramatic dialogue. What does a teenager from Kansas know about shopping in Soho ... could we not have a better line? It was boring to tears and just did not sleep from the sharp cry of the confused path to loud music.
