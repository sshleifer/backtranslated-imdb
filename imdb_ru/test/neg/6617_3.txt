Despite the famous cast, this animated version of Dickens' tale is the most boring I've ever seen. Enough that I flew into the first commercial break. I didnâ€™t like the characters at all, and the animation looks expensive. <br /> <br /> I will give this film a very low rating. Give me the Disney version anytime.
