Who wrote this movie? A boring 15 year old boy? <br /> <br /> Can be written by one of the children who were filming in Columbine. <br /> <br /> Absolutely meaningless, not funny, booze ... br / <br /> Plus to this: the French do not put their flag everywhere. You do not enter the French bank and do not see such a tricolor flag. Even on Bastille Day. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against a bloody bath. Just all this is not credible or ridiculous. Or a parody, or something like that. <br /> <br /> Okay, those who liked this movie will tell you that I must be some kind of fascist, so forget about my comments.
