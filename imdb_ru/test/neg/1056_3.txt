Sorry to disagree with you, but I found the DKC series quite interesting. So much so that I invested in the SNES system and my own copies of the games. This, mind you, almost ten years after the first release of DKC 1. The graphics were innovative for their time, the first games for vector graphics for home systems. Music and characters are remembered, and the games brought me and my girlfriend dozens of hours of entertainment. True, the second game was better than the first, and the third, perhaps, lacked the “edge” of the second game. But all three offered different games, and I enjoy them to this day. By the way, I'm old enough to remember when there are NO video games (and the televisions were black and white!).
