Talk about your wild life. Hardly a B-movie, but what kind of hay ... banal fiction and lesbian sex. According to writer and director Cody Jarrett, a trashy piece of fun. The chemical company dumps waste that causes mutants in the fishery. Hot stars Christie Russell as Dr. Barbara Michaels, an EPA agent sent to investigate this environmental dilemma. She accidentally enters a lesbian relationship with bartender Trixie (Ariadne Schaffer), and their love scenes are almost as good as this movie. A frog the size of a man provokes chaos; causing a car accident, raping the daughter of a chemical company boss, raping a girl under a tribune at a football match, hard arm holding a slider in a football match, raping a nun ... everything before a double shot in the chest The antidote was found, everything is ready. Special effects ... well, not special; a guy wearing a rubber frog without genitals to prove himself. Hard tadpoles, do you still want to watch? Come on, but bribe any security witness.
