I rented a DVD at a video store, as an alternative to reading the report. But this is more simply terror. <br /> <br /> Although the film may provide some information from the report in the drama, you accept the word of producers - nowhere is there any mention of the commission’s report in the film. Not alone. <br /> <br /> Everywhere, acting is pretty bad - almost all the stereotypes about “hot” shitty government agents, each of whom thinks he knows more than all the others. Perhaps there is some truth in this, but she has a really bad Hollywood stereotypical scent. <br /> <br /> The ratings and comments of the IMDb user community are generally more correct than the wrong ones, and I began to look at the ratings before renting out whenever I can. <br /> <br /> I would like to have on this.
