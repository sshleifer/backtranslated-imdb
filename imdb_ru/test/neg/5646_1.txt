Have you ever noticed how many really bad movies attract so many 10/10 votes? Not as many puzzles as this happens, but this is not a big part of the film. There are two ways to see how it is distributed in “Mail on Sunday.” <br /> <br /> 1. It's free, so you can't complain much about it. 2. It's free, so it can not be very good. <br /> <br /> My voice is number 2. A free DVD in Sunday newspapers is a recent trend, and some old films have been cast. These are the ones that have been out for ages and have earned the most money they will ever make, so this is a case of something else, this is a bonus. This is the last stop for old movies, not the first for new ones, so you can guess how bad it is if you skip the rental of TV and DVD. <br /> <br /> The advantage is that Vinnie Jones is really trying and Derek Jacobi is as good as Dickens. Minus points is a longer list. Attempting is not the same thing as doing well for poor Winnie, and Jacobi's other wandering character is a talkative ham that has gone. The story is very weak. The story of Dickens has nothing to do with the murders of the film and it feels like another film that was shot to make people think that this is Briton Dan Brown without religion. Auxiliary cast or for money (Vanessa Redgrave must be very hard), or because they are friends or girlfriends of directors. And very, very long. <br /> <br /> Winnie, taking his precious Dickens story with him in his jacket pocket, is good for a couple of laughs, but that's about it. Not funny and not very good even for free.
