If you love me, enjoy movies with stories and compelling actors, then Alien Vs Predator - Requiem is probably not the way. Thus, the land of aliens in a typical American city, the land of predators in an American city, a little quarrel, the US government explodes the city, some people leave ... I'm sorry, I think I could spoil the ending. It is easy to criticize the one who criticizes; people shout, I bet you couldn't do better! I bet I could! Having made this film, he watched it and then turned to congratulate each other by patting him on the back and doing a good job; there must have been a ghost of madness in the room.
