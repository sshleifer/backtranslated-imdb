Normally, I would not spend time watching a movie like Human Pork Chop (2001 version, not to be confused with an earlier film of the same name, which is probably better known in the West as The Untold Story). "), but since the reviews are already rather vague here about what it actually consists of, I decided that it was better to publish something more detailed so that no one would be tempted (like me) to buy it because of the movie mysteriousness I, frankly, would just say STAY. **** BASIC SPOILERS are below **** <br /> <br /> “Human pork chop”, I expected to look like on the Chinese interpretation of popular Japanese films “Guinea Pig.” Anyone who has watched this show enough can see where it came from And. There is a strong sense of humor around him - you can't look at the ridiculous “He never dies” without laughing, and Making a Guinea Pig is an incredible turn of it all upside down, proving that it has just been done, with some joy, rather good-natured potters.All GP films have punk rock, DIY, video aesthetics, occasional flashes of genuine artistry (“Mermaid in the Hatch”), an angry political program and a twisted, irresponsible zeal that puts them into the league their own. <br /> <br /> Human Pork Chop has none of the above. <br /> <br /> It was shot on a 35 mm film (with amazingly good production figures), its duration is 90 grueling minutes, and it is completely devoid of anything redeeming. The plot in a retrospective of police interrogation of suspects tells of systematic torture, death and possible dismemberment of Grace, addicted to heroin street vendors, who is abducted and brutally mistreated with her pimp and his henchmen when she steals money from him. br /> <br /> Despite the fleeting attempts to become a moral play, the film has a detached, inhuman feeling, and one cannot help but dwell on the mindset of those behind it. Although he hesitantly portrays Grace as an innocent victim, the vile nature of his script and the constant, vicious dialogue of the protagonist turn into a shocking, completely undesirable "she deserves it!" point of view that makes it all almost impossible to observe. Much more time is spent on detailing the degradation of Grace, and when her captors are eventually found guilty and imprisoned, it looks like a hasty afterthought by authors who have long ceased to care. <br /> <br /> What makes him talking about why someone wants to see such a film is incomprehensible that even those people who REALLY avoid senseless sex and violence in films will be greatly overlooked. Torture is simply a continuous stream of kicks, slaps, verbal abuse, psychological violence and then more and more bizarre manifestations of power on behalf of kidnappers using Grace's heroin addiction to force her to carry out her orders. And when I say this, don't get me wrong, by the way. Unlike Guinea Pig, with its frequent nude onslaught, which gives an almost teenage sense of mocking behavior in the process, despite the ultraviolet violence, the Human Pork Chop has no such sexual connotation. There is no real nudity in the film, and violence is performed by odious heroes solely by malicious intent (who at the beginning of the film are seen putting a dog in a bag and beating it against a brick wall - don't worry, not real, just a cheap special effect!). <br /> <br /> The only actual bloodshed in the film is the end, when they dismember Grace's body and boil the bones, all this is a very bad special effect (very close to Guinea). The level of the pig), and by that time you will probably already feel too unhappy and sick to even think about what is happening. <br /> <br /> The film is depressingly bleak and uncompromising by analogy with the film Buddy Giovinazzo. "Battle Shock", and I think you can even compare, with a single click. Both films deal with the gradual physical decline of an individual, which exists in a nightmarish environment, devoid of any social or morally redeemed characters, and both films are “particularly culminating” with the inevitable inevitable death of the individual. <br /> <br /> For the sake of justice, neither glamor nor violence (while Guinea Pig can easily be blamed for this), but one cannot help but wonder where there is a place for a film like this. In a frank view of such cruelty and a multitude of real moments, it is not able to manifest itself, and in the lead tempo, the practically non-existent storyline and the aforementioned absence of any entertainment value, I simply cannot understand what could cause someone to see something either like this. I did it only to the end, solely in order to be able to honestly view it ... which, I hope, I have already done. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 0 out of 10. Welcome to the lower part of the trunk.
