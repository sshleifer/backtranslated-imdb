Oh dear, oh dear! What were they thinking about? Scary script, terrible game. I'm not even sorry for the actors ... they took their checks to the bank and smiled happily. <br /> <br /> Since when did the Charing Cross air barrel appear in the Bank? Why do vehicles crossing Tower Bridge enter the city when a wave breaks out? Why is the Tower Bridge not overcrowded when the city is evacuated? How does Carlile dive into a raging stream ... and survive? I could go on ... and go on. <br /> <br /> In the command room there is no sense of urgency. With the same success, they can wait until the eleven-year-old England returns to the field after a tea break in the Lord. <br /> <br /> When I wait for advertisements, something is said there to learn more about diarrhea treatment with impatient anticipation. <br /> <br /> Absolutely disgusting trash!
