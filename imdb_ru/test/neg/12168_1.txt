Please - if you did not try to move away from this garbage and plan to watch this film / mini-series - do yourself a favor and find something else you can do. Brush your teeth, start learning to play the cello, beat your dog - whatever you choose will be better done than watching this junkie. This is not a bad film from which you can get some laughter - it just sucks in all possible ways. Just boring from start to finish. <br /> <br /> And those animal lovers who feel that my comment is higher are not sensitive - if your dog could talk, he or she would beg for beating and would not suffer because of observing this mess.
