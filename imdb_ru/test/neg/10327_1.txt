This film is so bad that I spent a lot of time talking about it. So bad ... really ... ... BAD ... and I'm not even that critical ... ... I am almost ashamed to admit that I saw it ... A few minutes Sandra will show you how far she really did this ... I mean, everything that is next to this is really worthy of her Oscar ... I believe that the only way for her to look at this is that there is no way except after this ... somewhere ... but really ... so bad ... ... horrible really ... bad is too good a word for this s ** t .... but I donâ€™t want to have mind ... but really, How can you not spend 90 minutes ... 90 minutes of your life that I will never come back ... I could spend 90 minutes on something better ... for example, sit on my ass and look into space .. it would be better to spend time ... (leaves, shaking his head)
