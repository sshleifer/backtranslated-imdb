I had nothing to do before going out, so I did not want to watch something too heavy, I chose the perfect movie. It must have been a gift from Barrymore from someone she slept with, director Raja Gosnell did nothing but stupid shit, and the inscriptions on it are just awful. In which high school can you register without the presence of parents, without confirmation of age or previous education? They allowed all the children to come to the prom without shirts, in tight leather swimsuits, in ass shorts, and one girl was dressed like Eve, only with fig leaves? She declares that she is 25 years old and her brother is 23 years old, but is there no repression from school, parents or any lawsuits against the newspaper for fraud or espionage? The boss of the newspaper wants to catch the teacher in a scandal with minors, but does not understand that the teacher is 25 years old, so in any case it will be a provocation? Do they allow the camera and record personal conversations of people with minor children? Interestingly, if I hired my younger sister to return to HS with a camera on her and shoot teenage girls for personal use, I would not have any problems ??? NAHHHH No problem. Didn't she have to go to the gym or go to the toilet at some point? The secondary characters in this were similar to the cardboard clippings of who the schoolchildren believed to be and all had a stereotype. Jessica Alba is just plain embarrassed at this robbery for the camera at every opportunity. In which world do parents not become suspicious when a school stallion miraculously invites their graduate to graduation? And they don't ask the guy inside to meet him, like any other parent in the story. If any guy in my school or any other school had deceived my sister about it and threw eggs into her in a prom dress, he would have been in a tight fitting body for the rest of his life. This film is so contrived and predictable that it makes him sick, and why in the end everyone (including Alpo girls) support this chick when two days before they hate her ???? <br /> <br /> DUMB, DUMB AND DULL.
