This film has many recurring conversations about “cold spots” (signaling the presence of a ghost) and characters praying to surround themselves with white light to protect themselves. To recreate the feeling of the film, I will repeatedly make references to cold places in this review. I have seen worse films than the "St. Frensville Experiment", but this is probably the most "forgettable" of all ("it gets cold!"). In general, about 20 people spend the night in a haunted house. This is shot as a supposedly real documentary. This is obviously not realistic, but there are several cold places in the house. SPOILERS - (as if you can't predict much of the plot!). Little is happening in this movie. We have a time-tested horror cult, when the cat jumped out of the shelter at the very beginning, as a "training" fright to warm the public. People wander around with lanterns, from time to time reminding the house that they came in peace — that they do not harm the spirits (or cold spots) inside. From time to time the door closes and scares someone. Of course, the ouija board appears. They communicate with a ghost named "Charles". The girl eats a sandwich with a cockroach in it. More cold spots. Another door closes, and some guy leaves because of a knock at the door. Scud, talker, he says. Oh my god, someone is talking. "Surround yourself with white light." I admit that there is a good scene in the attic (where the chair is overturned by a ghost), which really took me by surprise. But aside from some funny bad dialogue, the scene of the chair (the actual fraction of a second when it is upset, nothing immediately before or after this moment) is the only good thing in this film. However, there are still cold spots. In the end, the film ends. No one dies. No further details required. I was not a big fan of the Blair Whitch Project, but it looks like a masterpiece next to the St. Francisville Experiment. You may not wonder if this is a real documentary, but whether or not it was intended to be funny. I still don't know. But whatever he was, he failed.
