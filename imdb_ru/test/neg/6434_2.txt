Now television programs (at least in England) are filled with home improvement, bargain shopping, home hunting and culinary shows in the afternoon, and the chances of any terrestrial broadcaster digging out full ambiguity like this may take a couple of hours of screen time on a slow day. are at least small. But in the eighties, the BBC did just that, and I think I watched it. And this is evidence of the irresistible strangeness of this Hungarian-American co-production, which I still remember in large chunks of it, more than twenty years later. To begin with, the eponymous hero appears briefly during introductory captions, but disappears again for at least half an hour. (Imagine that American TAILS are edited so that Feivel is nowhere to be seen, and you will understand how confusing it is.) This is an incredibly weird animation in which one of the characters gets their carefully waxed mustaches trimmed and stretched, complete with loud sound effect that makes him look at the boss. It is probably funny if you are stoned, but it hinders the child very much. Speaking about this, the infamous scene of the Hippopotamus Hippopotamus is presented in an abstract manner - clouds in the blurry forms of the hippopotamus are struck by lightning - but this is still rather unpleasant. In fact, this film is rather cold and unattractive, a sad state of affairs, which is hardly helped by a strange production design, all dirty colors, fragile lines, bloated forms and this uniquely European gloom, reminiscent of Jan Swankmayer, but not so convincing, Then finish it all, we get songs Osmonds! This is not so much a terrible film, as deeply erroneous, not so much fantastic, as a rather bad journey.
