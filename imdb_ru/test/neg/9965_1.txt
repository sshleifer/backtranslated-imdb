This must be the worst piece of cinematic shit I've ever seen. This makes Mel Brooks films worthy of an Oscar by comparison. Jim VanBebber should be publicly praised for trying to pass him off as ANY form of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Although some may say that this film fits the low-budget genre of such classics as Texas Chainsaw Massacre or the Night of the Living Dead, the production cost is not questioned. It’s VanBebber’s ability to create and present a plausible storyline. Deplorable casting. For the role of Charlie, he had to choose the first actor he saw with a beard and long hair. Never mind that this actor’s hair went halfway in his back, (Manson never went too far his shoulders) , this actor spoke horribly monotonously without such a share of personality that Steve Reilsbek or even Jeremy Davis provided his images of Manson, the actor chosen for the performance of “Tex”, Watson had curly blond hair instead of straight dark hair - a fact that everyone knows who has shown even the most distant interest in the Manson case, he looks like a farmer from Minnesota in “A Little House on the Prairie.” The actress who plays Susan Atkins has an ass wider than Oprah’s. Although familiar with family members know that “Clem” was considered somewhat backward, the actor who portrayed him did it in such a stiff, Chaplinesque way, as if watching the old act of Vaudevile. Instead of Sharon Tate looking like a beautiful pregnant woman, the actress looked like a bloated, alcoholic trailer trash. VanBebber speeds up shooting in some places for an artistic effect, but this technique has not been shown to be remotely useful since "The Munsters". In the end credits all the known members of the family are listed, but we never get to know most of them, and with those we get to know, we do not know who they are. <br /> <br /> In this film, the facts are also destroyed. , Lotsapoppa did not die in real life, Stephen Parent was shot four times, not twice, Abagail Folger didn’t have a cut throat. Where were Mary Brunner and Bruce Davis during the murder of Himnan? Patricia Crenwinkel never wore a Dorothy Hamill hairstyle. <br /> <br /> The most amazing aspect of this film - what did the modern "freaks" have to do with this film? Why was the girl wearing a rubber mask with a dildo? What was their problem with the journalist? What was the meaning or goal of the final confrontation? Why were they included, period? The viewer never knows! <br /> <br /> Holy mackerel, I could go on and on, but the place is in the way. Do not try to eat popcorn during this garbage, because your hand will be too busy scratching your head while you constantly say: “What the ...?”
