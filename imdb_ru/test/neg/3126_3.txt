I would like Depardieu to finish his book and see that it has become a dazzling success. At least, he would have wound up with something. <br /> <br /> The film seemed meaningless, incoherent and very stylish, like some other recent French films. Do not knock. Most recent American films are meaningless and incoherent and have no style. We should be grateful, I believe, for the photo that challenges the European city in the midst of a windy continental winter, and for the elliptical conversations that challenge our ability to understand what happened. <br /> <br /> But there is an opportunity to be too good. Golubeva is found near the sea in the middle of a frosty night, stumbling over dreams and so on. (There are several dream episodes that include such things as swimming in a river of blood. You will like it if you are Vlad Tepes.) Many die. Catherine Deneuve dies in a suicide on a motorcycle. I do not know why. Young Golubeva dies too, and I don’t know why she dies too. They hit her in the face, fall on the pavement and die. <br /> <br /> Allegedly, there is a clear sex scene. I will have to take their word for it, because, although he is stylishly photographed, he is stylishly photographed in almost complete darkness. Do not worry about the shock of children. In any case, they are probably already sleeping by this time. <br /> <br /> Depardieu is not a bad actor. When we see him getting worse from a well-groomed handsome young man — well, handsome, except that his nose doesn't seem to get out of his way — toward a limping, suicidal, hairy physical ruin, we feel sorry for this guy. Golubeva has a pale, beautiful face, with huge half-closed eyes and wide cheeks like that of a doll. Her next film is to be a remake of Lewton’s film “I Was Walking With Zombies”. Then there is this mysterious guy who heads the group. I think this is a band. As far as I can tell, the band consists of a dozen drummers and a dozen musicians playing the electric guitar. Each viewer will find the resulting sound interesting, but uncultured listeners who love “easy listening” may not like it. If you don’t like the music, it is beneficial because the sinister composer and presenter hit the head with the cane of Depardieu. <br /> <br /> I must say, I found it hardly worth putting up with. (And this is also a longie.) At times it was like waiting in your car at a railroad crossing, while a long, long freight train rumbles slowly, sometimes stopping completely. I wish there were a few jokes.
