This film has it all: it's a thriller, a chase film, a romantic story, a story about a mafia, a comedy, a road film ... well, in fact, it's nothing at all. <br /> <br /> All the time you are waiting for something interesting, but no, you are still watching the same boring, boring and superficial cliche of a film with a very bad soundtrack. Even the star composition lacks credibility. A hired killer with his quirks, a girl who is hard to play, guys from the crowd, behaving hard and incompetent cops, yawn ... <br /> <br /> I would not recommend watching Backtrack. If you want to watch a good film directed by a famous actor, go and watch “Three Melquiades Pop Burials” by Tommy Lee Jones. That's what I call worth seeing.
