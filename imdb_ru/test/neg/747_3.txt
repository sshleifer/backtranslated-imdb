The BBC and the Arts & Entertainment Network should be ashamed of having imposed this unfortunate film on the world. The game, with the exception of Robert Hardy in the role of General Tilney, is at best amateurish, and at worst excruciatingly painful. Costumes are extraordinary and have some really terrible excesses - was the costume designer obsessed with feathers for women's hats? Of course, EVERY woman in Bath did not have feathers in her headdress at the beginning of the 19th century. Production figures are small, and the pace of the film makes you feel that it was hastily and awkwardly edited at the last minute. In general, a painful film that I had to force myself to watch until the end. It's a shame because the producers obviously spent a lot of money on costumes and filming in the field. Compared to Emma Thompson's sublime "Sensation and Sensitivity" or the extraordinary 1995 production of Pride and Prejudice or the subtle intensity of 1995 Persuasion, this production of Northanger Abbey turns into a grave.
