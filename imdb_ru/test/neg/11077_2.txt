I cannot say whether the “Cave” is a “Cave” robbery, because I have not seen it. I saw "Descent", and it's not scary, but it is very difficult to look at it, like this one. It is difficult to watch, for example, very little light and a lot of fast movements, so it’s hard for you to say what you are looking at. At times I think you should be scared, judging by the music, but afraid of what? Bad camera work? Bad light? If so, then it must be the worst movie. The story is that a group of cavers goes to a cave in Kazakhstan (Borat’s house) and goes down, but something (of course) with them. And what is it? One guy says that this is a hybrid of a wolf and a bear, that is, just before it is torn apart, but whatever it is, you will not be able to see it. And only when you think (or hope) that the film ends, as the screen darkens a little, you see the two remaining cavers (two women) who wake up somewhere in the clothes of Betty and Wilma and start trying to find a way out wherever they are . They drink some water and start to eat SOMETHING until they find out what it is and start to vomit ... and then the mystery of what is in the cave will appear and you will be simply amazed. Maybe, maybe not. Stupid, stupid, stupid .... I think that at the moment I have done quite well with cave films, 2 out of 10.
