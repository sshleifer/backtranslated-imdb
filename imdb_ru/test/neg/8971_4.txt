It feels very stilted and patronizing to a great extent. The whole plot is extremely forced - especially the "gallant" attempts to save the college from ruin, and the moralistic overtones (especially the leading lady) lose a little. <br /> <br /> But there are one or two comic strip moments that help ease boredom, and the dances are pretty funny (especially for prospective amateurs — ha, ha!) <br /> <br /> A shop owner and a young guy, performing exciting dances were especially vibrant. And I liked Peter Hayes’s impressions of Charles Lawton and Ronald Coleman.
