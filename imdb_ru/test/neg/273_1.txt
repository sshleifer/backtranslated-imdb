I saw "professional" reviews claiming that Julia Roberts played herself "was smart and very funny." I think no. Is the actress playing by herself? And do it with her usual vertigo whenever she tries a comedy? Talk about Hollyweird narcissism at its maximum. Why she just does not stand there and does not say: “I, I, I. Look at me! ”The director and writer should be shot for not thinking about something better than what could be a charming continuation. and, by the way, Stephen, when the audience begins to pay more attention to the strange camera angles than to the story with which you had a problem. Capra, Hitchcock, they all used several creative cameras, but they were talented enough not to lose an audience or just show off to the camera. You seem to have forgotten the cardinal rule of filmmaking in the name of “style”. However, the chemistry of Pitt and Zeta-Jones is pretty good, maybe if they made the film more focused around them and did without narcissism, which could work. Zeta Jones shows again that she has more talent and beauty than Roberts could have dreamed of. Unfortunately, this film is wasting talent and failing in many ways. I want my money back.
