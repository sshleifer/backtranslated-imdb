The only saving factor for this film was the fact that he was on television for free, and that this probably helped the Romanian economy. In addition, Hallmark needs to reconsider this division of its empire and, perhaps, keep its films more focused on the strange love relationship between cancer-affected hemophilia in Mississippi. If you go into details about how reckless this film is, you can give him credit for what he remembered. It was not I remember the act of observing him, there were vampires (some of them teenage) and very bad dubbing. The one who worked on the dubbing of this film should be moved to another sector of society ... maybe to the catering, to the deaf. If you have the opportunity, watch this movie just because many other really bad movies look like Oscar in retrospect. Again, if you really ended up in the profile of this movie, I think it might be too late ...
