The scientist Charles and his wife (or assistant) Marissa receive some objects and a skull from an ancient Indian cemetery, and during the cleaning of the vase they are attacked and killed by a mysterious creature, a human skeleton. Then a military detachment under the command of Captain Leary (Michael Rooker) is looking for two groups of four soldiers, each of which disappeared into the jungle. They face the Skeleton, shoot him while he kills every soldier. Then the "Skeleton Man" goes to the power station, and Captain Leary explodes the object, destroying the supernatural being. <br /> <br /> I bought the Skeleton Man on DVD, expecting to see funny trash, but found terribly boring Irritating and senseless rubbish, with shoots and explosions. The idiotic story is completely disconnected and has no meaning, and the military team consists of fools who insist on shooting at the supernatural Skeleton Man until they are completely killed. Their leader is also the most stupid, as a result of which, in the end, an entire object was blown up to destroy the supernatural robbery of the alien Predator warrior. On DVD, you can use the fast forward button on the film and reduce the suffering of the viewer. My voice is two. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Skeleton"
