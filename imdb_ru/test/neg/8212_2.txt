The basic idea of ​​"Dungeon of Harrow" is not so bad. The game, however, is bad. The lighting is bad. The music is bad. Scenes of torture without emotion. There really is not much to recommend this film. You know what movie you need when the title says “The Star of a Special Guest” and indicate who you have never heard. You can also say: "Rex Hamilton, like Abraham Lincoln." because there is no one to be identified in this film. There are one or two worthy moments, mostly towards the end, and I think the main plot plan may have contained an original idea, but this alone is not enough to prevent you from waking up through this inept yawn.
