It was a weird movie. A bit of horror and certainly noir film. Some fifth observers meet and mysteriously begin to die off with a Japanese dagger in their hands after the appearance of Monsieur Colomba (Bela Lugosi). <br /> <br /> A lone ranger soon appears in the face of FBI agent Richard Dick Martin (Clayton Moore). Martin cannot find the killer, since he is more interested in the missing doctor's niece (Joan Barclay), who is part of the gang. <br /> <br /> After the last person dies, and the doctor is terribly disfigured by some strange serum, the true story of the group comes out, and it is here that it becomes interesting and strange. I will not spill it. <br /> <br /> Lugosi was an amazing killer.
