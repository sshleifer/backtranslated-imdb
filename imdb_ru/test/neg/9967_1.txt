I was lucky to see this film because I heard a kind word about him: it was supposed to be this exciting, real criminal event, disturbing, shocking ... with all this jazz. Well, it bothers me, because I spent the money on it, and I'm shocked that something so terrible that God really released. That's all. <br /> <br /> This is the supposed “new look” on the family of crazy addicts, losers Charles and their murder. But if this is a “new look”, then it is probably “new”, as in “fresh and completely inept”: just watching it caused me a headache, and I had to give up trying to figure it out or even understand that the director intended to do it. <br /> <br /> I suppose I should say something about the plot, but in fact it was so stupid and disconnected that I hardly remember whether there was a plot at all. There was something about “Manson's cassette” staged by a radio DJ (or a television producer?), Then an hour of meaningless random shots from the “family” in 69th, then the murder of Polanski (like a bad school play) and, finally, some then the idiotic part about how a bunch of skinheads get drunk and beat each other to hell in the alley (I'm not kidding), and then it was over (thank God) (don't ask me to figure it out. I just remember what I saw!) Speeches were terrible. And how difficult is it to make a convincing "Manson"? Take a short skinny guy, put on him a dirty wig and a hairy beard. There is your Manson. But this "Manson" does not even look right. He just looks like a guy in a cheap wig and is glued to a black-painted Santa Claus beard. <br /> <br /> Or maybe this is what this film says: the Manson family had no meaning, so this film also has no meaning. This is symbolic! (Yes, right) I'm still so angry at wasting money on it that I stopped my usual confrontation on this site and registered only to vote 1 for this film and publish this warning, which we hope will prevent others from spending your money for this trash. Stay away from it, not even worth renting. <br /> <br /> ps. The recent American television production Helter Skelter received bad reviews here, but I saw it last month (I also saw the original of 1976) and let me tell you, compared to the Manson Family, the new Helter Skelter is BRILLIANT and IMPROVED. And I was disappointed in this! This is how bad the Manson Family is: it makes an imperfect and mostly disappointing television film perfect.
