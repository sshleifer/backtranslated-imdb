I broke my own rule by buying this film from the basket for $ 5.88 at Walmart. In fact, if there is a big star in a movie, and you have never heard of it before, it usually happens for a reason. Well, in the case of this film, the reason is that it sucked! They stick a photo of Sandra Bullock and call it on the cover of the DVD as bait, and a small fish immediately appeared on it. I was thinking about donating a disc to charity or transferring it to the library, but I don’t think I would subject anyone else in the world to this film. The worst lines are: “What do you mean army pals?” “What do you mean, your dad?”
