Anthony Wong stars both in this and in the original (much superior) Untold Story, but this is where the similarity ends. Wong obviously does not fulfill his role, but instead plays a clumsy police officer associated with a rather suspicious woman, Fang (Miss Singapore 1994, Pauline Sun), who is undoubtedly suppressed. But her tame jealous "I want to be with a guy who is with a girl," the killer is not so convincing as the fact that Wong played in the first. The film itself seems tired and by numbers. Yeng Fan, as the unfaithful girl of love interest in physical education, tries to keep her from being completely bored, undressing when it is possible, and the Sun has a good ass, but even this cannot save this nonsense. <br /> <br /> My rating: D <br /> <br /> Mei Ah DVD Extras: interview with Cheung Kam Ching & Paulyn Sun; Anthony Wong filmography; very brief overview; Theatrical movie trailer; and trailers for "Chinese Erotic Ghost Story" and "Twenty Something"
