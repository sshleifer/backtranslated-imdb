If you're wondering if Disney can broadcast a show with a more spoiled character than Paris, more superficial than Britney, more stupid than Jessica, and more narcissistic than DOORS OF THE NEXT DOOR, do not be surprised. Surprisingly, Selena Gomez, apparently, was to become a heroine. She should also be an outcast of spoiled, shallow, stupid, narcissistic "popular" girls in school, which is no more believable here than for Hilary Duff in Lizzie McGuire. Plots range from recycled QUANTITIES and WHEN GINNEY to the "parodies" of HARRY POTTER. The older boy alternates with a magical genius and an inability to cope with the complexities of his own shoelaces. The youngest boy is just another of the clever jerks with smart mouths who grew up on TV, like cockroaches in New York (and with the same appeal). Dad is a stereotypical stupid television dad, and mom ... well, she's not really terrible. But everything pales next to the disgusting, disgusting, and yet terribly exciting (like a bad car accident) spectacle of Miss Lopez's smug, smug, snotty notion. And, again, she is a heroine.
