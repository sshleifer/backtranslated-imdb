There is nothing to spoil, but it can be SPOILER, so be careful. <br /> <br /> Special effects were at the level of a video game - about five years ago, or perhaps the original Star Trek. The action was just pathetic - some stupid blonde wandering through the desert, while the voice in the background is buzzing. And further. And further. It was half the track and the drones I really went through. Progress is interrupted by several fights. The ships blast each other for no real reason, which is sporadic. Again, the point is not that there is a real fight you expect from the film, more like a cheap video game. Boi-ki! Boi-ki! The ship explodes. Next ship Apparently some ships are looking for a blonde. Here, in the distant future, ships must be short-sighted and astigmatic, because many of them pass right over the stylishly dressed futuristic girl in black, but they never see her. <br /> <br /> Then there are a couple of choreography battles that look like something that schoolchildren wear. Again, the rough mentality of video games is noticeable. The fighters go to “Battle Mode”, turning over something on their wrists, and a loud computerized voice repeats and “Battle Mode” flashes. This should be a trendy design if you are trying to sneak up on someone. Then you go to a large power plant, which looks like the tower of the power line of the current day, and connect it to recharge. LOL, I'm not kidding, you can't think of it, it's like watching a damn video game around 2000, only the game is better in the game. <br /> <br /> More hiking. Then she appears in the "City". (The track with a backward sound becomes even more lamer.) She enters into a fight with a future robot who cannot hit her with her big gun, even if she runs directly in front of him, about five feet away. Obviously, the robots of the distant future are about as useful as toasters in battle. She throws sand in her eyes and slaughters him to death, throwing stones at him. rofl, by this time I had about 95% tolerance, the contours of nausea flashed red. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, she was tied to a rocket with a rope. I'm not kidding, tied directly to the rocket. It must be an advanced form of transport. At that moment I was saved. <br /> <br /> This film is a shame for a film that has been shot at the moment. Just awesome shame. There was some kind of stupid story, but the film was distracted from it - someone constantly chats about the "mother". <br /> <br /> I gave him two, because there were several scenes in which quite nice science fiction pieces were shown as background. Unfortunately, the plot, action, action, cinematography and narration distracted from this work and humiliated him. No kidding.
