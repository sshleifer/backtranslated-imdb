I watched the Halloween episode ... My God, I wanted to die. The game was just awful. The lines were uttered without conviction. This is a bad idea for the show, I mean, who would watch some kind of web show in real life? Miranda Cosgrove perfectly played a minor role in Drake and Josh, but she doesn’t have the strength of character to secure her own show. I'm even more upset because her departure is the main reason Drake and Josh ended up. Her own show approached her ... she jumped from the ship to Drake and Josh. Then they decided that maybe they would do something with Drake and Josh who moved to college, explaining the loss of Meagan as a character, but Drake already had thoughts to move on to more significant and better things, and he decided that Miranda did it why not him. The best part of the show was the theme of the song ... catchy, good melody in the swamp of mediocrity. Of course, Drake Bell dubbed Miranda’s voice and wrote the melody ...
