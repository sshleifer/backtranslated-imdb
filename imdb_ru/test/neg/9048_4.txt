Eaten Alive is much simpler than Ruggero Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust, but it's also a much more stupid movie. I mean, sometimes it can be unintentionally funny, but the plot is so stunningly idiotic that I couldn't help but lose all patience to the end. Tough guy Robert Kerman (Cannibal Holocaust) teams up with Janet Agren (Gates of Hell; here with unbearable accent) to search in the jungles of New Guinea for Agrenâ€™s sister, who brainwashed the leader of a religious cult (Ivan Rassimov). ) torture of animals and some kind of stupid cannibalism. Under the direction of Umberto Lenzi, the film is so unbearable that it is difficult to take it seriously, but if you like a junk movie with a lot of unintentional laughter, that's not bad. <br /> <br /> 4/10
