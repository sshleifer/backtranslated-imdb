As long as you go to this film with the understanding that there will be no historical fact in it, this is not a bad thing. <br /> <br /> This is on par with Sam Raymi's “Hercules: Legendary Journeys”, as far as plot, action, humor and production values ​​are concerned. You will see similarities at several points. However, most battle scenes are not so good, and the film suffers from this. <br /> <br /> Jack Palance commands the screen as he always does, and you never get the impression that he gives something less than his level is better. Same for Oliver Reed. The problem is that their strong performances make the skills of Don Diamont with a square jaw even more awkward. The many-year-old beat player Cas Anwar was also very good, playing a character very similar to Salmonia in the aforementioned Hercules. <br /> <br /> If you like low-budget films about swords and witchcraft from the early 80s, I’m probably going to enjoy this show as well. It is a pity that they attached to him the name Marco Polo. It really has nothing to do with Marco’s life, contrary to the expectations of most people who want to watch this movie.
