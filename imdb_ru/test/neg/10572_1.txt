Went with friends and one of my friends, mom, thinking that this would be a good way to start spring break, but the film was awful. We all agree that this should not be PG-13. More like R stuff. A lot of sexual dialogue, cursing and appealing to boys and girls (below the belt). Not worth the time or money. I urge you not to leave or rent it when it comes out. If in the end you go, do not take small children. Not the type of film to see with your family! If you are interested in learning about the content, refer to the section with recommendations for the content on the page of the movie “Superhero” in IMDb Most of the content that was supposed to be funny was extremely coarse. Especially when they laugh at Stephen Hawking.
