Sappy. <br /> <br /> I liked the way they went to Haaavad Baa to quote each other’s books to impress the ugliest girl there. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the cleaner at my school is a genius too, but he is waiting to get this big construction job. <br /> <br /> Just because you keep your nose on the grindstone, there is no reason to try cutting their steak. “Do you like apples?” <br /> <br /> the guy nods or something like that. <br /> <br /> “Well, how do you like DEM APPLES!” Wow, this is a genius. <br /> <br /> Minnie Driver will give his number to anyone. Robin Williams does not know how to draw and keeps good books on the top shelf. And there is a professor who always wears a priest's headscarf for no reason.
