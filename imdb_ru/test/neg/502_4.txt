The movie “Heaven's Gate” was a good preview, although it was still tedious for more than 4 hours. But the film received an excellent license - as usual with Hollywood. James Averill (Chris Christopherson) and "Elle" were really married in real life. Their main contribution to the Johnson County War was to begin by hanging it. Well, by that I mean that it happened at the beginning, not at the end. Here is the real scenario: James Averill and Ellen Watson were secretly married, because each family could be given one manor. By serving as individuals, they could get two estates. They chose houses on Mad Woman's Creek, actually controlling the water above the land owned by a powerful member of the Cattle Breeder Association. He offered to redeem them repeatedly, from which they refused. <br /> <br /> Although in real life she is described as the owner of a brothel (Cattle Kate) and the prostitute herself (as well as in the film), there is no real evidence that this is true. It is known that she bought many heads of sick cattle, bore him back to life, and then was accused by the Association of cattle breeders in receiving livestock in exchange for "indecent actions". In the end, she was accused of rustling - the act is almost certainly not true. That's about this part of the myth of the "American West", which is the myth of inaction, covering a period of about a hundred years. <br /> <br /> In real life, She and Jim Averill were once surprised by several members of the Association of Pastoralists, taken in their arms and quickly hanged. Those who committed injustice have never been brought to justice. But it was the first link that led to the murder of Nate Champion, and the start of the war in Johnson County. <br /> <br /> Not at all like the Hollywood version, which shows her shot at the end. <br /> <br /> Besides that, I think the main problem with the film was the editor, who could make the action faster by using more skillful editing.
