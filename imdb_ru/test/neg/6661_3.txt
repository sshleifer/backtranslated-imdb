I looked at “Gristle” primarily at the presence of Michael Dorn, because I liked his image of Worf on Star Trek TNG, but I never saw him outside my makeup. Dorn seems to have a good presence and probably has the potential for a lucrative acting career. This film, however, gave him few dramatic problems, except to prove that he really can use the word "F". <br /> <br /> It seems that this film was made by someone who imagined himself a striker Type of thinking, with a public conscience. Yes, in 1965. Today, the themes are so battered, sophisticated, and Cornball that even the terrible “Bamboozled” Spike Lee looks good compared to him. <br /> <br /> This crime film has a complex double puff - triple and four-fold intersection, but the plot is so confusing that in the first 30 minutes it collapses by itself. Mostly, after this point, I just watched how it was going, and I was a little curious about how each scene would evolve. There is a great cast here - you will recognize almost everyone as characters from much better films. Why are they all in this? I suspect that it was 1) Work, and some money, even if modest. 2) Maybe the director knows all of these actors from acting classes and social connections in Los Angeles - you know, they may have participated to support him as the guy fighting out of the movie on the third and fourth levels of the Hollywood scene. I do not know ... but the film was unfinished - not quite "finished". I gave him 3 points, although my attachment to the actors did not diminish from my admiration for their previous work. Hopefully, everyone has since moved on to more professional, more thoroughly executed and more thorough projects.
