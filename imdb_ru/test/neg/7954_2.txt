What about Scream Baby Scream should make me not feel like a fool when I buy? I bought it because, God help me, I'm a fan of the old B-cinema, even something as useless as this one. Nevertheless, something in this film annoys me, perhaps it is Janet, Janet seems to be frozen and mocked, apparently with the intention to make her as deep and noble, with an expression on her face that screams from constipation, she, it seems, can not agree to everything that wants her excited boyfriend. I am glad that this is her only role. What really annoys me is the fact that this is a horror film of the 1960s, which became terribly erroneous, and, as we all know, Floridian is called “blood zero”. It seems that the director began with Herschell Lewis's style, but refused the bloody scenes when his wife found out about it, so instead we end up with one boring conversation after another, and, in fact, do not irritate a lot. In other words, we end up with Flore Bor Joseph Adler should be confused. Janets guy, Jason is almost as funny as she is, this guy has something negative to say about everything absolutely, if you think about it, he is probably the least nice good guy in horror history. The only thing that this film actually has is that it carries the vibe of the B-gore of the 60s / early 70s, which can be found in such things as The Undertaker and his pals, Bloody Freak, or almost anything from Gershella Lewis. Even Rodney from The Terrible Deuce is in it, I thought his caveman comedy routine was annoying, most everything from coil to coil was silly, even the scene of the trip was silly. The only positive thing is a small number of beach landscapes, but mostly it is Janet, whining that life is not perfect. In the only true ironic twist, Scream Baby Scream becomes even less interesting when the story finally begins, after about 45 minutes. If you don’t care whether your entertainment looks or not, but the red color offends you, you can not hate it. Why does Troma spread it? Wouldn't that be something weird about video? Scream Baby Scream may very well be the worst Florida horror / bloody era of its era, but, I believe, under the incredible characters and disjointed plot potential. Scream, baby, scream, in fact, it seems that he has to follow the pattern of the Bloody Holiday, so to steal a quote from Janet: “If she doesn't fit, I throw her out” 2/10
