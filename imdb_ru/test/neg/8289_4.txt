The star of a female track in high school dies from a blood clot after winning a race with the community in a scandal with coach George Michaels (Christopher George plays him as the main fighter who is VERY demanding of the athletes under his watch). He will be canned after the school releases, providing a film with his motive as a possible killer. Some perverted psychopaths in sweats (very similar to what Michaels often wears), using a stopwatch to determine the time of their executions, kill members of the athletics team, of which the dead runner was a part. Soon, anxious parents call Director Guglione (Michael Pataki) and wonder why their children did not come home after the prom. Inspector Halliday (Carmen Argenziano) begins to mow around campus at the request of concerned parents. Instantly besieged Michaels becomes the main suspect after the gymnast's body is found in the locker. Ensign Ann (Patch MacKenzie) returned home from her base in Guam to get her sister's diploma, and soon she will face the killer on the climatic chase scene. Kevin Bagger (E Danny Murphy) is a tired guy of a lost star. <br /> <br /> A rather unhurried slasher distributes the death episodes a bit, trying to mix humor in himself and failing miserably. The sequence of low quality killings only reinforces laughter, such as a sword put into a soccer ball thrown into a football playerâ€™s belly, or a pair of clippers that used to decapitate a poor soul that receives a leak. Linnea Quigley plays the funny role of the excited student Dolores, who sleeps with her music teacher for a higher class and always chases the male stallion (the recipient of the shears before he has the opportunity to go to bed Dolores outside the prom). Bath White plays here the early role of a blonde who discovers the body of a dead gymnast in a locker. Virgil Fry plays the stupid role of an incompetent officer.
