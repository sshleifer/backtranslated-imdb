This month, Brazilian cable television presents Yadon Ilaheya on its Cult channel. I saw the trailer, listened to the ads and decided to watch this movie. Indeed, this is absurd, boring, pretentious, meaningless nonsense nonsense about the conflict in the Middle East, and with Soultangler, they are definitely the worst films I tried to see. I really spent forty-three minutes of my life watching the first half of this shit, especially recommended for torturing enemies. How can this film be awarded and nominated for prizes inclusive in Cannes? My voice is one (terrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): “Intervenção Divina” (“Divine Intervention”)
