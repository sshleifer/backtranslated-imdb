A terrible game, a terrible scenario, completely unreal. The bumblebee flies anyway, illustrates the clich√©s and sentimentalism that film studios love to press the audience to their throats. Elijah Wood in the lead role is unimaginably bad, and the plot plots are invented and well fed. The relationship of Cook and Wood is ridiculous at best. But the worst element of the Bumblebee is the script. This is one of the most stunning bad conversations I've ever heard. Bumblebees, actually crawling in my ears and tingling eardrums, would be preferable to hearing Elijah Wood robotic spitting out their pseudo-deep lines. I would like the Bumblebee Project to be carried out on me so that I, fortunately, cannot remember this bitch.
