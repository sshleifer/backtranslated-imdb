My brother worked in the cinema when I watched this movie; I saw it for free and still went out. I saw a lot of movies in my time, but it was the worst. When people ask me what the worst movie I've ever seen, I mention this movie in less than one second. This film is bad because it moves from one unfortunate plot to another, it encourages stereotypes about disgusting blacks and a terrible flow. If you want to see how to make children cry and tear at the same time, study this movie. Well, this film is not a good "bad", but a terrible bad one. If you're like those people who watch horrible movies like me for fun, you can't even get through this very short movie. Please, for the love of God, destroy all copies of this film.
