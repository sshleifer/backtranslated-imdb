Wow ... as a big fan of Western fairy tales Larry McMurtry and, in particular, the Lonely Pigeon series, I waited with indignation with impatience for the Comanche Moon. What a huge disappointment. Maybe my expectations were too high due to the all-round superiority of Lonesome Dove ... stories, characters, cinematography, music ... it all worked. <br /> <br /> Compared to this, Comanche Moon comes through a lively Saturday night, a live parody. The characters are absolutely colorless, the dialogues chat, and the plot wanders thoughtlessly everywhere. It seems that the actors all read from TelePrompTers. I could not relate to any of the characters, the good guys, the bad guys, even random characters. Speech by David Shirinder is particularly notable. Looks like it was torn out of a performance in high school in eighth grade. Sorry, I would like to find something positive to say about Comanche Moon, but I just can't do it. There's nothing there.
