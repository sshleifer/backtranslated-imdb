This is exactly what the name tells you ... an island inhabited by fishermen. Dr. Claudio Cassinelli, the shipwrecked, and the crew landed on the island, they were either captured by fishermen, or sent in search of crazy hunters for Richard Johnson. Cassinelli discovers that Johnson, who believes he has found the lost city of Atlantis, is keeping disgraced scientist Joseph Cotten and his daughter Barbara Bach for 15 years so that fishermen can find a treasury under the sea. Cotten, of course, full of crazy. Bach and Cassinelli have excellent chemistry. This madness was directed by Sergio Martino and, surprisingly, not without reason. This is a fast paced, fairly well acting, and the fishermen look pretty convincing (although it is unlikely that anyone will be able to prove that these things do not look like real fishermen). There is a great musical accompaniment by Luciano Michelini.
