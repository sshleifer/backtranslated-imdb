I saw this film at the 2005 Edinburgh International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> This film was compared in EIFF with Sideways, which I really liked, so I was looking forward to this movie. I also liked Garden State, Napoleon Dynamite, and so on. So I had a good recent experience with some strange American Indian films. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I discovered that Puffy Chair is no different with any of these films. <br /> <br /> I sat for 35 minutes, waiting for something funny, witty, insightful, or even slightly interesting. It did not - and the wobbly video camera made me sick - so I left. <br /> <br /> This is the only second movie I ever left (the first one was “Showgirls”), which is a little disappointing. I probably could have lasted so long if it wasn't for the nauseous effect of the shaky picture, but nothing in the first 35 minutes made me feel that I would miss something. <br /> <br /> Disappointment.
