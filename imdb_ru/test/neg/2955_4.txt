Soft spoiler in the second paragraph. <br /> <br /> Anna Christie was the dim Garbo 1st radio. She and Dressler look like the only people who know what they are doing in this film. The old man who plays Garbo's father (George F. Marion) in the film, sooooo ah! All he does is drunkenly stumbles around in a completely fake way and shouts about the “old sea of ​​Dah-Vila”. He blames Garbo's “past”, his whole life and everything at sea! He looks like a stupid x 10. Charles Bickford - Matt, a rude sailor falls in love with him, and he does an excellent job with his role, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> The best part is when Garbo reveals his “terrible secret” to Bickford and her father. Finally, Marion stops talking about the evil of the sea and hits him on the head and with his fists at the perfect time with Bickford. Soon he goes to the tirade near the sea. <br /> <br /> I had to practically force myself to end Anna Cristi. It is too melodramatic in many parts and creaky. There are many good early conversations, but this is not one of them. If you haven’t seen Garbo before, try something else before Anna Cristi, for example, CAMILLE or GRAND HOTEL.
