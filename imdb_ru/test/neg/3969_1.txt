SLOOOOOOOW, a cool, poorly-produced schlocker of the 70s made Moore insidious because of today's headlines; nevertheless, this film is worthy of smelly food due to the unconvincing acting, lack of direction and silly clothes of the 70s (unfortunately, MooCow remembers when Adidas clothing was in fashion ...). It looks the same as some of the best science fiction films of the 70s, namely WestWorld and Logan's Run. While the premise is interesting (rich people clone themselves to keep reserves of body parts to keep them alive theoretically forever), the film makes the mistake of burdening us with Richard (Tim Donnelly), a clone that is both boring and annoying, Empty Donnelly's game does not help, but fits into the rest of the cast. Even B-portholes like Dick Sargent (TV series “Charmed”, “The Ghost with 1,000,000 eyes”), Keenan Wynn (“Doctor Strangelove”, “Dark”, “Lazerblast”) and Peter Graves (“Beginning of the End” " , "Killers from space", "It conquered the world") provide only the coolest performances. Created, directed and edited by the group nothing, it is not surprising that "Clonus" can not horrify anyone, Less hold the attention of anyone! In truth, There is nothing in this weak film that even Sloka fans would like to - really want to watch. Lohie, funny movies of the 70s, worn on something by Graydon Clark. "Clonus" is not a bonus, says MooCow even the MST3K version is onlookers, so act at your own risk !: = 8P
