The motion picture film by Jean Claude Van Damme seems to have gone to hell in the handcart, as it is ironic to see him as a character who literally meets the same fate at the very beginning of the movie! It is also interesting to note how very much and very similar are the plots of his films, no matter who is the producer, director or screenwriter. Van Damme usually plays a character who lives in France, then, due to circumstances, he finds himself in another part of the world where he has a brother who dies, and Van Damme needs revenge, which is helped by a character he has just met. Look at AWOL or LEGOINAIRRE or many other films titled “Starring Jean-Claude Van Damme”, and they all have almost the same type of plot structure. This does not mean that they are identical, of course, just very similar, and if you saw one Van Damme movie, you basically saw them all. Same with MAXIMUM RISK
