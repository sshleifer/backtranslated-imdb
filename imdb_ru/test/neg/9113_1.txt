I love most of the movies, and I'm a big fan of Sean Bean, so I thought I would like this movie. In addition, I am a Canadian, and this is basically a Canadian film, so I was ready to shoot a serious failure. Nothing could have prepared me for the garbage that is "In the air." Steve Guttenberg as an action movie hero? Give me a break. The acting game throughout the film was so bad that I would have trouble sleeping tonight. I now have only two desires in life. <br /> <br /> 1. I hope you never have to sit in this movie. 2. I would like to receive these 6 hours ago. Oh wait, the movie is less than 2 hours - it seemed like only 6 hours ... <br /> <br /> Don't watch this. Seriously.
