The film starts well, it has something for it. At about 1/3 of the movie, everything goes downhill. Kerry starts to fixate on the amount of 23, because he sees it everywhere. So what? This is not a reason to go crazy and start writing things all over the body and on the walls. <br /> <br /> Dealing with someone who plays with his son is bad. From the very beginning, as soon as he hears about the obsession of his fathers, he jumps on the bandwagon and hysterically about it. Absolutely incredible. I hope I will never see this child in another movie. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is a waste of time. Grab another. A boring piece ... well. Does the number kill him? Give me a break. I will not spoil you the final, but let's just say that it is equally frustrating. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
