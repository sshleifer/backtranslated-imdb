We can conclude that there are 10 types of people in this world. <br /> <br /> Those who understand binary code and those who do not understand. Those who understand the binary, put this film in the grave with the hackers, while those who really enjoy this film in order that nothing like this could happen. Ever <br /> <br /> For the film try to become a modern film with fiction. It failed. Horribly. Only the 11-year-old and the youngest can enjoy, and only the 30-year-old and above can be frightened to have their identity taken. It loses in the main market for resale (I watch it now, it is more boring than when it was first released).
