I really liked the movie. From time to time it was really stupid. (They destroy the villain with a hair dryer - but where are they connected?) Although this is a unique film, I liked the game Courtney Draper and Tamara Hope. I also liked Fanuel (no matter how you wrote him ...), and I liked the character of Megan, because she called him a Losers. In addition to the game, "rewind" and a show of what happened from the point of view of Ariel, and then Megan, were quite interesting. I saw it twice, and I would see it again
