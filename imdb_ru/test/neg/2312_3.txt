As one who loves films that turn to intellectual outings, so also those who just tell stories, this film should have been attractive. But, as written and directed by Catherine Brailat, who seems to be playing her own puzzles in filmmaking, this tedious and talkative film is not interesting. <br /> <br /> Main character Zhanna (Ann Pario) Screen form of Breilat, the director who was upset by her attempts to make a convincing sex scene with two difficult actors (Gregoire Colin is an actor and Roxana Mesquida is an actress). The only “comic” beat is that Jeanne imposes a dildo on the actor to bring the sex scene into action, but even this spectacle is quickly depleted, and we still have the movie in the film that seems more like “Deleted Scenes” on DVD, than the french comedy with the class.
