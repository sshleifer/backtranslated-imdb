I read about this film on the Internet and, seeing the generally positive feedback he received, and after reviewing the trailer, I decided to check it out for myself. What a disappointment! It starts quite well. the initial scene was actually quite tense, but from there everything goes downhill. I see that the filmmakers tried to do something different with this film, but in doing so, they got the pleasure of watching this film. This choice in conjunction with editing "C.S.I", using music and editing, lack of expectation, fright or humor really delays this film. There are too many omens and a lot of “thin” clues, so when the first turn comes early, you already know how the movie ends. I gave the film three stars, because I think the actors did a good job, except that I cannot recommend this film.
