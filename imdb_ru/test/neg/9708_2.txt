Well, Wright may have made a rude description of life around 1800 - as he repeatedly and anally told about when he was written and not published - but this is HIS Austin and should not claim to be an adaptation. br /> <br /> Mrs. Bennett looks like a village cleaner. This is a spoiled woman - they have servants (remember the scene from the book, where the servant cuts hair, etc.)? But Wright portrays her with rough, reddened skin all over her chest, with rough hands and working in the kitchen. And the pigs roam! If he wants bucolic, he should try Tess. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bennett - the script is made too pleasant and modern and ignores its weakness. The scene where he stops the play of Mary, should make you cringe, and not pass in seconds. If not, do not turn it on. <br /> <br /> McFadien is very weak in his role and seems to perform some pride at the expense of numbers. The first sentence, he looks more like a nervous schoolboy than a man who overcomes his pride to make an offer under his station. He could also read most of his lines on the shopping list. <br /> <br /> Lydia is terrible. Totally over with excessive screeching and skipping. Indeed, Knightley plays Elizabeth more like a giggling mindless character, of which Lydia is sometimes in a book. <br /> <br /> And Elizabeth. Half the time, Knightly clearly imitates Ele's voice and intonation - close your eyes to see what kind of copy it is. And in her role you see Wright's main mistake - there is no prejudice. <br /> <br /> With her first meeting with Darcy, she clearly loved him. When he comments on Bingley about the attractiveness of women in the hall, she initially looks offended, not shocked and insulted. The latter must establish the side of the prejudice of things. And when she and Caroline gallop around the room, she encounters how to tease, obviously, everywhere. And by virtually excluding Wickham, you are not getting enough of Elizabeth's investment to establish the biased aspects that fall out of this relationship. <br /> <br /> And obviously, this is Caroline, not Miss Bingley. And Mr. Bingley happily walks into Jane’s bedroom. And and and - Wright boasts how good he is with the period he wants. But a few panoramic pictures of rural life (which show Hardy’s preference) do not justify his blatant slips everywhere. <br /> <br /> The cinematographer — who obviously wants rewards — had to be curbed. He turned between Bronte and Hardy throughout the entire film — and wasn’t the last offer of Tess shots / lighting? The need to see Darcy going through the veil with an untidy shirt was just stupid. But most importantly - going between these two very different landscapes, they forget the most important - Austin. (She would have laughed loudly at Elizabeth = sad, therefore = rain, piercing with picturesque stupidity, wet Darcy rubbish). <br /> <br /> I confess that it was impossible to watch a movie without using the book as a context. I was ready to give him some leeway because he had to give the story in a short amount of time. But if you completely forget half of the essence of the book in prejudice, then Darcy constantly looked more like constipation than pride, making it almost imperceptible. I could only see it as a mess with generally bad actions (when Knightley did not imitate El, she missed or missed or both and only calmed down a couple of times to indicate that she did have some promise - but delirium on hesitation to convey emotions do not replace a bad script and bad leadership) - although for some it was just a case of a bad script. <br /> <br /> Tom Holland alone would avoid conviction. While he softened Collins' comic aspects, he really turned into a very interesting approach. Dench is doing a great job with a dream she can do in a dream, either here or with Oscar Wilde - but this should have been Lady Catherine De Boer, not Lady Bracknell. She was a little too sane. <br /> <br /> The shortened length could have been solved by a competent screenwriter, right? Not characters filling the gaps in the story and helping the audience everywhere. Elizabeth could not come up with a figure of 10 thousand pounds. And although they wanted to reduce the time after learning of Darcy's involvement in the Wickham marriage, the lines did not fit Lydia. It was the worst case of inappropriate exposition in a work. <br /> <br /> These are really awful things. Anyone who reviews him, saying that he works well in the context of the book, is someone whom I honestly don’t believe he has read or understood the characteristics of this thing. Wright seems to think that his characters in the 90s did not lag behind their behavior. I'm not sure that he read the book - he certainly does not understand it. He does not understand Osten's keen mind or ease of touch — he, of course, made a boring, captivating film out of him. <br /> <br /> What's worse is the sad, miserable need of lovers in love with chickens: I love you, I love you everywhere, so that they can sigh and go crazy. The fact that he has no place in the work of Austin, apparently, does not matter. <br /> <br /> Does anyone view it as one movie? Well, it's harder for me, except for the fact that I would notice a bad game, a weak Darcy and annoying irritation of all this. If you are going to adapt, you can change a lot - but if it loses its spirit and key motives, do not insult the book by taking its name.
