If you are a sane person and watched movies before, you can not tolerate this nonsense for more than 20 minutes. And if you stay there longer, it will not happen because you expect akshay or paresis (not govinda, please!), But because you value your money too much and want at least a little nap on the plush seats in the multiplex. instead of money, they robbed you! It's hard to believe that a director who gave us a cult film, such as HeraPheri, could fall to such levels ... well, he repeats, but now he comes out of the whole third level and expects us to laugh, because he brought in Paresh Rawal and Akshay Kumar. ..! No, sir, it won't work now ... especially with this stupid script of yours! Even comedic films can have meaningful scenarios (Lage Raho Munnabhai?). <br /> <br /> Govinda doesn’t do much for me, so I can’t comment .. Akshay Kumar was boring, Paresh Rawal played one of the worst jokes possible. Lara Datta had a real opportunity to play in this, but she failed miserably ... the only bright feature of the film (perhaps) is actress Tanushri! But she is only there for the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> I don’t think this film is worth more space ... (maybe not even so much!). So, the last warning - do not look!
