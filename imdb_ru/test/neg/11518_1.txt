I'm in a movie club at my school, and I had to sit and watch this dark movie. The story of the film is not gloomy, but the film itself is extremely gloomy. The game was absolutely terrible. The children were excessively tearful. A metal pillar could do better. I desperately wanted to fall asleep, but due to the fact that the TV was very loud, I could not calm down. Monkeys are neither cute nor funny. Drama worthy of laughter. I can't remember when I saw a more horrible movie. The story is weak, subtle, predictable and completely fake. Adults try to be good actors, but they just can't break through stereotypes. It seems that the girl even wants to leave the film, falling from a hill during the film to leave him, I do not blame her. Michael Anderson must publicly apologize for this film. Not just for me, but for everyone who was forced to watch this horrible movie. In fact, I apologize to you. Even if I have nothing to do with this project, I apologize for this film, because it means that at least someone will. This film even surpasses the gloom of Rob Schneider and Cheetah Girls films. I would even go so far as to say that the Hilary Duff film collection is even worse, but it pushes her. Just please do not watch this film, otherwise you will be forced to write a review similar to this one about how terrible this film is. I'm sorry.
