"Shining" has the wit, visual style and cult performance of Jack Nicholson. "Ausentes," however, has none of this; although he borrowed from his classic ancestor; for example, the man who broke the door, and the woman screaming around, squeezing a huge kitchen knife. Unlike the great psychological horror film by Stanley Kubrick, “Ausentes” is a work that echoes the exceptional lack of genius. This is gorgeous, comically terrible; it makes the movie Spice Girls look like a work of vital art. “Ausentes” is a story about a family that moves to a closed community in the suburbs. Everything should be fine with the world. They will live in peace and tranquility; They will quietly go about their business away from those evil streets of the old city. But no. The character of Ariadne Jill, Julia, begins to fear those things that insist on the bustle of the night, empty supermarkets and doors that close; and her husband Samuel, played by Jordy Moll, instantly switches from a laid-back family man to a constantly unshaven wild-eyed psycho, introducing Julia the medicine to keep her under sudden fear. Molla, highly respected as an actor, is absolutely terrible at that. Comic, not threatening, it simply cannot create a threatening expression. He just stumbled upon a ball of mucus in a bar that had too much of one drink. So is there anything to buy back this movie? Not. The script is awkward, the plot does not exist and is composed without merit. “Ausentes” is an exercise in how not to create a psychological thriller. It's funny and bloated, but as one of the most unintentionally hilarious films of recent years, it’s worth a look.
