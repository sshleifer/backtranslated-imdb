Another stupid "movie". Image quality is correct. Sound too. The music is average. The guy is trying to create music, like in Halloween. <br /> <br /> One rare time a producer / director chooses unreal girls. This is because this “movie” takes one week and costs $ 10,000. Does this mean that when a producer has money, they choose all the anorexic girls? Good question. <br /> <br /> But the girls in this “movie” are physically right. But they are not a good actress. Neither guys either. But maybe this is simply because the “history” of this “film” does not matter. <br /> <br /> I'm sure we will give $ 10,000 to some teens who love movies, and they can make the best movie. /> <br /> Take the time to watch this “thing”.
