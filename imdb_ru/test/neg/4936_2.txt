Perhaps a spoiler !! Well, I saw it at the Cologne Film Festival, and I have to say it's funny ... sorry the author and the writer and ... whatever, but this is the worst attempt to make a good movie I've ever seen ... if you have the opportunity to run away from the enemy 5,000 times, and you do not do it ... it gets boring ... there are scenes in the film that give you the impression that they are forgotten, for example, szene in front of a security camera, they ask for help, and who sees it and calls the police ... what is the reduction and .... ANYTHING ?? !!! ... the killer gets a shot in the head, and after 50 seconds he behaves as if nothing had happened ... no, this is not a film about zombies ... and, finally, the final ... A BIG END that was promised to us .... hmmmm, let's say we take a little guy who always wanted to give the world one of the best endings in history so much that everything goes wrong ... I am not going to vote "1" because the actress is beautiful. ..;)
