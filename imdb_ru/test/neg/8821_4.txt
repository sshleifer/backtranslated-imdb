I heard a lot of bad things about this movie before I saw it, but I thought that all the negative comments were probably related to the low budget of the film and the bad acting game - I can deal with both when it comes to zombie . However, what I did not expect was a really boring movie; if there is one thing that you can count on from low-budget zombies, their bloody and entertaining - but unfortunately this film has neither the one nor the other Clark - "Deadly sleep" and "Black Christmas" - were both very inventive and entertaining, but "Children should not play with dead things" simply did not work. The storyline follows a group of young people who travel to the island of burial to tinker with rituals to bring the dead back to life. However, they soon learn that playing with things they donâ€™t understand is a really stupid idea when their rituals really bring the dead back to life and the corpses of the island return to feast on their blood! <br /> <br /> The plots sound as if it could lead to a decent click, but I did not mention that the interesting parts do not start until the last twenty minutes; and since it's a ninety minute movie, I'm sure you can guess that this is not a good thing. The first hour and ten minutes are replete with bad game and even worse characters. I can understand how to adjust the situation so that the horror becomes stronger when it comes; but please, if you are going to spend so much time on it, you really should make it interesting. All the characters in the movie are overflowing and annoying, and personally I just wanted the zombies to hurry and eat them. However, the film is not without its merits, as the atmosphere is outstanding. Seven years later, Lucio Fulci will show how an isolated island and meat-eating zombies can go well together; but Bob Clark has already done this with this movie. The direction is also not bad, but it is reduced due to the bad effects of makeup and a clear lack of blood, which is unlikely to please fans of films about zombies. Overall, I really can't recommend this film; but if you're an avid zombie fan, you can enjoy it.
