Conclusion: very, but very, very boring, but I watched to the end, hoping for some kind of inverted effect, but the end was worse, because there was nothing. The old black and white game did not help at all, usually it helps psychological films, but itâ€™s not. Scenario, plot, and so on. D. Were linear, did not contain, nothing was included. When you deal with the psychological, you deal with the analysis, and therefore with the details, this formula of unity-diversity ... there was no essence, no details. Just a story, there are many stories that can be told, but something makes them unique and difficult to forgive with the help of cinematographers' tools and creativity ... well, this is not one.
