What we have here is a standard Disney DVD sequel, where I expect that cribs will be cut in all areas, which will lead to a good animated film that is far superior to the original. This does not mean that this is a terrible film, it is just a very mediocre film, filled with preaching messages, designed to show children the virtues of friendship and kindness to each other, and if not done subtly (which is not here) can quickly become an adult grid. The film has a very subtle storyline in which Kronk tries to win his fatherâ€™s approval and eventually finds the true meaning of wealth and success. There are comedic moments here, but in fact this is not enough to make a feature film.
