This film was really funny, although it should not have been! The game was as silly as the voices. Almost all of this was some guy who walked through the corn maze for an hour and a half. They added this stupid supernatural thing that made her even dumber. It didnâ€™t even look like an ordinary movie, this weird, creepy music played almost the entire movie. What's up with the corn maze horror movies? I thought the corn kids were really scary, and I thought it would be something like this, but in reality it was just silly. The main character just went aimlessly, shouting at these two little girls. And then at the end he seems to be killing someone or something. It's worth seeing if you are with friends, because it's really funny how bad it is, but if you're looking for a horror movie, then don't waste time
