That's what's good about the Rule of Slaughter: <br /> <br /> - Ryan Gosling, Clea Duval and David Morse give excellent presentations. Gosling is, as always, damn outstanding. Places are often breathtaking. <br /> <br /> This is what is bad in the Rule of Slaughter: <br /> <br /> Everything else. The script is terribly confused. And although I can certainly appreciate the film “not very good,” this film is just boring. Great performances can not fill the film with a silly premise and script, which is filled with discarded lines, which often do not even make sense. Passing the first hour was a chore. <br /> <br /> I was stuck with him because of Gosling, but in the end I did myself a favor and changed the channel. Spoilers here gave me the ending. I did not miss much. Do yourself a favor - if you want a good click of Gosling, look at “The Believer.” <br /> <br /> My account: 2 out of 10.
