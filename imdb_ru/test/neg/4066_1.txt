You should see this. I could not stop laughing at the nonsense that I saw in this film, even late after the event. In this film, perhaps a million of individual mistakes and stupidities. The game is bad. The story is so predictable and flat. Effects like 50 years. Estimated thriller is no good. You will not like the film, but you will laugh at it and enjoy laughing at it for a long time. We had a great time after the movie. Really. My friend and I had a full 40-minute bus ride home, talking about this film, as we saw the next Oscar. Unfortunately, we talked about all the bad things we just saw.
