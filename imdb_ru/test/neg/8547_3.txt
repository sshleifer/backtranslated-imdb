Reluctantly gave him 3 points - one point for Fonda, Stanwick and supporting actors. <br /> <br /> I have never seen this before - now I am watching him, and he has just reached the part where Henry Fonda is carrying Babs across the threshold. If I continue to look, I'll just see if Fonda and Stanwick can get it out of the truck. <br /> <br /> But after reading the comments of other viewers, I'm not very optimistic. <br /> <br /> The opening ski scenes were enough to lift me away from dinner. The voice-over was obviously made in a sound studio, and the editing between external shots and close-ups was terrible. I don't know much about the technology of that era, but I can't believe that they could not do something to make it more believable. <br /> <br /> My second gasp of disbelief was when Fonda wiped out and (I think because of the extraordinary speed of movement) he buried his head first in the snow before his torso — Stanvik pulls it out with an obvious staged difficulty — and I suppose, because she is such an experienced doctor) does not generally respond to his clearly unconscious state and sluggish posture. <br /> <br /> Listen, I am fully able to suspend my disbelief, but I could not accept the fact that she had just pushed a man with a possible head injury and that he could be paralyzed for a lifetime. I can't imagine big assholes. <br /> <br /> So when I finish this comment, we just saw Kirk’s first jealous surge, and Dr. Hunt goes for an appendectomy! I'm not sure I hate more - the script, the background music or the story! Argghhhh! I'm done. Game over. Click.
