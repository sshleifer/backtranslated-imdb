When one of my friends recommended this to me, admiring how well it was shot, the main themes and the overall greatness of the film, I obviously expected an amazing, at least interesting film. <br /> <br /> The two hours I spent watching this turned out to be a huge disappointing waste of my time. <br /> <br /> I understand that this film has to be surrealistic, but even in surrealistic films there is something that fixes it, even if it is only the slightest. This film, on the other hand, looked forced and fake. Many shots were unnecessary, and watching them made me think that the director tried very hard to be artistic. <br /> <br /> The game was bad, and the relationship between the characters was not sufficiently developed. Maybe I was just missing something that others could see, but I didn’t even realize that there was some kind of attraction between De Soo and Migo before they started, like rabbits, by chance in the middle of the movie. On the other hand, perhaps this film was just bad. <br /> <br /> I am not against violence in the movies, but in this almost all of this was simply unnecessary. Throughout all the battle scenes, I felt like I cringe on how painful the cliché was. <br /> <br /> And the plot? The word ridiculous comes to mind. I would be surprised if I did not waste two hours of my life after this poorly thought out and ridiculous conspiracy. Despite all the shortcomings of the film, by the end I was expecting something interesting to complete it. I will not discuss the final, because I would not want to “spoil” the film to those who have not seen it. Just a metaphor "Whether it is a rock or a grain of sand, they drown in the same way in water." cannot be used as an explanation for everything. <br /> <br /> This entire film was made only for shock and shock. I just hope that sooner or later people will stop being so pretentious and recognize a bad film as it is. I have seen many other wonderful Korean films, and it upsets me that people consider Oldboy to be the best.
