Barney and his friends ... Dora, a researcher of the 90s. <br /> <br /> Okay, I admit it. In childhood, Barney was my main character. I had my plush toy Barney, and I watched the same episodes of Barney again and again on videotape. perhaps because it was so coated with sugar and stuns. <br /> <br /> However, when I turned 7, I began to hate Barney. everyone at school would be Dis Barney, and I agreed (mainly because it was funny), and this is what little boys do. but a few years later I discovered something else about Barney that I will never forget. <br /> <br /> A person called IMDb on Angel_meiru wrote an essay for the school explaining the dangers of watching Barney, and he or she put it on message boards. many of these hazards made sense. <br /> <br /> Barney is a dinosaur that can magically come to life during the day at school. he is supposedly educational, or so says Cheryl Leach (Creator Barney), but in fact, all I remember, he taught me, is that magic can solve everything that is not true. <br /> <br /> To finish this comment, I would like to tell you a little story. There was once a young boy who watched a particular episode of Barney. Once he was alone when a stranger lured him into his car and drove away with him. I do not know the result (but it can be assumed that the child died), but why was he kidnapped? because he watched the episode "Barney and Friends" entitled "The Stranger is a friend you haven't met yet." <br /> <br /> 0/10
