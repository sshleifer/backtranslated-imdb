Honestly, I thought this film would be cheesy, although I really liked Alvin and the Chipmunks for a long time! I was very wrong. WAS COOL!!! It was the best movie Iâ€™ve seen since October! In my opinion, this is a movie that everyone should see this holiday season! Enchanted (I still thought ...) was terrible, the Golden Compass was fine, but the end was pretty cheesy for fans of His Dark Materials, and I am Legend, well, I have not seen it yet (or National Treasures 2), everything looks good. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to distribute anything, but this film is perfect for everyone, especially children!
