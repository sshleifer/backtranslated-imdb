Really horrible mindless trash. This film does everything wrong, except to make the time less than an hour. Gore FX defies gravity and logic. There are no scares. The game is terrible, everyone seems to read their lines. This is an unexpected ending, which is just silly when we find out that the things we saw did not even happen. Boy, I hate the police! They complement this thing with long protracted shots of people who do not do anything interesting (for example, they do makeup or say something that seems eternal). Should they add a film less than an hour long? Funny. The story itself is pretty darn thin. I mean, this is just a variation of the film “DAY OF APRIL OF THE SOUL”, if I remember this movie correctly, and this film was not so wonderful either. The only good thing I can say is that she seems to have been shot well. It is a pity that nothing happens, it is very interesting.
