There really is very little positive that can be said about this film. Walter Pijon is a really unconvincing hero, and even more so when he tries to become “under cover” as a villain who, as we must believe, drinks too much and knocks his wife a little. Margaret Leighton, as an undercover wife / sergeant, is a little more convincing, but it's still hard to believe that any hood worthy of their salt would not have passed through their charade in less than a minute. The story of the robbery of bullion is stupid, and the action is delayed, but not exciting. David Tomlinson, who plays Algy just as David Tomlinson seems to play all of his roles, is the only glimpse of light in a completely boring affair.
