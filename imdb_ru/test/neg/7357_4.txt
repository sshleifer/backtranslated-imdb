When you are ahead of a movie, you know you are wasting time watching a movie. That is how I felt when I watched "Darkness." I could foresee every turn and turn around easily. This is a combination of Amityville's Terror and many films dedicated to the occult. It is so stupid that I almost found it conquers his naivety. I can not say that I was bored, but the film seemed too derivative for my taste. Director Balaguero is trying to repeat his early Spanish hit "Nameless", but cannot make it. I admit, a few sequences were terrible enough, but I just hate when I can understand what will happen next. In addition, I really did not want to see how good actors, such as Lena Olin and Giancarlo Giannini, sweat a lot because of this shred. Finally, Anna Paquin as a horror movie star? This must be a joke. She is cute, but she is one of those good child actors who become very monotonous adult actors. You can live without watching it.
