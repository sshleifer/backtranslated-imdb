It had potential ... it really was. But the film has so much funny and funny. I am a horror film, and I thought it was stupid; like my 13 year old! I expected to be at least scared. And, yes, there was the gross factor of vines writhing in people; However, the path to the ruins is just stupid, stupid, stupid. <br /> <br /> I mean, who really goes hiking ... in the jungle ... with a stranger ... ... with a little water and a small amount of snacks ... AT HOSES, NO LESS ?! Puh-rental! And even better: who travels to a foreign country and leaves the tourist area without an interpreter or speaks a little in this language? Are these people idiots? <br /> <br /> Can't hear from the German brother, and he doesnâ€™t call for help? Who does not do this? Does he simply find Greeks and Americans to search and find a little?
