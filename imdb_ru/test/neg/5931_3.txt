Kudos to DP Bucksley for making this movie look like a real movie for the first time in this series (with the notable exception of the F / X scenes). However, approaching the production of films, he lost most of the entertainment value of the first two. They were in a very horrible category of "horrible movies." Is it possible to make the argument that the “believers” simply tried to make a general action movie with a prayer in it? In the film so many times when they abandon their own belief system, and this is annoying. If everything that happens, happens according to the will of God, and they are just his tools, then people infected with the virus do it as part of his plan, right? Apply it to any situation where one of the believers does not obey the will of God, and you get a rather hypocritical little film from the director Jackson's Action.
