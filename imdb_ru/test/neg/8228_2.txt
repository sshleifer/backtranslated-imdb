I would choose any of these films. This film was on my “must-see” list for a while because people said that it was “disturbing”, and there are many and many quotes from people in the VHS who say how “amazing” it is or how “ so close "You can get to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and similar lines. But, sorry guys, I was very disappointed. The idea is interesting, but the script is so underdeveloped that every character becomes an erroneous creation of evolution, and the movie. <br /> <br /> This is, in my Pts It could not have any confidence in the plot. I could not believe how some of the sequences “unnecessarily dragged on, let's find it.” There are several pleasant moments to please the blood fan, but there are so few of them that we get to them, there is no point. If Luther is an idiot, then the filmmakers must be in a chain.
