I have not seen this movie for many years, the last time I did this, I was really drunk after 5 pints of tenants in my local Witherspoon, but even then I thought it was pretty awful. this movie is pretty awful compared to other creature films, the first two were pretty good, 3 were pretty shitty, but much better than this. The story unfolds 53 years after the 3rd year, when Charlie, the bounty hunter from previous films, was found floating in the space compartment by a team of some space miner, their people and taken on board. Once on board, the last creature eggs left in the galaxy, which Charlie brought with him from Earth, split up, and we had creatures on board the spacecraft hinting at the obvious stall of "Alien" and many film in a nutshell. it's only good when we get acquainted with UG again (or so they make us believe), who is now a villain and wants to save the creatures instead of destroying them
