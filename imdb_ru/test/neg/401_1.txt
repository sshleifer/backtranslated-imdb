My wife and I watched this after the DVR removed it from the encore last week. It must be the worst horror movie that each of us has ever seen. Predictable dialogue (my wife and I guessed the lines before they were announced), unusual special effects, a script that drifted everywhere. I think the part that was the most annoying was the stereotyping of various characters in the plot, not to mention the gratuitous sex scene between the two young heroes in the film, neither of whom had any real purpose other than the bare parts of their anatomy for the cameras . This film should be categorized as comedy, not horror, because the villains of the film (spiders) were animated and not credible. I cannot say that I would have done a better job, making the film myself, but it was very amateur and was not even film "B", somewhere closer to film "d" or "f", if possible. I think even science fiction 3000 should have passed it by!
