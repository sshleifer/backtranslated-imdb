I can not believe that this is a film that I did not like. I usually find that I am open to all sorts of things. but this film is just, well, bad. <br /> <br /> I could deal with the subject if the script and the story were better. I could cope with the acting skills if the work with the camera was better or if the characters were better developed. I think it basically comes down to the script and the direction. <br /> <br /> it was just bad. <br /> <br /> I want to give it the lowest rating, but. I donâ€™t believe it, at least this guy left the tail to make a movie. , thus, it gets four stars (slightly above the average rating, which it still has)
