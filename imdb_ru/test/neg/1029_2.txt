It's hard to believe that Oprah Winfrey produced this piece of junk, the show could not even hold a candle before the culinary shows of the past, including Emerly Lagasse, Rachel Ray is the most annoying talk show host and culinary show in television history, and not because of Ainsley Harriott there was a terrible culinary presenter, which I watched, at least Ainsley Harriott has some good moments and a bit of style, it doesn't have any style at all, it's terrible as a host, the kitchen looks terrible, the letter is terrible, the TV game can't afford, and the initial credits so much fuckers, that makes me sick. Now I like cooking shows that have a great sense of style, but thereâ€™s absolutely nothing like it. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst TV shows of the year.
