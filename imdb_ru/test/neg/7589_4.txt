Butter Battle is an interesting story about two fictional cities and an arms race. This is also a mistaken allegory about the Cold War and the arms race in general. Yes, it is a book for children, but, like Theodore Sues Geiselâ€™s many other works, it amazes people with its head with its morality. <br /> <br /> And what is this moral? Of course, it is commendable to encourage us to concentrate more on what unites us than on what divides us. It is even good to encourage international cooperation. But to equate the differences between the Warsaw Pact countries and the NATO West with the difference in the use of oil is simply wrong. To point out the obvious, many Warsaw Pact countries enjoyed periodic periods of shortage of butter and bread - they would be happy to eat this oil sideways if it were available. At a less literal level and regardless of your political bias, Soviet socialism versus Western (especially Anglo-American) democracy is not just a matter of preferences and customs. <br /> <br /> To make it even clearer, nuclear weapons were developed not in the Cold War with the Soviets, but in a hot war with the Axis powers. There is no doubt that Germany developed its nuclear potential during the war. Should the US refrain from nuclear research, relying on its (less than inevitable) victory in conventional war? Once the weapon was developed, it was used against the enemy who attacked us at Pearl Harbor. What is the nation doing at this moment when the gin is out of the bottle? In addition, the retrospective forecast is 20-20, that is, it was impossible to guarantee that another half-crazy dictator could not recall the development of nuclear weapons. The Second Gulf War showed an incredible difficulty in identifying credible threats and neutralizing them. <br /> <br /> In any case, caricature is nothing more than simplified propaganda that does little to study the nuances of ethical issues behind armament and instead tries to instil in children the fear of military equipment.
