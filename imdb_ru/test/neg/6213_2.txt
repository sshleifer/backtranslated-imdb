This film was recommended to me, so we went to see it together. I would not call it a film, it’s more like a combination of 10 different unfinished, illogical stories that aren’t that funny. There are several characters in the film that at first looked important, and they just disappeared from the story. He just struggles to fit everything in 2.5 hours. I left the series without thinking about what happened to this and this guy. <br /> <br /> I think that this film is just an expanded version of "Hitch", complemented by a much larger number of characters and dancers. <br /> <br /> If this is the best film this couple has ever made, then I’m sure that I’m not interested in any of his previous ones.
