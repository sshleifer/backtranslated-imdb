I am ashamed of myself that I actually went to the theater to watch this film when it was first released. Although I believe that his subtly veiled description of the story of Aristotle Onassis and Jackie Kennedy is fairly well done, this is a film that should never have been made at all; hence my low rating. <br /> <br /> The film tells about a rich Greek business shark named Theo Tomasis, who is seeking and winning a lovely young widow Liz Cassidy from a murdered American president. Sounds familiar? Yes, everything except names. <br /> <br /> Cast should not be a mistake. Anthony Quinn brings the Greek magnate to perfection, and at least it is comforting, having just read that Ari himself asked Quinn for the role. Jacqueline Bisset, of course, is beautiful and sophisticated in parts (in all senses and purposes) of Jackie, and James Francis looks completely American as president. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen this movie since it came out, and I don't want to see it again. I seem to recall pretty bad vocabulary and some rudeness. Otherwise, I believe, this sensational and supposedly intimate idea of ​​the plane in which rich and famous people live frolics on their yachts, beaches, pools, etc. Yes, the landscapes of the Greek islands are impressive, the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> It seems to be all right. There is no end to Kennedy television films that, I confess, sometimes tune in, and not to my credit. This is basically just another. It is much better to allow Aristotle and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis to rest in peace.
