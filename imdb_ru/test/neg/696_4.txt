If you like to watch movies because they are cute, this should be fine. If you like watching movies that start with a good guy trying to catch a bad guy, then show the motives of each of them throughout the movie, skip it. At the end of the film, I still didn’t know why Starger killed women the way he did. When you set up such a ritual serial killer, it would be nice to know where these rituals came from. In Dreams, there was a similar, pretty serial killer movie that wasn't the best either, but at least they explained why he killed the girls. They also hinted at a dark background for Vaughn’s character, but didn’t explain, didn’t actually say why child psychologist Lopez was much better suited for this task than the other people they interviewed did not give a lot of explanation. for the problem of a small child, etc. If the rest of the story is irresistible, I don’t care about the details, like how Stargher provided all the fashionable electronic equipment and underground cameras, or why the FBI didn’t check if he owned any other property or I had access to strange places while they were waiting to see if the whole would work in the killer’s mind, but I really like to have an idea of ​​what motivates a serial killer in a serial killer movie when it kills in such a complicated way.
