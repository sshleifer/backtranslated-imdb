A nice idea for Dion Warwick to perform vocals for this film adaptation of Jacqueline Suzanne's bestseller (a la Dolly Puppet) ... although it's actually very bad that this kid doesn't have a Neely O'Hara Patty Duke splash of history. "The machine of love" is always boring. Even the final fight (with the Oscar as a reward for the fight!) Can not save him. Diane Cannon seems to embalm in his heavy pancake make-up and burdensome fall (although her tiny, tanned figure is a beauty worth contemplating), John Phillip Lowe is the group leader, and David Hemmings is embarrassed in a fun fashion as a bright photographer. And where does Robin Stone go at the end? He goes to the embankment to take the sailors? After Cannon blew out his manhood, it will be a safe bet. In this case, “The Machine of Love” - “The Last Episode” is perhaps a more interesting film. Of course, better than this provoking yawn hypnotic opera. * 1/2 of ****
