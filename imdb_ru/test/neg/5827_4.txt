I saw Winnie's Heffalump a couple of days ago. A good story based on famous characters, created by A.A. Milne. Although Winnie, Piglet, Tiger and Rabbit are present in this animation function, this time the main character is Rou. He is friends with the terrible Heffalump, who turns out to be not at all scary and shows everyone that friendship knows no limits, and everyone wants and deserves to be happy. I love this movie and I would like it even more if Iâ€™m 10 or 15 years younger. Alas, I would like to become a child again to enjoy this story of Heffalumph much more, but all I have is a feeling of sadness due to the loss of a kind of childishness and innocence that this film is full of ?? I was glad to hear how Carly Simon sings, Joel McNealy showed excellent results.
