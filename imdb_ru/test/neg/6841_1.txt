Collapse! Collapse! This is Big Gay Bruce and his Big Gay Death Gun! Likely storyline? Unnecessary! Decent game? Unnecessary! Respect for his mighty grandparent? Unnecessary! Yes, this is another offensive stuffed turkey in the Buch Bruce canon. <br /> <br /> I mean, how did you start this movie? Well, let's start with the sad misconceptions of people that may be related to the book or the original film "The Day of the Jackal." Is not. In fact, it is so different (and so bad) that Fredrik Forsyth asked to be removed from his name. Now I’m not necessarily the stuffy British who can’t crack Hollywood by recasting British films. Well, okay, maybe I'm a little bit like that, but fortunately, in this case, this is an extra point. This film is so different from the original that the only thing that has been preserved is the name and the strange link. <br /> <br /> Now let's get to the premise. The son of a Russian gangster is killed during a raid by the Moscow police (in some way with the participation of the FBI, although no one bothers to explain why). In retaliation, the gangster’s brother decides to take revenge by killing the wife of the president of the United States (although again no one bothers to explain why this is a good move, although, frankly, it was until 9-11, so he wasn't aware that it led would have been a US Air Force carpet explosion in Eastern Europe). Gangster hires a "nasty" killer (Willis). Police hires a "nice" killer (gira), a "nice" killer tracks a "dirty" killer. The police inflate and periodically kill. A “nice” killer kills a “dirty” killer. The first lady is saved, and we all understand that an IRA is just a bunch of real nice guys who just want to kill innocent people. Nicely. <br /> <br /> Let's put aside the nasty Hollywood habit of playing in the troubles of Northern Ireland, as if it were a sandbox in a theme park (I’m talking more about this on bulletin boards). If Hollywood directors want to use Belfast butchers as prostitutes with golden hearts, that's their business. I, of course, reserve the right to despise them for it. This is a free country. <br /> <br /> More blatant is the fact that the film manages to patronize and insult the Irish, trying to support them. It is not politically unpleasant, it is much worse: it is incompetent. No wonder, for example, that Gere still looks so damn good, considering that he slept through all the six months it took to make this piece of shit. The fact that Gere’s accent is not only South Irish, but also a horrifying parody of South Irish, shows that the filmmakers didn’t try too hard to make money on this film. Then there is that beautiful scene at the end, where Sidney Poitier (a complete waste of space in this film) says that he is going for coffee, offers to get our “pleasant” IRA, then casually says: “Ah, but then you guys are guys” Pei Guinness "Yes, that's right, Sydney; the Irish live in Guinness and potatoes. <br /> <br /> While we are talking about Poitiers: why? In the original film, the detective is a tracker. In Jackal, Gear is a tracker. So what does Poitiers? Well, he just hangs out and, of course, looks like two. He has absolutely nothing to do except to call on the Marines at the end, and he does it only because a good man from the IRA tells him about it. <br /> <br /> While we are talking about Gere: why? I suppose it's only a matter of time when Hollywood redoes Gandhi, where Vin Diesel plays ex-mojahedin Commando Mahatma Gandhi, decapitating him through India in the 1940s and 50s (after all, he is a bit of a dark shade and, therefore, it is very likely that he is a Muslim). forget that the Gear character is a killer and, therefore, an unpleasant job. And if not, why does he know the Jackal? If not, why does he know all his moves? And if he is, then why is he such a weak biscuit and such a “sweet” person? <br /> <br /> All this suggests that the creators of this film could not (a) think about the plot (b) have decision-makers who fit their character (c) avoid stupid stereotypes, such as when is the bad boss big boss killing his friend ?? To be honest, I thought that this had turned into a Bond film (d) so that the “central” characters could do something (e) attributed to the viewers a little bit of intelligence. <br /> <br /> This film insults the British; the Irish are killed at the hands of terrorists; this is an insult to the Irish, an insult to a not-so-good, but pretty good film, which it tears off, and an insult to intelligence. But most of all ?? and the most unforgivable ?? for me it is an insult for having to sit more than two hours it took to finish. Honestly, you would have thought without a plot, without characters and without dialogue, everything would be over as soon as possible. But they didn't even have the decency to quit early.
