ANOTHER is a horror film filmed in the 1970s. It should not be confused with the same film “OTHER”, in which Nicole Kidman starred. <br /> <br /> The plot is this: a woman with strange supernatural abilities teaches her twin grandchildren something that is simply called a “game”. ". One of these twin boys, Niles, must be "good." The other - Holland - is considered evil. <br /> <br /> The idea sounds quite interesting as an abstract concept, and the film was adapted from the novel. I can only hope that the novel was interesting, since the film was incredibly boring from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The execution of this film is very similar to a television film that UK residents can see on Channel 5. In fact, this film looks as if it was a day for this channel. A small trim of one or two scenes, and this will be a film with a rating of U, similar to that produced by Disney. But even to OTHER children will be more boring than scared. OTHER. <br /> <br /> You do not need to check the director’s resume to understand that horror is not his forte. <br /> <Mr. Mulligan relies heavily on characters to lead the story. This is obvious from the start. I haven't seen any of his other films, but Killing a Mockingbird is a highly regarded crime film on this site. Unfortunately, in “FRIENDLY” the characters are given too little, and the script with giblets ensures that the film will never go as expected. <br /> <br /> Direction is as soft as you can find. Almost every scene happens in the daytime! Think about it - a scene shot in an open landscape in rural America during the daytime with a camera focusing on a vast area. Sounds scary or atmospheric? Believe me, it is not. It looks like something more like an episode of "A SMALL HOUSE ON PRAYRA" than a horror movie. And yes, and the aforementioned series, and OTHER were filmed in California. <br /> <br /> There is no noticeable danger or anger, because of which the whole exercise looks rather meaningless. <br /> <br /> The ending was obviously very disturbing and may have influenced the final of another film from this period. I will not show which movie, but I will give 2 tips - the young guy was the main character, and the movie is well known. And I will add that in the last film this concept was much more effective. <br /> <br /> Acting is actually pretty good, and this is the only reason I got 2 stars. The actors playing the twin boys, along with the actress who plays the grandmother, are all trying because of the bad material they are given. <br /> <br /> Diana Muldaur was completely wasted on the ungrateful role of the mother of twin boys, Do not be deceived by her high exhibition of bills. She has very little time on the screen, and her presence just seems like a ploy to capitalize on her long-standing television career to help attract viewers. <br /> <br /> I paid close attention to the ad on the back of the DVD cover (version for region 2 in the UK). Comparisons have been made with EXORTSIST, which I considered a complete insult to this film. There is no comparison. EXORCIST had everything that this film should contain, but it isn’t there - tension, tension, mocking humor, very exciting content, great game, excellent characterization and participation of the viewer. Ironically, EXORCIST was made only a year later, but in terms of style and performance, it seems like decades ahead of a soft drama known as OTHER. OTHER looks like a piece that seemed to be tame in the 1950s, not to mention the 1970s! <br /> <br /> The 1970s were a great era for horror films with such classic works as Exorcist, Omen, Texas Chain, MASSACRE, LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, SALEM LOT, to name just a few produced by For this reason, ANYTHING proves even more frustrating. <br /> <br /> If someone is interested in finding ANOTHER interest, they may want to read the book or study its content a little more. I would advise everyone to skip the movie.
