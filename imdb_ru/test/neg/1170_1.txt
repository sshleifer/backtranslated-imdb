The name speaks for itself - Ed Gein, a butcher from Plainfield. <br /> <br /> This is not a crazy slasher film made for teens with high energy drinks. It would fit into a well-established genre that some people find interesting, something like "Halloween" or "Texas Chainsaw Massacre." <br /> <br /> It's dark, slow, filled with cut corpses and quietly evil. There are several shocks, no monsters from the point of view, no loud electronic scores. I do not know who he is targeting - perhaps ghouls. <br /> <br /> We see that under the photos you can still see photos of skulls, hanging corpses, skins draped on the backs of chairs, and the like. And they are so disgusting that I could not help but think that this the film should be pretty good to catch up in Grand Gignola. <br /> <br /> Alas, it is not. Acting is equally terrible, as in playing in high school. The script is doing everything possible to go below vulgarity. Ed Gein, who killed only two middle-aged women and, possibly, his brother, pursues a screaming, bloody young woman through Les Weir, and she wears only a modern bra and bikini, and not historical underwear. Hein also decapitates the night watchman, which he never did in any historical sense. <br /> <br /> Direction? You could do a better job. In the first few minutes, law enforcement officers discover an abandoned vehicle with blood splattered across the windshield. There is no one. A handsome young deputy sheriff turns to his boss and suggests finding a victim who can still be around and live. The sheriff, devoid of any motivation, shouts to him: “Now you just forget it! I don’t want you to go FULLY FAMOUS! ”This should be nothing more than a business exchange of opinions. Why is the director so angry at the sheriff? Various characters listen to radio programs or recordings in which old jazz pop songs are played - for example, Louis Armstrong's “Do Not Behalf.” Is that - rural Wisconsin in the 1950s? And the characters insist on music that will appeal to Cotton Club customers in Harlem in the 1930s or to New York intellectuals such as Woody Allen. Nope Radio will play "Wheel of Fortune" by Kitty Cullen, Teresa Brewer or, which is not less likely, Lefty Frisella. Not that the dysfunction between music and events adds something to our understanding of what is happening under the images. Someone who was involved in the production just liked the old jazz pop songs, that's all. <br /> <br /> Of course, you can do very little with a small budget, but this may be several years ahead of this massacre. See “Ed Gein” with Stephen Reilsbeck for an example of a much more sophisticated way of coping with this madman and his penchant for dead bodies, as well as with a budget that could not exceed this much. <br /> <All these comments are based on the first twenty minutes of the film. This is about the way I could get. If someone finds this story well executed and fascinating, he should try to understand his tastes. This is lower than mine - and I consider myself rather perverted.
