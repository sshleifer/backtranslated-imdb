I spent enough time watching this routine work on the film, I don’t want to spend more time writing a great review. I have never smiled. ALL the jokes were boring, forced and devoid of all intelligence. I kept saying, "where's the zest?" Almost every character was a disgusting stereotype, and all situations were clichéed, and half the time there was not even any solution. Things just happened to get to the next scene. In my entire life, I cannot understand how it received as many good reviews as this. If you like a clumsy acting game and a poorly composed film, then the film Fat Girls is for you.
