I'm so glad I got this movie for only $ 5. Anime is expensive, no doubt about it. I looked after it for a while and finally I saw it on sale. I immediately grabbed him and took him home, just to hang my head in frustration. This movie sucks. I heard people talking about how horrible and cruel this film is. It really is not so scary or cruel. I watched it three times and I think I spent enough time on it. Demons get points for being unique and sometimes cool. Sex gets a point, since it is almost non-stop. Excited old man gets half a point for arousal and sexual attraction. And the main character (whose name I erased from my head) gets half a point for the cool design of his gun. I saw the main links between this movie and Demon City Shinjuku. Both have the same style animation, this is obviously due to the director, both have lame soundtracks, like antichrist, and both have terrible endings. Avoid this movie if you dislike anime.
