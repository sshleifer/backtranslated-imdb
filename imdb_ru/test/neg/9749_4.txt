This is probably the only film I’ve seen where IMDb reviews on both sides of the spectrum are 100% accurate. “Stupid” is a disgusting, stupid film, in which there is absolutely no artistic merit, and this is slander of a director like John Landis. And this is what makes it great. <br /> <br /> To appreciate the “Nonsense”, you must remember the little-known, but very true saying, said by the director Abo Kyra: “I urge you In order for any film to work, it must establish and follow its own logic, and if it does so convincingly and sincerely, then the film can really work. For example, when you see “Freddy Got Fingered” as a traditional comedy, this is complete nonsense; When you watch it with the understanding that this is actually a comedy in the genre of neo-surrealism, it is gorgeous. <br /> <br /> It works with good movies. If the “Jaws” had not accepted the reality he had created, the cessation of the explosion of the air balloon would not have worked. But many people think that "Jaws" are greatly overvalued for this reason, and they are not mistaken. But this one has its strengths, doesn't it? The fact is that such a film makes sense, if you look at it from the right point of view. Some people, like me, get it right away, while others never know how often they explain it. Jim Jarmusch once made the convincing defense of Showgirls, and even after that I still don’t see it from his P.O.V. This does not mean that he is wrong. If you have the right mood when you watch this movie (and NO, I DO NOT MEAN AS STOPPED, I’ll put it to bed now), you can really enjoy the movie for a silly, cheap, pointless farce lately. This is a farce in the style of the 80s / early 90s. <br /> <br /> The defenders and haters of this film are right: this is stupid, and that's the point. The film perceives the stupidity of the characters in almost the same way as "Charge" accepted the idiocy of Nun Johnson. And because it takes and works with it, the film focuses solely on using it to advance the plot and determine the characters. A “bad” movie would actually do this and could not properly use this logic; bad movies are bad because they make it all up, while films like “Stupid” know where they go, what they do and why from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> I cannot protect the film from an artistic point of view, so I give it such a low rating. The acting is mostly bad, the jokes are very superficial, and the quality of the live performances probably destroys what works as a cartoon. But I cannot deny that this is interesting in its own way, and therefore I defend it. I understood this immediately, and I feel sorry for those who do not. <br /> <br /> I admit that I was attracted to this film because of the delightful appearance of Christopher Lee (hearing him say: “Free the bee!” it would be worth the rent, even if I hated this film) , but I was surprised to find that, apart from the applause segment in the TV studio with Jenny McCarthy, I was never bored and I never disappointed. ” In fact, many of the jokes, due to their cartoon context, were hilarious (in particular the explosion of cigarettes with an airbag). They were stupid, but they were funny. And the film does not pretend to be something else: a comedy with a fool, about the heroes of the Foolish, and instead of apologizing for it, he gets pleasure. <br /> <br /> And that is why it works.
