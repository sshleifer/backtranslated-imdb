I'm not sure who should be blamed for this fiasco - in truth, acting is not so bad, and the story is not as horrible as some films for Disney. The story itself is shallow and undeveloped, but this is not surprising in a film of this type. Acting is more than two-dimensional, but I pay tribute to the actors for the fact that they managed to do something with the material with which they had to work. <br /> <br /> However, in my book, it is unforgivable to base the whole plotline on the theory that they created the “perfect” pop star, and then they shoot an actress who cannot sing to save her life. If a girl can't sing, ask someone who can record music! <br /> <br /> This actress is a HORRIBLE singer — she was so flat that she used to sing under a completely different key!
