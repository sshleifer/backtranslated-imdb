This is 2005, my friends ... time of amazing special effects and the era of technology. So why can't we watch a movie that is a little more thought out than this stupid low-budget movie. I have seen a lot of low budget films that shake my socks, but this one ... almost as if he is trying to be terrible. Just ... don't ... look. I can look past the lack of special effects and computer scenes, if the game itself was at least good. I feel like a little kid made this whole movie. There is not even an original storyline. Vampire killers themselves are one big hole in the plot with an attempt to mock themselves. Can someone tell me, maybe it was designed as a comedy film, and I just didnâ€™t know it? It makes me wonder what awaits the continuation for us, who so loved the first installment?
