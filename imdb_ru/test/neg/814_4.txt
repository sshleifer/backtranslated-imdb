“Jaded” offers a room with potential, as it looks at the rape of a woman by two other women and asks the question “when is rape not rape?”. Unfortunately, the film seems to be suffering from a bad direction, as it sneaks in on legal trivia, trying to weave a story with a handful of dirty mouths and poorly represented characters to end suddenly. "Jaded" is a junk-only stuff with dull eyes in the mood for some kind of dark drama.
