For GW almost failure function debut, and not because it is not without trying ... In fact, it is. Moreover, it is terrible, because his writer / director / technical man Nick Galya went through the same rehabilitation cult, which he portrays in the film. Sometimes for the first time, the filmmaker is full of energy, which comes in order to get the thumbs up from one or two film students, madly craving for a style that is too divided, unsure and sharply disappointing that the personal side of the story, the extremely personal side, is smeared with to tell a good story. Galya, who was 13 years old when he was included in a terrible program that basically tortured and brainwashed their "patients" with the help of a crazy group scare tactic, psychological "mind" sessions that could last for several days, and relationships from leaders the rehabilitation, which most Nazis would have cringed, finally escaped when he was 15 years old. I am glad that he left, although it can help, if he now goes to a real rehabilitation center for his filmmaking skills, at least for a couple of days to learn things like, say, structure, proper lighting, smooth camera movement, subtlety with actors and other basics that are constantly lost here. <br /> <br /> This is all the more frustrating because Galya is dealing with a topic that needs to be shown more to the general public (an article was recently published in Newsweek that talked about this cult AA rehabilitation). In many cases, the question arises: can some personal character studies work as documentaries, rather than narrative dramas? This is always an unpleasant feeling in all Over GW, when it seems that Galya wants to tell the truth, but does not know how to pass it through his characters. The character who, as you might think, is closest to him, a teenager from the Bronx, Tony Serra (Gallacher), whom his mother took to a rehabilitation center in New Jersey, would be closest to Galia, in fact, much more than a one-dimensional being, where there is a very a small prehistory (we see a short quirk, in black and white, in his old house) and a little connection with his mother (Moriarty), who has more potential, which is never distracted from the cold stone that passes its children to another. But I think there is a story with his two-year crisis. <br /> <br /> Immediately everything becomes rigid (the naked cavity in the first five minutes), and it soon becomes clear that, from a medical point of view, this is more like a cross between anger management and some strange religious sect where the chief physician Hiller (Insinnia) is a complete crazy person. But soon, Tony's sister, Sophia (Donohue), is being thrown into the program, and, unlike Tony's recurring moments and perceived non-compliance, she walks head-on through a haggard three-step program and once released she becomes escaped. Sometimes episodes appear in this devastated nightmare when one woman, a 22-year-old mother who participates in the program for a year and a half, discovers that she has become a prisoner who is not allowed to leave, and when the father of the main brothers and sisters comes and visits Hiller in a rage, when Sophia finally returns to them, who really possess some raw power, very short looks that Galya can at least get some leverage in pure melodrama. <br /> <br /> But these moments are counted on the fingers. These are not just unsuccessful characters, which basically boil down to stereotypes that turn into hysterical DAAR.E. robberies (perhaps some of them, such as an evil Negro boy, passive-aggressive advisers, or even Serra’s older sister, who are criticized by brothers and sisters for throwing a joint and almost thrown into the program) would have caused more resonance if more time was devoted to developing any of them). The fact is that Galya is so focused on his many roles in his tiny budget of 30,000 dollars that neither side of his potential talent can pass. He over-uses shades, mostly with a hue that looks covered in urine), he shakes his handheld DVX camera, as if it should be intense ala City of God, sometimes the character just shoots randomly at the frame, his choice of music is similar to the worst possible pseudo-indie soft rockers, and there are even meaningless fake scenes from interviews with Nicolas Serra (inspiration?) and Krakow, who feel as false as possible. <br /> <br /> Can Galya just not get an interview with the real victims with whom he was and resort to the potential artistic and cathartic plan B? Bottom line, no matter how many real life stories you might like, don’t worry about watching them in the theater or even at the box office if you don’t like the final scene with two children staring at digital Hueson at the sunset of the Hudson River with the latest reading : "Dedicated to children." Oy.
