Perhaps it was the worst movie ever made. At least, Plan 9 from space was fun. I can't believe they persuaded someone to actually invest money to do it. A complete waste of celluloid. Before I saw this shit, I had some respect for Christopherson. I think someone needed to write off the tax. Please, in the name of everything that does not suck, stop doing it before they suck again! This film should be avoided by all people who do not take LSD, or my crazy cousin, who insists that we are Native Americans. If you are in the forest and the owl starts talking to you, consult a psychiatrist. No need to make a movie about it.
