I saw this film while surfing through commercials and late night sitcoms of the 80s on television at night at 2 am. I must say, I did not expect much and did not receive much. Although Rose McGowan is hot, her performance and the rest of the cast were at least not Oscar-worthy. This film has its ups and downs, and at the end it has a couple of good turns, but, to be honest, it was awful. Not even a typical slasher movie. No blood, no sex, no nudity, no real violence. Just a bad game. I would give 3 out of 10.
