I watched this movie several times and I never liked it. I'm not a fan, the so-called "nude horror", so they can not fire me. I find it a bit sloppy, I think the thing that annoys me in Hammers is an aspect of sexual exploitation, not sex, but mental activity. I’m surprised at how many people rated this film so highly, so I’ll watch it again. But for me it was not terrible, there was no atmosphere in it, just a little "my God, look at these bad / stupid London prostitutes and that little innocent Anna, who is about to be raped by another nasty man, ooo!" I suppose that ultimately for me the film had no depth, just a bunch of disgusting, picky men and women just for the sake of the value of the skill. This, no doubt, to some extent was like Victorian England, but the scenery is even too clumsy and boring, which gives a feeling of a Victorian threat. The horrors of Roger Korman, on the other hand, are now style, atmosphere and elegant horror. For me, it was just exploitative trash.
