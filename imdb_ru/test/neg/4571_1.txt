I watched Cheats a few years ago with a friend of mine. He promoted it as a great funny movie, which is one of the best comedies. I think he was in a crack or something. I just recently learned that this film was not released in cinemas, I understand perfectly why. <br /> <br /> The main storyline includes a group of guys who cheat almost all of their assignments at school to get good grades. The main problem with this film is that the moral of all is bad. There are other comedy films for teenagers where students do bad things, but more often than not, such things don't happen at school. So I think that the idea of ​​having a whole film, in which mostly children cheat, is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> I also didn’t like the characters of this film. The protagonist is a completely smug arrogant idiot who is not a good hero. In fact, I'm not sure that you could say that there is a main character because they all cheat at school, which is wrong. The other minor characters were not funny at all, and basically it was the actors hitting the movie. <br /> <br /> In this film, the bad message and even worse acting role and characters. There are other teenage films that are much better than this film. So you don’t have to watch this movie, which is good because I don’t recommend this movie at all.
