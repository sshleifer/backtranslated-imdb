Recently, I took all three RoboCop films in one set, rather cheaply, and the only reason I did it was a special edition of the excellent first. I have seen Robocop 2 before, but not 17 years, the year when it appeared. Since then, I have never watched it, because I still remember how disappointed I was when I discovered how terrible it is. In fact, this is a complete mess, it has all the signs of problem production, when many sub-plots happen simultaneously. He has a very uneven tone, and this is also one of the most disgusting films I've ever seen. I do not mind a little violence, the first was incredibly cruel, but this one is just nasty. In addition, SFX is terrible even for 1990, say hello to a bad stop in traffic. Besides, having a drug trade, cursing a child like a villain is too much. At least Peter Weller had the common sense not to go back to the next. The only positive thing I can say about this film is that there are a couple of good jokes in it, for example, thanks for not smoking, and a children's baseball team, robbing an electrician's shop. I will quote a child who plays the villain "It sucks"
