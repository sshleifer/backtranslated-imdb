The third and final big screen comes from the popular comedy series ITV in the early 1970s. HOLIDAY ON THE BUSES is not inferior in strength and power, like the previous two projects, and from the point of view of three and a half decades later, it is truly astonishing that at least one film was made in this franchise. <br /> <br /> What makes up the plot is the adventures of Stan Butler (Reg Varney), his conductor Jack (Bob Grant) and their clumsy autocratic inspector Blake (Steven Lewis) after his dismissal from work at the bus stop. They all find work in similar positions in a camp for a holiday with Stan's family (Doris Hare, Anna Karen, Michael Robbins). <br /> <br /> British cinema had a well-deserved and significant reputation for high quality in the 1960s, but this was largely due to American financial support and guidance, which, unfortunately, came to an end, as in 1970- e years. After that, among them appeared the famous homegrown titles (among them GET CARTER). very few episodes) became as rare as Mick Jagger in a stable marriage, and British cinema followed the path of cheap budgets, slovenly and senseless sex comedies (CONFESSIONS, COME PLAY WITH ME series) and flabby, elongated celluloid versions of various television shows , mostly sitcoms (this is one of many disgusting examples). Only DAM'S ARMY and PORRIDGE were quite respectful in this respect, the bizarre success of the first ON THE BUSES film (it was the biggest box office hit of its year in 1971, it’s pointless to think now!) Led to two further sequels. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the series itself had a fun, mature, non-PC-related vulgarity that was quite tolerant in a half-hour comedy. but stretched three times, it burdens patience beyond faith. The irony is that HAMMER FILMS made this effort, because it actually resembles a horror film in a literal sense, with ancient puns, beaten, untimely farces and terrible, battered production. Values <br /> <br /> Ability to send cheese The British holiday camp is completely useless here in favor of the above elements, and it is very strange, if not terrible, to see clearly more than 50 years old Barney and a great grandiose bounty who can instantly charm young women twenty, and they constantly laughed at their own bravado and inept jokes. The presence of Wilfried Brambella (from STEPTOE AND SON) in a romantic relationship with the elderly Miss Hare does not help either, and although the film lasts about 1 hour and a half, it drags on to an infinitely depressing degree. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it was the last film in this most terrible film trilogy, and the television series itself ended at about the same time, with the sequel (“DON'T DRINK WATER”, which was severely looted by critics and ignored by the audience) followed in 1975. After that, most of the protagonists were not noticed, but Bob Grant was the one who suffered the most. other mental problems for many years, he com suicide committed in 2003. The sad code for the comedy series, which was the most popular in his era (he didn’t grow old too) and should have remained so, and not three financially successful, but artistically hopeless big screen hybrids that diluted the happy memories and occasional merits of his television colleague . <br /> <br /> RATING: 2 and a half out of 10.
