This is a story as old as a man. Jealousy for the wife and property of another man. There are even commandments against this. <br /> <br /> In this story, Raymond Barr (“Perry Mason”, “Ironside”) is the runner’s plantation manager who longs for the master’s wife and feels that he is not treated with respect. Wife starlet Barbara Payton, who tried to return after a series of dirty deeds, craved Berra, who killed her husband Paul Kavana. <br /> <br /> But lurking was a strange woman, a housemaid (Gisela Verbizek), who sees everything and is able to avenge some kind of voodoo for the offended, including another young woman (Carol Varga), whom Burr professed love. <br /> <br /> Burr is poisoned and becomes, or thinks, he becomes a gorilla. Peyton will have to marry Kong, if she ever wants her marriage to be concluded, as he goes into the jungle every night. <br /> <br /> The end is predictable. But the exciting question of this film is why Payton will ever be afraid. With these spiky rockets protruding from her chest, no animal could approach her to cause harm.
