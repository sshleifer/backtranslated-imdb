The mystery of the low-budget murder that the Public Defender is trying to clean up his client from the murder for which the person was convicted 12 years ago. Complicating the situation is the fact that he escaped detention after sentencing, but the police believe that this man is innocent of the murder, and is trying to find the real killer. Gig Young in the role of PD is fine, and James Anderson in the role of a convicted murderer is actually quite good, but the whole picture just rattles along with a slight wait, and despite the fact that there are good actors in the cast, the performances are generally lower nominal. Directed by George Arkenbo, obviously, he liked to make westerns more - around the same time he released the series Gina Autry in Colombia - but even if he tried to bring at least some vividness to this picture, the hacking script would have failed in his attempts. At best, the average film ends with a scene in the courtroom, which is straight from the Perry Mason episode and just as predictable.
