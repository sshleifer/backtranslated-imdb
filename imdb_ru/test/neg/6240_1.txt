How two great actors take a piece of trash, like this, to the viewers. My only conclusion is that they and their director believe that ANY film they are shooting in should simply be seen and applauded, <br /> <br /> Now about the film - perhaps the worst “thriller”, which i have ever seen. The actors showed minimal emotions; the plot was reasonable for 1/2 hour (not 91 minutes). The FBI agent was an almost stupid parody - his partner was clearly taken aback and did not say a word. Paraphrasing Robert Redford, the villain was meaningless crap! The film was stretched and meaningless - the only question is whether the hero will die or not. One really bizarre part of the story - it seemed that the waiting family lasted at least a few days; the hero and anti-hero seemed to take only one day. <br /> <br /> in general, a waste of time
