One day I will watch a movie that will surprise me completely. One that appears out of nowhere will be a little lively entertainment. One that is pure pleasure from start to finish. Well, guys, when a stranger calls, this is NOT that movie. This is an incredibly stupid and contrived remake of a much better 1979 horror classic. Our main character Jill is forced to look after children after a few minutes of talking on a mobile phone, and she is haunted by the phone calls of a mysterious subscriber. Every clich√© in the world is used here from the stupid jump of a cat from a hidden place to a car that does not drive a killer, it can be anywhere at any time. This film is bad ... not even bad in "so bad, it's good," more in "so bad, it's boring." Skip this damn movie and save your movie for something else. You will thank me later, believe me on this. Rating: D-
