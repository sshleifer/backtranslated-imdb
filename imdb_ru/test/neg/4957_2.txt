Jack Brooks (Trevor Mathews) is a college student with serious anger problems. His family was brutally murdered by a monster when he was a child, and now he pours out his anger at everything and everyone. <br /> <br /> So when his professor (Robert Englund) begins to show signs of monsterism, he learns that he must control his rage and use it for good instead of evil, and fight creatures that chase his nightmares with fatal night. <br /> <br /> Truly earning a B rating, but what was great was that he didnâ€™t focus on the lousy CGI rated B graphics. In fact, 0% of the movie was CGI. Monsters were really well assembled, and although the storyline was not enough, it was somewhat watchable ... at least once.
