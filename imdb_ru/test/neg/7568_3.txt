I like the J-Horror, the anime, and even the digging of the pink movement, which some claim is a member, but it has done nothing for me. Iâ€™m ready to go a step further and label it as one of the biggest disappointments in my film-making career. <br /> <br /> Three young rockabilly walk, enjoying the rape of girls. One of the group begins to develop conclusions about their passing time, when his younger sister almost catches them in action. Invariably, the group turns itself on as soon as once friends start fighting with each other. This ends with a note suitable for the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Besides the fact that friends shout at each other, what they often do, not much happens here. The film is littered with LONG continuous shots that only exacerbate the problem. In addition, even when the film begins to do something interesting, it suddenly gets stuck in the ethereal philosophy, which never makes any sense. For example, after one of his friends changed his mind to attack the girls, he goes out and does it again, but then stops his friends in turn. BUT? Cinematography is slow, and the lighting is bad. Scripture is fine, as is acting, which makes it a partisan effort from the very beginning. Mix the lack of technical skill with fragile content, and you will have nothing more than a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Yes, and one more extra note, at least one of the girls who appears in affection, does not look old enough to do such things. <br /> <br /> 3/10
