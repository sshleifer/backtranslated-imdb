I sat on TV hoping because of the names that it would have been worth the time ... but, dear Gussy, who would have thought that this script was worth writing? The main idea is excellent, but the performance is terribly bad, with a constantly illogical sequence of scenes, a finale that is almost ridiculously melodramatic, and poor Rock Hudson wanders around with a clear, confused look on his slightly sagged face. Looks like a bad B movie from the 40s ...
