Steven Seagal is back! Here with his third film released this year. Of course, as a fan once, who has become increasingly dissatisfied, I can say that it is not surprising that this is pretty lame. First, the film hit the headlines because of obvious problems in production because of Seagal. He was late for the film set, changed the script, the film crew, etc. And usually caused problems for director Don E. Fauna Leroy (his lack of talent is his problem!). This also happens during their second collaboration with an upcoming mercenary who promises to be as bad as this garbage. This also marks a big turning point in Seigal's career, because this film is the first of his to really pull out the footage. The ticker was a little bit, but this movie takes a cookie. They take bits from, Order (Film Van Damme, Seagals is the biggest competitor in DTV films!) No Undisputed code of conduct, as well as the entire sequence of actions from the little-known Peter Weller in the title role of the Top Of The World vehicle. Interestingly, the car chase, stolen from Weller's epic, made almost 10 years ago and, ironically, cheaper than this garbage, is actually the best action movie scene. I was quite shocked when Dolph Lundgren lingered a bit in the world of action movies, from which, fortunately, he escaped. Seagal, however, is the market leader for DTV action, and its main competitors are Van Damme and Snipes. Seagal still manages to sell films, and I don't know how to do it. Surely the fans are bored with this terrible, thirsty for a return to like Above The Law. The story here is completely lame. In fact, there are so many holes in the film in the plot, which he does not even think about. For example, at the end of the film there is a little girl whom Sigal seems to know in the orphanage to which he gives a necklace. Why I don’t know, but we’ll never see her in the rest of the film or hear her mention. Seagal has a girl in this film who is at the beginning of the film with a psychic, and she is haunted by visions that by the end of the film are never explained and mean nothing. The film is so ridiculously glued together by a series of senseless dads that it causes a headache ... This is Segal's most stupid film! Sigal himself is as wooden as ever, however, to his credit, as far as I can tell, he is not duplicated in this. Seagal, however, feels the need to speak as if he is a gangster rapper, which makes me wait long for those days when he put on his Brooklyn / Italian-American accent in his classic early films. He also has a terribly unfunny double act with Trechem, which I consider to be a rapper. It's funny that the producers seem to think that the Seagal combo, plus the hip-hop star seems to work, because his DMX team in Exit Wounds has been his most successful film since Under Siege. Obviously, if no one heard about the rapper, it would not work. It is an action movie, and therefore the action itself must be judged. Unfortunately, the action that did not come from the NU Image back catalog is strictly routine. There are several small scenes of fighting with Seagal's classic aikido, but when 90% is played by an understudy who does have a strict work in this film, it really doesn’t impress. There are also a few standard shootouts, in which only a good cruel and bloody mallard actually takes place. In general, this is a terribly boring experience, and again I left the same verdict: Seagal lost it! I keep asking the summer question: “Why do people still watch his films?” This is all very good and good, like a question, but the sad bastard that I continue to watch his films in the deceived hope that he can do something good. time. The odds are slim, unlike Seagal's ever-expanding waist. * 1/2
