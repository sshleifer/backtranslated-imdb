I did not like this movie. I rented it, hoping it would be something like the 10th Kingdom. I was disappointed when I discovered that it was not. I also found it just nervous. The game was bad, the characters were incredible, and the jumps over time were insane. I recommend this film only if you are in the mood to see a crazy guy running around, but I am sure there are better films with the same. I can not believe that I wasted my time on this.
