In fact, this is just a stupid chase story, almost identical to millions of other chase stories in terms of games, expectations, plot, dialogue, characteristics (or lack thereof) and pace. <br /> <br /> One area in the “Network” is at odds with traditional chase movies in the subject material: computers. Unfortunately, the authors of the script clearly do not understand the differences between the pocket calculator and Cray! <br /> <br /> Computer novices should not watch this movie because it will make them paranoid with computers. Regardless of what Hollywood is trying to tell us, it's just not so easy to erase someone's identity by hacking. There is still too much paper documentation in the world, and in 1995 it became even more. <br /> <br /> Computer professionals should not watch this movie either. I mean a magical virus that can melt your entire PC when you press "Escape"? You are welcome. And the whole virus, including the cool multimedia effects of dissolving your screen (what does this mean?), Can fit on a single 1.44 MB diskette? Yes whatever.
