So, once I was in a video store looking for a movie. I stumbled upon this and filmed it, because it was a film that I had not seen or even heard. <br /> <br /> Now I like slasher films, but this is just awful, not even good for laughing. Besides the fact that it is ultra-ultra-cheap and contains all the slashes of film and horrible behavior, it has the most incompetent and inept direction I've ever met. Now sometimes the aforementioned traits may be present in the film, and some pleasures may still be, but not here. A painful example of domestic horror.
