This movie is nothing new. Nothing you haven’t thought of before, nothing you haven’t heard of before. The story of a homosexual who is brutally murdered in a small town, and the reaction of people can be affected in different ways, and this film chose the most demagogic and slushy. One of the biggest shortcomings of this film is that it is neither a film nor a documentary. The director used the recordings of the original interviews and made the actors play them as if it were a film. The result is strange. And finally, I read in previous comments, which said that people who don't like this film are against gays. I’m pretty sure that these comments come from people who consider themselves tolerant, but don’t tolerate that other people don’t like this movie. This is a funny world.
