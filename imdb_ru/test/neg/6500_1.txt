If you plan to plan your program for the film festival, do not mislead what is said in the booklet. It is a complete waste of time and energy. I watched Bunuel, I saw Dali and admired them; but it is not surrealism, it should not be at all. Did they never think about the reputation of the human race when taking this photo? Once we are extinct as a result of global warming, they will remain our civilization. What if the aliens try it on the example of our intellectual capital? With all due respect for the efforts made in this, it might be a good idea to stop all copies of this film - or whatever.
