First of all, let me emphasize that I am not a big fan of political correctness. In fact, I like satire or dark humor, even if he jokes with minorities. The reason I’m almost certain that this racist job is not worth looking at is because minorities don’t laugh to demonstrate their living conditions, their social conditions or how people treat them. Moreover, he uses all the silly stereotypes and prejudices to reinforce xenophobic feelings and reservations. It is a pity, but it is not surprising that other comments did not understand this, because we all had a cheap laugh. Congratulations.
