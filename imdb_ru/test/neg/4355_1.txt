The quality you probably remember after watching the Big Knife is how claustrophobic it is. His rhythm is sacrificed for a single dialogue texture. This is very extreme. Modern viewers will feel that each point has been made (and then some), but the film will still not move on, or will serve the viewer and change the situation. It is very inert. At the 45-minute mark, I was sure that I watched two very slow hours. My besieged answer was: “My God, where is it going?” It seems that the Odet was paid in words ... <br /> <br /> This is a good place to mark the decline in drama from the highest level in the 40s thanks the vanity-laden projects of the 50s and 60s, before real cinematic merit was rediscovered in the 70s to disappear again. Here we get demonstrative, ordinary, emotional flashes from Steiger, Lupino et al. and the camera moves in advance to meet an overly blocked practice. This is due to the growth of the Method; the regrettable tendency to sacrifice all the other virtues of the film in order to give the actors their most mercenary desires. "Great game", ho-hum, killed the thoughts in the movie. <br /> <br /> Jack Palance's forehead and pompadure move back and push forward every time he reacts to something. It is disturbing. <br /> <br /> This is terribly boring.
