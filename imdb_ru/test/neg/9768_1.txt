This film is absolutely terrible! I thought because there were good actors in it, such as Gabriel Union, Hill Harper and, of course, the infamous Billy D. Williams. The film is long and stretches with the documentary style of the show Gabrielle Union, who died in the film, talking about her family; which, by the way, is a tangled family, because you never know who is who and who is connected with whom. I would not recommend this film to anyone, and I would like to take it back to where I got it from. From time to time I fell asleep because of boredom. Do not waste your time and money on this film. It might be more true to life with more drama and less boredom.
