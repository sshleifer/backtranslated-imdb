I loved the book “Little Princess” most of my life and was very excited that a movie had appeared. But I was shocked by this adaptation. Not only is the woodworking, and the conspiracy a confusing mix of different incidents in the book, but the topic is all wrong. The real theme of this story should be that a girl can only be a princess when she behaves like one, like Sarah, when she gives 5 of 6 buns to a poor child, even if she is very hungry. The theme of the film seems to be that all the girls are princesses, which significantly reduces the cost of Sarah’s actions, and it seems that this should be written on a card with a label, and not in this story. <br /> <br /> There are many others that are not right with this film — too many to list, but here are some of the larger ones: this story should be written in British in the mid 1800s, and not in america during the first world war. From the very beginning, Miss Minchen is cruel to Sarah, doing her actions when Sarah is penniless is far less astounding than they would have been if she were drunkenly sweet in the beginning, as it should be. Nowhere is it mentioned that Becky is black. Sarah's father * does not * return, he is dead. This is his closest friend and employee of the diamond mines, who finds Sarah and restores her in his place. In fact, diamond mines are not even mentioned, although they are the source of the wealth of Sarah. <br /> <br /> Throughout everything Sarah encountered, she always behaves like a princess, giving everything she can and forgiving those who hurt her. She would never have called Lavinia "a snotty bully with two faces." Such a thing is completely out of her character and undermines the whole philosophy that it should behave well, no matter what. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the worst adaptation of the book to the screen I have ever seen (with noticeable exceptions “Enchanted Ella” and “Ann from the Green Gables - a Continuing History”) so I do not understand why the director felt that this needed to be changed to make it interesting. I would advise anyone who wants to know this story to see the 1987 version, which is much better. Or better yet, read the book. It will cost you more time than half an hour spent on this version of the film.
