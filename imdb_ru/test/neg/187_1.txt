and I still don't know where the hell is this movie going? I mean, really, what is this movie about? Is it about demonstrating the complete absence of Arabic from Sean Connery? About showing that if he could play the role of a Moroccan warlord, then he naturally played the role of Ramirez in the highlander? Why was Teddy Roosevelt even in this movie? Why was there so much sand that was used so little? Where were so many slaps on the table? Why did Teddy ignore the Japanese guy he used to shoot a bow? Did he understand that this man was Japanese? Why was there no credible excuse for Connery accent? At least Jean-Claude Van Damme has an excuse for his French accent, whether raised by French nuns in Hong Kong (Double strike) raised in a bay in Louisiana (Universal soldier) or having a French mother and brought up in Indochina (I donâ€™t even remember the name of this movie)? Can anybody explain this?
