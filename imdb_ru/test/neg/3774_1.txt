I attended this movie. Travolta came to make a Q & A after the end of the film. It was a small observation room in Tribeca. Out of courtesy to him, I did not come out what I wanted to do. This is filmmaking at worst. To begin with, the script was poorly written. The writer writes in one voice. The dialogue was crossed out and cliché. How this writer / director made Scarlett Johansen, John Travolta and Lions Gate Entertainment support her is the only brilliant thing she has achieved in this fiasco. <br /> <br /> I really recommend this movie to all novice writers, directors and directors. Because when you are told that you are wasting time and you cannot achieve your goals. Hey ... just look at this shit and tell yourself ... if they can do it, then anything is possible. <br /> <br /> PS- Travolta made great questions and answers, although ... he was calm, spoke fluently and was a down-to-earth pleasant guy. The director / writer stood by. When John tried to engage her in a conversation, she moved away like a piece of wood, and never joined. I looked at her and thought ... how this person was able to successfully “transfer” to agents, studio managers, talented specialists ... when she cannot open her mouth at the screening of her film. Some of those present came to the conclusion that she must have strong family ties in the business. <br /> <br /> After you look at it, you have to follow him with Guy Ritchie's “Zvett Away” zero star masterpiece with the most unintentionally funny and worst performance of Madonna’s wife. She is so bad and looks so bad in this film that I believe that it was his way of avenging her for all the insults he gets from her at home.
