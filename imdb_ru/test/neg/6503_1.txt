ABC is preparing its repertoire for another unrealistic view of rural Australia. Yes, guys, it's all there. Buck Burke (Jeremy Sims, actor with a little talent) There is Uncle Jeff, Big Dad of Lost Sources. Uncle Jeff's scenes are like Tennessee Williams speed. The only saving grace is Russian actress Natalya Novikova as the crazy Basya. She is great. I can't understand why John Waters took on the role of the psychologist's husband Lilly. I must have needed the money I expect! However, he will not last long, as Lil and Buck will be without a suit. Just look at this lemon to see how bad the Australian show can be. Honestly, I'm ashamed.
