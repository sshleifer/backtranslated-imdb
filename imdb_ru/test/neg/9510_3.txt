The third blow by Franco Zeffirelli (“The Taming of the Shrew”, “Romeo and Juliet”, “Jesus of Nazareth”, “Othello”) when transferring Shakespeare to the screen works very well, with the participation of Mel Gibson (“Mad Max,“ Deadly Weapon ”and - Awareness of the “Passion of the Christ” in a role previously owned by Sir Lawrence Olivier (and rightly so; see My Review on his “Hamlet”, perhaps the best interpretation of one of the eternal bards) and remade 5 years later By Kenneth Branag as a full-blooded treatment, explaining his A total of 3 hours and 22 minutes in conjunction with the performance of sleep (and the many small additions that have been chosen by the experienced master of modern master William Shakespeare, Kenneth Brana, director of Heinrich V and The Dead again. Glenn Close has joined the Lethal Weapon star (“Big Cold”), Paul Scofield (“The Man”). For All Seasons ”), Alan Bates, Jan Holm, Michael Maloney (who will be played as Roderigo opposite Kenneth Branag h and Lawrence Fishburne in Otello by Oliver Parker ( cm. my review of the “stage” version of the Olivier tragedy, although he only starred in it) and the one Bran will play as Laertes in his 3-hour version of Hamlet (due respect to Sir Lawrence Olivier and his classic version of the play; see also my a review on this matter 5 years later), Nathaniel Parker (who will play the role of Cassio in his brother’s version of Othello 4 years later) and Helena Bonham-Carter, who will play in Frankenstein Mary Shelley 4 years later. br /> <br /> Zeffirelli conceived this film as a tribute to Sir Lawrence Olivier (who died in 2 g Ode to this film), and for the most part it works quite well. What I was a little uncomfortable about is that Zeffirelli missed many lines, and in one scene he passes one of the lines of Hamlet to the Ghost. In addition, Helena Bonham "Carter did NOT convince me as Ophelia. She was too sad and unreal, while Gene Simmons (who perpetuated the role in the version of Olivier) and Kate Winslet (who did an acceptable job in the directorial, epic revisionist reworking of" Hamlet ") Kenneth were good in role with Gene Simmons BEST Offe in the history, so she was nominated for the Best Actress in 1948 (she did not win - what a shame). Jan Holm said his lines too quickly, not as slowly as I expected in the scene with him, Laertes and Ophelia. But again, I am more accustomed to interpreting the role of Felix Ailmer and Richard Biers, and I think that they did a better job than Holm, in their respective versions of Hamlet (both were made by great directors, actors, text editors). , producers And the stars of all their versions of the work of Bard) as Polonius. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast, however, was excellent. The scene where Hamlet confronts her mother was very well done, but Olivier and Brana made the scene even better in order to create even more emotional tension and tension needed for the scene. <br /> <br /> I recommend this version just to pass the time, but it is ideal as a teaching tool for English teachers in the 12th grade (I recommend first showing the version of Olivier, and then Brana, and finally this version). Despite the rating of the film “PG”, there was nothing disgusting in the film. Only what was required in the play. <br /> <br /> The best versions of Hamlet: <br /> <br /> # 1 Sir Lawrence Olivier and Kenneth Brande. Both were so good that I can't decide which one was the best. See my reviews on these versions for more information. <br /> <br /> # 2 Franco Zeffirelli. This one was fine. It all started well from the stage, which is not in the play, but then it was necessary to go to the actual beginning of the play, where the guard shouts: "Who is there?" "No, answer me. Stand up and turn around !!" This scene scares the hell out of you, because you are sitting quietly, and then, damn it, you almost jump out of your skin. In short, this scene sets the tone for the rest of the piece. A huge mistake from Zeffirelli to skip this scene. It is also inappropriate to many lines (and cut off others that I think should be inserted), for example, the line where Hamlet tells Ophelia: “Take you to a convent, why will you be a breeder of sinners?”; It was assumed that this line occurred in the scene, and not in the place where it was placed in the film (after the monologue "To be or not to be"). This version fights between cutting out too much or too little from an excellent literary work. Kenneth Branagh would fix it 5 years later with his uncut version of the tragedy, making the HIS version more worthy of tribute to Sir Lawrence Olivier, as several actors (besides him) performed Hamlet on stage / or in many films once and in different cases. However, taking Jefférelli on Hamlet is true to the play, and this is what I was looking for. The setting for the final match was the same as in the versions of Olivier and Bran, only that the outcome in the Bran version was more violent than the outcome of the previous two correct versions (more according to the play; Olivier softened it ... and it worked equally well ), and more closely followed the play, Brana threw in several innocuous touches on his own ... very good effect. <br /> <br /> This version is not appreciated.
