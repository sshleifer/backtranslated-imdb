Bad. Personal opinion? People who made it? They knew it when they did it. To play in this film, again, my opinion, you had to meet three criteria ... # 1: You had to have your own Gothic clothing and jewelry. Thus, the wardrobe becomes easier and cheaper. # 2: You should have been able to memorize and repeat your lines without prompt cards. Please note that I did not say that you should have done it well. Saves time and paper work. No. 3: You should have been ready to undress. Gives a rating of R and thereby supports sales. Want to watch the best movie? Easy. Gather a camera and a few of your friends and do it yourself. Believe me, you won't do any worse. As for movies about vampires, this sucks. And here's a hint for people like me who love to look for little weirdness in movies ... Consider the connection between vampires and crosses. Now look at the symbols and names on the gravestones in the cemeteries where the fragments of this thing were taken. Ed Wood himself could not better plan such an accident.
