The letter and direction of Duncan Roy is valid and regularly below par. Actually it seems to stink. AKA is almost as bad as its recent (horrible, self-serving) remake of Dorian Gray - an absurd, distorted dialogue between the characters of the "upper class", both idiotic and pretentious, amateurish, burnt in its essence. Characteristics and script - and sometimes acting skills - are creaky, like a school play ... but, even worse, there is a kind of Peacock confidence that the direction simply destroys the soul when the director clearly does not catch ... he is simply not good . Diane Kvik must be embarrassed. DR, you should just get out of the movie ... seriously.
