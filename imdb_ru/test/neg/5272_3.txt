Kevin Spacey is my favorite actor of all time, no doubt on the list of others when it comes to great actors. He even showed a good Irish accent in "The Ordinary Decent Criminal". But Kevin Spacey, how is the mafia leader? Or even a robber? I'm not sure that he can go that far. The film simply did not make any sense to me, and some stories did not seem resolved to me. <br /> <br /> I know once again that IMDb will make me write ten more lines. But I'm not sure what I can say about this movie, because I'm still trying to figure it out. Stupid, isn't it? But I'm sure more than a few of you IMDb users are in the same predicament as I am right now when you just want to say one or two lines about the movie, but now you need to make ten lines? Wow, that should do it. : D <br /> <br /> 3/10
