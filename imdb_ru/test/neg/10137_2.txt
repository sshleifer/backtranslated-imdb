My parents might like this show, but I can't find humor in it. What is so funny about the fact that the dentist’s husband soaks his assistant hygienist, and the eldest daughter is soaked with the captain of the high school football team? Absolutely nothing! Sometimes I am shocked by what people think is humor in our time. The show is responsible for such shows as “The Date Game” and “The Bridal Game”, which brought the problem of sex to the fore in the mid-1960s. Of course, the series has its own touching moments, but this does not justify the content that was otherwise included in this series. This is nothing more than the family-oriented days of "I love Lucy" about five decades ago. <br /> <br /> The answer to the question of why this series plays on the cable channel “Lifetime” is that the management of this channel thinks that women can relate to the character of Reby! I absolutely don’t like the character of Reba Hart’s daughter, Kira. She is best described as an ugly and bitter teenager! It's funny, I wonder if the actress played Kira; Scarlett Pomers, it's like in real life from acting. Who plays the booze of the former husband of the dentist, Christopher Rich, is not much better. Barbara Jean, played by Melissa Peterman, is crazy in herself! The characters Van and Cheyenne are also very annoying. <br /> <br /> Another thing that confuses me is why the creator of the series’s dingbat, Alison M. Gibson, decided to install the show where I live 25 miles from; Houston, Texas! Reba McIntyre is not even from this state, she is Oklahoman! Why for one or several seasons did they decide to make random music look like a snorting pig? By this I mean that we hear how this baritone saxophone plays the drums accompanying it, but the melodies are mostly soundless!
