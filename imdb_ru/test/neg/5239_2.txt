I like Christoph Lambert as an actor. He played in several good films (Highlander, Metro, Greystok, ...). But I can't even think that he played in this film. The story is almost nothing, the special effects are very bad and the actors too. To resume the film, I can only say one thing: for the first time I watch the film and I want to leave in 10 minutes.
