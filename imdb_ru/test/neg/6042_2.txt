Someone said that WEBS is very much like a series of sliders, and I have to agree. Spoilers: I never liked the actors on the Sliders, and I rarely saw them, except when there was nothing better. WEBS is a movie type to see if you have no other choice. To read a book. WEBS has such television actors who look as if they are present as part of their PROBATION or Work Release Program. Some low-budget television films have actors who at least look enthusiastic. The actors at WEBS look like they are being paid the minimum wage and they are working on Time-Clock. They have such a desperate "The Paycheck-Better-Not-Bounce" look. The royal spider looks great, except that it is rarely seen, and there are no other spiders (and no networks). The spider queen bites humans and they become zombie spiders, which means they try to keep their eyes wide open when attacking people. All people fight among themselves for a number of different reasons, and they do not sympathize. After meeting all the "people", I would recommend the charm school for the characters. All that made me feel the network was APATHY. I was numb from the characters and hoped for some interesting bloody effects and special effects. The blood was minimal, and the special effects were reserved for the ugly spider queen, who looked good. If WEBS had a bunch of spider creatures eating people, it would be more exciting. Apparently they could only budget zombie spiders. WEBS is a sad entry into the field of spider-oriented movies. This can be considered the worst movie about spiders, because the eight-legged monsters had excellent special effects.
