Are you alive? Well, I think I'm smart, educated, liberal and really into the movies. I really like and have a great sense of humor. I got the impression that this is a terribly painful comedy. They were paid for it, gasoline was used, electricity was burned, food was consumed, kits were built ........ why? I blame the current state of the world in this film and in all those people who are associated with it, I will even include us among the audience. We are all guilty and deserve what comes. It's not funny, not much happens, it seems to everyone that it is boring or boring. There is no talk, communication is minimal. As far as I know, there is no plot. In fact, I just lost 89 points in a few minutes of my life. I will never return this time. The only message I received is perhaps life is too short to sit and watch movies of people who do little ... and then you will die!
