I went to the cinema with a little apprehension, I went out, boiling with anger at the trash (passing for the film), which I witnessed. Actors, especially Travolta, should be ashamed of themselves for participating in this. Obviously, the only thing on their mind is a paycheck check, not to mention humiliating their talents and us. Travolta has to go back to creating a few more “Look who's talking” films, as he returned to his level of work to Tarantino. It comes to something when the continuation of L W Talking is better than this. Travolta is no longer the King of the Steep, but the King of the Corn. Michael Caine himself admitted that he was making bad paycheck films, and Trovolta should follow his example if he has self-esteem!
