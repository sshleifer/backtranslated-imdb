I do not understand the jokes. I truly believe that this is my problem with modern cinema or with films worth millions of dollars, in the hope that this will be the next greatest sensation. Isn't that weird? people just don't laugh anymore, and I believe that one of the ills of this problem is the film “Showtime”. There was absolutely nothing, from the beginning to the end of the credits, with all the jokes between Murphy and De Niro, with Rousseau as eye candy, even with standard clichés that make people faint with programmed laughter, there was nothing in this film that made me laugh . Throughout this debacle of the film, there were no powerful physical jokes or clever vocal jokes. From the very beginning, I didn’t perceive the match between De Niro and Murphy as something more than the excitement of Hollywood. Throughout the entire commentary, the director vividly talks about the jokes and laughter that occur during the shooting ?? where was it in the movie? Does this apply to either two problems? the director really doesn’t have a comedy feeling, or the editor doesn’t understand the value of the film. In any case, they both condemned the entire hour and a half spent on the Hollywood nightmare "Showtime". <br /> <br /> Not finding a reason to laugh, there was no reason to follow these characters at any time in the film. There was a glimpse of humor with De Niro’s desire to raise pottery as a hobby (but the director had to write KILN in a car so that viewers could understand “WHO DOES IT”), but it was discarded and never developed. There was an idea that Murphy was an actor, but apart from this first monologue, no one would understand. Does he rent a room in the producer’s house where he can afford the salary of a policeman? It is simply not designed even for Hollywood standards. There was a bad guy who wanted a big weapon, but the weapon was never developed, nor was there any real test of the ability of the weapon ?? even at the end. Laughing at the accent has become more of a joke than remembering a weapon. Where in this TV show? Rousseau was supposed to get permission from this random guy at the beginning, but there were no consequences. In the middle of this film there was nothing but questions and meaningless juggling. Random characters have been entered, forgotten, re-entered and forgotten again and again. The director and producer laughed at it, while we, the scant viewer, must suffer because of jokes and stereotypes of cliches. <br /> <br /> Was there a love interest in this film? Was there really a sinister bad guy who separated from the comic duo to bring real evil to the screen? Were there any references to pop culture that were not returned to Robert De Niro? Was there random chaos in this movie? If you need answers to these questions, obviously, you will not find them in Showtime. The fact that I confused this review with a question to a question only means that this sub-item (in fact, much lower than the sub-item of the sub-item) did not fill out the quota or resembled anything valuable to the cinematic world. Of course, he had big names and one really neat explosion, but there was nothing substantial about it. It was almost as if the director had said before the shooting that he needed clichés, and not ordinary clichés ?? go with the bad ones. The plot did not have a linear structure. Jokes were boring. The characters were gray and underdeveloped. This place is below even the best films "buddy." I like to give films the benefit of doubt, but nothing happened in this film. Even Shatner could not save this film, and he even tried his best. <br /> <br /> In general, I cannot and will not offer this film to anyone who has an impulse. The commentary only confirms the pathetic nature of the film, with obvious flaws, horrible jokes and creators questioning the legitimacy of their work. If creators can't stand behind Showtime, why should we? I didn’t want “Death Weapon” when I watched it, but I really wanted something like that. I understand that there was some form of criticism of the "reality show" and the corrupt nature of the media, but this message did not hit the page. In fact, I think that I saw how the “media” left the theater for the first time when I watched it. Shame carries its heavy hand with this film, and I can't blame it. Murphy used to be a big star, comedy was his second name (see “Coming to America”), but lately he seems to have lost his advantage. De Niro obviously wants to get away from the image that haunts him, but making such films will only put him aside. One of these films is equal to one Scorsese film. <br /> <br /> Skip this movie. I promise this will make your last cinematic days worthwhile. Oh, and if you laughed at some joke in this movie ?? I'm sorry! <br /> <br /> Rating: * of *****
