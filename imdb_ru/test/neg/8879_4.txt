After seeing this film several times, I came to the conclusion that Milos Foreman made a very bold decision to create a muse for Goya, when the artist led what most would consider a stormy, passionate life, while the French revolution and the Napoleonic era raged throughout Europe undoubtedly the one that will have enough drama to build upon. Although I do understand that Mr. Forman, in the microcosm of the tragedy of life, Ines linked the destruction of the world at that time, I had a feeling that there was so much Goya left in it, so much of its humanity. The strongest and most eloquent moment in this film was that, because of the fallen nature of man, each of us is a potential villain in the stream of life, each of us has an evil within us, which we must fight with the help of God. How eloquent when Goya says that Ines should have helped more, as is true for all of us! We must protect and defend the innocent. A magnificently ironic scene in which a once-imprisoned priest sentenced to death, announces the death sentence of Lorenzo, who initially condemned him, is a brilliant case. I had to wish for something more when the loans rolled. Maybe less unrealistic coincidences, but more of the characters' inner life.
