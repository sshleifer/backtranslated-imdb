MELTDOWN is quite an interesting SCI-FI. There is no large budget, very few special effects; but a decent acting and plot of global doom is enough to withstand viewing. The asteroid touches the atmosphere and pushes the Earth into orbit closer to the Sun. Global warming is quickly becoming unbearable. A determined police officer from the Los Angeles Police (Casper Van Dien) is doing everything possible to save the world from certain destruction, as the increasing pace is destructive. The pressure is aimed at saving mankind from this solar catastrophe; and protect your daughter, nurse, ex-wife, and television reporter's friend. Cast: Stephanie von Pfetten, Venus Terzo, Amanda Crew and Vincent Gale.
