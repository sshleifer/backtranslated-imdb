I have seen crappy kung fu movies. Living in Taiwan, they come instead of sitcoms in America. I have seen films laugh at themselves, but this film belongs to the sad category of martial films that try too hard with terrible actors, terrible props and terrible music to take them seriously. I am very sorry for the man who wrote the music for this film. How sad it is to be a composer who has to throw out nonsense, as I thought, should have been called â€œNinja Drama Scene, Op. 1 "or" Variations on the bad guy who sent the gun to the girl's head when he stood in Angle "or the daring" Helicopter Flight. "Then the battle scenes were over and the captions ended. It really made me laugh in tears. If the "special effects" were not sufficient evidence that it was low-budget, the fact that only two or three crew members, presumably local people, who, although they were good for the much-needed Philippine economy, were probably done solely to save money. he has ever done anything since the time of this series of films. They rented equipment despite creating sequels for this film. It was pretty funny too. However, it wasn't really music that pleased me (which half expected GI Joe's pop-up lively Sargeant Slaughter ), and the ending ... I guess it will be a spoiler, if there really was a plot to spoil, but when the American ninja throws the girl in Jackson's hands, and then removes the mask, I wanted him to jump off the roof, and Jackson threw the girl, to catch him. <br /> <br /> I think that would be the perfect highlight for this movie joke.
