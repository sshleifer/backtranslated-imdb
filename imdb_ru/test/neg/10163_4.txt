John Wayne is without a doubt one of the most popular and favorite actors of all time. His career lasted more than forty years, and during this time he starred in films such as Angel and the Villain, Green Berets, Sands of Iwo Jima, Rio Bravo, North of Alaska and Invincible. < br /> <br /> The films listed above are recognized as one of his best, unlike this 1934 work "Randy Goes Alone," which was forgotten over time, which is not surprising, since there is nothing memorable if counting a very short running time is only 53 minutes. <br /> <br /> Young John Wayne plays Randy Bowers, who for some unknown reason how much somewhere arrives at the salon to nowhere and finds that everyone inside has been killed. Looking around, the detachment arrives and finds Randy there, and they arrest him, accusing him of being a member of a gang and demanding to know where the rest of his gang is. on murder charges Sally Rogers, whose uncle owned the cabin and was killed, arrives at the prison to see Randy, to clarify that he was one of the gang members (she was hiding in a secret room when the shooting took place). Sally does not believe that Randy is a murderer and does not recognize him, therefore, as long as the sheriff is gone, she takes the keys to him and Randy runs away. Fleeing from the sheriff and his squad, Randy conveniently stumbles into the shelter of the gang in the cave responsible for the killings. Randy intends to clear his name and bring the gang to justice. <br /> <br /> “Randy Rides Alone” is a fun movie, especially if you're a John Wayne fan. But at the same time, he has too many shortcomings that cannot be ignored. The film is also very outdated, as one would expect; we have a terrible camera that makes everyone look as if they are moving in a super-fast movement, and the dialogue is terrible. The acting is not great either, and Wayne's character is very wooden, and he, like all the other actors, looks like wooden dolls that someone leads (in this case, it’s directed by Harry Fraser). Harry Fraser is at the helm, and does a pretty good job, but the story is thin. It’s impossible not to feel that about ten minutes is missing from the beginning of the film, because Randy has just arrived from nowhere to the salon and hopes to meet someone. It will later be explained why Randy was there, and it looks like he is a person who was sent to investigate allegations that someone was trying to take over the city. Honestly, I didn't really take it, most of the time I was hoping that the movie would end. <br /> <br /> But as they say, I haven’t found this film completely horrible. I enjoyed it and sometimes found it pretty funny. But it really is not a very good film, and in fact it is not worth watching or stalking. <br /> <br /> In general, “Randy Rides Alone” is incredibly outdated and tiring western with very few redeeming qualities. It can be fun, but overall this is not a very good movie and is definitely one of Wayne's weakest versions.
