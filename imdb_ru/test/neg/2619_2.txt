In the literal sense .... <br /> <br /> Reminds you of those role-playing games "police robbers" or "cowboys-indians" that you played with your 8-year-old friends. <br /> Tedious and not inspired, the storyline was clearly written so that the bad game and dialogue seemed part of the plot, but all he does is show it. I can't believe that John Badham let his name be associated with this piece of shit. It could be better for a school cinematographer who was given coverage, film and camera editing. <br /> <br /> It is intended to memorize time on a science fiction channel, when they overly used everything else from their library, and hardly any better than paid programming.
