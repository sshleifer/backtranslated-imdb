<br /> <br /> 12 Grand is the cost of a new car. New car, which Jake West now has to save from the hordes of angry villagers, desperate for his blood. Some may say that this film can receive the status of "So bad, that is good." In my opinion, this is the proud owner of the label "So bad, this is bad."
