This is a new approach to comedy. It's not funny. <br /> <br /> The joke is that by itself it should be funny. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a French story located in Paris, and the characters have French names. Louis Obinard, for example ... performed by ... Bob Hoskins? The film also starred French Jeff Goldblum and Natasha Richardson. The situations are similar, and the characters act in the same way as in those films with the participation of many years ago. <br /> <br /> I suppose that these are also jokes - actors who are not trying to play in French. so that they jumped in the manner of a broad English comedy in the ballroom and left the spectators to blossom the whole riddle. <br /> <br /> In the department of humor it is practically a round table Algonquin Isnâ€™t it? <br /> <br /> The film tries to be charming and bizarre, and I think these characteristics are pretty funny. Perhaps not as funny as "Duck Soup" or "Love and Death", but funnier than "Deer Hunter" or "Battleship Potemkin." <br /> <br /> This is an example of personal filmmaking. He makes no real effort to reach out and share with the audience, but he remains true to his premise and his inner logic. Although all situations are incredible, they are logical in their own strange film world. <br /> <br /> I generally like this eccentric film, but I found that this film is going too slow to be dull, tiring, and to provide too few pleasant surprises or genuine wit. It just meanders in a predictable and sophomore way, and wastes some wonderful talents. It should be the lowest point in the career of each of the main stars, who are all outstanding players. I think this is the biggest waste of talent since Betsy, and I wish I had never seen Goldblum and Hoskins in this. <br /> <br /> So call it an interesting miss and pass it on as Rent if you really have a lot of time to kill. <br /> <br />
