Well, that was my first IMAX experience, so I was just amazed at this, above all; although, looking back, I cannot help but wish that it was some other (less monochrome) film. <br /> <br /> “Great Desolation” has greatly influenced the “School Program”, which lists all the astronauts and this made him feel very much like reading National Geographic magazine in 3D. Strange, but in reality it was a very two-dimensional quality that only occasionally turned into reality, and for a long time it seemed that it was a PowerPoint presentation. There was a moment in the film when an unnoticed abyss opens; In your opinion, it was a bit of a WOW factor, but, to be honest, this could be due to the fact that I was a virgin of IMAX. <br /> <br /> The comment provided by Tom Hanks, I personally found very, (what is a good way to express it ??) a "nationalist flag waving" that did not go very well in central London, judging by the remarks we heard when we left. <br /> <br /> For everything I liked the IMAX experience, but I really wanted to have another film on this day. The moon is not a particularly colorful object, and, frankly, many 3D effects were lost in the monochrome landscape. All this would be good if it were not for the documentary inserts and distractions, such as interviews with American schoolchildren who spoiled him a little.
