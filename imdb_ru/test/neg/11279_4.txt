For a film made in Senegal and based, I think, freely on the book Carmen Prosper Merimee, Carmen, this film does not just resemble a story that has become known as opera and other films. <Br /> <br /> Ms. Guy, like Carmen from the title look very good. Her fiery dance smolders on the screen, as is the case with her tumultuous love scene at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> This is Carmen, who seeks to please all men, but the real Carmen, she is not! <br /> <br /> We would like to see Ms. Guy in other films in which her talent is used better than here.
