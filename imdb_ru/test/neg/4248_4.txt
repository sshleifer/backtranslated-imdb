Although I usually prefer not romantic dramas, watching this movie left me a bit short. <br /> <br /> He promised that the characters and relationships could be studied much deeper than they, but the story does not seem to understand the direction in which he wanted to go. <br /> <br /> Comparisons and parallels in history, especially the three generations of women in the family, had great potential, but somehow did not expand fully. This could make the film much easier to link and tie to it, which is the goal of any film about lost love and a restored life. <br /> <br /> IMHO, I think the film suffered from a lack of direction in spite of the fact that Harry Connick Jr. and Sandra Bullock really desperately tried to breathe a little life into the completely flat outlines of the characters. <br /> <br /> Itâ€™s not that it was a bad film, some parts make you understand the reasons for the different Plot of events, this film is just unfinished, and generally a bit flat.
