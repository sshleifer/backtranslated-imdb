Very slow, boring, mysterious film. Maybe Jean-Luc Godard would have made such a film if he were an Italian. Of course, it conveys how tedious, boring, joyless and empty a person’s life can be, but I usually don’t go to the movies to find out! The plot (such as it is) does not convince. Why a magnificent hotel administrator (an exception to the dullness of the film) would be at least a little interested in the capricious, smoking chain, quiet loner who speaks in “deep” aphorisms, confuses me. It is very difficult to feel any sympathy for the main character. It feels as if he is shaking his throat and says: "Get out of it!". His brother has a much more human character. The final is inconclusive and mysterious. Everyone in the cinema (when I watched the movie) muttered how they almost fell asleep. Of course, this should not be a shhot-em-up or crash-bang Hollywood Bruce Willis fiasco, but a little energy and action would make it a lot more exciting. One of the best italian movies ever ?! Please ... Art House, curiosity at best.
