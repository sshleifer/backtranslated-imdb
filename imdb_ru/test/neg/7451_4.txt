This film started off great; The first 30 minutes are very funny and clever with some interesting characters. This is good news. The bad news is that the film becomes too repetitive, and then it becomes completely stupid. <br /> <br /> As a result, we get Santa Claus with “magical” abilities and many New Age pranks added to the mix. It's just ridiculous and hardly the “Christmas movie” that I would expect from Jim Varney's “Ernest”. <br /> <br /> Honestly, he still had a decent amount of laughter and without profanity, but not a film that I could recommend.
