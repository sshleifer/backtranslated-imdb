When you got used to Lana Turner in the movie “The Postman Always Calls Twice” and compare it with this low-budget, low-professional, low-quality film, I was just embarrassed by the “singing” of Ida Lupino (more like talking) playing the piano. When the first non-singing scene began, and all the people just looked at her straight, I was sure that they would all close their eyes and start to leave, or at least talk among themselves (She stinks, let's go away). The actors are flat - emotions are lowered. Ida - the real spoiled biotku - only 100%. It was like the way Betty Boop, during a conscious calm, meets a gas station attendant in nowhere in the US. The story was flat, the music was flat, the acting was flat, her chest was ... no, never mind. I was sad for the rest of the cast. Perhaps if the right actress were given the lead role, and the male actors had more emotions, then the film could have a chance. Sorry for insulting those of you who thought it was from this world. I would not mind if he remained out of this world.
