One of the worst films I've ever seen in the 90s. I often used it as a guide when watching other movies; “At least it wasn't as bad as Karo Diario.” Three absolutely meaningless segments, all with the participation of a director playing himself - and he is not that interesting. A whole segment about this hypochondriac goes to the doctor. The other is where he rides through the countryside on his scooter. For three interesting minutes and another fifteen agonizing. <br /> <br /> The only saving factor was that the scooter scene was dedicated to Keith Jarrett's concert in Cologne. He suggested that I go home and rediscover this wonderful album. The best thing you can say about a director / actor / egoist is that he has a great taste for music.
