wow ... I just watched this movie ... Americans have such a stereotypical view of films in Hindi, such as ALL Indian films have dances, songs and a love story ... It's a pity how far away from the truth. This film simply reveals the stereotypical western view of Hindi films. Horrible game, terrible direction, terrible cinematography. And all this from a Hollywood director. Most Indian films today are much more informative, realistic, touching and meaningful than this piece of shit. Indian cinema (not just Hindi) also covers a variety of topics. Like most other Hollywood films these days, it shows a very stereotypical picture of another country where truth is thrown out the window. This is NOT a highly recommended movie. Instead, watch good Hindi films, such as Black Friday, Eclavia, Omkara, Khaki, Avarapan, Gangster, Don, Zakhm, Dor, Sholay, Mother India, Lagan ... These films are what real Indian cinema does.
