This film is probably one of the 3 worst films in history. I rented it by chance without reading the reviews, and wow, I regret it. Actually has no plot, in fact does not follow the genre of the vampire. Just a terrible god. Watching this movie will ruin your enthusiasm for vampire movies. I felt that the writer / director / producer was still using drugs, was hallucinating and trying to recreate him in the film. The whole time I wanted the movie to end ... but the ending was even more unfortunate. <br /> <br /> If this review can save only one person from viewing this shit, I feel that my time spent on registering and writing this review was worth it.
