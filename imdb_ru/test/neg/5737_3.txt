Definitely not your typical Polysia, Redneck just never worked for me. The film tells the story of a gem robbery, and a boy who was accidentally kidnapped in the process. Trying to leave, the robbers leave behind a bloody trail of death, bearing the boy's ransom plan. The plan is never carried out, as the robbers are more eager to get to France, and the boy intends to stay with them. Although I could cite a number of problems that I had with the film, I will focus on the most obvious ones ?? Memphis's character, played by Telly Savalas. From his work in The Dirty Dozen and Kelly Heroes to other Italian films such as The Crime Boss, to his most memorable role as Kodjak, Savalas was the winner. I always thought of him as one super cool customer. Unfortunately, Savalas is almost invisible in Redneck. The director turned on the camera and ordered him to act as mentally as possible? Perhaps it would not be so bad if his actions were made in the context of the plot that worried me, but here he seems to be acting strangely in order to be strange. Looks like a random frenzy. And what's with that accent? Savalas may have been many things, but South is not one of them. It sounds completely ridiculous, even trying to emphasize. In addition, I found little interest in the rest of the film. As I said, the plot never attracted me. I just didn’t care what was going on. And the idea that the boy is so quickly addicted to the criminal lifestyle does not correspond to reality. As for the other actors, Mark Lester is almost as bad as Savalas, and usually reliable Franco Nero is not much better. Three "nominal" actor and not a good game between them. To make matters worse, I believe that the director shot many of the night scenes with nothing more than the light of his watch to light the shots. I could not say what was going on. Characters I hate, a plot that doesn’t bother me, and production values ​​that failed ?? Not surprisingly, I gave Redneck 3/10.
