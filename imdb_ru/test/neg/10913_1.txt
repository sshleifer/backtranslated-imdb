Not me ... If it came to this, I could kick a dog's ass, and that is why this film does not work for me. If it was me against a stranger, or Jason ... Or ... Damn, I don't know ... ANY OTHER HORRIBLE ANTAGONIST, then there would be no competition, and I would give me my ass, except for the intervention of God. A horror film works because it puts people in a situation with a creature, a man, a creature, an entity, anything that is more powerful, resourceful or clever than they are, and then people think, “What if this happens to me” and they get scared - and that's why this is a terrible idea for a story. I can not imagine that the dog scares me, so I am not afraid.
