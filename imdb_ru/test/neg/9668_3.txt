Visually this film is interesting. The light is literally reflected along with the cinematography and the enticing presentation in front of the titles, which placed hopes on me from the very beginning, but then the b-film is a b-film, this is a b-film, regardless of how you can see it. This film surrounds the life of Albert Fish, one of the most famous serial killers in the world. Active at the beginning of the 20th century, Fish’s life hastily and vaguely, before he began to kill children in old age. This film is based on two tracks: the life of Fish and the life of William F. King, lead investigator in the case. What saves this film from becoming the spectacle and rout of Hallmark of the usual type when it comes to films about serial killers is the direction that is a double-edged sword; Director Scott L. Flynn pays enough attention to bi-actors to prevent their flaws from shining through too much, but at the same time creating a truly boring and stereotypical view of the American police through the corner of King. Of course, he spoke in some detail about meeting Fish with Grace Budd, a 10-year-old girl he killed, although I’m not quite sure if her mother was a crazy person Flynn really tries to emphasize that she was, I miss more psychological immersion in the fish, not to mention the very short time that was spent on the post-capture fish. In general, it is interesting to those who are fond of serial killers, but mostly disappointment; however, if the director makes another movie about another serial killer, I will definitely see him in the hope that the holes will be fixed.
