I kind of had high hopes for this film. I have always thought that the little-known films of Tom Selleck (for example, “The Runaways” and “Coma”) are much better than those on which he relied more. Perhaps the producers should have learned a little more about former high league baseball players who have become stars abroad. Most were players too good for a triple baseball, but not in the big leagues. I admire the idea of ​​transferring the character Celle to Japan, instead of playing with minors. Unfortunately, this film, as well as the name of the post, was stuck in third place because of the film, which seems to work on autopilot. I do not mind seeing the sequel, and hopefully the producers will learn from the mistakes. The premise is too unique to be left alone with this uneven click.
