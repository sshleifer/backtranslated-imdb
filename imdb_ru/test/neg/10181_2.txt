The only reason I gave this movie 2, not 1, was because for some reason I had to finish it! In fact, I wanted to see if there would be any aliens, UFOs, anything at all from the name of the movie, the cover and the beginning of the movie! I was very disappointed to see that religion was thrown into the mix the way it was. It could be used in the interest of the film, but instead I felt that the film was trying to send me subliminal messages! Finally, how big was this actor's wardrobe!? I was so distracted by the number of different and very bright shirts that were on each character in each new scene, and I began to wonder if this film should not be classified as a â€œbad comedy. <br /> <Thumbs down!
