... but, unfortunately, no one thought about killing Van in order to save this doomed production. The only positive thing about him in the film is his good singing voice ... It is a pity that the songs are mostly tasteless and juicy. Why do I hate Wang so much? Well, throughout the entire film, he seemed to mimic a third-grade Soupy Sales — with lots of looting, bad jokes, and too much energy to make everyone laugh. The worst of these moments was when he "taught" the class - these children laughed at EVERYTHING that he did. Damn it, Wang could read the phone book or show them the autopsy pictures, and they probably would have laughed! Now Wang was not the only bad decision in the film - he was the most obvious. Of course, it is funny to play John Gilgud (a fine actor) as an Asian, and Michael York to play brother Peter Finch !! The bottom line is that because of this insane choice of actors, the film was doomed from the very beginning ... and the worst of them was the terrible Bobby Van. Now, in real life, he may have been a wonderful person, and it’s sad that in real life he died so young, but with the material they gave him here, I just wanted to pull his tongue out to make him calm. <Br /> <br /> Now I also mentioned the songs - for example, these horrible songs !! The original “Lost Horizon” by Frank Capra was subtle admiration everywhere - and not a single number of song and dance in the film. So why did they decide to add several billion songs that did not help the film? They only served to make it look like a sticky mess — like the original DOCTOR DOOLITTLE in combination with LOST HORIZON. The end result is a sickeningly sweet children's movie that no one over 8 can watch. <br /> <br /> Now, if you can fix these problems, you have the foundation for a decent movie. In the end, the plot is beautiful and still hidden under it all. Peter Finch is especially good (although, of course, not equal to Ronald Coleman in the original). But, given that the original was almost an ideal classic, why bother with this sticky pastry. Who wants to go through the molasses? <br /> <br /> By the way, this film was included in the book “50 Worst Movies” by Harry Bear. Although I didn’t like the film either, it wasn’t bad enough to deserve inclusion in a book. I think it was included mainly because it was a huge box office failure and because it was released just a few years before the book appeared. An excellent book is simply not one of the best selections in Drak's "consecrated hall".
