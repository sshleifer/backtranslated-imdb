I saw Shallow Grave many years ago, and it was one of those films that I remembered for a long time. It was intense from start to finish and with a lot of unexpected turns. But it all made sense. <br /> <br /> I can’t say the same about dead bodies. Above the heading is a subtitle that states that it is “even better than Shallow Grave”. This is a big lie. <br /> <br /> Dead bodies lose their power and become less convincing during the film. <br /> <br /> For example, two supporting characters are much less innocent than they first appeared. This may come as a surprise, but it doesn’t surprise me. I could see it a few minutes before, and * that * is a big difference with Shallow Grave. <br /> <br /> Another thing I have to mention is that the characters in this film often do not react very realistically. They behave more often when the movie comes to an end. <br /> <br /> I would be much more interested if some of the characters were completely innocent, not knowing what was going on. It would be better to contrast with Tommy and his friend, who must carry with them * a huge * secret. <br /> <br /> But no, for some stupid reason, the creators of this film decided that all the characters should show their darkest parts. It does not work in such a film. <br /> <br /> The end felt like an open end. It left me with unsatisfied feeling. I expected much more. <br /> <br /> At first, I would give this movie six stars, because it’s not a bad movie. I enjoyed watching it. Most part of time. <br /> <br /> But sometimes I saw really bad acting and unrealistic scenes, and because of the disappointing open end, I stuck to four stars this time. And because it turned out to be a mistake that I spent my time and money on it. Unlike the Shallow Grave, I will probably forget the Dead bodies very soon. This is not such a special film. <br /> <br /> With this film, the creators could cope much better. It's a shame that they did not.
