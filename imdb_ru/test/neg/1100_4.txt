Wicked Little Things (known in Australia as "Zombies") is a rare find ?? a film that promises one thing, but delivers another. This is one of the few genre films to be shot by Millennium Pictures, a European film studio known for creating various class B thrillers and thrillers, some of which are shot by fighter Jean-Claude Van Damme. <br /> <br /> Karen Tunney and her two daughters, Sarah and Emma, ​​arrive in the Additaun City of Pennsylvania to move into a big house that her late husband, Karen, owned after he discovered a mining act in his actions. Upon arrival, they discover that the house is very old and in need of repair. But the condition of the house is the least of their problems, as they discover that the area is subject to extinction, and Karen faced the owner of the area and ordered them to move out. When night falls, the Tunisians find out the cause of the disappearance: a group of zombie children who died as a result of a mine collapse in the area more than 85 years ago, comes out to kill everything that happens in the forest. With the help of her grizzly neighbor, Karen is trying to break the curse before she and her children become the next victims. <br /> <br /> I bought a DVD waiting for a flesh-eating zombie movie, but one thing was disappointed: the movie looks more like a ghost story than a regular zombie movie. Dead children are the embodiment of a curse that haunts the forest, taking revenge on everything that moves at night (although the internal logic is somewhat flawed: children can only be satisfied with animal sacrifice and repelled by blood guards on the doors just as vampires repel garlic and mirrors - aren't these children Should there be zombies?) The plot as such would not be a problem and would actually be interesting, but the main problem is that the producers adapted the script with the intention of making a film about zombies just to go crazy on that face. <br /> <br /> Thus, a film like this would be a good ghost story, but due to a bad script it turns into nothing more than a routine effort. The greatest strength of the film is acting, in which the actors give the best performances that the film deserves. Particularly noteworthy is the scout Taylor-Compton, which copes well with its role ?? It is a pity that she is destroying her genre prestige due to the very poor performance in the HALLOWEEN remake (or maybe this is just Rob Zombie script).
