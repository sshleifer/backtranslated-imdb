Can they be worse than this? Probably. But Stephen Seagal does what he does. Well, sort of; this time instead of mortally wounding the bad guys, he just hurts them. According to the reputation of a bad agent, Segal is hired to deliver a special package from France to America. But this is not an easy task when so many people try to intercept and spoil the mission. Fights just do not have enough bite, and the big blows are just big, that's all. Anna-Louis Plowman seems to be the only cast that doesn't look wooden. Also starring: Geoffrey Pierce, Max Ryan and Harry Van Gorkum. Do not put all the blame on Seagal for this fool.
