You just need to take it as poorly executed anti-abortion propaganda, and you will see how bad it really is. The main idea of ​​this film is that even the sickest people cannot have an abortion. If you ask, it is not far from the explosion of abortion clinics. So this guy wants to kill some poor girl, but he must first convince her to have an abortion. What nonsense. And worst of all, he has a convincing argument (leading the child to a free environment), but this must be rejected because he is a freak in any case. And the part with Bible pushers ... first they throw this girl away just because she explains that someone stole her money (this rule should be somewhere in the Bible), and then at the end they become a kind of angel, like deus ex machina killer from evil, chasing him in the front yard. Come on. Other flaws include a very confusing scenario (and I don’t mean in a good way) ... so this guy is just crazy, why? Because his mother once fed him a liver? And I do not know about you, but he seemed to be the most pleasant person in the world throughout the whole movement! although he was wearing girlish clothes, he stole money and taped girls in his car. If you forget the story of idiots, this movie is really great cinematography, and Bob Hoskins was really great, and there is one of those funny little English cars in it. If it were some kind of psycho-killer, I would give it at least 7.
