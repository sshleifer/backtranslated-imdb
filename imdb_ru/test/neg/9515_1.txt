When I voted for “1” for this film, I noticed that 75 people voted equally from 146 votes. This means that half of the people who voted for this film feel that this is really terrible. I saw it recently at the film festival, and I was really not impressed with its poor performance. The cinematography is unobservable, the sound is bad, the story is cut out and inserted from many other films, and the action is terrible. This film is basically bad plagiarism from three other films. ANYTHING WONDERFUL, IT NEVER EVEN MADE IN THE USA.
