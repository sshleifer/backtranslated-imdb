This is such a film that could ruin several careers if rubbish could ruin a movie career these days. <br /> <br /> Melanie Griffith took off her shirt, and in the days preceding the improvement operations, she really should have remained dressed. <br /> <br /> Jeff Daniels was completely useless, but fortunately for him and for us, he went to much better things since this ... this ... this ... well, hell take a piece of trash. <br /> <br /> Strange, but all his main players went for bigger and better things, including director Jonathan Demme. His work here was also wasted, but deserved reluctant admiration. I mean that everything that should not be done should not be done well. But in any case, he did it well. <br /> <br /> However, there was one bright, brilliant aspect: Ray Liotta, who is named on the list of credit cards, simply stole everything. Liotta was wonderfully hypnotized! Hypnotic! Fascinating. <br /> <br /> I saw this piece of garbage while it was still relatively new, in a friend’s private theater. For some strange reason, my friend loved it. I think this is because Melanie Griffith took off her shirt (and, frankly, she shouldn't have), although he tried to argue that these were other, more artistic reasons. <br /> <br /> In any case, Even then, after his first scene, I thought that Ray Liotta would become the main star or at least a major, very respected actor. <br /> <br /> Despite the dirty aspects of the dirty script, sheer deformity Of all the history, Liotta made it almost worthy of attention. Actually, it's worth seeing once, just to see how far Ray Liotta has gone. I mean, firstly, his name is now usually indicated at or near the top. <br /> <br /> Even then, even in a pile of rubbish, Ray Liotta shone like a diamond. <br /> <br /> Simply, if you see this rubbish, be prepared to hold your nose. Every main character is immoral or immoral. Scary film. Awful movie idea. <br /> <br /> Comment added: Too many people respond: “Was this comment helpful?” with “no” because they do not agree with the expressed opinion. Maybe IMDb should ask this question instead: “Do you agree with these opinions?”
