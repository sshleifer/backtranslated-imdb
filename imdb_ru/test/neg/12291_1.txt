Sorry, but I can’t understand what people smoked when they wrote how great they thought Ethan Mao was. I have seen better act, character and plot development in porn! ATTENTION: I am going to give the key element to the “plot”. After a night of being held hostage by his family, Ethan lets his vile, angry, hateful stepmother go to the bank - ONE !!! - to get a piece of the jewels of his deceased mother, which he so desperately wants. Guess what? She calls the police! Wow ... what a twist! I could not foresee this at all. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this film was that it lasted less than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Clean, clean trash!
