After seeing the documentary film by Carlo Lizzan about Luchino Visconti, I was associated with high expectations, before watching this film, made three years later by Adam Low. But a spectator like me was unhappy ... I was faced with the need for a critical opinion, which I usually don’t like to express because there are no documentaries that would satisfy every spectator. There are also no documentaries that fully explore the topic. But when I read reviews already written on this topic, I also felt a little embarrassed. People sometimes do not know what to criticize. Therefore, to make it clear, I will divide this film into two main parts, which differ significantly: the first is about Visconti before his career as a director, and the second about Visconti, the director. <br /> <br /> The aristocratic origins, all the hobbies, the wealth that young Lucino experienced and enjoyed, are clearly represented. His efforts in horse racing are mentioned, as well as his relationship with his mother, who were so upset after his parents' divorce. We also get a very accurate idea of ​​where Lucino was brought up like a real Milan: abundant wealth, with nannies, cooks with access to everything, in TRUE ARISTOCRACY. For example, his father’s magnificent villa in Grazzano and other wonderful villas prove this. Particular attention is paid to the important Visconti visit to Paris in the 1930s, where he met with prominent people (“leftists”) who later influenced his style and ideas in art. This clearly explains the idea of ​​communist education with aristocratic education (contrast at first sight). <br /> <br /> However, the part about the career of its director, which began with OSSESSIONE during World War II and ended with INNOCENTE shortly before the director’s death in 1976, is poorly executed. His films are badly discussed. What for? Because there are very few people who really have something to say. Franco Zeffirelli, the director, remembers the work on LA TERRA TREMA, and everything is in order. There are also several interviews with Franco Rosie. But later, films such as IL GATTOPARDO, LA CADUTA DEI REI, LA MORTE A VENEZIA, or LUDWIG are mainly discussed by Helmut Berger. Although I liked the actor as Ludwig, I didn’t like his interview. Moreover, some of the thoughts that he reveals are not entirely accurate for such a documentary ... There are no references to the significant work of Visconti, such as PART OF CONVERSION, there is no interview with the outstanding actor Bert Lancaster. Mention should be made of Sylvanas Mangano and Romy Schneider. There is one interview with Maria Callas, which seems interesting, but it is quite a bit. Franco Zeffirelli, although I appreciate him as a director, laughs at all of this, and does not say something really valuable. For example, he mentions how Visconti separated from him after several years of service. Therefore, I say: simplistic and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Here I find strengths - an interview with Visconti itself. As a result, we can get our own opinion about his work. For example, I really appreciate the words he says about death, regarding it as a normal chapter of life and as natural as birth itself. He also talks about his health problems after a stroke during the filming of "Ludwig". <br /> <br /> I think it is better to see LUCHINO Visokonti (1999) Carlo Lizzani, than this document. Although it is shorter and more concise in general, you get a better idea of ​​the director. Visconti would be furious about this, and his rage would usually turn people's emotions and views into stone ... 4/10
