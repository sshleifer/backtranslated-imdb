This cozy middle-class sitcom was the subject of much hatred from a new generation of talented comedians in the 1980s, such as Ben Elton. Does it deserve such anger? Well, Terry and June were never smart, it was never a well-written story with different threads that intersect in prison. It was a show that your mom, dad and maybe grandma and grandpa watched. They laughed, not laughed, but they never offended the show, so the fact that he never challenged them was immaterial. <br /> <br /> One leg in the grave initially suffered because it appeared at first glance to be just another Terry and June. <br /> <br /> A few days after the death of Terry Scott, an episode was shown on terrestrial television, and this was his last release. On any TV channel there were several repetitions of the show. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the television comedy has progressed with Terry and June. Itâ€™s hard to find good words for this - Terry Scott made the best of the weak scenarios.
