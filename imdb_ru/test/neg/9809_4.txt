A rather perverted horror movie that has some good moments, with some horrific blood transfusions, but it's too boring for its own sake. All the characters are fine, and the story, although it had a lot of potential, is rather boring, but the blood transfusion scenes looked frighteningly real, and as a result they were extremely disturbing. It was well-made and well-written, and from the very beginning it was really interesting, but it just couldn't keep up with the times, plus it seemed to me that the final was disappointing. Linnie Quigley is no more than a very small role in this role, so I was also disappointed with this, and Stephen Knight copes with the role very well, as he was rather perverted, plus I got it in the DVD Horror set called A Taste Of Evil with a bunch of other horror movies. There is a lot of blood, but it’s not so bad, and because of the small budget it was pretty well done, however, as I said, it simply did not sustain his interest. It's a rather perverted horror movie, which has a few good moments, with some horrific blood transfusion scenes, but it's too boring for your own sake, I would say, but it's worth seeing if you have nothing better to do. Direction is fine. Ellie Kenner and Norman Thaddeus Wayne do an excellent job with their work, do a good job with the camera and do a good job with a small budget, but, in my opinion, it’s too variable. In fact, everything is in order. Stephen Knight is great as a leader, he was creepy, twisted, sick and gave a very creepy performance, the most creepy thing about it, even though he seemed like a normal person. Linnie Quigley succeeded in her little role. Christopher MacDonald is fine, I suppose, the sin of his short time. The rest of the cast are fine too. In general, I would have passed, but I think it is worth seeing if you have nothing better to do. * 1/2 of 5
