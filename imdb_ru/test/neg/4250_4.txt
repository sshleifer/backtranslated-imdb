Some people like to tell you that Deep Space 9 is the best of all Star Trek shows, because it emphasizes character development and continuity, and also has a more complex background and current plots. In a sense, this makes it more satisfying, but in many ways the show fails. <br /> <br /> The series begins as a soap opera on the space station, where two whole seasons of common fantasy stories are combined with banal stories about characters. The characters are a good band, and most of the actors are decent, but I think the writers have tried too hard to make them "normal." By "normal" they actually mean "normal and tedious." <br /> <br /> At the end of the second season, we meet Dominion, who hangs threateningly for a while before finally going to war with the good guys. in the fifth season. This is the main “story arch” of the show, but it occupies only part of the entire series. We still get episodes with slop episodes, the characters still end up on strange planets for forty-five minutes, and there is a horrible comedy with an unpretentious look, showing greedy, stupid Ferengi. Many episodes are just boring, and some are not observable. <br /> <br /> Dominion, the DS9 villains, are prone to galactic domination for a convenient reason that, well, they just don’t like anyone. The whole war is represented by a naive lack of moral complexity and imagination. Impressively pyrotechnic space battles appear with great frequency since the third season, but they are conducted in ridiculously simplified ways, such as two huge fleets of ultramodern space ships flying directly at each other and escaping into the air. The authors of DS9 (including the talented Ronald D. Moore, later the famous "Battlestar Galactica") spiced up their monotonous show with the beginning of the war, but in the depths of their hearts it was still pedantic soap. <br /> <br /> DS9 is a very frustrating experience. The continuous story is too flat and obvious to be truly exciting, and the characters never develop in truly interesting ways. Babylon 5 and Battlestar Galactica both fulfilled the promise made by DS9 and made everything much better. For Star Trek, stick with the original and the next generation.
