I have already commented on this film (called TheLegendaryWD). But I see that there are others who have commented since. All I can say is: WHAT, F ** K!?

Add to this the fact that the couple gives good reviews (probably the filmmakers who went to one of those places in the mall that provide Internet services, and wrote a good review - seeing that there is no way they could or would pay for their own ISP ... just watch their movie.

I thought some other people writing This can be confused with another ... until I read the reviews ... especially the person who identified Left on the front of the box: “Ultimate frontal lobotomy” (what does f ** k mean in any case? Lobotomy?) ... I completely forgot about it until I read it in the review People, we are the favorites ... I say that we meet once a year to watch this movie ... wait, anyone else has ? If anyone has please contact me ... I want to get drunk.
