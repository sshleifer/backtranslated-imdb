I recently had to watch this for a project in a sociology class, and I thought that this was absolutely the worst movie I had to watch. It was like a bad cinemax movie with all the good beats. A bad game, a fake documentary, a meaningless plot and steering - all this together creates a terrible, terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Female characters basically exist only to have sexual objects. Consider this exchange: "He is hot." "He had a girl." "Do you have a girlfriend?" "No." * The girl takes the boy by the hand and leads him by the bushes. a boy comes out and sits next to another boy, a girl leaves * "Did you hit it?" "No, I did not want to take off my pants." "You are silly." Another girl shows up when the boys drive to Beverly Hills, sits in the trunk with one of the boys, and when a policeman stops them, you see the car bounce. <br /> <br /> Homosexual pervert, happy Clint Eastwood, like a trigger, like himself, and what appears to be a luchador mask - all this adds to madness. One of the boys is caught by a cop, anyway. They shoot at one of the boys, nobody cares. <br /> <br /> Someone said that the dialogue was mostly improvised, and it shows. Just awful. I never recommend this movie to anyone.
