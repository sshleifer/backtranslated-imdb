Well, of course, I am a fan of a low-budget horror that brings with it a random piece of garbage, which even the most indomitable fan of fake films cannot but testify ... TRANCERS 6, director Jay Wulfel of DEMONICUS. <br /> <br /> First, the TRANCERS series, launched in the mid-80s by Charlie Band and his Empire Pictures, is in fact a franchise thanks to Tim Thomrson and his excellent image. trance hunter Jack Det. Well, low and behold, because of the spent budgets of the Full Moon functions (which, despite what people said, actually led to very high-quality features such as HELL ASYLUM and DEAD & ROTTING), Thierson did not return to the sixth a place. installment plan <br /> <br /> The full moon writer, Kourtney Joyner, comes back again and offers another below average scenario in which Jack Det (played by Tomerson ... in memories that are very poorly inserted ... he has a different hairstyle like every the time he is shown, and some kind of "hemp" lying on the table), going down a line into the body of his daughter. Well, from now on, you have "Joe Det," acting like Jack ... but it's a shame that she doesn't really highlight the same presence on the screen as Jack Det. <br /> <br /> The movie Shot 16 mm is, more simply, the embarrassment of the name TRANCERS ... do not offend anyone at Young Wolf Productions. I mean, I respect you guys, because you really wanted to jump and make the movie "TRACKERS" without Tim, but after spending a little more time (despite the fact that he starred since December 2001), he could be better. <br /> <br /> However, watch the Full Moon DVD, which is a double feature with original TRANCERS and contains trailers for the last 10 plus points of Full Moon. <br /> <br /> In general, I would probably like to add more if he doesn’t have the name TRANCERS, but like everyone, you can judge it by someone’s opinion, and you should check it yourself !
