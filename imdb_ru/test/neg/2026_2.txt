The initial voice will sound like “Wind”, it can be quite an intriguing film, but when the story turned around, I realized that from there down. The main things in this film that blew up were terribly bad acting work that all the main characters did (except for a few scenes involving Mick's inner turmoil), there was a complete lack of character development and absolutely no point in the plot What did the screenwriters think? <br /> <br /> Michael Mongillo won 2 Horror / Science Fiction awards for Wind. BUT? What is so scary about this movie? NOTHING! With the exception of the resident evil 2 video filming, the rest was more “made for a television thriller” - it didn't even need to be edited. If you want a much better movie about “killing among friends,” rent a “Shallow Grave”. <br /> <br /> Wind * / *****
