For me, this is not a good TV show, animated or otherwise. However, it is annoying to the n-th degree. There are several reasons for this, in no particular order. First, the entry of one of the most meaningless and annoying characters, Batmite. This character does not make sense for the show, however. Maybe this is intended as a comic relief, but it won't work out that way. Next is the Joker. After almost every sentence, the character loses his ridiculous laugh. Let's talk about repetition. He is aging very quickly. Also do not think that he had the right actor to voice the character. It seems that because of this, Robin looked like a complete moron. Apart from these problems, the show is not so bad. But these are big enough problems to significantly reduce the attractiveness factor. For me, Batman's New Adventures is 3/10, at best.
