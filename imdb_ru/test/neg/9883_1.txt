This film had only two redemptive functions; the beauty of Bucharest and its architecture, as well as how they portrayed the transformation of the human form into the form of a wolf. Forget about the plot or the plot of the book - they are completely absent in this film. In fact, the only thing transferred from the book is the names of the main players. Even then you barely know the characteristics. If the directors had made a good film, although they had nothing to do with the book, I would not be so disappointed. Unfortunately, they did not. The plot and storyline are typical for low-budget horror films, acting is wooden, and directing efforts are mundane. Oh, yes, the way the loop-garu bows to his leader is a pure hook. I believe that the curator of animals should receive recognition. Wolves were beautiful animals and coped well with their responsibilities.
