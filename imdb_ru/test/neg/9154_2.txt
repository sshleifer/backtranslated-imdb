MEMORY OF THE KEEPER OF MEMORY in the form of a novel Kim Edwards was a very successful bestseller and was probably represented in more reading groups than any other novel during its distribution. So what happened when the novel became a television movie? Perhaps the following mediocre script (oh, telecast!) Of John Pilmeier, who is constantly walking in an awkward, pedestrian way, eliminating all confidence in history. Perhaps this is the direction of cutting and pasting Mick Jackson, which skips the tempo and outlines of the character. He may be suffering from cinematography from an uncredited source or the musical score “Liquid Tears” by Daniel Licht. For any of these (or all of these) reasons, this novel survives before the film, because it gives a good reason to educate the public about the possibilities of those born with Down syndrome. And for it is worth attention. <br /> <br /> Dr. David Henry (Dermot Mulroney), a successful orthopedic surgeon, is married to a beautiful Nora (Gretchen Mol), and their lives change after their pregnancy. On a stormy winter night in Kentucky, Nora enters childbirth, and Henry hurries to the nearest clinic where David delivers his wife (the doctors were caught in blizzards) with the help of his old friend, nurse Carolyn Gill (Emily Watson). After the birth of the ideal boy (Paul) Nora continues to give birth and (surprisingly ...) gives birth to an unexpected (!) Twin girl. David and Caroline immediately recognize that the little girl (Phoebe) is a “Mongoloid” (this happened before the term “Down syndrome” was used), and David, who has a history of losing her little sister because of a birth defect, decides to send Phoebe to a shelter for Mentally retarded: Caroline must make a delivery, and Nora is told that the second twin died at birth. <br /> <br /> Caroline follows the instructions, sees the terms “at home” where Phoebe should be handed over, shrinks in horror and decides to leave the child. With the help of a friendly trucker, Caroline is changing her lonely existence and Phoebe's mothers, finding a new life in Pittsburgh of her trucker. Nora insists on Phoebe’s official funeral - a fact that deeply worries David’s psyche, and Henry’s life continues with only one child, Paul, leaving sunken pains due to Phoebe’s absence. Nora gives David a camera (“people's lives are like a camera, that's where they live — in a room captured by the moment”), and David becomes obsessed with photography. Nora mourns, drinks and loses David's attention, while David tracks Phoebe with Caroline - by sending money and letters to Pittsburgh. Paul (Tyler Stantiford and Jamie Spilchuk) grows up, discovers his mother's infidelity and is outraged by the lack of communication and understanding of his father and decides to achieve his goal of becoming a musician, and he goes to Juilliard. In the meantime, Phoebe (Krystal Hope Nausbaum) has become a very well-adapted young girl, and the way Heinrich’s marriage breaks out and the healing atmosphere of Phoebe and Paul’s lives combined with the courage that Carolyn Gill’s struggle for acceptance in the world for those born with Down syndrome, forms the conclusion of the film. <br /> <br /> Actors from famous actors try their best, but only Emily Watson can resurrect a trustworthy character from this soft script. Jamie Spilchuk gives testimony of a young actor with a big promise. Dermot Mulroney and Gretchen find it difficult to form sympathetic characters from the banal lines they are given. The film is a mess, but reporting on the adoption of children and adults with Down syndrome is important. Grady harp
