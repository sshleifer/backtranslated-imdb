The funniest movie I've ever seen, Not scary, just bad. The first WWE film, and believe me, the only person who might like this film is the fight of the fans. He has a terrible game and the worst direction I've ever seen. I laughed at the plot and the bad actors. I saw that people from WWE tried hard to put a lot of wrestling movements in the killings and a few camera effects. I think they copied a lot from the quiet Hill. This film is also not attractive, so if you see it, you will find yourself tuning because of the lack of Suspense. The end of the worst, no matter what, you go out, wanting to get your money back
