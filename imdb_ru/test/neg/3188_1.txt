A terrible "comedy" in which a beautiful crazy woman (Liv Tyler) "comedically" destroys the lives of three men (Matt Dillon, Paul Reiser and John Goodman). Dillon hires an assassin (Michael Douglas) to kill her. What happens to the comedy? In 2001, some of the worst comedies were released (Silverman, Sugar and Spices, Freddie Goth Fingerides, Cats, etc.). This is one of the worst. There is not one, I repeat, not a single funny moment. Jokes are stupid, unfunny, dirty or very sick. Also in this garbage there is a strong hatred for women - the only main female character (Tyler) is constantly used as a sexual object. Also extreme, bloody violence thrown at the end. The only tolerable moments are psychiatrist Reba McIntyre and Andrew Dees Clay in two roles - both psychos. Dillon, Goodman and Reiser hit a record low in their careers with this - the only way is to take off. And poor Tyler! She stopped making intelligent, daring independent films for IT? And DOUGLAS ???? What was he when he agreed to this? A complete piece of shit - which should be avoided ALL EXPENDITURES !!!!!!!!!!
