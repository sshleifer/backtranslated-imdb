Wild Rebels was probably the funniest second movie in the Triple Movie film 40 years ago. He did not grow very well, but he should never have aged well; it was obviously intended to be accessible, forgotten fun from its beginning. Taken at this level, this is a good example of the biker movie genre. <br /> <br /> Several elements help distinguish it from dozens of similar films being released simultaneously. The “hero” Rod Tillman (Steve Alaimo) looks like not impressive “Everyone” - he is not particularly brave, tough, talented or handsome (although he wins the fight with a tough biker gang member halfway through the movie, and the girl gang member decides help him compared to another gang member at the end of the film). The soundtrack is pretty well made, with a nice 'Ventures' bass / drum riff that makes things move, and saxophones and brass charts that liven up a bit. And although the script is rather shallow, all the actors inhabit their cardboard characters convincingly and with enough energy. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of careless technical mistakes: terrible day-to-night scenes that occur in broad daylight, tires screeching in the swamp, fire sirens mistakenly stuck on the soundtrack instead of police sirens, a bank sign made of sticky ribbons on the ceiling tile, the Luger, which sounds like a Winchester 30-06, shotgun blasts that cut 100 yards away from the detective killing a biker on the 3rd floor and landing from the ground with a revolver with a 2-inch barrel. <br /> <br /> There are a number of stupid plot elements: Linda (a gang member girl) cuts off the bank’s security guard with a drug-filled syringe, the last shooting takes place inside the lighthouse (!), police checkpoints do not actually block the roads, the police obviously never heard of dyaks, and police detectives obviously never heard of planting beetles or having them under cover Call by wire. <br /> <br /> But the plot is overwhelming, the operator knows what he is doing, in most scenes walking is pretty good, and here and there there are some nice liners and an exchange of dialogues that keep the energy level up. (My favorite is: “Dude, you’re joking with personal reserves! (T. E. Linda).” So no, don’t look for that or something, but if you’ll have a copy of the MST version, you should have a bit of good, little fun, watching it. Much better than Five The Hard Way or The Hellcats or even Girl In Gold Boots (three other MST films about counterculture)
