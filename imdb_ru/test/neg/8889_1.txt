This film is so bad that it is simply impossible to believe. Even for an independent low-budget movie ... it just, well, sucks. I can't even believe that even Troma would release such crap. I have been a fan of some of Tromâ€™s films for years (Toxic Avenger, Squeeze Play, Rockabilly Vampire and many others). But, Lloyd, come on, it goes beyond any taste. It presents some of the worst actions imaginable. I think it would be possible to find unemployed street people who could be just as good ... oh wait, this is what they did. I mean, these characters have negative charisma. If you're lucky, the producer and director of this film will have a huge karmic debt, because of this atrocity. Like people with special effects. In addition to the terrible actions and terrible special effects, the dialogue is absolutely traumatic for the ears. The script is full of holes in a Alaska-sized plot, and there are serious problems with continuity. The worst part, however, is that it is not interesting even in the smallest way. And this is the most unforgivable sin in filmmaking. But don't take my word for it. Get out and spend four dollars by renting it. Just do not say that I did not warn you.
