I think trash really sucks. I watched it a couple of weeks ago, and since John Waters had the "Women's problems" of John Waters, I have not seen such a sensation in the movies, and it was even worse. Dialogues, acting; it really smelled, it was so bad that I wanted to leave the movie and ask for my money back. But in fact, I am glad that I saw it, because then I could say my honest opinion about it. We must watch this movie, although it stinks.
