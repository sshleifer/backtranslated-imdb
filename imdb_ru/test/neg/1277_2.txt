I stopped this film in the 48th minute and changed my clothes ... I don't know ... maybe it's because I'm not a Swede ... or a Frenchman (Cannes commentator) ... or any of those OTHER sleepy places, of which previous reviewers have spoken ... were born and raised in New York. lived near San Francisco a quarter of a century. and now Holland. I love a good independent film just like the next film lover ... but this is not, in a word, funny. see? now it's funny ... what do you think I made a mistake. I said “in one word”, but then said “not funny” ... No. no mistakes. if this is your type of humor, I would say that you really didn’t have a special life ... I think your assessment of this film is a symptom ... and PLEASE NEVER write another review ... I have a tendency to believe them when they are unanimous. even if I only had about 3 reviews left ... I thought I could save someone, SOMETHING SPEED ... anticipation of laughter that never materialized ... I REALLY smiled once or twice, though .. when i started the movie ... and when i stopped it. it should be 10 lines.
