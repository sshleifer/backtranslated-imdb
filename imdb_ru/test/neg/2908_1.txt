This is terrible. No, in fact this is, without exception, the absolute worst ... the worst ... I donâ€™t even dare to call it @ & $% in "_movie_". This is a ninety minute visual root canal. The plot is almost non-existent: a mad scientist, similar to the frontman from Cars, saturates a woman in his secret laboratory, in a lawn chair, in what I think may be a garage, with the help of an Palmolive injection. After a few hours, she gives birth to an adult monster, who then becomes enraged. That's the whole movie. Scenes of death: they are poorly tuned, taken _forever_, and actions ... how can you ruin _screaming_ ?? The victims stand there while the growling, wheezing, overloaded freaks attack them and continue to choke them soullessly for about three days. The plots are savory, the lighting for the most part of the film consists of one muglit (yes, a big flashlight), the sound quality is poor, only about 40 words of dialogue for the entire film and the actions are described as wooden. Frames shamelessly reworked to complement the film. And the special effects will make any sci-fi production of the BBC shake its head and say: "They did not even try." "Monster" is some nameless name in a rubber mask on Halloween for $ 3 with several applied bandages. In his encounter with a lonely cop of the film, a policeman shoots without flashes, smokeless, invisible bullets that obviously move so slowly, the monster can dodge them in five steps. I do not see this movie. No, in fact, this is not a challenge. I do not see this movie. The director should be shot. The author should be chained to a giant rock where his liver will be eaten every morning by Ed Wood. Enough rent and may be continued, do not let this happen!
