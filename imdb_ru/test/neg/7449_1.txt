The first Robocop had a sense of cynical wit and a painful sense of violence. It was a fine line, but Paul Verhoeven coped with it, and the film was so successful that they made a sequel. How awful. (Possible spoilers ahead - although everything that can spoil it is beyond my power). <br /> <br /> Irwin Kershner is not a director of this type of film. He clearly did not understand the wit of the original, and as a result, the mass senseless violence looks really bad - and the worse is very unpleasant. Even worse musical score. Leonard Rosenman was an old man from another era, and the heroic, light music does not match the images on the screen! What did he score ?! Great American hero ?! Worst of all, he completely excluded the topic of Robocop from the first film, which was so memorable and perfect. Can you imagine a film about Superman without fanfare of John Williams, Indiana Jones, etc.? How could he do this? !! <br /> <br /> The plot is just a collection of ideas that do not stick together. First, we see Robo "chasing" his old wife. Good, good idea. But they completely discard it after that. Then there is the company's stupid idea to reprogram Robo to be cute. This is added for 10 minutes and then immediately falls. Or the stupid idea that the hideous 10-year-old drug lord reminds Robo of his son - again, a weak motive that is briefly shown twice and dropped. This may work in comics, but not in films, and Frank Miller was unfortunately too inexperienced at the time and threw every idea along with the kitchen sink. This does not work as a whole. <br /> <br /> Some people here seem to compliment the corporate beatings in this film and the privatization of the police. This is the best part of the movie, which corresponds to the first. However, in the original, the old man was a tough businessman for profit, but in the end he was fair. In this film, he is just pure evil in his thirst for money and power. You cannot simply change these characters for no reason. And the character Nancy Allen in this film is useless, whereas in the first she was needed by Robo in search of herself. She is as gratuitous as the violence in this film. <br /> <br /> And violence, yes violence. I like many violent, bloody films when they serve purposes and are meant to tell a story. Irwin Kershner seems to be losing his mind about human beings who are being torn apart, split into pieces, children eager for death and torture, and people's desire for drugs. He does not know when to stop. Do we really need every innocent bystander (even people trying to help others) to be shot? This is output when we see how bad Robocop shoots repeatedly! Instead, Mr. Kershner argues that he has very little taste for this type of work, and creates a disgusting mess, which is a terrible work of art and, even worse, a disgusting signal of violence for any young man watching this film. <br /> <br /> No, this film is not intended for messages, and for this reason I, of course, do not watch Robocop movies or Alien or Predator films. However, when you go too far and cross the line, much of what you are doing should be questioned. As for this film, according to the evil guy who was dying with a drug dealer when he dies, “he still sucks.”
