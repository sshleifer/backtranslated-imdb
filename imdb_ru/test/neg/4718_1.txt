In this terrible attempt to use the Blair Witch mock-up, a group of people are sent to Africa to explore a creature called the Half-Blood. Obviously, there was no script to talk about and everything was improvised. It can work if you have good actors who are not in this film. <br /> <br /> This film tries to get points for originality, exploring a more obscure myth and exotic culture. As a result, there are a lot of scenes in the forest where characters make "fancy African things," for example, they eat elephant dung. There are also quite good frames with lions (from the point of view of National Geographic), but there is not a fright in the whole film. <br /> <br /> If you have seen the Cannibal Holocaust or the Blair Witch Project, this film will not surprise you and you can probably watch the best shots with lions on the Discovery Channel. <br /> <br /> Definitely half the effort. <br /> <br /> Note to the filmmakers: guys, do us a favor and next time save your home movie “How I Spent an African Vacation” for your family and close friends. No one else wants to see it.
