In 1913, in the Carlton mine in Additown, Pennsylvania, the cruel mine owner uses poor children for exploration, and after the explosion a group of children are buried alive. Currently, Karen Tunni (Lori Heuring) has just lost her husband after a long period of incurable disease, when family savings were spent on treatment. Without money, she moves with her daughters Sarah (scout Taylor-Compton) and Emma (Chloe Moretz) to an old house in the mountains that belonged to her husband. Neighbors advise Karen to stay home at night, and Sarah hears that there are zombies in the area. When Emma becomes Mary's friend, his mother believes that she is an imaginary friend. However, when Sarah's friends are attacked and eaten alive by zombie children, and Emma disappears, Karen and Sarah pursue her near the mine. <br /> <br /> “Unclean little things” is not a bad movie: acting is good; makeup creepy; and the cinematography and appreciation of music is excellent. However, the story, and therefore the script, is very weak, a really bad collection of clichés. The beginning is reasonable: the widow moves to a house in a remote place, because the family has spent all their resources on the patriarch's illness. But when she arrives, by coincidence small zombies attack people without any consequences, for example, families are not looking for missing people. Then the evil Mr. Carlton comes to a place with the most disgusting looks, typical cliches, which he will die at the end. There is no explanation why children attacked innocent people and why they should stop after the murder of Mr. Carlton. When Sarah runs off with her mother and says that she is tired and can no longer run, this is one of the most stupid lines I've ever seen in a horror movie. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Zombies"
