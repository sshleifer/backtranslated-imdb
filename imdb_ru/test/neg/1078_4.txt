I was very disappointed with this movie. He has great actors and perhaps a great plot, but he seemed to be just limping. <br /> <br /> Charlize Theron was a workshop in her role and beautiful, but it seemed that 90% of her screen work chasing a car was made with Austin Minis. Product placement went wrong, therefore very wrong. <br /> <br /> The direction also seemed wrong. Edward Norton is a bad guy, and it was so obvious from the start. Every time the camera passed over him, she lingered too long, and Norton frowned or something like that. Come on, Hollywood, give us a small loan! You can surprise us by turning the plot without the need to telegraph. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but this film was just below average. I have always been alone to appreciate the work and talent that goes into the movie, but it simply did not have that.
