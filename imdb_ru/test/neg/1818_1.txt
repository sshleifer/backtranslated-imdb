This series continues to disappoint and annoy. How are they going to pull it for another year? Each episode offers more and more questions, while at the same time providing answers to very few. By quoting another very popular website, I believe that this show has now stepped over a shark! <br /> <br /> Will I continue to watch it? <br /> <br /> Maybe <br /> <br /> will they be able to keep the show on the air until it ends? <br /> <br /> Probably not ... <br /> <br /> How did two skilled doctors not notice that Naomi was still alive? How more than 30 people did not notice how the corpse woke up and left with a knife in the back? Why did someone have enough strength to create two paths and climb a tree to ambush Kate? <br /> <br /> We presented a ghostbuster ... <br /> <br /> Next week? Aha
