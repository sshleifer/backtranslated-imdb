This film was not so good at all. Here is the first hint, and that it will not be a strong film, the name Harrison Ford not only appears first, but more than the title. The music was nominated for an Oscar, what the hell was that? This music was probably the most annoying thing in the film. At best, acting was below normal, except that the boy from Amish did a good job with his youth. Then you have a story that was weak and a bit ubiquitous, and she won for the adapted one! The music was terrible, I know I already said something, but it was really bad. The room was very good and should be redone. Well, that's all I really have. <br /> <br /> Your average guy <br /> <br />
