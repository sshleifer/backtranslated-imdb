The only interesting part of this film is jazz and reggae in New Orleans. This is an attempt to become one of those films in which the heroine has to overcome two battles: one from the past and one from the present that she cannot convincingly do. The game is bad, and the direction is even worse. I'm not at all surprised that it went straight to the video. The end result of this film leaves no one satisfied or convinced, including the actors themselves.
