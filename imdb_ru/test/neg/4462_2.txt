If you first watched this film with Maria from the fourth grade, then perhaps a haze of nostalgia will encourage your charitable side. If not, he has no chance. Hippik young people are bullshit, people may have used a random word that you will hear here, but not huge parties in sentence by sentence. This is not so much a date with Dracula in 1972, as tearing him to pieces. From the moment someone opens his mouth before the age of thirty, it’s impossible to take the film seriously, and even if it’s a laugh, it’s not even a smile. The idea of ​​throwing Dracula into modern times is good and worthy of a much stronger scenario than Don Houghton has to offer. The River Thames and Chelsea Male are no match for doll bats, model locks and terrible additions, but you can't help but feel that with the best writing it would be so different.
