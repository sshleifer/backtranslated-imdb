PLEASE, people! Do not worry about this badly directed joke. The direction was completely wrong from the start. Where is the story of his mother’s emotional intervention and total madness in the original family? Why is ED depicted as this big, powerful imposing figure, full of anger and hatred? What the hell is this? The writer and director obviously didn’t explore the story and just wanted to cash in on the infamous name Hein. The fools who made this film took upon themselves so much truth, this is ridiculous. If you want to see a brilliant movie, Gein. Go back to the minor classic "Deranged" to see how Ed really was. There is humor in this film, and, according to the story, Ed is portrayed as the sadder, lonely little man he was. Where is the background? There are simply poorly tuned shocks (which are not shocking) that we have seen before, and more perfect ones. Take the most terrible fight with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and add it to this list. I had to give him ONE out of ten, because the rating would not accept ZERO. I want my money back. If someone views this film as “stunning,” perhaps it will get a financial return.
