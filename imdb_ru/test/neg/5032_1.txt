I saw this movie yesterday on TV. I just finished reading the book in which the film is supposedly based. The opening credits read: "This is a free adaptation of the novel by Esa de Queiroz." At that moment I should have turned off the TV. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​“free adaptation” of the Faith of Sacramento talks about the influence of the Church on people and the hypocrisy of people claiming to be moral at the end of the 19th century. in the story of sex. In fact, the only thing she took from the novel was the genital part, which was only slightly mentioned in the novel by Esa de Queiroz. And, of course, the name of some characters. <br /> <br /> As regards the characters of the novel, Amelia and Joao Eduardo became victims of the influence of the church. Amaro's father seduced Amelia, and she controlled him all the time. Joan Eduardo, her fiancé, was excommunicated by the priests because he dared to criticize them. In this film, Amelia seduces everyone she meets, and Amaro's father is just another victim. Joao Eduardo is a drug and illegal weapons dealer. <br /> <br /> Vera Sacramento turned a novel in which she criticized the moral costumes of the era, and turned it into another film with a lot of (bad) sex. Worse, her story was completely empty of ideas. Two hours wasted! Ashe de Queros, of course, did not deserve this.
