Czech cinematography is going through dark times ... this film is real proof. Slama obviously wanted to make a mediocre documentary about fictional people, characteristic of their stupidity. A young and healthy boy who does not want to work and prefers to live in a decaying shack with a helpless alcohol aunt. Because of the idiocy of Tonik, who simply can declare: "Dad, I will not work in a factory" (I would really like to know WHY); I understand his state of being “at home”, but I’m really not able to digest this terrible mess around. Tight sentimentality is everywhere. Why Monica did not accompany her boy to work abroad? Young Czech couples do this very often. And take other people's children to live in a devastated barn ... it's too much. <br /> <br /> An irresponsible mother (Geislerova did not do well), a naive and stupid boy (Tonic), a stupid and confused girl (Monica) ... Yes, someone already said this — a poor director and a soap opera acted. Actors such as Martin Huba, Bolek Polivka, Tatiana Wilhelmova and Simon Stasova did everything possible, but unfortunately this could not save the entire film.
