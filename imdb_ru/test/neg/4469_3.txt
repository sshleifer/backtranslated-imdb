(very serious spoilers) <br /> <br /> This film was a huge disappointment. There are so many problems, I do not know where to start. So, I'll tell you what's good about the movie. <br /> <br /> The cast was great. Steve Martin presents a really funny performance of a middle aged, worried white guy. the queen of the latif plays a big, beautiful, urban, black girl. and Eugene Levy, well, he pretty much plays himself. Add Betty White and Jean Smart, and you get a great cast - all played their part very well. and if watching these guys for 1.75 hours costs you $ 8, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> but there are a lot of serious mistakes in the film. First, racial stereotypes and racial jokes are enough to offend everyone. all white people are fanatics. all black people are carriers of the ghetto. black - fashionable, cool, poor and poor. White nerds, tough and rich. (except for Evgeny Levy, he is clearly taken with Queen Latifa and “speaks jargon” - so Latifa calls him a “freak”. So - if you are a white man and you like black women and you know street slang, you must be a freak) . the film is littered with obvious racial stains against blacks, and in return, whites are depicted as morons and tits. <br /> <br /> Putting the race card aside, let's consider the main drawback of the film: they destroy the character of Latifah. She comes to Martin's house under a false pretense, but she still likes Martin. she must be mistakenly accused of robbery, Martin takes over. On 3/4 of the way through the film, we learn that the character Latifa escaped from prison. So, our sympathy for her goes to the window. <br /> <br /> There is no real plot. the film moves from stage to stage with Latifa appearing in a place where she is not supposed to be (like a country club or Martin's house), and Martin tries to hide it. This is a running gag. then in the last moments of the film they decide that they will finally have to deal with Latifah’s assertion that she was mistakenly accused of robbing a bank. Martin is hiding as a homely guy to get (let's face it, unfit) recognition from ex-boyfriend Latifah, and everyone lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Finally (but with this click, there are much more problems)) this film seems to be a jumble of clips from other films. The room is clearly borrowed from another martin film, House-Nanny. where Goldie Hawn comes to live with Martin and shakes his hard middle-class life. Martin and Latif meet online - ala "you got mail." the whole “quirky nanny corrects the life of a rich man” goes back to the “sounds of music” and “mary poppins”. <br /> <br /> I would never see this movie for free.
