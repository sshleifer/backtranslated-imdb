This “documentary” absolutely does not shed light on how it feels to be backstage during the Hard Knock Life tour. Of course, I was not there, but watching this movie did not make me feel like me. And for such a film is not quite a compliment. All the time that I watched it, all I could think was: "What are they missing?" When it's over, the only rapper you feel that you have some idea is DMX, and this is mainly because he just talks about his dogs. Waste of time. <br /> <br /> 3/10
