this film is rather bad, aggressive, poorly played, poorly directed, it seems low-budget, poor quality, emotionally weak and detached. After looking at the previous comments, I went to see it, but if you try to compare it with the Apocalypse now, PLATOON or any other, you really do not know. This film looks like an old and cleanly filmed movie of the 60s with the cast of adult Neanderthals, not to mention not mentioning (or even not doing), not paying attention to such details as changing rounds, low-budget fireworks and types of poorly taken characteristics. However, it is watchable if you would like it to be at the initial stage of developing a document about a movie ... do not come back !! <br /> <br /> p.s - In the end, with the guys everything is in order.
