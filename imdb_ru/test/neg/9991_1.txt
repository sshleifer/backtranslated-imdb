It is rare to see a film that catches the eye in all aspects, but Caligula should certainly have this title. I'm not sure which is more awful; abuse, sexual perversion, action or conspiracy (or serious flaw). <br /> <br /> Two and a half hours mainly followed the ascension of the notorious Roman Caesar "Caligula" to the throne in the year 37 AD. and shows the atrocities and perversions that he allegedly committed while in power. The game is lifeless and boring - but this is only the tip of the iceberg. Obviously, knowing that this film lacks something lawfully interesting, the directors decided to add as many scenes of naked bodies and orgies as possible. But do not be fooled, these scenes do not weaken or distract attention from the hideousness of this film. The camera work is crappy, the dialogue is ridiculous, in fact you need to congratulate Malcolm McDowell (playing in Caligula) for enduring such farcical lines. And then violence .... <br /> <br /> If you're going to watch a movie, be prepared. Some atrocities are committed in the film (not only in writing), but also as a result of disgusting violent acts that have little meaning or purpose other than to reflect the viewer. This is the only purpose of this film. One has to wonder how the creators of this film thought that bestiality, necrophilia and castration (only some of them) would be attractive to everyone. When it belatedly ends in two and a half hours, you donâ€™t take anything from this film, except for some disturbing shots and that you may have witnessed the worst movie in history. <br /> <br /> You have been warned
