I read a lot of great hopes from readers of the book that this would be a true adaptation of the story of Nora Roberts. Without reading a book, I do not know if this adaptation was correct, but I know that it was not a good one. In fact, the screenplay was the best part of the film, so the glory of Norah Roberts. <br /> <br /> I planned ahead and watched Caroline Moon from behind Claire Forlani. I was never sure if she was a good actress. She was decent in some films, average in others and very bad at that. But Forlani was not alone. The performances were everywhere. Oliver Hudson was wooden and boring. Josie Davis was Hammy. Then, among all this B-course, there is Jacqueline Bisset! She had nothing to do except to portray bitterness, but even going through it in a dream, she was many miles ahead of the others. <br /> <br /> However, Forlani remains one of the most exciting women in the movie, and I was not disappointed in this capacity here. I believe that Forlani can be more than just a spectacle, but until she turns into a good performance in a good movie, she continues to succeed. And I will continue to faithfully observe everything in which she participates. Fandom is so funny. <br /> <br /> This film, Carolina Moon, was pretty bad. In addition to the bad action (fake southern accents really distracting) the direction was pedestrian. It was not terrible. It was just a boring gauge for television, which you used to see in Lifetime. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of any of the stars, you can probably enjoy Carolina Moon for this reason, as I did. If you're a book fan, you might like to see the story on screen, albeit in a more modest form. Otherwise, this film is unremarkable.
