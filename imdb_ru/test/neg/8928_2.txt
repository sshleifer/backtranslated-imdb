RATING STARS: ***** Jodie Marsh **** Michelle Marsh *** Kim Marsh ** Rodney Marsh * Hackney Marsh <br /> <br /> Harlan Banks (Steven Seagal is not such a bad actor as Kevin Costner , but ....... aaaaaaaaa, you know) this is a modern day, Robin Hood (listen carefully, you can hear Brian Adams’s music playing in the background ... no, not really), the type of guy who steals illegally obtained hard-earned money from drug dealers and use them to keep open shelters. But now he was approached to take a van in a robbery from Las Vegas to one of the last things before working in retirement. But, of course, everything goes wrong, and he challenges the big guys upstairs and in prison. Here he meets a guy by name (although you will not know about it because of the attention to the film) Ice Cool (Treach), with whom he has a friendship, and as a result he is released from prison. After his release, he is going to prove his innocence, find the missing money and, naturally, put up with those who framed him! <br /> <br /> Of all the recent Seagal “Today You Die” videos, this is what most belongs to cinema, even with a rap star in the role of his colleague, as in his previous films Half Past Dead and Exit Wounds . Yes, it seems that when he doesn’t make films about caring for the environment, he pretends to be black and is shot with rappers. But TYD is not a cinematic film, and it is a luxury. The Great One will never enjoy until Under Siege 3 materializes (if ever!) <br /> <br /> The film opens with a sleek, sharp look that commands attention, but it all goes fast down the hill from there. As soon as Seagal goes to prison, the plot quickly loses consistency. Indeed, Trach's character seems to just appear out of nowhere without any introduction as his partner, and from there you quickly lose interest in him. <br /> <br /> That's it. I know I said this before, but I think I mean this time. I do not think that I will give more of these right in the Seagal video films anytime. Honestly, I have no enthusiasm for watching Shadow Man. In fact, I can honestly say that until now I didn’t like ANY of his STV films, and Today You Die is certainly not an exception, an indifferent, boring effort that is best avoided. *
