I received a copy of this film from a friend for my 21st birthday, which he obviously picked up 99 pence from the promotional video. <br /> <br /> I have never been so upset when watching a movie - Tiring, Adam West was wasted (literally), and, looking back, I can't remember a single thing about it. My lack of pleasure increased to such an extent that at that second, when the loans rolled, we broke the tape and hung the tape around the living room. Just for good measure, we set the lid on fire.
