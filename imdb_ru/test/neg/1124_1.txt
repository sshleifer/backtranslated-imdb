** WARNING ** MALFUNCTION FILM ** WARNING ** A day before Christmas Eve, some crazy case decided that he would entertain us by sending this movie as "entertainment" on TV. What in the name of God did he think? <br /> <br /> This movie is filled with terrible humor, despicable game, lousy jokes and a catastrophe storyline. Randy Quaid plays the idiotic role of cousin Eddie Johnson. Eddie is a mentally retarded person, unable to solve even the simplest tasks. He was fired because he was stupid like a brick, but the company in which he worked, regretted it, so they sent him and his family on vacation. But being as stupid as he was, he managed to turn a vacation into a disaster. <br /> <br /> In general, this is the worst film I've ever seen, and I still have nightmares about this pathetic game and even more pitiful jokes in this film. It's so sad that you almost have to see it ... But do not. My nightmares are much worse than any other nightmares you ever have. Believe me ... I hate this film so much because of its play, humor, "jokes" and history. The only good thing was the beautiful scenery. <br /> <br /> Well, this is my opinion, and I hope everyone agrees with me ...
