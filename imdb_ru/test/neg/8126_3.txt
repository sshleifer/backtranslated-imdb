The TV team Realty is tasked with covering the high school hockey team in a small town where a serial killer in a black mask and a hoodie meets. A number of interviews in which members of the film crew (and some of the locals living in the city of White Plains, where most of this film is being shot) tell the camera about each other, those they meet in the city of White Plains, their current situations and the side of show business in their lives. The script is often sour, cynical, and caustic, and Killer Movie, in essence, makes fun of real-life television shows featuring characters that can be found in The Real World. If this plot is attractive to you, cut out. I found the characters tedious, and the satire - the familiar. Jake Tanner, Paul Wesley, a director who needs a big break, meets more than he could afford, Jake Tanner is a good guy, very handsome and patient about the shit he has to contend with, given the prima donna and the immature people around him which often cause only migraines. Particularly tedious is his producer Lee (Sia Batten), a tyrant who constantly barks orders to everyone, her poisonous attitude creates great tension ... she is a type of producer who wants to benefit from the eruption of a small town against the killer using the cover of a hockey team History as front to use the tragedy that takes place on the White Plains. Those familiar with Kaley Cuoco know that by now she has perfected the pampered princess, has lost consciousness, because this is the only role we have ever seen in her most of the time. Like Blanca, she polarizes the way she needs attention, goes so far as her celebrity status is small, she creates a lot of friction, because she becomes a source of frustration and has a rather modest mouth (perhaps Cuoco took part just so that she can to avoid her usual roles in television sitcoms, if they are allowed to pronounce profanity without any restrictions) Quoco, like the whole cast, serves the Killer Movie as sweet, but it’s hard to find any character you don’t want to see broken into pieces with meat cleaver. Jason London is a sound / equipment specialist, a real bastard with a sour attitude, often torturing others with dirty comments that are inappropriate. We see a lot of personality clashes, watching as these self-priming Hollywood characters in the cast beat each other. The identity of the killer should not surprise anyone, it is quite obvious. Some minor blood, but most of the violence is off-screen. Despite some tame lesbian, even this does not satisfy. Leighton Meester appears in the film as a cute victim. Director / writer Jeff Fisher collects a rather attractive cast, but I could not distinguish it from the countless slashers who have stocked horror regiments in the last ten years or so since the appearance of SCREAM. Although I never liked Cuoco’s characters, I don’t get tired of looking at her, but in the end she needs to come up with a role that isn’t in her purity, with self-satisfied arrogance, constant nagging and complaints.
