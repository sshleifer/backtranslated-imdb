"Yagyu ichizoku no inbo" (let's say, "Shogun's Samurai") is somewhere in the middle between the terribly boring and stunning pain to watch. As a historical epic, it could have been much more likely to become a rich saga ... but in reality itâ€™s nothing more than just another cheap 70s action movie with a plot based on real events and a sports bandage on a Chiba leash. Before this movie reached the middle, I was even tempted to do seppuku! The music is like a thousand dogs in the heat, screaming in your ears to the melody written by Ennio Morricone (this is not an insult to the Morricone). Using cinematography with a zoom lens is more disgusting than exciting. And in terms of action, this is really nothing more than a series of violent attacks and shocking. What a horrible movie.
