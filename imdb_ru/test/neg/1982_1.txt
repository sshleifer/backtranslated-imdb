When The Spirits Within was released, all you heard from Final Fantasy fans is how awful the movie is, because it doesn't look like Final Fantasy. This is another story, for better or for worse. Familiar settings, characters, music, scenes and plot screens should excite fans of the original game. The problem is that this is just a bad movie in itself. <br /> <br /> Direction during battle scenes is often sloppy, ridiculously fast switching of camera angles in an attempt to make the action more insane, but only serves to make the scenes look messy and confusing. <br /> <br /> The computer graphics itself is exceptional, but I cannot say that this is the best I've ever seen, since Spirits Within had much more detail about the characters, although I have to admit that the characters are Advent Children's moved much more naturally. <br /> <br /> The plot is almost a black hole. This is a giant deus ex machina, intended solely to return Sephiroth to the final battle. Old characters appear again, but serve no other purpose than to please the fans. Character development is absent, and the film does nothing at all to solve any plot themes that remain stuck after the end of the game. But it's full of neat-looking scenes of battles with magic, challenges, and limit breaks, which was probably what the fans wanted anyway. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, Advent Children is a very catchy, but completely thoughtless action film, it's more a side story for Final Fantasy VII than a real sequel. <br /> <br /> By the way, don't think that you hurt my feelings by voting “Not helpful.” It makes me feel better, knowing that the fans are so offended by my objectivity.
