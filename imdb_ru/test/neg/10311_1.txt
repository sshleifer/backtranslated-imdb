Previous comments are a generous way. This film is a waste of electricity and plastic. On the other hand, I had a lot of fun by presenting it to friends and having previously described that it is “incredible!” comments like enthusiastic endorsements. They were wrong. The sadistic pleasure I felt imposing it on people cost $ 5, which I paid for the film. On the other hand, one (former) friend says that I owe him 90 minutes ago. I especially liked the "view from the cannon" parts of the film. Truly cool in this absurdity.
