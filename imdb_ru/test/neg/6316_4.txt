Being a big fan of street fighters and fully enjoying the previous film Street Fighter II: Animated film, I was looking forward to this film! <br /> <br /> However, the film did not have much meaning. direction or goal. Most of the characters that I could not connect, and he simply did not have enough intensive actions that made another mentioned film about street fighters so excellent. <br /> <br /> However, there are some good moments, the animation is great !!!
