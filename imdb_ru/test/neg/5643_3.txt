I could not believe the original assessment, which I found when I watched this movie, 9.5? Unfortunately, it seems I'm not alone. <br /> <br /> The film is really slow and boring, one of the sad things is that if the film received a realistic rating of about 5 or 6, then the expectation would not be so high. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was not the case, so when I watch a movie and see a bad story and acting, I stay, putting him 3/10 points. /> <br /> Vinnie Jones is great at Lock reserves, as well as in Snatch, and he plays a very tough person, but he should stick to this role. It's a bit like when Stallone and Schwarzenegger shot comedy films, they just don't work. <br /> <br /> He also cannot play the main role, he plays better than in a secondary role, or in some other way. When he plays a leading role, his acting talents are too “visible” and turn out to be not very good. Vile Machine is another good example of this.
