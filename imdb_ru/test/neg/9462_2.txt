** Spoiler * He gives out a very inappropriate ending ** <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this film the master of short films H.G. Lewis presented a brief overview of the world of blood. He spoke about how this film was lost and then discovered years after the director’s death. He also talked about how films were measured by the amount of blood used in him. The blood feast was 2 gallons, 10,000 maniacs were 5 gallons. But then he goes and claims that Dr. Gore was 15 gallons. I want to know where half of the 15 gallons went. While watching a movie, I saw very little about 15 gallons. Agree, there was quite a lot of blood, but about 15 gallons. Some scenes of dismemberment were definitely awful and realistic, from flesh and other things, but I would not say 15 gallons. <br /> <br /> "END !!! ENNNNNNNNNDDDDDD !!!" Does this sound familiar? This is what you should have said about the last half of this film. After Igor's character was thrown into an acid bath, the film slowed to a painful crawl. There was no consistent end, as it did not fit into anything 90 minutes before it provided. She drove in a van with a complete stranger, a BIG OFFER! This is what happens when you save a person (I will not say a person, because she cannot be considered a person) very innocent towards the world around her. The doctor teaches the girl that a man needs to be loved, so every man she meets loves her. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that H.G. Lewis told us at the beginning of the film that we might not like acting, directing, or even blood ... I’ll go with options A and B. I WAS AWESOME !! That was enough to give me bad dreams about editing a scrapbook and about people with shifty eyes when they talk to one person. But I went through the film and came out stronger. It is a pity that I could not say the same thing after finishing ROBO C.H.I.C. <br /> <br /> It was a BAD film. I can usually take my doses of vinegar at a good pace, but from time to time you get a movie that bites in response. I think this film took off an arm or a leg (haha ... * sigh *). Admitted, I really enjoyed my gaze when the kind doctor looked at his future victims and opened his REALLY wide eyes and just looked. It was VERY similar to Fuad Ramsey in the “Bloody Feast” when he looked at this lady in his catering shop and then did not use his power. I suppose this film starts where the power of Fouad ceased. <br /> <br /> * Final decision * The film should have been lost. Good day <br /> <br /> Scott
