It's been a long time since I was in a movie as lame and dull as this one. Itâ€™s one thing to have a slow pace when the characters develop gradually, or some aspect of the film is obviously reinforced by such a pace (such as Lost in Translation). However, there is a difference between slow progress and it directly breaks down, as it happened in this. I guess by the expression on Helen Mirren's face, she was probably distraught by the disappearance of her husband !! (sarcasm) And it's great that the whole story fell apart at the end. Really a masterpiece.
