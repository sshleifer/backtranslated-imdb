With the help of NBC, “Thank God you're here,” the network may be trying to replicate the success of the improvised ABC sitcom “Who is the line? in which presenter Drew Carey will judge the performances of a handful of actors who are asked to improvise some scenes. On NBC, Dave Fowley and co-host Dave Alan Greer are watching several famous comedians who have to improvise their way through the various scenes that all start with "Thank God you're here." This takes itself too seriously (why viewers need to constantly be reminded that the actors have never seen the filming before), both co-hosts seem less enthusiastic. After the actors constantly observe the unsatisfactory attempts of the actors to cause laughter, I can only wonder whether the audience really laughs at what is happening, or they also improvise. Expect this time period filler to be very short-lived.
