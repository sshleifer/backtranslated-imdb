The blank cut of the novel by John Irving courageously strives for depth, but ultimately turns out to be absurd. This is a bizarre, stupid and bitter-sweet chain of sketches in which they try to explain the height of a person from birth to adulthood and how he copes with the evils of lust and fanaticism that surround him. Garp was born the formidable unmarried mother of Jenny Fields, played by Glenn Close. (In the different stages of Garp's childhood, three young actors play before Robin Williams takes over when Garp comes of age.) The story is traced in childhood by the boys. â€œPreparatory school, where Jenny is a school nurse, thanks to her passionate struggle in high school, writing and sex marriage with her beloved high school, children, marriage problems and a writing career. Jenny, meanwhile, became a famous feminist, supporting an unorthodox cause. The plot details the abundance of comic and tragicomic episodes and outlandish adventures. Williams gives a presentation with a cherub. This scenario did not match his wildness and anarchy, and therefore his talent was wasted. He's like a wounded bird that goes out of control. The role of John Lithgow as a father as a transsexual conveying wisdom is also meaningless. This film was able to attract some reasonable attention in 1982 thanks to the popularity of Robin Williams and his new movie recording. Williams recently dropped his studies of Mork and Mindy and focused more on comedies and films. The audience was embarrassed by this film, especially its arbitrary and inexplicable ending.
