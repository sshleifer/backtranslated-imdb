The brands in this film, such as Suit Supply, are taken away from the story, because it must be in the eighties. This is not a very exciting movie. In addition, the single with Intwine on the soundtrack is very bad, it has a chorus that repeats itself many times, ”like,“ I'm a cruel man, I take it all, I'm a cruel man, I'm here. come up with something better than this? I think they wrote it in a couple of minutes .. <br /> <br /> This is really annoying, as is the product placement in this film that comes up with controversy and publicity around the criminal, who should not be a celebrity. the way he was now, but should be forgotten, as should be sy.
