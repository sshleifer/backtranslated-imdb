This film itself is a cyborg: half meaningless / half permanent original film. <br /> <br /> This film, like a cyborg, has only one goal: to make you wish that you spend the entire duration of the film in a dark room, punching yourself in the testicles. <br /> <br /> Unlike many people, I didn’t make this film because of Angelina Jolie (I’ll explain why I shot it soon). I'm not a big fan of Miss Jolie, although I would say that her performance was stellar! Her empty gaze and robotic game really made me believe that she was an android prostitute. If anyone has her clip in Inside the Actors Studio, explaining how she prepared for this role, send it to me. I will definitely use it when I try James Lipton for “Crimes Against Honesty”. <br /> <br /> So what made me rent this movie? It would seem that it was a hope to see Angelina Jolie's nipples, but this is not so. No, the reason for this lease was solely in one of the images on the DVD cover; This is the face of Jack Palance! Half of his face was a robot! When I saw this, I introduced the Palaces, slowly marching through the fiery wasteland, devastating any man who was stupid enough to resist. In my opinion, every member of this Unholy Army Palance had a red, glowing eye; a red, glowing eye that looked at people and saw only "meat". They were to become the Architects of Oblivion ... a cold, cruel Apocalypse ... A nightmare from which humanity will never wake up. This is a beautiful image that I will cherish until the end of my years. <br /> <br /> Like most things in my life, this film did not live up to my expectations. No, there was only “one” Jack Palance, and the only visible cybernetic improvements he had were on his feet. Unfortunately, these improvements didn’t really “improve” anything. Unless you consider FREEDOM POLICE SECRET as a superpower. At least it was a scene in which Jack - smiling, like a happy Alzheimer's patient - began to fucking shoot some people. I waited for him to shout: "I'm damn tired of paying too much for prescription drugs!" Unfortunately, there were few geriatric rage flashes and they were far from each other. <br /> <br /> Abundance of the film was a poorly developed love story about a man (Elias Koteas, aka De Niro for the poor) and a cyborg (Angelina Jolie, also known as John Voigt's Demon Spas). Oh dear, can the love between Romeo from flesh and Juliet from Silicone ever last?!?!?! This is possible if you follow the simple advice of Jack Palance: "You must TASTE TIME each other." <br /> <br /> Yes, I'm not sure what that means. However, I’m sure I don’t want Jack Palance to explain this to me. I sure as hell do not want him to show me! As an experiment, I suggest you ask your significant friend if he / she thinks that “we have reached a level in our relationship when we can START TIME each other?”
