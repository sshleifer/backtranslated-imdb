I think this is the first time I go to the theater and go out so disappointed. There were two reasons why I went to watch Astérix et les Vikings: first as a movie buff and then as a big Astérix fan. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film doesn’t satisfy a single request, It’s just a big animated mess, and this proves that the Astérix franchise is getting worse and worse. <br /> <br /> In fact, this was the case after the death of the first screenwriter Rene Goscinny in 1977. His faithful co-author, illustrator Albert Uderzo, took his place, but the following books clearly lacked the quality that was present during the years of Goscinni. <br /> <br /> “Astérix et les Vikings” is based on the book “Astérix et les Normands”, which was published during the reign of Goschynny. Obelix must turn him into a real man, while the Vikings come to Gaul to find out what fear is, because it seems that fear gives wings. <br /> <br /> This is where the similarity ends. What follows in the book, is a continuous series of laughter, jokes and cheerful dialogue, with the result that the Vikings are really but they discover fear and flee from Gaul. The film is stupid, unfunny, fast-paced, banal ... Well, just call the default, and it has good chances of applying ... <br /> <br /> The difference between a book and a film It may be more acceptable if the film was good, but new ideas simply crush it in a bottomless pit. Even older Astérix films, such as Astérix le Gaulois, in which the lines are almost permuted without being modified, are easily improved. <br /> <br /> Animation has the quality of other 21st century films, but it has its drawbacks and any budding film could find mistakes. The best example is a continuity error when the day follows the night after a split second in the same sequence. <br /> <br /> Imagine. They took animation studios from many countries, and they still cannot get adequate film production. <br /> <br /> Changes to the original story are simply unbearable. And they can still be, even if there was no original story. In the film, Goudurix has a domestic pigeon named SMS, which plays the role of his mobile phone (!). Grossebafa, the leader of the Vikings, has a rebellious teenage daughter named Abba (!), And she constantly challenges the authority of her father. There is also a dull viking wizard, his cartoon dull and muscular son, Grossebath's faithful bride, who is obsessed with ornaments (her name is Vikea!) And ... well, I can not stand for so long. <br /> <We are far from the original jokes from the original book. The biggest problem is the difficulty of transferring images to the big screen, mainly because verbal jokes and visual jokes that do not have the same attractiveness on the theater screen laugh most of all in books. I remember that the greatest moments in the book were Obelix, laughing at the names of the invaders (which end in “af”), and Goodurix tries to scare them in ridiculous ways. <br /> <br /> And if everything was not so enough, some of the advertising staff decided to write on the film’s poster that there is an already existing song, Céline Dion, which will be included in the final credits. If it was a new song, I would understand. But the use of the old song is another proof that the film is made so badly that they are ready to do everything to attract the audience. <br /> <br /> The only good moment for this film is that it’s so stupid, and the end is so bad that we just can’t get out of the theater without staying cold. In the summer release, it just doesn’t hurt ... <br /> <br /> The only other acceptable moment in the film is how Goodurix becomes brave. His psychological transformation in the book is too spontaneous and not credible, while it is better depicted in the film, and the motivation is more believable. <br /> <br /> So if you haven’t seen the movie yet, don’t spend your money on it. Instead, take a book. <br /> <br /> Oh, Rene, why did you leave us?
