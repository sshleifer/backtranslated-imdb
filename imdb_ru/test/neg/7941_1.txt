Initially, the “Assault on the 13th sector” is rough, witty and, perhaps, the most important, short character. This remake is ruthlessly crammed and talkative. Worse, the African-American hero of the first film here is replaced by handsome white boy Ethan Hawke, which makes this “Storm” less progressive than in the 1970s. God, I miss John Carpenter and his incredible storyline and his weird sense of humor. I even miss his B-List actors, who are better in leagues than Hawk and company. <br /> <br /> I can’t say that I care about new villains in this version - they stretch that little trust in history to the limit. Female characters are useless, all criminals are generics, and Gabriel Byrne gives another boring idea. In music, too, everything is not so - these are soft action films that actually distract from tension. Just awful
