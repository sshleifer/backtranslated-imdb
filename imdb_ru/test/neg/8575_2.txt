I usually do not like to comment on the actions in the film, because this is the only thing that people who have plans against the film will go after. In this film, I will make an exception. Acting in this film is below average. I mean halfway through the film, I wonder how the hell the producer and / or director went around the cast of such people who can't play. Even though the production value was good, the poorly written story was only aggravated by the bad acting of the actors, and there are even hesitant attempts to distort the end of the film, which ultimately confuses. Do all Spanish horror movies disappoint?
