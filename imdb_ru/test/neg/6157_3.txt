The story and characters really REALLY needed work. The idea of ​​the world is quite elegant, but no one bothered to develop it either through exposure or through the plot. Despite the silly notes at the beginning of the film, it makes sense that you will not use the exposure, since no one is new to this world. And yet, when Matt Owens (Bill Paxton) and Byron (Bob Peck) get off course and get lost, and they will be presented to fans of the wind and fat, lazy, rich people in the museum, we will not get any real idea of ​​who these people are. or why we should take care of any of them. Smart films have ways to develop this by simply forcing characters to live in peace. Simple things, such as ordering a drink at a bar or talking about something in the past, are the things that make the world of cinema unforgettable, and not endless shots of crappy planes and cheap computer graphics effects of someone who tries to make loops in ultralight. <br /> <br /> If this is too difficult for you, here is a little advice - shorten a few places. If everything becomes incoherent, because you often pull, stay in one place for a while and ask the characters to talk a bit. All the extra crap must be removed. Get rid of the whole scene of fans of the wind. Get rid of the stifling museum people. Get rid of all the shit flying shit if you can't make the wind fit the story. Put it all on a big plane or something. Just get people to talk about what we care about. <br /> <br /> Hey, get rid of Bill Paxton. Let the film center around Tusker's character and his relationship with the robot, Byron. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the biggest problem of the film is that we don’t care about anyone, because no one spends time trying to either explain their motives or delve into their characters. We don't like Matt (well, because Bill Paxton plays him, by the way). He is a scoundrel who does not redeem himself enough except to let go of the android Byron. And this action is even less important than most because of three key points: <br /> <br /> 1. Byron is the killer. 2. Byron is indestructible. 3. Byron can leave at any time when he's damn good, please. <br /> <br /> We are trying to love Byron, because there is some kind of pathos, but it is mostly not developed. All that we have left is a tearful guy-robot with glass eyes, who in an instant is muted and wooden, and in the next - almost insane. We do not know why or how he develops emotions, but we know for sure that he killed someone. We do not know why he killed someone or the circumstances of this terrible event, because it was not developed. We can not feel sorry for him if we do not know the story. All we know is that he kills people. And he likes Bill Paxton. <br /> <br /> We don’t hate Tasker enough (partly because he is played by the good guy Mark Hamill) because, although he is rude and ruthless, he doesn’t do anything unusual for his character - a post-apocalyptic peacemaker. Of course, he kills Montclair (Robbie Coltrane) and his team, but they are drug dealers who collect poppies for heroin. And they shoot him first. He does not kill anyone who does not interfere, or who does not first try to cause him physical harm. It is equally well suited for the final confrontation in a museum. He uses a bit of police brutality towards a lazy amateur (F. Murray, Abraham, wasted in this role), and everyone else shoots him. <br /> <br /> I really don’t understand what is Belitsky (Kitty Aldridge), partner at Tasker. After just 10 minutes spent with Matt, she is ready to go to the other side, despite her cries of loyalty, and in spite of Matt talking to her about horseradish and knocking her out. If this is love, then I will choose hate any day. <br /> <br /> Indeed. Paxton's character is about as cute as Simon in True Lies, or Pvt. Hudson from "Aliens". Does anyone fall for him in these films? No, why? Because he is an idiot with a loud voice and a loser. Why put him at the helm of this movie?
