The Madness, which first appeared in public, caused the ridicule of most critics when it first appeared on the pages of British television. I remember seeing him in his initial release, and thought then that if Hitchcock wanted to show some kind of on-screen recognition of his ingrained misogyny, he could not have found a more disgusting little car for that. <br /> <br /> But time changes the perspective, and something that was sickeningly bad in 1972 could, all these years later, be worthy of an upward revaluation. <br /> <br /> possible. , , but no. Madness is a dross. Stunned by an aging director who desperately wanted to use the artistic freedom to create films of the 70s without trying to understand that freedom imposes his own obligations — in particular, the need to bring honesty to his work. <br /> <br /> There is no And not too much evidence of an earlier director's brilliance - the transition from tingling from elusive to odious and obvious is neither shocking, nor, for the highest stylist, stylish: it is simply trivial it is this: long, without any reason, without a goal, except for the cheapest of the director's desires to act as a contemporary artist, like, say, this other famous practice of cheap meanness, Michael Winner). <br /> <br /> And everything goes from bad to worse, with a dialogue that defies no human origin (not least in the ridiculous occupation of the home life of our dear tree inspector and the cooking of his wife's food). <br /> <br /> Perhaps the scene that best describes “Madness” (and is the most obvious accusation of Hitchcock’s identity) is an awkward exchange between two lawyers in a bar where they discuss serial murders and then agree that least women first had a good time being raped. <br /> <br /> I remember my disgust at that scene in '72, and it is still not muffled, because it was not Hitchcock, clever, or sardonic, or an attempt to make some kind of universal point of view (big topics , great truths, were not Hitchcock's strong point, nor personal preferences.) It was only Hitchcock, allowing the reflection of his own distorted mirror in life to shine through the texture of the film. <br /> <br /> Calling Hitchcock’s last great masterpiece “Madness” is to betray little, if you understand at all, what Hitchcock actually achieved through cinematic deception, cinematic thrill and dazzling cinematic prowess. <br /> <br /> Therefore, “Madness” is what it has always been: a cheap, disgusting film with its fists, which did not help any of those who were involved, or in memory of the director who really was in his Hollywood days one of the greatest ever existed.
