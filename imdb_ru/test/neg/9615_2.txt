Oh, my God, as Alfred Hitchcock (North to the Northwest, Enchanted, 39 steps) can turn into this vile, cheap joker, outside of me. Do not try to search for hidden depths or deep values ​​- they are not. It’s just awful, tacky and cheap. One of the redeeming traits is the family life of an inspector who is investigating - his wife imagines herself to be a gourmet chef and is constantly submitting her hideous culinary experiments to her poor husband. It's funny, and it almost saved me from putting the movie in a “terrible” bracket, but the movie as a whole is one of the most unpleasant I have ever seen. I think it was the last but one Hitchcock movie - maybe someone was trying to tell him something.
