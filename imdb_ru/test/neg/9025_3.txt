Even the dying fans of John Wayne will have to admit that this film is a mess. The character of Wayne, John Tobin, pursues a gang that killed his parents, led by half Apache, half white renegade Pandro Zanti (Earl of Dwair), posing as a Mexican. <br /> <br /> There are almost too many stupid conspiracy points to count, but sheriff Williams (Jack Rockwell) stands out among them, who puts the captured Zanti around his boot, so all that Zanti has to do to free himself is this is to remove his boot! Tobin's friend Dusty (George to Gabby Hayes) takes a throwing knife in the back and returns as new to the rest of the story. In the chase scene, Tobin rides a home-made log channel through a drainage chute surrounded by log walls in the middle of the desert, and, following his trail, pursues Zanti (actually follows him) on foot through the desert. Zanti is looking for relief and drinks from a puddle of water, but, OH! He didn’t see a sign saying “Do not drink poison” above a water hole. When Zanti collapses dead, Tobin resumes his chase after the remainder of the gang and captures the entire party, blowing up a stone wall that closes the secret passage to the Dusty cabin - as convenient. <br /> <br /> At the end a new sheriff Tobin appears on the scene, talking on the phone with the new Mrs. Tobin (Sheila Terry), daughter Dusty Ruby, who previously in the film was the target of kidnapping the gang Zanti. Apparently, the studio was designed to ensure that Wayne received a girl in almost every film they shot with him, since this type of ending is quite predictable for almost all the films of the “Lone Star”.
