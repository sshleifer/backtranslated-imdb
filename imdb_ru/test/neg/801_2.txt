Filmed in 1976 for no apparent reason, besides the fact that it forces decorators to be occupied, “The Box” was directed by Richard Kelly (Donny Darko), and stars Cameron Diaz and James Marsden as Norma and Arthur Lewis, a young couple, who is allegedly in financial difficulties, even though they both have a successful career - she, as a high school teacher, he, as an optics specialist at the NASA research center in Langley, Virginia. They have one child, Walter (Sam Oz Stone). <br /> <br /> One day Lewis will find his parcel with a black box with a big red button on the threshold. There is a note from Mr. Steward 'indicating that he will be back at 5:00 pm to tell about the box. <br /> <br /> The mysterious Arlington Steward, played by Frank Langella, arrives at the appointed time, smartly dressed in an elegant Savile Rowe suit. He is polite, but businesslike, but his most visible feature is a face, half of which seems to have been blown away and improperly serviced. Langella is the only thing worth seeing in the film, however, unfortunately, he is pushed into the background with his own make-up, which resembles Harvey's “Two Face” Dent (Aaron Eckhart) makeup from Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. It's like an elephant in a room: you can ignore it, but it distracts a little. <br /> <br /> The steward explains that he will be back in 24 hours to pick up a button. If during this time they decide to unlock and press a button, he will give them $ 1 million in cash. The only catch - and it is big - is that somewhere a stranger will die. It may be through the city, it may be on another continent, but the Steward assures them that the victim will be someone unknown to them. As a demonstration of good faith, he left them a clear $ 100 bill, so that they reserve the right to press a button or not. <br /> <br /> Arthur and Norma are skeptical about this, believing that this is all a fraud or a complex deception, but they soon begin to wonder what will happen if they press a button? Will they really get a million dollars? Anyone really die? Tired of speculation, Norma slams a button. Nothing has happened. However, their initial relief is alarming when the Steward comes the next day with a briefcase full of money. They decide to cancel all this, but the Steward tells them that it is too late. “You have already pressed a button,” he explains. When the Steward's limousine drives off, Arthur notes the license number, which he later discovers, is registered with the NSA (National Security Agency). <br /> <br /> At this point, the film begins to go deep into unacceptable territory, as the secondary characters begin to bleed their noses and blink signs of peace. Meanwhile, the city is filled with puffy, lethargic jaws in bad shirts, which are beginning to chase Arthur around, as an advanced group of scouts for a race of alien zombie botanists. Eventually, Arthur falls into the trap of threatening bookworms in the library (?), Where the lustful Steward's wife appears - which we have not seen until now - and tells Arthur that in order to leave the library, he must enter one of them . of three vertical columns of cheese digital water effects. “What happens if I choose the wrong one?” Asks Arthur, looking much less confused than he should have been in the circumstances, and, of course, much less confused than the audience by this time. "Eternal damnation," says the spinster ominously. <br /> <br /> Arthur enters the middle column of digital liquid effects and, after a short absence suddenly appears, still in his water cocoon, hovering above Norma's bed. When she wakes up and sees him, a bubble of water bursts, and Arthur falls on the bed in a shower of water, which, oddly enough, continues to drip from the upper water pipes just outside the area of ​​the camera, while the vile Marsden and Diaz flop on the bed. <br /> <br /> This is confusing, I know. <br /> <br /> In the end, we learn that the Steward was once a NSA public relations officer before he was struck by lightning, which destroyed part of his face. He was declared dead, but later returned to life, becoming a kind of superman, who now serves "those who make lightning," and whose powers allowed him to take over the CIA, the NSA and NASA all by itself. <br /> <br /> And what's the point in all this chatter? Obviously, the mission of the Steward is to expose people to a kind of biblical character (for example, “The Commitment of Isaac”) in order to determine whether it is worth saving mankind. If enough people pass the button test, refusing to press it, the godlike Steward masters will spare the race. Unfortunately, those people who press the button, such as Norma and Arthur, must be punished for their moral ingenuity, and for this purpose they are subjected to a series of dull “Lady or Tiger” trials that play out as one of those. ” Saw films, “except when they didn’t have fun bloodshed or benefit from a consistent plot. <br /> <br /> “Stash” is a meaningless mental masturbation, which novice students like to talk over after a few beers. Richard Kelly’s tedious exercise in existentialist pethopoheria ultimately collapses under the weight of his own incomprehensibility; the haggard melange of unbearable ideas eventually freezes, as when mixing too many colors, in a tortuous gray adhesive film, as tasteless as one of those narcotic films in flight, whose plot no more or less suffers from an unhurried sleep. <br /> <br /> In the “Box” there is a point when Arthur, a technically minded guy, becomes curious about how the button works. Opening the block, he was disappointed that he did not find anything inside. <br /> <br /> After seeing The Box, I know exactly what it feels.
