Any great romantic comedy needs a conflict between romantic reasons in order to give the plot tension, anticipation and charm. This story is completely flat in this area. There is no conflict â€” at least not one that would prevent the two main characters from joining together, and therefore the expectation was flat, there is no anticipation, and in fact there is no appeal. <br /> <br /> Chemistry between Richard Gere and Diane Lane is the representative of friendship at best, and with the talent of these two particular actors I was quite surprised. During the movie, I expected them to play more checkers and talk about the weather than to see any moving passion. <br /> <br /> Although I am a fan of both actors, I believe that the actors in this film were turned off - or perhaps the direction was outside the base, and this affected their delivery. The letter was very weak, which could also affect the speeches; Most likely, the script could use some help from some harlequin writers who have real experience in the production of romance. <br /> <br /> This film may be worth seeing on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but only after it is aired. cheap shelf. <br /> <br /> (Sorry, Diane Ladd and Richard Gere)
