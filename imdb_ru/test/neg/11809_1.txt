Pre-nerd Robert Carradine, predator Desi Arnaz Jr. and almost pre-fertile Melanie Griffith hit the road and go to Alaska with romantic dreams of becoming rich salmon catchers. Well, their dream is as exciting as this boring youth road film. They are not particularly interesting, and the film does not make much sense, except for the fact that "we have collected the creation of some famous people and made a low-budget film about their misfortunes." Of the guns of road films of the 60s and 70s and the rebellious youth films, this film is mediocre, with insufficiently developed, cumbersome characters, not too witty, not as fresh as the dirty landscape of films. <Br /> <br /> But for those who care, they are sent to Alaska, and, apparently, Alaska looked like the Wild West in the 70s, because everyone carries a weapon and is rude and erratic. Robert Carradine says such charming things as: “I hope we can find a shower, my crazy itch.” (And he is alone with Melanie Griffith!) They are quickly robbed and forced to get a job, and the local large wig, their employer, forces Melanie to move and eventually dismisses Desi because she is not corrupt. That's when they are not smart and do not leave the city, deciding instead to eat dog food or go hungry, get beaten up from crazy guys, and then go for a walk in a car with cones. In the final half of the film, the evil prankster is abandoned when the trio commits a robbery, runs around, breeds an abduction scheme, and so on. The film just ends somehow, annoyingly and ambiguously, but seeing how they did not bother to get character development and history in the first place, this is entirely appropriate. It’s worth a look if you really love the low-fare 70s fares, but in the end it's pretty easy to be forgotten.
