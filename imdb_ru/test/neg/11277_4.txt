The previous IMDb reviewer stated that “Rafter Romance” is “plagiarism” (this is another reviewer's term) of a German musical called “Me By Day, You By Night”. Obviously, the reviewer does not know that * both * of these films borrowed their premise from Box and Cox, an English play written by John Maddison Morton in 1847. This play concerns two merchants who rent the same room from an unscrupulous housewife, each person considers himself the only tenant. Since these two people have different work schedules, the trick is not immediately apparent. This piece was once so popular in Britain that "for Box and Cox it" became a general term for an agreement in which two people willingly shared a home intended for only one person. <br /> <br /> “Rafter Romance” innovation (and its predecessor) is that the two tenants are now a man and a woman who inevitably develop romance. As usual in these Cornball movies, the boy and the girl hate each other until they get into each other's arms. Hoo boy. <br /> <br /> The host in this film is George Sidney, a character who specializes in playing Jewish stereotypes that were supposed to be sympathetic. George Sidney has never been as annoying as the odious Harry Green (the Jewish equivalent of Stepin Fetchita), but the images of the Jewish characters Sidney are still exaggerated and confused from watching. <br /> <br /> The most noticeable thing about “The Shrewd Romance” “This is what, as far as I know, this is the earliest Hollywood film that talks about Hitler and the rise of Nazism. At some point in this film, the homeowner Ecbaum (Sydney) discovers that his teenage son Julius is engaged in small swastikas on the walls. Ecbaum and his son are clearly supposed to be Jews. Admittedly, no one in Hollywood in 1933 had any real idea that Hitler was planning for Jews in Europe ... however, it’s amazing to see a film depicting a Jewish teenager who thinks that swastikas are a joke. His father, quite rightly, outraged by this display of the Nazi symbol. <br /> <br /> A very shameful aspect of Hollywood history is the documented fact that all major Hollywood studios continued to do business with the Third Reich. back in 1939. Hollywood leading women were medically registered as "Aryans" so that their films could be distributed in Nazi Germany and Austria. For the same reason, the leading people of Hollywood were registered as "Aryan and Uncircumcised". With the exception of Darryl Zanuka from Twentieth Century Fox, all Hollywood studio executives who colluded with this policy were Jews ... but clearly did not object to doing business with Hitler. I am surprised that “Rafter Romance” contains a scene depicting the swastika unfavorably, since this sequence would make a Verboten film in Germany and Austria. (The scene may have been cut out for release in German: this is not decisive for the plot of the film.) In addition, there is nothing remarkable about the film. Robert Benchley makes his usual unfunny puzzled characterization: I never understood the attractiveness of this person. I rate 'Rafter Romance' 4 out of 10.
