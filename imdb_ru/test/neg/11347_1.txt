The first season of Kostya takes place in Finland, and I can't believe the nonsense that this show puts on - the characters are small, poorly managed and clumsy. <br /> <br /> This is a CSI for a poor person. Or actually, CSI without a consistent plot. Although Kostya has potential, he fails due to the lack of a director who was unable to extract the essence of the show from the actors. It is actually sad to see the show throwing it all out when it could be a pull-down show, just thinking a little. From the beginning, you feel how awkward it is to play. <br /> <br /> In short, do not waste time on Bones.
