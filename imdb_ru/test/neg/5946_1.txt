Folks! “Comedy” about a man whose parents beg him to kill them, because they become decrepit and want to get rid of suffering. He tries to kill them several times and then changes his mind, saving them from his death traps at the last minute and losing one part of his body each time in the process. It seems the film hates its main character, which makes it even more painful to watch. There is also the usual tied love interest and a predictable end. <br /> <br /> In this film I first saw Tom Selleck without a mustache, and I remember how his shaved upper lip looked weird and strange. the movie.
