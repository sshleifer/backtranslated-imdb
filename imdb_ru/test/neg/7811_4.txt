That was stupid. Kind of like an Adam Sandler movie. <br /> <br /> There were several funny roles, but not very funny ones. <br /> <br /> I liked some of the actors. <br /> <br /> There were some sat. Night Live people in the film. But I would not recommend it if there is nothing better. And it was still better than in any movie Jennifer Lopez.
