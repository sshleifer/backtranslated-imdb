The Lumumba version, dubbed “beyond comprehension,” is a catastrophic reflection of what was once a worthy movie. Some scenes simply do not make sense in English, and the actors lend zero energy to their voice reading. Add self-censorship to yourself with CIA operative Frank Carlucci, and you will have a film devoid of both drama and its power. We hope that the version with subtitles will fall on the screens of American television at some point.
