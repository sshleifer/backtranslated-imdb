I tried to watch this movie, but I did not pass the first 15 minutes. This is a terrible disappointment, given the cast, but I can not forget the fact that the dialogue is conducted in English, and some actors who pretend to be Hindus do not even stand close (read: Christine Kreuk). Given that 1/6 of the world's population lives in India alone and one of the largest film industries, I don’t think that it would be difficult for the filmmakers to find an excellent Indian actress who will play this role. And I say this not because of some kind of blind patriotism, but because it’s absolutely nonsense for non-Indians to play the role of an Indian / Pakistani. Now some people say that "as long as she convinces, who cares?" but my point of view is that she is NOT convincing and can never - not because of her acting skills, but because of her ethnicity. For example, no matter how good the actor Tom Hanks is, he can never play the Australian aborigine! <br /> <br /> But this is still insignificant in relation to the biggest fraud of the filmmakers: to have communication in English. This completely destroys the mood, as well as any semblance of authenticity. If the same film were shot in native languages ​​(Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi) with English subtitles, this could be a great movie. Unfortunately, under the current circumstances, I do not recommend anyone to watch it, except for students who want to study films “What not to do.”
