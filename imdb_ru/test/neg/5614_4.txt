“Kicked in the Head” is all about the character Corrigan, a twenty-year-old man seeking to find himself, and his participation with a bunch of freakish characters. This delicate and ambiguous story written by Corrigan has a “do-it-yourself-how-it-like” feeling and a script that smells like boring indie budget indie. Despite this and some annoying interjections on the Hindenburg stage, the film has an unusual, unusual look of glamor, which can to some extent appeal to people with a similar sense of humor. Not for everyone, not for most, but perhaps fun for someone. (D +)
