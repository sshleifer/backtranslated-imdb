First, the Mexican Werewolf in the name of Texas is misleading, as noted by many others. In fact, it is about El Chupacabra, like a werewolf, but not the same. <br /> <br /> Production and editing just sucks. When it's all over, I probably won't be able to give a very accurate description of exactly how Chupacabra looked, because whenever she was in the scene (despite one or two exceptions), the camera turned all trembling and you could only see monster's face is clear. The special effects were ridiculously bad, but this is to be expected from a horror movie with a low budget. <br /> <br /> Bad actors appear along with a terrible production Now the couple gives fairly believable performances (Eric Fay and Martin Hughes), but there were also bad actors (all others) who seemed to have no emotions when people were dying. Then there is an absolutely awful actor (Sarah Ericson) who gives one of the 2 worst performances I have ever seen in a movie. I mean, my god, she was indescribably bad. <br /> <br /> The plot was very simple. In fact, the Chupacabra is in a small Texas town, killing local residents, and a group of teenagers hope to stop it. Nevertheless, even though the plot was so simple, several holes leaked through it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, horrible movie. However, if you are looking for a film that you can laugh at and laugh with friends one night, that would be nice. My friends and I had a good time watching this. Probably the second worst movie I've ever seen is 1/10. Awful.
