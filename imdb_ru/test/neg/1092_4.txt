My mother did not allow me to watch this movie when I was in the second grade because she said that he was too cruel. Well, years later, and the only reason I remember this film, because of my mom, I didn’t sleep and watched it on PBS. Well, perhaps all these years have led to a great disappointment in this film, but I found it unsuccessful. He didn’t age very well, and it made an actor shaky, huge incredible holes in the script, but there are some cool scenes, such as chasing a car, and a big gun fight. I will no longer sleep on this movie.
