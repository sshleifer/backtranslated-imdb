This is just the worst piece of trash that I have ever experienced displeasure. The story was embarrassingly amateur, the graphics were terrible, and the acting was ... I had never seen the worst acting in my whole life. A kindergarten classroom can come up with a more intimidating, better written and more interesting concept than this one. I feel sorry for all those who spend their time on this film, as well as the actors who agreed to do the work. It was obvious that they were not given appropriate instructions. The screenwriters must have spent time at the film school in the back room, playing pike. Many professors have spent a lot of time on these two. I would be really embarrassed to admit that I knew them.
