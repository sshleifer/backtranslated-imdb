This is a classic type B movie that you wouldnâ€™t want to spend on it. It all started well, and I thought I would grow up like a good thriller, but I was wrong. Throughout the film, you have the feeling that something interesting will happen soon, and it will suddenly turn into a tense thriller, but this does not happen. He runs slowly and peacefully to the end, there is nothing interesting in him. Just the final was unexpected and original, but that's all. Vote: 2.5 out of 10. Oh, one more thing. Why did this movie get an R rating?
