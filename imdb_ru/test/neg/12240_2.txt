“Return” is a parody of inspirational sports films, and let me tell you, this is not a very good option. Tom Brady (director) probably found it funny that links to sports films (from Gridiron Gang, Invincible and even a Miracle! ”To the Longest Yard and Dodgeball-yes Dodgeball!”) And throwing sexy jokes, it would be the funniest thing with Plane! Well, he was wrong. They did such a stupid job, you thought it was written in a week. I found that if the director loves the genre, the film will be good. Obviously, Brady does not like the genre that he forges. This film is a rotten piece of garbage that is not worth watching, so don’t watch it!
