I remember watching this film when I was about 10 years old, one of my friends had it. At that time it was just a movie, I was about 10 years old, and I thought of him as another action movie. <br /> <br /> When I look back, like on the set, this is quite a shocking film. Whoever made this film, I'm sure he had a short Hollywood career. Although the lead actor seems to have made several films on IMDb, although I have not seen one and did not really remember him. <br /> <br /> In any case, just to say that this film is really bad, in all respects it can be. I would like to see it again, though: oD
