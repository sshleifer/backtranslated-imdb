Well, I have to agree with the critics about this, who all said "leave it alone." Why they should have made this rethought "Psycho" in 1960, I do not know. I guess they wanted to attract a new audience and thought that color and modern actors were the answer, as they were major changes. The dialogue was the same as the story. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I greet them for not ending up with profanity and arrogance and making this film dirty. And yet, if they are going to leave everything as it is, why bother if you are not going to improve Tony Perkins, Janet Lee and the original team? <br /> <br /> They sincerely thought that Vince Vaughn was going to be as good or better than Perkins? You are joking? Anne Heche, with her short male haircut, will be better than Lee? I do not think so! <br /> <br /> Yes, the colors here were pretty beautiful, but it was black and white photography that helped make the 1960 version so creepy to begin with. This is perfect for the story, not a bunch of greenery and carnations! Once again, I think that the filmmakers relied on an audience that had never seen the original. <br /> <br /> It was just a stupid project that should never have been off the ground.
