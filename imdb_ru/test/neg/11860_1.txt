There is a difference between “film” and “film”. The film, regardless of quality, is ready for public consumption. The film is what a group of friends gathers together over the weekend with a video camera. During my time as a spectator, I could see examples of both. <br /> <br /> On September 19, I attended the show of “Donnibrook” by writer / director John Satjowski. Now, after reading the script and seeing two different sections (draft and “finished” product) of this work, I can say with confidence that this is a film. And student film. This, due to the lack of a better word, competent, that is, the director knew how to put a record on the camera and capture moving images. The visual effects, for the most part, are static and not impressive, and the dialogue scenes are reduced mainly to long frames, with little or no close up, to allow the audience to establish relationships with the characters. I understand that this is a modest budget film, but some visual talent would be appreciated, and it would greatly contribute to the interests of the audience. <br /> <br /> Of course, there were independent pictures that showed that limited work with the camera could be finished with a well-written, exciting plot and some sharp dialogue. “Sex, Lies, and Videos” by Stephen Soderberg immediately come to mind. This film, however, has neither one nor the other. The main story is weak and unfocused. If the main plot is how Davy tries to build a relationship with his father, then I feel that this film misses the point. From this I understood that the main desire of Davy was “to change the face of rock and roll”. However, we see very little activity on his part to show it. Although at the beginning there is one sequence of dreams and an improvised performance at the end, all we seem to get are scenes where Davy listens to music or accidentally plays the guitar. We are simply told that Davy had played a lot of concerts, but we never see him in full fatal release mode. Next time, SHOW, DON'T TELL THE VIEWERS. Anyone who has passed the creative writing lesson knows this. In addition, Davy is not like someone who would be great in the glam rock era of the 1970s; he looks like he will be more comfortable in the early years of rock and roll, posing as a less talented brother, James Dean. At the same time, the rest of the events in the films seem to happen at random with a pretty cliche, and storylines that have nothing to do with the subtle main story rise and fall with a frightening frequency (that is, the plot involving Father Terry). If I want to see a film with such an unsystematic construction, I’ll think again to see Napoleonic Dynamite, a film that I could hardly make for the first time. <br /> <br /> With regard to the above-mentioned dialogue scenes, I think I should mention that they are few and extremely far from each other. Is it too much to ask for characters who speak? I don't think so. When characters speak, these are short, intermittent sentences; collections of such insightful questions, disgruntled grunts or wild violent flashes. These characters simply do not behave like normal, rational people. Working with such material, it is easy to see why there is only one good performance in the film - Al Hudson, and this is only because he poorly imitates Sam Elliott during his time on the screen. A good director, or at least one who is ready to accept the director's challenge, could detect these problems and force the writer and cameraman to correct them. However, because Sateovsky is so close to the material, he simply does not see them, or, if he does, he does not want to take the necessary steps to correct them, because this will damage his creative vision. Being unable or unwilling to respond constructively to criticism is a sign of a self-satisfied, deceived fool. Just ask Rob Schneider. <br /> <br /> In the end, we remain in a distressed, high-class, terrific “Garden State” by Zach Braff, combined with the equally amazing “Velvet Gold Mine”, with two films, much more worth your time. <br /> <br /> Now, before any of the actors or team chooses the word “work” to take me on a mission for this review, let me suggest it. The best thing I can do is to commend Mr. Satejovsky for deciding to create his own film and present it to the audience. However, the hopes that this film will be shot and spread are merely a deceptive vision of greatness. This is a student film, no more, no less. If the film contains any promise (and let's face it, for the moment, it will not come from acting, writing, or directing), it’s like this: if, if people associated with this film are ready, then, please learn from this film, store it and use the lessons learned from the next attempt; Do not attack your critics, or let a friend or family do it for you. If you can do this, perhaps the next one will be worthy of distribution, worthy of being called a “film.” <br /> <br /> I am your audience and I want to watch.
