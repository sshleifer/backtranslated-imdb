If this is an artistic and essay film, not enough art, not to mention an essay. <br /> <br /> If this is a thriller, then a thriller is not enough. <br /> <br /> If this is a teenage drama thriller, not enough drama, and as for teenagers, NOFX and too many Nino Roth are missing. <br /> <br /> I thought it might be a trailer for the upcoming Tony Hawk film, but Tony Hawk is not there, so I think I’ve been deceived: this is not a biopic of Tony Hawk. <br /> <br /> If it is a fighter, then there are no explosions in it that might interest him, or at least you would have to jump asleep in their chairs. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters seem to be dead inside, but this is not a zombie movie. In fact, if this is a movie, the plot is missing. If it’s not a movie, it’s too long to be a music video. <br /> <br /> If this is a music video, well ... this is an album that I will not buy
