"Three Marionette", perhaps the greatest comedy team in the history of cinema. For this reason alone, they deserved a much better ending in Colombia than they got with this short one. <br /> <br /> “Juicy bullfighters” just don't work. Of course, this is not all Joe Besser’s fault. I personally feel that some of his shorts are funny enough, simply because they contain the usual Stooges fanfare, and also because Larry sometimes show more. However, such a short simply will not work. And the fact that someone knows that this is their last short film that has ever been shown is good, which only adds to the general disgust. <br /> <br /> This film only embodies how short subjects were on their last dying breaths at this time and how little effort went into making them. This short is so sloppy. This is a simple rework of the curly short film “What is the Matador?”, Filmed a few years ago. As if this fact was not bad enough, the studio actually added Moe and Larry footage from the original (which was filmed almost 20 years ago). These things are not obvious? Laughter or sadness? You will be the judge. <br /> <br /> Another part of this short plot, which makes him unhappy, is the fact that this is basically a showcase for Joe Besser, where he shows that everything he is (at least in this film ), is Curly-want-be-gone-completely-so! Moe and Larry can do little in this short film. As a fan of Larry, I also have to say that I am a little ashamed when Besser uses the joke that Larry originally popularized in the short film Ants in the Storeroom. To see how Besser said: “I don’t see, I don’t see!” <br /> <br /> Two brave soldiers who are stuck I say and Fine for all these years so little needs to be done in this short film. There are hardly any funny bits with them. The only thing that fits is Larry, who is hiding under the bed of a jealous husband, trying to become "Pepe", his dog. <br /> <br /> You can't blame the dynamic duet. Larry and Mo give it all. No matter how ridiculous things might be (and I'm sure they had their own opinion by this point in their careers), Howard and Fayn never did anything less than their best. Their efforts do not fade from 1934-1959. <br /> <br /> I often like many shorts that some people think are terrible. I'm all for their more "experimental", unusual shorts. At least those contain new ideas. However, this short, I think everyone can agree, just not good. <br /> <br /> Thank God, the TV later found the boys after the closure of the short section. If they were forced to come out in this way, it would be a serious injustice to all the years they invested in the laughter of the audience.
