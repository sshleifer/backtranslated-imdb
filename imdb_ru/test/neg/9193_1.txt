Wow, thank God, I was on a plane and could look out the window. Bad Hollywood fire scenes, predictable, badly acted (who the hell was that horrible woman who played the wife?), Badly abandoned, badly written. This film, apparently, was created to appeal to the type of people who are ready to kneel before the altar of either firefighters, in particular, “Heroes”, or gods in general, I suppose. I just don’t have enough bad words to say about this movie. It also could not be cheap with all the stars that were in it, plus with all these special effects and scenes of fire. It must have been worth a fortune, but it was still worse than in any movie that I even remember. Funeral scene? Surprisingly bad. To court between the fireman and the aforementioned horrible woman? Roots, contrived, banal. Fire joke? Wouldn't all of us want us to be just as courageous and impolite at the same time?
