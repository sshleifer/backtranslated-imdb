Words cannot describe how stupid, youthful and repetitive this smoking series heap is. He relies on 3 things: 1. Permanent references of the pop culture of the 80s 2. A tired bit of “stretch the joke to awkwardness” and 3. At least 3 or 4 meaningless memories in the episode. The only reason I see this crappy festival is as popular as the constant references to pop culture, which, I suppose, cause "My God, this is from supernaturals! THIS !!" response from the viewer. The letter is lazy, and indulges its viewers, mostly between the ages of 20 to 30 years. Plus there is a character design that seems to consist of the same three characters with the same bored expressions, painted over and over, but with different skin colors and sometimes with a different hairline. Abusive shit.
