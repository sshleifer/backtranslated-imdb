So, as I understand it, this episode is trying to make a statement that the real villains are very bad people, and it is as scary as the paranormal. "Paranormal" images associated with the villain Donny are purely symbolic. In fact, he is an ordinary person. <br /> <br /> The problem is that I just do not buy it. Donnie is just no worse than paranormal. He's not even so scary. As a guy who seems embarrassed and strange, not angry, loves dead girls and hair, and only recently became a murderer, he is much less worried than most well-known real serial killers (for example: he is like a VERY diluted version of Ed Gein) That's why Scully's horror is that he sees only bodies with cropped hair and nails (something not too different from ordinary hygiene), even before anyone was killed or injured at all, completely out of character. She sees things a hundred times worse in almost every other episode and hardly shudders. <br /> <br /> As comic Guy says ... "the worst episode EVER!"
