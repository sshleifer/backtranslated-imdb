My friend and I decided to see this obvious piece of junk solely on the basis of its slogan ?? After almost 30 years of lousy and rudimentary teenage slashers, I can’t believe that only now some clever man with horror-nonsense has come up with a brilliantly ingenious slogan "They took it upon themselves"! In addition, the "Miner Massacre" is as random, annoying and forgettable as everyone else there. Perhaps even more! The script contains all the typical clichés and contains all the terribly stereotypical characters that you want a horrible and painful death. The effects of blood are programmed on the computer and, thus, beyond the deplorable state, and the obligatory "big" stars (Karen Black, John Philip Low and Richard Lynch) completely disappear, despite the fact that they bill. Cursed mines and abandoned ghost towns form the perfect horror setting ?? Did the creators of "My Bloody Valentine" understand this in the early 80s ?? but his boring film simply has no innovative ideas or even remotely surprising elements to offer. A bunch of greedy twenty-something losers who call themselves friends, although they obviously cannot tolerate each other, desecrate an ancient mine in search of gold that is supposedly hidden there. Of course, they unknowingly resurrect a zombie miner in this way, and he has only 150 years of rest to prepare for a mass slaughter among teenagers. Hooray! The cast is extremely annoying in this. All girls have impressive racks, but they refuse to show anything. Instead, they all prefer endless nagging and taking unnecessary risks. Stupid guys obviously just serve as screen fillings. In her five minutes of play, Karen Black still manages to fool herself completely by portraying the most prototypical and hysterical local walnut woman. A zombie has a stupid and very unconvincing face, but he looks good and threatening enough when he is shown in the distant shadow of moonlight while he swings around his pickaxe. Because the best thing about the Miner's Slaughter is the above-mentioned slogan, and you can read it on the box in the video store itself, there is very little to recommend here. Directed by John Karl Büchler scored a few modest hits in the eighties, in particular, the original "Troll" and the fair continuation of "Friday the 13th," but now, obviously, it's time to retire.
