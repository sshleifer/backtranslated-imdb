Cronica de un desayuno combines the worst shortcomings of Mexican cinema - a rare feat in our time. <br /> <br /> This is pretentious: we want us to believe that it is deep, only because one scene is out of focus, another is pseudo-surrealistic, another plays with the Eisenstein-Infante-Kaifan tradition to laugh-cry , the publication is fragmented, and it's all so solemn. <br /> <br /> He has a weak scenario: the main story is unlikely to develop, so there are three other more unnecessary stories in it. They are good only to make the film last longer. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting is bad. This feat, given that many of the most famous Mexican actors have been cast. <br /> <br /> There is an abuse of profanity. To such an extent that the character of Paloma, who symbolizes the dreams of the freedom of the child, uses it through and through. <br /> <br /> This is homophobic. The character played by Eduardo Palomo is the most creepy and most punished transsexual performance I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This is very boring. I ended up jealous of people who left the theater before the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Whatever he tried, it was done better in Mexico and elsewhere. <br /> <br /> In other words: "Para partirte la madre, nada como una mala pelikula"
