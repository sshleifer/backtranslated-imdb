First, I admit that I did not see Vampires: Los Muertos, but I saw the original Vampires film and I like it. I made this film without hearing anything about it. I did not expect to be impressed. I was not. <br /> <br /> I like the idea of ​​moving the action to the Far East, which was supposed to open up many new possibilities for action sequences, as well as the storyline, but it wasn’t enough made of it. Scenes of fighting and chasing motorbikes were painfully boring. <br /> <br /> There were several roles that I liked, for example, the killer team was not shown in the role of heroically good guys, as in the first film. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that since a few years ago I had watched Hammer’s old film “The Legend of 7 Golden Vampires”, someone would ever make another good Asian film about vampires. This was not the case.
