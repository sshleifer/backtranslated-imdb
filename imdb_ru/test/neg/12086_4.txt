Despite the strong speeches of Minnie Driver and Tom Wilkinson, this film cannot spark the viewer's imagination. <br /> <br /> By the way, what happened to Mrs. Driver? She had such potential in the film industry. <br /> <br /> For me, it was almost like a version of the Yentl of the 1850s without musical fanfare. After the death of his father, the Driver becomes a governess in a Christian family, hiding his Jewish identity. <br /> <br /> Although I understand that this is a peaceful period, it was terribly boring even for England in 1850 and Scotland. <br /> <br /> The owner of the house is most annoyed by her voice from this song. I expected that she would call the driver at any time. What is the name of Mary Blackchurch? I know that the Driver is trying to impersonate a Christian, but does this name completely mean? <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Mary finds love with the father of the young defendant (Wilkinson) and his emotionally unbalanced son. <br /> <br /> In the end, the only thing we see accomplished is that Mary found a profession for photographing her family. Do we really have to undergo what happened throughout the entire film? <br /> <br /> The early scenes of Judaism practiced in 19th century England and the cholera epidemic at the end might have been reinforced. There is a certain sense of anti-Semitism on the part of the Wilkinson family, but this is never allowed.
