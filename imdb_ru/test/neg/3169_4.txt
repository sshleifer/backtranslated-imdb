Although Stephen Gyllenhaal is a good television director, and his credit for this is only a few good ones, Homebrew is just a mess in his script and direction. Despite the performances of Billy Bob Torton, John Lithgow, Kelly Lynch, John Bon Jovi, Jamie Lee Curtis and Ted Danson, this cast was unable to save the film. <br /> <br /> Gillenhaalix will know that Jake and Maggie are in the film, but you donâ€™t see Jake very well, and Maggie is present in him only for 30 seconds as a nanny telling the character of Lithgow about the bust. This is not even a comedy about the pot, as expected. It just wasn't funny.
