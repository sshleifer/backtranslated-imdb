The dishonesty and the atmosphere in this film, but unfortunately, the imprint I just watched. Raymond Massey provides the laid-back Sherlock Holmes, almost comically in the early scenes, in his dressing gown, which he changes to a worker's clothes to explore Dr. Rillotte’s creepy mansion (Lin Harding). It is not clear to me why Rilott would like his stepdaughters to die. If, as in the case of Helen (Angela Baddeley), he did not want her to run away to get married, he would have achieved the same by sending her. <br /> <br /> Other curiosities also abound. After setting an early wedding date with Elena, the bride is no longer heard for the rest of the picture. The presence of a group of gypsies at the time of Violet Stoner’s death is simply a diversion, and what could be an interesting murder weapon, a poisonous snake, is diluted by the fact that it was not a cobra, but musical images Despite the fact that it is an Indian servant. <br /> <br /> Aetol Stewart competently portrayed Holmes's assistant Dr. Watson, although he needs to get used to if Nigel Bruce is more suited to your cup of tea. Like Rilotte, Lin Harding is quite menacing, this trait would be useful as the sworn enemy of Holmes Moriarty in two later films - The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes, 1935, and The Murder in The Baskervilles, 1937. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, with repeated variability and an unstable camera, the plotline is no more destroyed than it is. Its integrity is usually maintained, even if stretched a little to fill in the gaps. I guess this will be my main complaint about the film, as the mental overcoming of some of the jumps in the picture turned out to be a real pain in the ass.
