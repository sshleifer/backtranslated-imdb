Character Michael Kane has problems. He is a simple, short-sighted, insecure man of about forty. He is married, but his wife seems to no longer love him. He has a bad relationship with his only daughter. But his most pressing problem is that the stunningly beautiful young woman played by Michelle Johnson pursues him too hotly, kisses him, gropes and tries to start sex at every opportunity. What do the poor fellow? <br /> <br /> This film should be taken out of the “Comedy” section and placed in the “Science fiction” section. Only the intergalactic brain chip can explain the actions of the character Michelle Johnson. Let's see - 3 billion men in the world - she can choose for herself - she comes with an awkward, aging loser. This goes beyond the middle-aged masculine fantasy and turns into something so delusional that you just hope that all participants voluntarily went to therapy. <br /> <br /> There is nothing funny about it. There are a few quick attempts at wit from Kane, who seems to often play Hawk Pier more than a new character. Joseph Bologna is like nails on a board. Michelle Johnson is not an actress - she has one crying scene that will not pass by the school play - but she is beautiful and takes off her clothes. So buy a DVD, go to scenes 4 and 9 and forget about everything else.
