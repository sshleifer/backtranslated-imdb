I felt that the two hours I spent on watching this film might have been better served if I went to the local used book store and searched for old fashion magazines and Halston advertisements. Or, perhaps, watching dried paint. These two classes, at least, would have attracted me a little more than the “Song of India”. The most disappointing moment in this was that I could see what moods / atmospheres they were trying to create, and the idea of ​​them could be interesting if they were more specific. Instead, there was a presentation of an incoherent, stupid chain of events in which the same scenes were paraphrased over and over again to give meaning to our feelings. <br /> <br /> I didn’t want to devote more time to this film by writing any review, except perhaps to warn other people against this waste of time.
