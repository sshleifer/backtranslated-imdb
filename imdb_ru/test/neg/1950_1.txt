I noticed that this film has appeared frequently on Cinemax lately, so this morning I decided to watch it. I just finished Infiltrator, a great movie, and I thought it looked good too. From the description, the cable was at least. This movie was terrible. It is slow, the rhythm is terrible, it seems that it lasts 4 hours. There is no real conspiracy to talk about ... ah! How can you say something good about this movie. Rickman is good ... but he is always like this ... the other two characters work well, but there is no real story to support them. After 2 hours, and you sit there, wondering what is happening on the ground, where there is a plot on earth - this ends in surprise, which, frankly, just made me sick. Do not worry about that.
