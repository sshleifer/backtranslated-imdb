When all we have is pretty much a reality show with people who for some reason make themselves fools, are too fat, can't sing or cook, damn it, I know that original ideas ran out of Hollywood. I cannot remember the time when something original or clever appeared on television over the past 15 years. What is our obsession watching the bums fooling themselves? I would think that programs of this type would go around, but each year they come up with something new, more strange than the previous one. So people need to lose weight in this ... most Americans need to lose weight. I just think that we all like to watch the humiliated people to some extent. Maybe it makes us feel better when we see someone who looks like a jerk. I don’t know, but I just want something clever that doesn’t offend your mind.
