Joe D'Amato could make some other famous films, his very long and very prolific career- prolific, of course, take turns making very cheap Z-class films into a big exploitation of the Italian boom in the late 70s and early 70s- but Pornofoil one of them, or at least should not be. Of course, I didn’t expect much from a film with such a title, but I thought, considering the flip side of the box description, that there might be funny horror scenes with “horny, mutant, zombie-man-eater”. It turns out that zombies appear only in the middle of the film, and at every turn, instead, we get a merciless sex scene as hardcore as one can imagine. What well. But this is not very pleasant, except for the fact that “damn this BS”. There is a ridiculous dialogue, in which lobsters cost more from Japan by mail than in Paris, hot, slender women play biologists and zoologists who have special sexual connections (allowing you to open the door to be raped, and a bipolar kind of pleasure out of the house ). gangster grouping). <br /> <br /> All this leads to the island, where the “main attraction” is the guy who spends the time quite miserably (forgetting the funny) the amount of time, just staring at the new arrivals at the radioactive wasteland of the Caribbean island, and once discovered , there is a face that looks like one of the guards at the Jabba Palace, and sweet potatoes for the main genitals. But much dumber than anything before this “relationship” that develops between a monster and a dark-skinned woman who has too much time to escape, but just sits there with an empty face, as the monster brings presents and for what should Being the motive of racially motivated exploitation on the part of the filmmakers, the monster will rape and kill white women, not hers. And this ends, of course, with a “happy” end. I use quotes, of course, from a kind of shock that this can lead to any legitimate ending altogether. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this is NOT what you would expect, because perhaps this is a bloody horror movie with a lot of sticky, but cool looking Italian zombie monsters devouring human flesh. If anything that violence in the film is done on shoelace; hit logs in the face immediately leads to bloody consequences, as if someone hit a tomato. So, in fact, the last part of the name is intended more for the market. However, even in porn, she has little to go on, except as a reason for the actors and the film crew to get paid leave on the Caribbean (in an interview, George Eastman says that this is only one of several hack work done while on the island ). He has a shot by a penny operator and similar actors filled with genitals about 3/4 of the time and terrible lip-sync and music like Nino Rota forced to do something sharp in a brothel at gunpoint, and this is STILL a piece of celluloid dung anyway ; All this can be a tremendous sense of guilt, but it is not.
