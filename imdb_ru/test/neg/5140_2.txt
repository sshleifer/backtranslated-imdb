Like the previous poster, I'm from northern Vermont, and I liked this movie. However, since the time of the “Red Zone of Cuba” I have not seen such a complicated plot. People’s bootleg stuff doesn't make sense. Two gangster oars across the border send a second car by car. Hmm, why? Then they meet the other two and go at night to the shelter of the bad guy in a luxurious packard. “Did two people in the flatbed truck no longer make sense?” Then, four cars, parked near the garage in which the target moonshine is located, fall asleep! When they wake up in the morning and begin to pull out the whiskey, they are, of course, noticed and shot, while losing part of their precious cargo. Then two smugglers put whiskey into the boat and sailed over the border. Again why? I was told by someone whose great uncle actually smuggled into the area, and all that was needed was to drive a vehicle that could outrun the Canadian Border Patrol, which then had a small part of the resources it currently has. <br /> <br /> And don't make me start the last half hour, which made no sense. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can say about the film is that Chris Christofferson has actually grown charisma over the years.
