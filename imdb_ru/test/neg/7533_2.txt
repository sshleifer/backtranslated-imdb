Since Pep Squad scores an average of 4.7 points on IMDb.com, it's no surprise that Steve Balderson slanders this site so much. But the fact is that Pep Squad is a badly thought-out “black” “comedy” (both words in quotes are not without reason). This is a film full of excessive action (Cherry, Mother Beth), combined with a couple of lethargic performances (Beth and boyfriend Julie). A film where you can track cars from twenty feet in a bright red jeep and never be seen. A film full of not very appetizing pictures of splitting and naked bodies that make you think: “Does the director think that this is funny? Or clever? ”Moreover, the characters are so thin and poorly developed that the film becomes completely unpredictable, but probably not on purpose. Pep Squad cannot decide whether there will be comedy, or drama, or satire (patriotic music, I understand ...). The film can not be serious, because the idea of ​​killing for any school position (whether it be the Queen of the prom) turns into a frenzy (not to mention the shots of burning flags and shooting the car, a bad attempt to argue and annoy a comedy, for all violent and clumsy jokes (a big applied mother, a “funky” black director and excessive swearing, poorly staged by the main actor). Watching the documentary “Wamego: Making Movies Anywhere” only made this film more worthy, with praise that was praised by ... the director and the director's father ... hmmmmm. Not a black comedy or something like that. I think Kansas will have to wait.
