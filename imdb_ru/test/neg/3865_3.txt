It was such a terrible film, an almost comedic sketch of a film noir. The budget was low compared to the blockbuster, but still higher than most. But where they decided to cut costs, it is completely strange. Some actors are the least competent, while others look as if they have just been dragged from the street. One of them is the lead actor, he is so bad that I cringed when he said something (he speaks through the ALL movie). Then there is the weird choice of costume. . At the beginning of the film, all the characters are dressed in the clothes of the 1930s. They drive classic cars, but in the background is a modern wind power plant that clearly corresponds to the modern level. And the costumes and some settings continue to follow this theme of the film noir of the 30s. Then BAM leads a brand new escalade with 24 inch rims ... WTF. Once again, when a guy has a sight on his rifle, you get a sight. He is aiming at a guy with mp5 and a tactical transmission in even stranger contrast, the places are brilliant, and it seems We are more expensive than the rest of the movie. The camera takes very good pictures and shows these places superbly in the frame. The director keeps a sharp eye on a good looking single shot, but does not know how to do much more. . <br /> <br /> People who should be shot for this movie ▼ <br /> <br /> Scriptwriter Director-casting Costume Designer <br /> <br /> People who should be tortured to death for their monotony, monotonous nails on the voice of the blackboard. ▼ <br /> <br /> Anton Pardo - lead actor, writer, producer. If you have ever seen the movie "Hostel", I would like it to happen to this guy, but he does not run away
