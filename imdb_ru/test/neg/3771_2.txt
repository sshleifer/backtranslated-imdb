This overheated South Gothic “mellerdramer” has a few decent moments - but too often it is the beginner’s director who spoils the cliché and the star, who obviously decided to take it upon himself to spoil him to turn the picture into his personal showcase, not allowing writer / director Gabel to update Inge or Williams as a kind of contemporary "The Midnight Cowboy" meets the tear "Lolita." <br /> <br /> Close your eyes, listen to exaggerated southern accents and try to decide if you are watching a feature film or acting class - full of lovers. <br /> <br /> Johansson is tolerant this time (that is, less puffy than usual) - although by no means good, Maht is a decent, although too cute boy to believe, and Travolta is chewing on landscapes like never before ( with the help of a decent editor and some director's restraint, his performance could be truly touching; however, he - and almost all the others - is too unpleasant to ever move us from the place of boredom or disgust). Kara Unger is perhaps the best; if her role had evolved over several lines, she might even be in the nomination “Best Supporting Actress”. <br /> <br /> Rice is almost saved thanks to Leonard Cohen’s snarling theme, decent design and locations, as well as constant references to literary works (which also received other standard scripts reviews, such as “poetic”). useful are some old-fashioned professional actors, such as Sonny Schroyer, and, perhaps most importantly, Soderberg’s Elliot Davis, whose excellent work will no doubt be attributed to a novice director who, in ten or twenty years, can actually learn to lead. <br /> <br /> But probably not.
