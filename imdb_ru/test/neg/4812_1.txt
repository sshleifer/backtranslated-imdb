What for? What for? Why on earth would anyone tell the truth about this horrible, HORRIBLE film? I still wake up in the morning and ask God why He did not prevent me from seeing this disgusting "comedy." I can't believe I paid to see this insult for my cinematic taste. I begin to think that he has 5 stars because of nakedness Mart Higaged “s and all people who cannot buy a porn movie and not see ... I will call it a“ thing ”the reason they call this film is an insult to the Mexican film industry. The characters are a huge cliché, the acting is causing involuntary laughter, and the script ... well, I can't believe it was written by a man. And just when you thought you had been tortured enough ... the last half hour was so painful that I wanted to snatch my eyes. The only thing I can say about this abomination is that it lasts only 90 minutes (it will be like a century, but still). Indeed, AVOID PAIN !!!
