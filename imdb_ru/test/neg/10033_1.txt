Thank God, I did not buy this film myself! I borrowed it from a friend who bought it out of pure curiosity and, of course, after watching, I feel that they should be repaid! This is supposed to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I really understand that they could not have a lot of budget, but I swear I could make a better film than this by looking at my pets! The game was terrible, like editing, dialogue, EVERYTHING! It was so bad that it really pissed me off when I watched it! I look forward to a REAL film about this story coming soon, so that curious people should not stoop to watch this joke!
