Schoolchildren are pointless ... Go to the Gold Coast, get drunk and have sex. Maybe ambitions, but not very intelligent. The plot is simple: a few sentences assigned to each character, and no one helps the cliches highlighted here. <br /> <br /> Something that could help is casting. Everyone looks too old. These characters seem to be innocent and begin hesitant steps toward adulthood, but they all look too old to be believable in this role. <br /> <br />
