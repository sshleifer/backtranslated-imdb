spoilers <br /> <br /> This movie does not contain action; it is slow and boring. It is not funny and not interesting, it is predictable and plays on cheap sentimentality and vague patriotism. Special effects are not creative or impressive. They are noisy and not inspired. <br /> <br /> Acting talent is wasted on hopelessly stupid single-row cliches and clichés. They are worn by characters who should be called "gentle giant black man", "eccentric genius who is about to break up", "a square-jawed hero coming of age", "a cowardly coward", "an unhappy player who lives by a code of honor, “Impulsive princess”, etc. <br /> <br /> And I write! How many non-dramatic readings did they think they could fit into this thing? Is the scene in which people have to defuse bombs, cutting one wire or another like an invention? The drama of the last 15 minutes of the film depends on the care of the audience, whether some idiot can put aside his personal differences with Ben Affleck and say goodbye to Liv Tyler in time to SAVE THE EARTH. All work is done; we just need to wait another couple of seconds until Harry Stamper, the moron, drops a few cotton candies. I know that Bruce Willis is usually a charismatic guy, but his character Harry Stamper is a disgusting bore. I thought he received Golden Razmi, which he was awarded for this role. <br /> <br /> Since the film is very long, the plot is so obvious, and the dialogue is one-time, it is impossible not to notice gross inaccuracies, inconsistencies and plot holes. 800 feet in something TX smaller than a shot. Try to walk 800 feet to TX and see how close you are to the center. After all the discussions about artificial gravity at the Russian station, it seems random inside. In fact, gravity comes and goes throughout the entire movie. Does it make any sense that someone other than Michael Bay will give these morons a pair of space shuttles and send them to blow up an asteroid that threatens the earth? <br /> <br /> Sentimental montages in the commercial style of a telephone / insurance / cola were disgusting. <br /> <br /> I like action movies. Indeed. This boring, stupid and really stuck on yourself. It deserves hate and contempt, because this is all that the most expensive Hollywood efforts have become - a bunch of cheap cliches running from one expensive explosion to another. Oh yes, all this is permeated by the Neanderthal conservative view of sex, politics, and so on.
