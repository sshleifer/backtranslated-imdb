More terrible than any horror movie ever created, because you control this bloody feast that makes it more frightening than watching how other people do it on the big screen or on the TV screen. This game has two CDs that make the game much more interesting. <br /> <br /> Each disc contains its own character with a completely different storyline, which makes the game much more fun. I recommend that you buy this game and the first game (not as good as this game, but still fun) <br /> <br /> **** <br /> <br />
