I really saw EVIL on the big screen. I saw it as part of a double function in the early 1980s (I donâ€™t remember another movie) when I was in my teens. The film is bad, bad. Embarrassingly bad. The effects are terrible (you can clearly see the cable pulling the black girl across the floor). There is nothing wrong with that. In fact, I laughed throughout the film. <br /> <br /> History tried to create this great event, created for the climax, when we should finally see who is responsible for all the evil deeds, and we see fat Victor. Buono, who is as scary as a stuffed Twinky. Seriously, what are they thinking about? Buono, who was a villain in the Batman series, is one of the most disgusting actors who ever caught the big screen, and I just can't imagine anyone being so scared by them. <br /> <br /> EVIL is almost forgotten now (for good reason), but it's actually a very funny movie, and I wish I could see this turkey again just to see how a black girl is being dragged around the room invisible force through this highly visible cable.
