The concept is excellent. Performance characterizes the overall quality of the ABC network. <br /> <br /> Aside from Peter Jones, the rest of the panel seems to consist of marketing managers. not real entrepreneurs. <br /> <br /> When I realized that Peter Jones was going along with Simon Cowell, I had thoughts that he would take America by the balls. But it seems that ABC came and destroyed this concept. <br /> <br /> I was an absolute dragons lair addict in the UK, and I was interested to know that Peter Jones was manipulating a concept that originated in Japan and developed his own state show. The result is not inspiring and not informative. <br /> <br /> If you lack drama in life, do you have a choice? Jerry Springer or American inventor. Summarizing, we can say that the struggling musician sells a media tycoon. <br /> <br /> Idea: understand me! And I will do a show worthy of the name.
