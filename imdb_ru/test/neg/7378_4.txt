First of all, I am in the USA. <br /> <br /> When I first saw this, I thought that this was an obvious - and disgusting - breakdown of the "Office" (United Kingdom). I would award him with zero stars in this way, but, oh, a miracle, it came out long before the Ricky Gervais series. <br /> <br /> However, it is difficult to watch this or any other show with similar dynamics (including the American "Office") without comparison. It is not even close to being the same. <br /> <br /> I pay tribute to him for originality and ahead of his time. I will also say that this - and the "Office" of the USA and "Larry Sanders" - are actual satires. The “office” in the UK is something more grandiose and transcendent, as if it were filled with real people in events that felt that they really happened. However, unlike Christopher Guest’s shrill “mockery”, in fact it’s not satire, while the Newsroom is definitely. <br /> <br /> Be that as it may, the Newsroom is still very funny. It’s alienated and self-conscious, but with actors and a team not smart enough or talented enough to lift the load. This is a heavy comedy, which is carried on weak shoulders. Commendable, but ultimately discouraged. <br /> <br /> --- And what about the lack of anamorphic DVD ?! I know it was filmed in an anamorphic widescreen because I saw a pilot episode on one of our HD channels. CBC, get with the program. ; )
