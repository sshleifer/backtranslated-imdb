Robber film with Jean Reno, Matt Damon and Laurence Fishburne ... sounds great on paper? I suspect that this was supposed to happen when someone green lit up the production of this film, but the final product is terrible! <br /> <br /> The story is a boring, boring action, and for a film that only takes 88 minutes, it seems just to drag on. I felt that my life was slipping away, and I was sure that there was something better that I had to do ... any paint to dry somewhere, maybe? <br /> <br /> Sigh. I'm a big fan of Jean Reno, but what was he thinking about when he signed up for it? There are so many other great action movies around ... go see one of them and let this film be forgotten best of all.
