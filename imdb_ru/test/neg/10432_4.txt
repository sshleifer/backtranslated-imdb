I saw it on a DVD a couple of months before it was released. <br /> <br /> I liked the main characters and the overall story, but some scenes are rather sloppy and confusing. The sets were suitable, but some just looked like remnants of Freaks & Geeks or reminded me of a mobile phone commercial for a middle-class house. Definitely not what the DVD cover says: “Intended to be the next classic model,” hardly. <br /> <br /> Wardrobe and hairstyles are made well, and yes, there are really beautiful girls in it who are always pleased to see a good looking cast. <br /> <br /> Almost every scene contained a guitar that just buzzed and turned on. The sound design was a bit bad. I think less would be better.
