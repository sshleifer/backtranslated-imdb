I really want to believe that the above quote (in particular, the translation of English subtitles), which was actually written, not uttered, in a letter of refusal, which the publisher sends to the main character, was intended for self-reference in the language-check style. But if so, the director Leos Carax clearly forgot to inform the actors about the true nature of the film. All of them are so terribly serious in their images that I must conclude that Carax really takes himself seriously here, otherwise he so despises everyone, especially the audience, that he cannot be bothered to let someone in on a joke. br /> <br /> Some authors can get away with creating oblique, bizarre films because they do this with Alan and their unique personal style (for example, David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky). Others use a more subtle approach, at the same time weaving surrealistic elements into the fabric of history (for example, Krzysztof Kislowski and the later, less fanciful works of David Cronenberg). In Paula X, Carax casts a random mess into the viewer, and then dares to find a mistake in it. Well, here it is: a rhythmic and unstable distribution, in particular, of succession is often bypassed; abundant characters abound (for example, Gypsy and child); most performances are overwhelmed; the coverage is often poor, especially in the often-discussed sex scene; unrelated scenes are inserted into the film for no apparent reason; and the list goes on. <br /> <br /> In order not to be completely negative, it should be noted that there were some encouraging exceptions. I liked the musical score, even the cacophonous industrial techno music played in the vast abandoned complex, to which the main characters retreat in the second half of the film (perhaps a reference to Andy Warhol's “Factory” of the 1960s?) beautiful, obvious attempt to contrast with dirty city settings. And even in adulthood, Catherine Deneuve shows that she still has “this.” Her performance was also the only one among the main characters who did not faint. <br /> <br /> In earlier times, I considered such films of “Paul X” more gently. Experiments are admirable, even if the experiment does not work. But Carax is not trying anything new here; the film is a mixture of elements borrowed from countless earlier films, and after several decades of watching films and literally thousands of films later, I simply no longer have the patience for such an unoriginal, ill-conceived trip. At this early moment in the 21st century, the question remains: with the exception of Jean-Pierre Jonet, are there any directors in France who know how to make films to watch? Rating: 3/10.
