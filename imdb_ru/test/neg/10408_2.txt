Whoever thinks of continuing the Iron Eagle must be shot dead. In this case, once was enough. Iron Eagle was a good movie to watch. Even if it is unreal, it is still interesting. Iron Eagle II has a meaningless plot and can be used as a cure for insomnia. I didn’t even bother to watch the Iron Eagle III, but, looking at the R rating, I assume that it is more violent than the previous 2 films. Well, the Iron Eagle IV is probably the most pointless sequel. Lou Gossett Jr returns as always delightful "Chappy" Sinclair. Another Jason returns to play the role of Doug the Master (Canadian Jason Cadier, who looks just like Jason Gedrick from the first Iron Eagle). But wait (this is a possible spoiler) ..... Wasn’t Doug killed in Iron Eagle II? The authors must have despaired of the story, so they revived Doug the Master, saying that he was a prisoner of the Russians. This film was the cheapest of all the films about the Iron Eagle. Why do filmmakers consider it necessary to continue unattractive films? (eg. Police Academy films). I always liked the work of Gossett Jr. in these films. He was the only one holding this turkey together. Let's hope that this was the last sequel to the Iron Eagle. let it rest in peace.
