This stupid film will never see the light. Action is lame, violence is everywhere, the end of meanness is just stupid. <br /> <br /> It is all about the lawyer who saw the murder committed by RISS. National team. No one has ever seen him, even the killers themselves. Thus, he and a beautiful woman on the run, trying to find the leader of this R.I.C.C.O. squad before they find them. <br /> <br /> Then in the film begins the romance, shooting with a gun and voodoo. Now, how the hell did Voodoo come in this. Never watch this movie if your life depends on it. Trust me!!!!!!!!
