A real yawn and a bad movie even for the Chan series. I like a good movie about Charlie Chan or even quite a good one, but this film is far from the goal. Charlie is enlisted to help figure out the murder of a scientist working for our government when someone in the house stole plans for another power. The mystery is very pedestrian, and acting is not much better. The only saving grace for me in the film was the presence of Mantan Morland as Birmingham Brown. He gives the film a small comedy and a few good, scared faces, but after that the choice is rather meager. Benson Fong is in the role of Tommy Chan and is connected to Chan's daughter. What about Sydney Toler? He's pretty decent, but he looks like he is trying to carry a movie. Most of all I noticed how the movie was shot. Chan director Phil Rosen, who usually likes me in most of his works, uses a lot of long shots without any actions (for example, Charlie's initial walk to the house outside). What for? The film lasts only 64 minutes to cry out loud! These shots tell me that the director had to fill the time, because the script was even weaker than he was used to. This is probably not the worst movie ever made by Chan, but still it is the worst movie I have experienced, unfortunately.
