My God ... to think that I saw it all ... Danny Thomas looks completely out of place in this confusion. He seems really uncomfortable. He cannot sing, it would be worth licking, and when he is paired with Peggy Lee (Peggy Lee?), She is easy ... EASILY walks around him! Maybe the director saw it and made him do really bad comedy programs, which he sometimes does in the film. Peggy Lee is fine, but it all collapsed. Maybe good for a laugh.
