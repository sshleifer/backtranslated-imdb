I really like science fiction movies of the 50s. I like really good ones (such as “The day when the Earth stopped,” “When worlds collide,” “Invasion of body thieves,” and many others), and sometimes really bad ones, because they can be really funny and wonderful to see with friends (such as Plan 9 from space). However, if a science fiction film is bad, but not so bad as to be fun, it really should be avoided. This movie is just such a movie. Posters give the impression that some kind of sexual beast attacks humanity, while the real plot is much less interesting. A woman is married to a womanizer. She is infected and begins to grow to HUGE size and decides to hunt down this worm and kick its tail, and that’s it. In addition, many of the special effects really stink - especially the giant papier-mâché hand that enters the room to grab an evil husband.
