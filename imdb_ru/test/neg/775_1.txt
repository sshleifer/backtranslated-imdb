This is absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen. In fact, it is so bad that I plan to rent it again as soon as I can find it. This film makes “Plan 9 from Space” look like an Oscar. Just looking at the actors, I want to laugh out loud. I can't say enough bad words about this movie. It is awful, approaching perfection. <br /> <br /> The plot is based on a terrorist attack using nuclear weapons in San Francisco (I think). This is as far as I can go ... I'm laughing too hard. I know it should not be funny, but ..... * LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL * <br /> <br /> MOVE OVER THE ED EDGE !!!
