I found that the first 90 minutes of this film were very interesting, although some of its parts were funny (i.e., the character of Philip Seymour Hoffman). The last 60 minutes were unpleasant, and I began to lose interest in the film. It seemed the last hour lasted forever. <br /> <br /> The film was well shot, and I understand why Renee Zellweger won the Academy Award because her character was so interesting. The film is also beautifully shot, and the story is emotional. However, I found the message to be bad: no wonder that these days are in Hollywood. In this story, Inman (Jude Law) leaves the Confederation army during the civil war. His reason: his girlfriend misses him and wants him home. He also became disillusioned with the war. (Can you imagine if every soldier who was in a similar boat threw an army in two world wars ??!) <br /> <br /> And yet in this film all this is quite acceptable. On the other hand, did the liberal filmmaker ever enjoy talking about the US military? To add to their left deviation, they depict a detachment similar to warriors, pursuing deserters as cold-blooded sick murderers. Well, in the world of films, as we know, the good is portrayed as bad and the bad is good ... and only the liberals portray deserters as heroes.
