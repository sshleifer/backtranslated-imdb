I could not watch more than 10 minutes of this film. He set the standard. I will never give film 1 again, if it isnâ€™t as terrible as this one. I totally agree with other comments about this movie. But, since I am Dutch, I watched it with a Dutch translation. Apparently, they did not have the money for the correct translation, so they decided to fry it. Sometimes you get funny results. <br /> <br /> Do not smoke, do not drink, do not take drugs, do not watch "Summer of Demons". <br /> <br /> I was surprised that the actors (Wow, I can't believe I just said that.) Did not hold the script (was he?) in his hands while shooting. I think they also did a good job on ... Well ... Hmm ... No, they didn't do a good job at all.
