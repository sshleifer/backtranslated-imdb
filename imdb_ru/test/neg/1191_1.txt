Do I think that I went to see the same film as everyone else ... this film was terrible. I am a fan of all 3 series of the League of Gentelmen and always respected the originality of the writers, even when the format changed in the 3rd series. However, this film was a brazen half-effort, the plot was very bad with the characters. Going out into the real world, the film became more like the hero of the last action. There were about 5 moments in the film that mixed up, but the rest of the time I wanted it to end. It would be better if the 10-minute short film on DVD ... it was rather an explanation of what they planned to do, and it looked like some of the authors did not agree with the characters' fate, and they joked about it to kill him for 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> If you are a real fan of the league of gentlemen, to be aware of, you will hate this film. If you only watch it because there was nothing better on TV, you will like it. <br /> <br /> Someone will support me !!
