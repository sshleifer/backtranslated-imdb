Tom Stern and Jeremy Slate plan a swing bachelor to seize a casino called Ocean 11 and attach it to Hell's Angels. Bad move. For the film with the words "Hell's Angels" AND No. 69 And with the image of the real "Hell's Angels" this film is surprisingly boring. Hell's Angels really deserve a better film to be centered around them. Not this snoorefest. Fortunately, this is one of the DVDs with a Joe Bob Briggs commentary, so the pain of having to watch it is much easier. If you see it differently, let me recommend something to you. DO NOT !! <br /> <br /> My rating: D <br /> <br /> More info on DVD: comment by Joe Bob Brigg; Connie Van Dyke's message to his fans (she has more than one?); Photo Gallery; Theater trailer; and trailers for Bloody Hut, High Hell, Samurai Cop and Hollywood Strangler
