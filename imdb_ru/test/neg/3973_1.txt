Parts: The horror of Clonus is horror. There is, of course, the bad fashion of the late 70s. There is a really bad game from Dick Sargent to Peter Graves. And then there are the clones themselves. Their days mainly consist of running, jumping, cycling and fighting with each other. When they do not, they learn about America. Not the band America, or the Neil Diamond song, but America, where they become part of a great society. But they are given some kind of strange medicine, then all the fluids from their body are drained from them (General Ripper was right!), And they are placed in the freezer and wait for Thanksgiving Day or Christmas, when they are defrosted and fried at about 450 degrees. Unfortunately, this is not what is happening, but it would be much more interesting than what is shown. Mario, from the fame of the Super Mario brothers, makes a wonderful cameo like a doctor who spar with Dick Sargent.
