John Stewart (aka John Libovitz) constantly breaks conservatism and anything republican. This liberal comic is nothing more than the fact that he pours out his "humor" into the throat of impressionable youth. I watched the show when I was stuck in the waiting room while my car was being repaired, and this guy borders on cheating. He will take the side of al-Quida over Bush any day. He is shameless, and everything he says is accentuated on a false laugh. I remember four years ago when he “interviewed” John Kerry. The two faces looked at each other, which seemed to impede a make-up session. It was like "Get a room guys." I just do not like the little grins traitors who sell their propaganda. Call me fine. The daily show was long, and there are many like-minded liberals who are seething with hatred of Republicans and conservatism. I'm not surprised by his success, but do so many people watch Comedy Central? This guy from Mancia makes me lousy.
