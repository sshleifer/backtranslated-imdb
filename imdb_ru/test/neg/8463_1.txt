Five fingers are so bad that I don't know where to start. So let me first admit that I only saw the first half hour. When the first finger was cut off, I thought that sleeping was a more rewarding exercise. I told my girlfriend the meaning of "five fingers", and she immediately followed my example. <br /> <br /> Could the producer, director and / or screenwriter appeal to a chess lover? Like me? They were supposed to use a digital chess clock, not an analog. This main fool makes mental pressure on Martin just a laugh. How, when and why did Martaine meet with a Moroccan girl? This happens very rarely in the Netherlands. <br /> <br /> Calling me a mentally retarded person is, of course, an insult to all people suffering from well below average IQ. Moreover, as far as I know, the mentally retarded do not play chess. I do. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem, of course, is the script. Just compare the small intellectual film Hard Candy. To keep the viewer in check, information must be disclosed gradually. A good turn from time to time also helps. From other reviews, I realized that at the end of the film there is a big one. Any intelligent person can guess what it is. This, of course, just causes more questions - why did the guide die? My God, why should I care? The whole film focuses on only one thing: chopped fingers. The creators did not even learn the lesson of Hitchcock: an exciting bomb. It is much more interesting to show that the bomb is ticking. But no, we will not see the paper-cutting machine until the impossible countdown is over. I will not waste more words on this shit. Go look at Hard Candy.
