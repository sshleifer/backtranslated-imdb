I have one word: focus. <br /> <br /> good. <br /> <br /> IMDb wants me to use at least ten lines of text. Good. let's discuss the subtleties of focusing. I don’t know about the rest of you, but in my first year at the film school they taught us a lot of useless crap, for example, "you will ever become famous avant-garde artists", but they also taught us how to do this crazy thing lens focusing! it was wonderful! You give a little twist and boo! everything is clear as a bell. The person who shot what Alice found should know something about the fine focus points. lighting too. This film is not only completely out of focus, but also illuminated as the corner of someone’s basement. <br /> <br /> Don't even make me start walking or plotting. they could cut the start and the end of each shot for about ten seconds. <br /> <br /> But who cares? in this film there is not enough rage to compensate for the complete disrespect for the film’s best friends - FOCUS and LIGHTING. <br /> <br /> Words for the wise.
