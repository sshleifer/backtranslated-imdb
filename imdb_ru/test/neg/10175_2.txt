This film is nothing more than Christian propaganda. It began as a good science fiction film, and then writes a thick sweet Christian theme into a story that is completely unrelated. I had to turn it off halfway, because I felt cheated on renting it. The Catholic Church has officially announced that aliens do NOT contradict faith in God. <br /> <br /> Despite this, the film is a bit entertaining, but the dialogue is unbelievable, the scripts and acting are mostly rubbish, and in general this film is for the most part bitches to avoid. <br /> <br /> The authors of the film obviously did some research on this phenomenon, but then you quickly realize that this is only to debunk and introduce their paranoid religious views into a really interesting subject. If you are a zealous religious fanatic who believes in demons and angels, you will love this movie.
