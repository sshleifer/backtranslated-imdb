A WARNING! SPOILER! This movie is absolute shit. This is not entertainment. I have no words to describe the disgust that I experienced at the end. <br /> <br /> This is a badly made film about the scum of society. Throughout the film, I kept waiting until it was better. This is not true. Instead, things got worse and worse. <br /> <br /> When I watch such a bad film like this one, I always try to find at least one good thing to say about it. In this case, it turned out to be impossible. I have no good to say about it. How bad is it? Well, here's an example: by the end, Dan Acroyd is choking and killing Vincent D'Onofrio while Reeves and Diaz are watching! This is not fun!
