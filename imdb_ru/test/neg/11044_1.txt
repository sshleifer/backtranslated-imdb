This film was one of the longest films in my life. Although I like the way the director Chang-wook Park coped with revenge, the move was on the whole HORRIBLE. Oldboy is only billed for 1 hour 55 minutes, but it seems that it takes at least 3 and a half hours to tell this story. I will say that the English dub was made very well and the film was easily understood. I felt that some of the scenes were too long, and many dialogues were repeated. In addition, if you are disgusted with annoying voices, then avoid hearing Hye Jong Kang speaking (she plays Mi-do). If you're looking for a movie that would kill time and make you feel morally better than others, then look. If you do not want to watch a film filled with incest, poor dialogue, unnecessary fight scenes, rough scenes of torture and confused memories, then this film is not for you.
