I really wanted this movie. A film with zombie children coming out of a mine to kill people at night really seemed like a great idea for a horror movie. Unfortunately, the film was in the top three films played at the festival of horror. <br /> <br /> A mother and her two daughters are trying to leave after her husband / father passed away from an illness that cost their family a lot of money. They must adapt to their new environment. They end the fight because of the whole environment for various reasons. (Crazy zombie kids fall into this category.) The film never gives sentimental affections to anyone who lives or dies, the film does not scare and does not jump worthy moments, the film barely shows children do what they should ... Kill! With a big budget and better cast, this film may have hope. Until then, pass it on. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10 in fact.
