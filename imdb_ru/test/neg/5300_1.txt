Uma and Travolta were very good together, but - unfortunately - when they left the screen, the film was just a collection of very boring and verbose secondary characters wrapped in some kind of extremely bad text. Random glimpses of greatness, such as the dance scene between Uma and Travolta, quickly disappeared when such people as Harvey Keitel and similar uninteresting bandits appeared. And the white dude, who tried to behave black, became VERY, VERY tedious, after too much exposure in the picture. He distracted a rather nice performance from Rock, the only minor character you couldnâ€™t wait to see as he left the screen. Bad, stupid conspiracy. The authors clearly could not understand whether they were writing to Generation X or the 12-15-year-old rap crowd, and this combination turned into a film that made me look at my watch!
