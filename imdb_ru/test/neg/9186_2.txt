"Cars East" became a big disappointment for me. But the saddest thing about this film is that he turned out to be John Candy’s last role (he died shortly before the shooting ended on this). There are only a few laughs all over this western deception, and this is a comedy that doesn’t cut it off. If you want to see the noisy deception of Western films, the answer is obvious. See the classic Mel Brooks "Blazing Saddles". Or, if you want to see Candy in much better material, see “Summer Rental”, “Space Balls” or “Uncle Buck” (just to name a few). These three films (as well as others) show us what a great comic actor he was. Unfortunately, there are no “Cars of the East”. What a disgrace! <br /> <br /> * (out of four)
