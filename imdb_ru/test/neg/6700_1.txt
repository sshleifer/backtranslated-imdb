Badland is one of the worst films I've ever seen. In most cases, this is normal, and I can continue my life, but I feel the need to warn others in this case. As a veteran of the war in Iraq, I consider it necessary to say that the story, plot, actions, and description of what the soldiers go through on returning home were clean rubbish. It was as if the director / writer / whoever clung to some cliché about the return of the soldiers and ran with him, ran with him and ran with him .. Not to mention that I would assume that this film had absolutely no research. The “sea” uniform looked as if it was fresh on the store shelf surplus and not used since the first war in Iraq. I will not continue forever, this is a terrible film. If you are interested in the history of the return of soldiers, there are much better alternatives. I recommend going to your local library.
