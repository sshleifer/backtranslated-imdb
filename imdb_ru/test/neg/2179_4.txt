Maybe it was * An important film *, and therefore people rate it so highly, but, frankly, this is not very good. Looking back, it is easy to see that Chaplin (probably all of Hollywood) was incredibly naive about the scale of what really happened in the ghetto, so you cannot blame him strongly for the fact that the separation touches the modern viewer, but the separation remains. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film is just awkward; as if Chaplin had no idea that films had advanced in sophistication since the days of silence. Plots that include both the Jewish hairdresser and the dictator do not merge with each other; they simply sit there, like individual pieces of the storyline that progress in attacks, moving HERE, but never reaching a resolution. Some are funny and some are not. <br /> <br /> The fact that there is a charm in the film is strictly in the person of Chaplin himself. His parodies of Hitler's speech were the best part of all this, and one cannot deny that he had a physical grace for which it was pleasant to watch. But practically everything he surrounded himself was annoying. Hannah was TOO damn American. The stormtroopers were too damn American. <br /> <br /> Oooh! Oooh! Something else! I do not know what purpose served the fact that the garbage was the source of evil behind the throne. It seems that the film says that if it were not for the harmful influence, such as “Garbage”, Hinkle would not be such a bad guy.
