A terrible and bloody story about a couple who inherited an Italian castle with 150 rooms, and yet grieved for the loss of her little son. The coupleâ€™s marriage seems to be on the rocks because of a car accident that claimed the lives of their son and left their daughter blind. When inventorying a castle for future sale, hideous, exhausted and deformed creatures break from the bowels of the 12th century castle. Pretty bloody with a great horror atmosphere and some sexy nuances. Starring Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Jessica Dollarhide and Elizabeth Kaza.
