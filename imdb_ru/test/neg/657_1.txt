By Hollywood standards, this film was shot and edited in the same way as Hollywood films, and therefore looked like a film that you could get in Hollywood's big production studio. That's all close to Hollywood standards, ends. It was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life! I am not kidding. The story was so incredibly stupid and unreal that I could not help laughing at the cinema while watching this movie. I know what you are saying: "This is a horror film, there should not be a good story that should scare you." Well, let me tell you something, the film isn't even scary. It is too full of stupid pieces that can nullify that little wait that could be. The action was also horrendous, along with the fear of the killer, which you constantly see through memories locked in a cage. Throughout the film, I kept getting the feeling I watched what came up, wrote, produced, and directed by a high school student who watches too much pornography. Please do not watch this film, spend your $ 8.50 on other things, for example, on a snow cone, which would cost much more.
