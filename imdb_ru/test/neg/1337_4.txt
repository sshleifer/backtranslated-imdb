Updating Claire Booth Luce's play and the movie of 1939 is a great disappointment. The composition of women is excellent, most of the individual scenes work, but nothing fit. There is no connection between the stage and the stage, as if the film was made piece by piece and then assembled in a vacuum. Yes, the story of a woman dealing with her husband’s infidelity and how her friends help and hinder her is less shocking in our time, when divorce is so common, but at the same time it is just as timely as always, I I just wish they could put all the pieces together, because at the moment you really don’t feel passionate about the plot. Wait for the cable.
