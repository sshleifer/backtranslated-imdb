Ask thousands of people what is the greatest unintended comedy of all time, and they will almost always tell you Battlefield Earth or Plan 9 from space. They are wrong. The American Ninja defeats these two turkeys for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the script, which was completely not thought out. Despite the fact that I fully support the B image industry in order to keep workers like Michael Dudikoff in the work, a little work on the product would go a long way. <br /> <br /> For those who give the back of a rat, my next few paragraphs will give out important parts of the plot. <br /> <br /> First of all, when we are given some background information about the title hero, we are informed of his date of birth, immediate family, parents, and so on. All unknown. I don’t know about you, but I expect the US Army to take fact-finding about its personnel a little more seriously. They also manage to quite effectively spoil the continuity of dates, although I don’t remember exactly which dates were spoiled and when. In fact, this is one of the less obvious shortcomings of the American ninja. <br /> <br /> This has already been mentioned, but the common drawback of many martial arts films is that when our heroes encounter a large number of antagonists, antagonists are told to attack one at a time. Later films, such as Matrix Reboot, do not fall under this convention, but approximately in every film of the 1980s, viewers shout, "Hey, why don't you attack everyone at once ???" Martial arts films tend to be much more impressive when battles are bigger than one-on-one. <br /> <br /> The central premise was initially a joke, but in the light of recent events, when the US Army cannot crush the crowd of insurgents simply because they will not delegate to specialists, this seems strangely ironic. Filipino renegades steal weapons from a local US Army unit for sale to wealthy clients. Never mind that such a theft would induce the army to give local businessmen, those responsible, or even considered responsible, the air rectal exam, after all, is a funny fighter of the 1980s. <br /> <br /> Of course, the funniest part of the film is the climate battle, however. When Joe and Jackson combine pose and fight in an art form, evil ninjas start to explode for no apparent reason. I agree with one previous commentator that this film should have been called the “Holocaust Ninja”, because I’m willing to bet that a total of at least three hundred evil ninjas will bite him during the film. In addition, the Black Star ninja begins to fight with rocket launchers, laser beams and all sorts of ridiculous tools that are not only poorly thought out, but also poorly executed. You will never see the effect of a laser beam that looks cheaper. <br /> <br /> To top it all off, the film takes itself so damn serious. During the scene, when Joe meets up with his old mentor again, I dare the viewer not to laugh at the abominable dialogue. Not that I knew any modern ninjutsu practitioners, but the logical part of my imagination hardly believes that they said that at any time in their history. During this mentoring scene, I almost expect the old man to tell Joe that he must prove his masculinity by cutting off his head with a blunt plastic spoon. <br /> <br /> In general, I gave American Ninja 1. This is a special assessment in my system, because it is intended for the worst, most terrible, most offensive films I've ever seen, or films that make me laugh without even trying. The American ninja is certainly an example of the latter.
