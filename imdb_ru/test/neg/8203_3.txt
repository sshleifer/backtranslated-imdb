A group of seven people fear that they are the only survivors of the hydrogen bomb in the near world. They are afraid not only of radiation, but also of mutants in the surrounding hills. One of the groups is already infected, but in a strange way does not pose a real threat to others. Just to experience the friction of different personalities at close range is the plot. Richard Denning plays a hero. Mike Connors is close to the edge playing a tough guy. Laurie Nelson - a girl who is destined to begin to inhabit the brave new world. Not one of the best directors of Roger Corman. This is a predictable black and white fiction.
