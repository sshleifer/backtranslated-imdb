I am a fan of paranormal phenomena and I love Ghost Hunters, so when this show first came out, I decided to try. I could hardly sit one episode. The show is so clearly delivered. I mean, come on, every episode is associated with someone obsessed or with demonic power trying to kill a family. Another huge flaw is that these guys never expose anything. When I look at Ghost Hunters, they find evidence and try to disprove them, and if they cannot, then this is evidence. On this show, they find a voice or piece of video evidence and very quickly call it a ghost. This completely destroys their authority, unlike TAPS and Ghost Hunters, who really know what they are doing. Honestly, if you are interested in paranormal phenomena and want to watch a show about it, look at Ghostbusters.
