I don't often feel strong enough to publish something about a movie. It was, however, just the worst movie I have ever seen. The performances were ridiculous at best, at worst - well, there is no other word, terrible. Especially the leading woman, who has occasional sexual appearances, should be noticed and heard to be believed. Honestly, the plot is meaningless, the dialogue is terrible and the characteristics ... no. I'm surprised this is not an Alan Smith movie. I cannot stress this strongly enough ... to be avoided at all costs. How are such films ever made? This is not a budget film industry in its very, very worst form.
