It could be a really good movie if someone just knew how to finish the movie. <br /> <br /> The story went very well and went to that point in every film, like this one, where the “gray” characters become “good”, and the “bad” guys only get their desserts and * boom * ... as if they had exhausted the script, and the cast just started coming up. <br /> <br /> Whatever it is, it would be so bad ... if the actors had just continued to develop the character they had already created. But this is not the case, and soon the film turns into a stupid mess. <br /> <br /> My advice is to watch this movie for about the last 30 minutes ... and then turn it off. At this point, imagine what you think the next 30 minutes will look like based on what you’ve already seen. <br /> <br /> Believe me, the finale you come up with will look much better than this movie actually ends, Believe me of that.
