I watched this film only because it was expected that he would become another David Dhavan artist. <br /> <br /> David Dhavan, the return of “Bad Bad”. In the past, he made many funny movies that had no meaning, but none of them was a bag of shit! What was it a waste of talent and beauty? It is clear why the actors agree on this film. <br /> <br /> There was no practicality in this movie. The standard and potential Bollywood is. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth seeing in this movie is Katrina, but we don’t need to watch this movie to see it! Being a remake of the Hitch Hollywood film, it's clear that Bollywood directors can't even make the right remake. I think this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Awful 1/10
