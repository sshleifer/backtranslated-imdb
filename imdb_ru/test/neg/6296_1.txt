I saw it in the cinema at the time of its first release and I can only ask: "Has the world gone crazy?" A seemingly stunning positive response is a stunning impression on this poorly written, embarrassingly predictable trap of pops. <br /> <br /> Stefan Elliot is not a genius director, as evidenced by the successive bombs he has created since (see “Welcome to the Woop” Woop ',' Eye of the Beholder ') <br /> < br /> I can only assume that in a film about gay / transgender culture, there are people who believe that disliking a film is an insult to this group of people. Are we not smarter than that? What about an interesting script and good performances? Okay, so with the 3 presenters, everything is fine, considering what they have to work with, but this film includes the worst performance of a child actor I've ever seen, not supported by a horrific dialogue and really unconvincing resolution see for mile. <br /> This is a disappointing film that does not deserve the recognition it received.
