I can do without an obvious review of factual inaccuracies. There are too many to name. A much shorter list would be what they got right. 1. Dude named Noah. 2. Ark with animals on it. <br /> <br /> If you want a much more accurate depiction of Noah’s ark and the destruction of Sodom, rent the Bible (1966). He portrays the creation story through Abraham trying to sacrifice his son Isaac. This is a much better movie, and perhaps the abomination called "Noah's Ark" (1999) made you look for just such a movie. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060164/ <br /> <br /> I really couldn't watch the whole movie. After reading the other comments, I see that even atheists found it extremely inaccurate. As a Christian, it was unbearable for me. Perhaps the worst movie ever made. There is no point in this film, except maybe the demonstration of their computer animation below nominal. <br /> <br /> Was it a waste of time? Probably no. God can use evil to do good. <br /> <br /> Romans 8:28 says: [28] And we know that everything works together for the good of those who love God, for those who are called according to his plan. <br /> <br /> Genesis 50 says: [20] and you thought evil was against me; but God meant good to accomplish, as today, to save many living people. <br /> <br /> In the second example, Joseph’s brothers wanted to kill him, but God turned their evil into a very good one. Perhaps he did the same with this film. <br /> <br /> People were so overwhelmed by the lack of a biblical basis that they probably broke into the dusty old Bible and read the story for themselves. To learn about Lot and Sodom, they will have to go all the way to Genesis 19 before God destroys Sodom and Gomorrah. By the time they read almost half of Genesis, they may want to finish. The next book is Exodus, on which the Ten Commandments film was based (and much more precisely). If they have seen this movie, then Exodus becomes easy to read. So now they have read at least two entire books of the Bible just because they watched a pathetic film about Noah's Ark. I'm sure it really happened to someone there. <br /> <br /> God works in mysterious ways,
