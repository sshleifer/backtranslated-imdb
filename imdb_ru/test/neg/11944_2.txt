I hesitated to see this film, truly enjoying the original film “Mostly Martha.” What a disappointment. Catherine Zeta Jones is a good actress, but it was not her film. The original had poignant moments, perfectly accented with an incredible soundtrack. No reservations are felt as if it is never related. Food, characters - nothing felt the passion. Basically, food came to life in March - each scene was filmed so that you could try it with your eyes - smells, textures. The food in “No reservation” was in the background — rarely did we get close-ups of preparation; the characters were not real enough to carry the film without him. It was hard to finish the movie - many scenes were awkward. Watch the original - this is a really nice movie; The soundtrack is incredible.
