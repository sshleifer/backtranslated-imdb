Saw this movie today. Very disappointed and surprised how it can be in the short list of Oscar. The most sad things: <br /> <br /> 1. This is very slow. <br /> <br /> 2. How can Genghis Khan, the cruel and mighty Asian emperor, play the kind, good actor with warm and sweet eyes — throughout the film, except for one scene? <br /> <br /> 3. Many holes in the plot: there is nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spent 20 years between childhood and adulthood. We see a former slave without money, power, friends, or at home. Click! - the next second, he leads a huge army without any reason to be a leader. <br /> <br /> 4. The magic of Genghis Khan's appearance is graciously explained only by the help of one wolf / god / whatever it is. <br /> <br /> 5. Can a man make love to his wife in this way, without seeing her for years? <br /> <br /> 6. Is it enough to win a sword battle if you just ride a horse through the enemy's line, sit there with two swords and everyone around you dies? Ridley Scott knows about this? <br /> <br /> 7. Why, after 20–30 years of age, is Han’s mother not older? <br /> <br /> 8. What is the motivation for the main character? (No. Literally.) <br /> <br /> Do not waste time. Indeed. The work of filmmakers is good; nature is outstanding - but the film cannot be made without a director and script. The real Cengis Khan executes the director in a second. <br /> <br /> Best regards.
