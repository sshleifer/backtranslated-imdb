Have you ever had a sneeze that seems to have accumulated forever? You are choking, and you have cramps, and you grab the nearest paper product, preparing for the world's greatest supercharger ... and then it falls. Frankenhooker was the cinematic equivalent of this lost sneeze. Now I'm good at B-movies, and I always look different when a boom microphone appears on the screen or an actor says his lines with all the enthusiasm of Gerald Ford, but this one really brings me down. For example, the cover of a video is a line of the entire movie. Using the details of the murdered New York prostitutes, Dr. Franken rebuilds his deceased bride only to annoy her in Manhattan as a kind of super prostitute with a bad attitude. After one and a half hours of training, these rather amusing ten minutes seemed a bit anti-climatic.
