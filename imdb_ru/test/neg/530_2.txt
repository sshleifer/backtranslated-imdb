Two things are always a sign that you’re going to watch a bad movie: <br /> <br /> 1) If you remember other films right away, such as TERMINATOR, HARDWARE or BLADE RUNNER during a header sequence <br /> <br / > 2) If death occurs immediately after the header during the sex scene, <br /> <br /> In fact, there is a third warning sign, and this title indicates a lazy exposure warning the poor ignorant Naive audience about the dangers of corporate greed. Guess what ? CYBORG 2 begins with a signature warning us about corporate greed in the future, followed by a sequence of headlines reminding me of a TERMINATOR, EQUIPMENT and BLADE HANDLE and subsequent death during the sex scene! Hey, don't you think I accidentally watch a bad movie? <br /> <br /> As you can guess, this is a bad movie. In fact, this is a series of battle scenes written around a cyborg story on the run from a greedy corporate company. It is poorly written, directed and acts, and especially it is poorly lit, which means that it is very difficult to see what is happening on the screen, although I’m not quite sure that it’s really bad. The only interest that will take place is that this is the debut of the film by Angelina Jolie, who plays cyborg on the run and says the prophetic phrase: “Are they cute, interesting, are they real?”, What am I asking. myself whenever I see one of her films
