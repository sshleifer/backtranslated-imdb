I was completely disgusted by this unnecessary continuation of the film “The Adventures of Poseidon,” about which I gave a great comment. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredible from the word GO! I agree, why there were no other rescue boats and helicopters? The one who saved the first survivors, just flew over the boat, on which are Michael Kane and Sally Field. WHAT IS THE ONLY CREW? It's hard to believe. <br /> <br /> The game is generally bad and the show looks cheap. I really hated wasting the talents of some good actors. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie unless you catch Sally and Michael as lovers. <br /> <br /> gore
