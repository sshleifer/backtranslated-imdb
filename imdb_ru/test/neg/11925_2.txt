It is clear that critics began to call him the club "Oscar Winner". That after Halle Berry won it for the Monsters Ball, she went straight to the devil Cat Woman. Hilary Swank triumphs in the film “The Boys Don't Cry” and follows him with “The Core”. Jamie Foxx becomes a pilot in a dull stealth after grabbing a gong for Ray. Looks like Hollywood starlet Charlize Theron plays Oscar Monster with one of the worst sci-fi shows ever made. <br /> <br /> The film loses interest in the public already after 20 minutes, and this is the only thing that is really worth staying at, this is that, despite the fact that the film is rubbish, Charlize Theron is still an exceptional actress which clearly does its best out of a rude and ridiculous premise. Not only is “On Flux” ultimately small, but for an action movie it's really very boring. This is really going to appeal to fans of comic books and Horney’s teens, who like the idea that Theron runs half naked for 90 minutes. The stream only really succeeds in failure. <br /> <br /> Confronting the 2011 virus, which kills 99% of the world's population, and in the last city on earth, Bragna, survived about four hundred years later, per year 2415 continues to live in the Goodchild dynasty, the name of the scientist who developed her medicine. <br /> <br /> Not everything in this utopia, and not what lies behind its high walls, protects it. citizens of the endless jungle, but that unspoken, unwritten taboo, which holds and binds this unwritten taboo, which holds and binds together these loser, which lies within these walls of paranoia, conformity and unquestionable obedience. Ironically, this film was made in and around Berlin. It is a story against a totalitarian state, a fortress city, in which its people are no longer able to reproduce, and its sinister and most secret plot about how it supports life. <br /> Theon Flux is a killer appointed by underground rebels to change the course of humanity forever. This is a story about her struggle for justice, freedom and revenge. <br /> <br /> Flux combines lousy narratives, reckless moves and truly terrible consequences. More like an unreal video game than a movie. The only thing that is successful in this failure is that there are no sequels in the work, Flux can only be the beginning and the end of what could have been one of the worst franchises in history, thank God for the lousy box office then. <br /> <br /> My final verdict for this really lousy feature? There is really no story here, only Charlize Theron is jumping in a black suit, like a grass bunker. The action is very idiotic wooden and insensitive compared to other cinemas that exist today. This is too much to look like an adaptation, and in fact takes little from the cartoon, which I expected, the only thing that was done half right, which does justice to the cartoon, is a fly in the eye scene. Avoid at all costs.
