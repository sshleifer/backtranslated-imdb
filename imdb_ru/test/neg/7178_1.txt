Yes. It takes the Norwegian to destroy and kill two great books and a concept that will work well on the film - this film is indeed the worst Swedish film of all time. I hated it so much that I even thought about leaving it, which I never did. But it was so terrible that I was almost irresistible. I just had to sit until the end. Just as in the early 80s in the Stallone battle roll, this DOES return the Swedish militants to the Stone Age. So full of logical mistakes and stupid mistakes, it's almost funny - but who could ever see something good in a terrible action: the survival of Mark Hamill in a minefield or a dull, useless and irrational act? <br /> <br /> Let me ask you: are we not finished with the clock ticking to zero, the hero runs away at the very last moment and the two friends become enemies reuniting towards the end? Stupid !!!! <br /> <br /> And one more thing: product placement in this movie is incredible. While other countries realized that this should not be so obvious, the Swedish film industry did not seem to understand at all: just look at the credit card that Hamilton uses to open the window? Or or or ... this film really drives me crazy.
