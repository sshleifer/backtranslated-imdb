If you consider this as an independent feature, I can not say that it is too bad, but where I am from is a continuation, and the original “Lady and the Tramp” do not agree with each other! These are two completely different films with different styles, different voices, different narrations, and the only thing that they share with each other are visual effects (for example, Jim Dear's Townhouse, Darling, Lady and Trump), and none of them have changed. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for any continuity years after the release of the original for such memorable songs as "Bella Notte" and "The Siamesse Cats Song", this sequel will not give you any at all! Almost every song has a bit of pop music, and these good old characters, such as Jock and Trustee, Jim Deere and Darling and Aunt Sarah and her cats, may well be seen, but it looks like they are somehow replaced by new characters, not to mention the Peg does not appear at all, whose voices are rather annoying. Even Lady and Rogue do not appear often enough, and as for Scamp? He is so spoiled! And he treats his father Vagner with complete disrespect, then runs away without repentance even after he finds out how much he is missing at home! And they called his shameless escape an adventure! I would say that Scott Wolfe really brought the abusive bad guy out of Scamp, who destroyed the typical cute animal Disney. Even old characters just make you crazy about it; Trusting sounds like a stupid patient in bed, Jock (Jeff-stupid-Bennett) - and his voice - do not sound Scottish, nor should hear! Kill him as far as possible to free our poor ears from his voice, as well as stupid, feathery, dizzy, catching up dogs. Someone put them in place !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> “Lady and Tramp 2” Not bad if you don’t have a hard day, but I expect a lot more charm from a sequel to real classics - Scamp shavok, like his girlfriend Angel, and he has a weak storyline . However, I think you should try it at least once, because, as I say, there are much worse films around.
