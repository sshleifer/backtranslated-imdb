Probably the biggest thing in Wild Rebels that hurts him the most is the hero. It says LOSER on it, but this does not prevent him from “getting the girl”. Probably one of the worst riders in the world he can imagine, he decides to stop racing after having crashed his car. Well, his new job is still racing, as a bunch of bikers choose him to drive his car when he commits crimes. There is nothing that could please you Rod, even the situation in which he fell is rather stupid. After all, on the stage of the lighthouse, you want Rod to be killed by all the bikers. Get it: he shot twice, once in the arm and once in the leg, and yet he manages to crawl a little up the stairs. If only Jeter had the best goal ... <br /> <br /> Avoid this if you don’t see the MST3K version.
