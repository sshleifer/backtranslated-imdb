Martin Lawrence is not a funny person, I am Runteldat. He simply has too many thoughts, and he is too mad, that his puns are rather early on. He is trying to make fun of the critics, which comes down to "e *** them." Then he continues with rather primitive sexual jokes with smokers with throat cancer, and from there he just goes down. 3/10
