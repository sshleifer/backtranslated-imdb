There were good characters who were played by pleasant-looking actors and actresses, plus there was a famous group and several famous dancers ... but the film simply did not work. By the time it was almost over, I was bored to death. The dialogue was stupid, the humor (mainly Milton Burle) was completely stupid, and the music just did not suit me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I have never been a big band fan, and if I hear, “In the mood” again when I vomit. <br /> <br /> This was my first look at the famous figure skater Sonya Heni, and I have no complaints about her. Almost part of the problem, at least with humor, is that it is so outdated that it is no longer funny. Berl, Phil Silvers, Bob Hope, Red Skeleton, Abbot and Costello, etc. And so on. Were fun for the crowd in the 40s and 50s, but the humor changes, and what was funny then was Today.
