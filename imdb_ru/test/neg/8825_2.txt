Othello is going to burn the eyes of the audience of this film. The poor portrayal of Shakespeare's characters and the horrible manifestation of love that Desi and John had, made this film a terrible abomination. Of course, Othello, directed by Jeffrey Sachs, is ordinary and cruel. <br /> <br /> The Othello film is a pitiful drama about love between John and Desi. Their loyalty to each other will be tested by a friend of this person. The initial scene of the film clearly shows that love between John and Desdemona is inseparable from faith. After a few moments, Ben Jago, a friend of John, appears on the screen, frightening the audience and immediately showing them how a liar he is and a power-hungry person. <br /> <br /> Of course, this film was much more awful than the Shakespeare novel itself. With that, as they say, he has a small amount of good parts. For example, the love that was shown between John and Desi was depicted very well, and it seemed that the couple was so inseparable; just as it was explained in the book. Although the love between them was exceptionally good, she still did not show the jealousy that Othello had between Cass and Desi as she should have. <br /> <br /> Love, jealousy, deception, this film is based on all three main themes that were in Shakespeare's novel. The novel, however, does explain how it all came together much better than the film. For example, the conclusion of this story ends in a book much differently than in a film. Much more detail is also inherent in the novel. That is why this film is so disappointing, believe me, and those who read it will also be disappointed. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film was by far the most horrendous depiction of a novel ever released by humanity. Having got rid of watching this film, the audience will not only save themselves for two hours of their life, but also from one or two eyes from the disgusting face of Ben Jago, who jumps on them.
