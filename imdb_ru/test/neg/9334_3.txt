This film and several other films of the 1950s with religious overtones, such as The Robe, Quo Vadis, Samson and Delilah, unfortunately depict all pagans or those who are not Jewish or Christian, morally corrupt and decadent. The focus is only on biblical stories that ignore the world outside the bible. As for them, nothing good has come from pagan Egypt, Greece or Rome. <br /> <br /> Any film that preaches about the “one true god” gives a short shift towards freedom of religion. The films ignore the fact that the absence of religious freedom in ancient Judea made it fertile ground for religious extremism. Most religious films from the 1950s also overlook the loss of freedom that occurred after Christians came to political power in the 4th century.
