Pretty bad. This film is about the gray-haired (and frankly stupid) old geological explorer and his dog "Shep", T. E. Lassi, as well as an annoying child, whose name I cannot remember at the moment. At the beginning of the film, the old scout deliberately buried himself in the sand so that the poor dog would have to dig it up. What for? Did he hate the dog? Anyhoo, anyway, this idiot managed to hit gold, and goes to tell his partner. But the man died, and his scruffy partner happily helps old Jonathan mine gold. The eccentric is trying to get away, this is a dog with the son of a dead guy, but even a retarded fool does not want to stay with this child. There is a strange old preacher (for the odd to read smelly), and the fat guy finishes off the old (surprise, surprise) and tries to steal all the gold. Plus he poisons the dog and tries to kill the baby too. So I suppose it's normal that the devilish and crazy Lassie ... uh ... SHEP makes this guy at the end, although it is rather unpleasant in that it is basically a children's film. There are extremely stereotypical (on the verge of a racial trait) "Native Americans" who speak without using verbs (such as, for example, in a speech like "I make the camp fire"). And that's pretty much the cast, because Lassie's salary was too big to hire anyone else. Kind of boring. not very interesting, and a little too dark. Not a good movie anyway.
