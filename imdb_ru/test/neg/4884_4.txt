It is very interesting to find another reviewer who had the same reaction to this film as mine: I was much better when I was 10 or 11 years old. <br /> <br /> Seeing him more than 30 years later is still in order, but it only slightly interested me. What seemed incredibly funny back then was just slightly funny. <br /> <br /> In addition, things that were amazing to me when I was 10 years old seemed just silly. For example, in one scene, Trinity goes in front, shoots a revolver because of him and kills two people without even looking. In fact, he did not even bother to look and see if they were dead, because he knew that he had hit the target. Hmm, yes, that's right. <br /> <br /> In addition, many dialogues sound quite wooden. Sorry, but 35 years later, he didn't grow old very well. <br /> <br /> Although it’s been a long time since I saw him too, it’s possible that the film about Terrence Hill is better than this one. My name is Nobody.
