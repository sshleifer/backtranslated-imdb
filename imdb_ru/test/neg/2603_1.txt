Everything in this show is terrible. His premise even sets himself up to get a cheap laugh with a bad letter. The theme “dysfunctional family” has already been used too many times, especially The Simpsons, which is a great show with great writing and lots of laughter. In the meantime, Family Guy has about five minutes of history in each episode, with tons of celebrity jokes and random memories. Now, if it was original or funny, of course, I think it was smart. But no, this is not at all funny. In fact, the only reason these episodes are similar to this is that this is the easiest way to easily start the episode after the episode of this junk. Much of this show is not original, but what is original is simply lame. It is also surprisingly rude and disrespectful, which again can be good if it is still reasonable. Animation is not everything, but from an artistic point of view this show also fails, once again confirming that Family Guy is committed to as many cheap jokes and simple labels as possible. People like this show, and I don’t care, because people can enjoy everything they want, no matter how much it tends to the lowest common denominator. But no, I do not recommend it, especially for those who want to someday study a film or become a writer. This is cheap entertainment, which is aimed at a low price and has found success in it. The fact that it is so successful speaks of bad things about America.
