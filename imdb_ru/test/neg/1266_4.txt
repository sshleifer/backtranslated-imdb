I was very willing to give Rendition the benefit of doubt when it came to all the negative press I read about it. Even about three-quarters of the way, I still thought it was jumbled and a little incoherent, but otherwise the solid story came to its end. And then the bottom fell. Not wanting to destroy the film for anyone, but the conclusion turns everything you adhered to to be a fact about what happened on his head and when - for no particular reason, except maybe to tell the world, yes, I'm cool and I know that. I love a good turn, I love a good moment ah-ha, but only when it has to do with the story at hand. Full misconception on the part of the filmmakers does not make sense in the general story, the timeframes should not have been parallel, and they should not be divided into a week. All I did was destroy all the merits of director Gavin Hood and screenwriter Kelly Sane, which can be a good thing because, looking back, the film was not as strong as I was going to blindly give it. credit. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful thing to try to bring the term “translation” to the public’s mind, but for this you needed a story that would go deeper into connotations and politics, and not into gloss. because of these questions about the story of the unfortunate woman because of the disappearance of her husband and the excitement of her daughter against her “investigator” father. I understand that the final film visitor needs human quality, and therefore I do not blame him for following this path. The only thing that bothers me is that we lack what the title says. Instead, we are shown numerous plot lines, all of them confusedly come to the fore before being sent back to more distant areas of our consciousness that we never return to. So much is happening that you forget about who you should look after, wife? investigator? CIA agent? victim? senator? Middle Eastern daughter and her fanatical boyfriend? In the end, I just gave up and let the film take me to where it was, and in the end it was someone completely different than the one he had first laid out. <br /> <br /> Everything that happens, happens as a result of a bomb. explosion. This bomb is in the center of each plot and, in the end, turns out to be so harmless that it is impossible to believe how huge the waves that it spread were. An old quote of butterfly wings flapping in full, because the mission of one boy to take revenge ultimately destroys the lives of many people. Whether death, destruction, physical and emotional abuse, or professional suicide; no one really can remain unscathed. However, in the end, only the story of a man who was slaughtered in Egypt for torture is really interesting. We are led to believe that he is unambiguously innocent from the very beginning, but he is thrown into the water, killed by electric current, etc., in order to extract any information that he may have. When there is a person in power who has no compassion or reason to stop until something is spilled (true or not), and an observer who does not have the courage to accept or stop it, the situation creates some intrigue as to how it could would happen. end. All three actors involved are the best parts of the film and once again prove that the film should have touched them entirely. <br /> <br /> I don’t want to detract from people like Reese Witherspoon, (victim’s wife), or her Senate hired by ex, played by Peter Sarsgaard, because they are really good at what they are given. Even Meryl Streep, her strange accent and Alan Arkin are not too distracting. However, this is really a trio of CIA agent Jake Gyllenhaal, investigator Igal Naor and victim Omar Metvally. Naor is great as an Egyptian, trying to stay as sharp as a razor during working hours, but compassionate and full of anxiety, like a father trying to find his daughter. This man is cruel, but he is such, because this is what his profession calls for and why he is supposed to find answers. Metwally never gives a false second during the pain and suffering caused to him. Whether he is lying or really does not know anything about the terrorist who called his cell phone, we completely agree with his situation and are desperately waiting to see how the situation will turn out. As for Dzhillenhaal, then, from whom, it seems, one course of work is processed throughout his career with varying degrees of success, he finds the part that suits him. Demons penetrating his soul throughout the entire trial, he is forced to be part of the wear and tear of his body and mind, causing both ambivalence and the need to intervene. These two feelings fight each other until he makes a final decision, and his stoic, boyish behavior is perfect for this battle. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that one storyline will never be the main focus, despite being the namesake of the movie. With all this mess around the edges, we, as an audience, jump too much, fall into a sense of time and consistency, and then slap ourselves in the face when it all unfolds from more laughter at us than ever: I did not expect it. " I felt deceived, and, unfortunately, it was the effect that I got from the film. If it were simpler, I could have more fun, but, nevertheless, you can still take some positive moments from badly spoiled whole.
