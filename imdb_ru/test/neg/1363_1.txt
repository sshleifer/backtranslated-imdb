This mess begins with a real tank running through the car, intersected by images of a toy tank. Then the family goes home from a birthday party without saying anything. I swear that the inexplicable tank and the impregnable family take more than 10 minutes of the film. Finally, the family sees the car after the accident and decides to report it to the appropriate authorities, only to find out that all the inhabitants of the city are hiding in their homes, and the police are hiding in the police station. Interesting? Nearly. When city dwellers come out because of the presence of a family, we learn that both the writer and the editor conspire to replace the unknown with unfathomable story-telling methods in the hope that the inability of the audience to tell what is happening will somehow cause concern to the audience. and it works! ... but not the way they thought. I was very concerned about how bad this film was, but I was not scared at all. The dialogue consists of things that make little sense. Not in the style of David Lynch, but in the style of "I entered in the middle of a boring conversation." Over the next hour, we learn that filmmakers are trying to tire us with fear, showing weary scenes in combination with the above-mentioned “what's happening?” Type the scenes. <br /> <br /> The plot includes something like tender-looking old people who introduce children into a trance through the power of Satan, and then bring them to a party to play with toys, and even more sinister intention, and the group White men (all white in the film) must seize their weapons and save the day, and a woman with long eyes who whined from sweat in a hat. They search for abducted children, searching in random places and shouting the names of the children. <br /> <br /> This is a great horror movie for anyone who has never seen a horror movie because this person is frightened by simple thoughts about Satanism, paganism, Wicca or even Catholicism due to Trinity brainwashing diets. - broadcast. It represents Satanism as older people in Halloween costumes with candles that are mixed at an Ankh party. Top up with the priest, spewing completely invented nonsense about Satanists, calling them "witches." The message that everything that is not Protestantism can be thrown into one category for light conviction. <br /> <br /> It took about 30 minutes to show that mediocre older actors babble awkwardly because of overworked pseudo-satan gibberish. make teenage goths blush, almost always in old English, and sometimes in Latin, which may or may not be made-up words. <br /> <br /> Among the highlights is a guy laughing at the idea of ​​little green men for a solid body. 3 minutes, the family watched from the window of their car, without talking for 10 minutes, listening to lift music. A priest who studies Satanism for 4 minutes with horrible drawings of demons to frighten the Lady of the Church crowd. Random shots of dolls. Random pictures of children. Draw instead of blood at every opportunity. Film schools dream level. Represents unimportant characters who do nothing before exiting. Sometimes they behave as if Nothing of what they are doing is important. <br /> <br /> At best, the direction is careless. An example of directing involves a scene at the beginning, where a man and a woman kiss, and a man pulls away to look lovingly into her eyes, and a little dark red paint falls on her cheek. Looking up, they see that it is not blood, but drops from the girl’s snow cone. The snow cones are ice and colored / flavored water, and they could not produce droplets of the same texture as the paint, not to mention that its snow cone was a bright reddish-orange color. Written work, of course, but even worse due to poor direction. He then shows an alternate snapshot of a man, a woman, and a girl, and shows that she is four feet away from them, so that the snow cone would not fall on the woman, even if she held her snow cone over the woman. face. Path editor! Of course, the acting is blah. The action of the entire cast can be scaled and perfectly balanced between replay and void. <br /> <br /> The director’s most offensive reception is not to give the actors any motivation, and then go out to lunch as an unblinking eye. because the actors make fun of themselves. <br /> <br /> And finally, after all this, we get to the finals, which would be great if competent people handled it, but not Jerry Fulwell,
