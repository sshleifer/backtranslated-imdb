I was just excited when the movie started (because I saw the name of Juliette Lewis on the screen). At first the script seemed very complicated, but when the film continued, it became understandable. the sex object was used too much in the film, and it seemed to me that the director ignores those who are inclined towards the opposite sex. In my opinion, a well-prepared script cannot be implemented. because we look at the cast, the film promises something at the beginning, or I just expected too much ... and finally, the end ... the end is so mediocre that I would not expect. The protagonist Cassandra wants to give a message about how to have a baby, and how a child can change life, in my opinion, this scene is a real disaster for the film. In general, the characters are funny and behave beautifully. But only the actors can not save the film.
