O my lord, what were they thinking about with this. This is not only desperately unfunny, but, even worse, a very good original was broken in the deal. Jane Fonda, believe it or not, actually changed her life in this. Even better than where she plays a whore in other so-called ideas of her life. Maybe she is just as good as a crook. At any other time, wow, what a waste of time. But she and Segal work beautifully together, so if you notice a little something funny in this child, catch the anvil on which he was beaten. - <br /> <br /> Because very, very little, this remains, to this horror. Thereâ€™s nothing funny about this child, except maybe a couple of moments when Dick and Jane bulge like lepers can't kiss ..... and uh ........ My God, that's it ? Well, it looks like that. <br /> <br /> This is a really bad movie.
