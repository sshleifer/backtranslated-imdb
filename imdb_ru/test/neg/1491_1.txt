It was hard for me not to sleep during the two-hour introductory episode. It was dumbfounded to such an extent that I doubt if I learned at least one thing. The graphics were rudimentary. Any small idea was repeated to nausea. Compare this with the TV series "Cosmos", which is led by Carl Sagan. It was a good theme song. There is NO music from these hell of 10-dimensional strings.
