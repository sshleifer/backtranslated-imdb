Yeah. Those of my generation who grew up watching these old Sunbow cartoons were spoiled. In the 80s, Joe's melody was one of the best cartoons in television history. Well written stories, well developed characters. Of course, it was nothing more than illustrious advertising for toys, but it definitely helped move this line of toys. Fast forward almost twenty years later and enter Valor vs. Venom. The animation was average average. The movement of the characters seemed sharp and puppet. The film was more like a sequel to The Little Soldiers than a story about special military forces. Then we have a character development or absence there. Dusty likes to be dusty? Slice and Dice love doing things together? What kind? Did the writers take a written course on how to develop characters with the deepest equivalent of Jar Jar Binks? As for the story. I like a little fiction. But the whole concept of transforming soldiers into an army of mutants was implemented to death in Joeâ€™s universe. Mega monsters or toxo zombies anyone? But I pay tribute to the creators for trying to make fans happy by holding martial arts every 10 minutes. I'm not a big fan of SE and SS, but I liked the scenes of the struggle between them. If you can rate VvV for what it is, you'll like it. I admit that I could not rate VvV as I should Again, everything that Joe compares with what was done in the 80s, and, frankly, nothing compares with the days of GI glory. If you can rate VvV for what it is, you'll like it.
