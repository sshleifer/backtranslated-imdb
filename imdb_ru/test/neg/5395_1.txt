I got it in Six Pack of Horror from Echo Bridge Home Entertainment. This movie is not the worst movie ever made, but it still sucks. In fact, this film is sucked so hard that I don’t know how I’m going to write this review, especially since 1. I pulled it out of the DVD player because I couldn’t even watch it for one more second 2. Hurricane pancake Ike is coming, and God knows how long it will take for me to complete this review. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the scientist and his wife. The scientist gets a valuable artifact and explores it when this supposedly urban legend, known as the Skeletonist, kills him and then his wife. Then ... <br /> <br /> Sorry, but in fact I can not say anything about this POS, except to not worry. I currently use the disc as a stand, and if you see it, you can do the same. Casper Van Dien and Michael Rucker must have needed money ... BAD! <br /> <br /> ps. I will mainly review the films in the box and maybe make a new review of Ghoulies IV.
