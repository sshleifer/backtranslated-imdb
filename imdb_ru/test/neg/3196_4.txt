I saw a great video of this film, which I will talk about later, and then the cast list, and I thought that you might as well try. In fact, bartender Randy (Matt Dillon), his daring cousin Carl Harding (Paul Reiser) and the murder investigation detective have something in common, they have something in common, they saw the girl of their dreams (whether married or not ), and they will do everything to please and be with her, even die. All three met / saw her "one night at McCool," the bar where Randy worked, they don’t know each other, but all three can't stop thinking about Femme Fetale Jewel Valentine (Lord of the Rings Liv Tyler). All three tell their stories to those who, as they hope, will listen to their rather intense and illustrative stories, Randy talks to the killer Mr. Burmeister (Michael Douglas, who participated in the making of the film), Karl - with the psychologist / psychiatrist Dr. Green Reba McIntyre and Deling priest father Jimmy (Richard Jenkins). They confess all the details of what they were willing to do, their sexual contact with her, and in the end they are all gathered in one place, everyone intends to be with her, and everyone is involved in the final exchange of fire, which leaves one dead, one runs away (and eventually dies) and one is stunned, and the unexpected guy she chooses (but at the same time obvious, because he is Douglas obsessed with sex). Also starring Andrew Dice Clay as Utah / Elmo and Sandy Martin in the role of female bingo merchant. If I had to choose a favorite moment, it would be what was mentioned at number 11 along with Cool Hand Luke in “The 100 Greatest Sexual Moments,” where Tyler imitates a woman washing a car with foam all over herself and very good sexually! In addition, not the most memorable film. Good!
