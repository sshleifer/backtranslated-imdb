Anatomy is not very unique in the horror genre, in fact, it is not even scary. It reminds me of my American cousins, horror slashers. It's just a copy of any other horror movie, and, like a German film, it’s too American, and there’s nothing to add. <br /> <br /> In fact, “Anatomy” is too predictable and boring, its plot is not whole and consistent. It has silly scenes for it that don't even fit into the horror movie genre. Funny sex scenes with pop music and topless in underwear. Why should they have it all in just one movie? Instead, they had to make a cheap German film for adults. <br /> <br /> I cannot recommend this film to anyone because it’s too boring.
