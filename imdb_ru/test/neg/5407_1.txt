This is considered the worst movie of all time. There was no research or thought at all in this film. The action took place at random intervals, which did not make sense in the context of the film. Objects appeared and disappeared in a random order, etc. It is obvious that this was led by a “stunt coordinator” who should return to his previous work. The skeleton rode on horseback during the entire film, which in an amazing way could change color at will. Either that, or someone thought that the audience would be color blind and would not notice. The blood will be on the actors in one scene, and already in the next, miraculously disappear, and then reappear. It seems that everyone associated with this film forgot to check for inconsistencies.
