As a parent of two girls (14 and 11), I have serious doubts about this show and all shows aimed at teenagers. First, I am always amazed that the living conditions of Drake / Josh, Zack / Cody, Hannah, Carly, Derek, Sunny, etc. Always make most homes look tiny and cramped. Most people work hard all day to pay for living space less than half, but at these shows no one leaves or does not leave work, does not pay utilities, rent, mortgage or insurance bills, floor cleaning, cleaning, replacement of light bulbs, repairing toilets and so on. Just enter and exit (and go down the omnipresent broad steps that exist only on TVs), make fun of jokes (most of which include lies and fun results) and shy away from work. I think that children watching this will have unrealistic expectations about how hard they will work and how luxurious their lives will be. Secondly, there is never an untouched family, always mom or dad, but there are never those who always go on asexual dates, but they never seem to have the reverse of a divorce (alimony, support, arguments). Again, children may get the impression that if mom / dad divorces, it will be fun and fun (in fact, mom or dad is often not around, if this helps the plot). Needless to say, there is no mention of spirituality (forget about a particular religion). Finally, there is a topic that worries me. There are “cretins” who are good at school, “athletes” are good at sports, “good two shoes”. The main characters are not very good at school, sports or charity, but they do stupid things about those who do it. The bottom line is that there shouldn't be anything good, just be one of the “nothing” that mixes up in joking jokes. Needless to say, I put all these shows on zero and turn them off all the time, and I miss them in my house.
