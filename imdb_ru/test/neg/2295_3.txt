In this Swedish spray film, he tries to parody / emulate American horror films, such as Evil Dead, Gremlins and others. Writer / director / actor / filmmaker Anders Jacobsson and writer / producer / actor / makeup supervisor Goran Lundstrem (did I miss something?) Obviously, they were inspired by Sam Raymi. But cinematography is a bad copy of what can be seen in “Evil Dead” and other places. Some other users wrote that they liked the humor of this film, but I don’t. <br /> <br /> The film rather excited than entertained me. He is trying to combine vanity and comedy, and the end product just makes me feel oppressed, although it was not scary or shocking. The combination of different genre elements made this film very strange. I was never sure if it should be scary or ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The story is quite inventive, with the exception of the showdown in the hospital, but I did not like the way it was organized for the reasons mentioned above. The effects of blood and makeup are very good, and at least the episodes of “Free Limbs” were quite interesting, because in these scenes the directors did not try to mix panic and jokes. <br /> <br /> In general, a strange film that you will either hate or love. Rest in peace, Evil Ed. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3/10 (made me stick to American production)
