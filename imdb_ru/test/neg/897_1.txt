A long time ago, in the early 80s, Friday night television show came to ABC, trying to steal the spotlight because of the bad list of NBC "Saturday Night Live". It wasn’t, but it did present some disgusting sketches and semi talented “comedians” to the world. Like Mark Blankenfield, for example. <br /> <br /> That leads us in a roundabout way to “Jekyll and Hyde ... together again.” Which is disgusting in every way. <br /> <br /> Blankenfield is almost as thin as a bench full of adder cushions leaving after Communion. And about the same taste. It's just his drugged character pharmacist, which he played in the ill-fated show "Friday", stretching to its full length. And if you didn't like it there, why are you reading this review? <br /> <br /> Every time it takes more than one or two authors to write a film, this is a bad sign. Then, when it comes to joking jokes that will throw you away from each improvised scene in the western hemisphere and replace the gags with rude things, everything can only get worse. <br /> <br /> A comic view of Robert the story of Louis Stevenson? Approximately the same good idea as the creation of a comedy film from "The Fall of the House of Usher" By. <br /> <br /> In addition to a few (VERY few) jokes that give a slight smile, this whole film is an exercise in wasted acts, wasted film, wasted opportunities. Unsurprisingly, they showed the original author Stevenson, turning into his grave. What more attentive feedback could they give themselves? <br /> <br /> Without stars. No, even for Armstrong, who should have known better. <br /> <br /> “Hyde” of this.
