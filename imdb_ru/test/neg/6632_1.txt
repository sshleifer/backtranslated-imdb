This should not have been done in the movies. Everything about this was idiotic, and I don't think I laughed even once. There were bits that were fine, I think, but that's all. Many pieces were strikingly similar to many other films that made them much better. There were some famous actors / actresses in it, but no one did a good job, they must have just not cared. This is one of those films that is trying to have a “cute” finale, but it was so idiotic that it literally had no expiatory values. Carrot Top is probably the worst comedian out there right now. Do yourself a favor and stay away from it! <br /> <br /> Final decisions: <br /> <br /> Films: NOOOOO! <br /> <br /> Buy DVD: Absolutely not! /> <br /> Rental: only if you have seen EVERYTHING and yet, and you have a free coupon, but even then it is still not worth your time.
