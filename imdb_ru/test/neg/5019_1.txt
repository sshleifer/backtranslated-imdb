This film is absolutely incredible. The only way a girl could perform this act with a dog was if she had serious mental health problems, or had been sexually abused for a long time or was under duress. However, we are asked to believe that the rest of the “normal” healthy woman became a little boring, and she “made a small mistake”, and she had a sexual encounter with a dog. Moreover, it has never had a detrimental effect on her, except when she tells someone. <br /> <br /> She was not raped by a dog, or the dog didn’t do what she couldn’t resist - she actively initiated oral sex to complete this activity with a dog of her choice. She did not take drugs or anything else that she simply "wanted." <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is trying to show this action “hey, this can happen to someone whom she’s just honest.” <br /> <br /> But in fact, in order to believe in it, we have to believe that it is a woman who is able to do absolutely NOTHING if she “just wants to.” Think about it - could she have considered the rights and shortcomings of this action before its implementation? If she had, she would have stopped on her way. People have instinctive boundaries for reasons. If we now begin to consider bestiality as a "sweet" little aberration, what next? Child abuse? And yet the “heroine” is portrayed as a difficult, good girl, who had one moment of aberration. If she were forced to commit this act of the rapist - the story could have made more sense, and I would be able to take the storyline. But there is no way for anyone to perform a lengthy activity, required and referred to even once - if there is not any deep impairment that requires great psychiatric help. This is NOTHING happening in the rest of the ideal life. <br /> <br /> I know that this is just a film, but thanks to the normalization of behavior through the media, the society becomes less sensitive and more and more Terrible realities become possible. <br /> <br /> I could present the abuser showing it to the child to convince them that it is not so important, and then go to their agenda. It can also be used by the abuser to stress to the child that he should not talk about abuse - because of how people react to you if you do. <br /> <br /> This is not true. The director WANTS people to think this is true. It's about degradation and how easily people (the audience) can manipulate the adoption of the most terrible concepts, if they are wrapped correctly. They manipulate, humiliate and laugh with the audience. <br /> <br /> This is a film in which actors and viewers are subjected to humiliation and in a very sophisticated and sophisticated, clever but extremely worried film. writer. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that this film is used so that the creator of the film can be carried away by the game with his offensive way. I don't know if this is consciously on their part — but this is the most classic example of the Mind F *** k that I have ever encountered. <br /> <br /> I hope that this will not offend anyone bust. But if you watched this movie - I do not think that there is a place where you could offend something.
