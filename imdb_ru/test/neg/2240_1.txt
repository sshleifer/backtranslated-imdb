Quentin, in my opinion, wrote and shot only one good film, and it was several times the award-winning Pulp Fiction. However, most films, especially recent ones, were real REAL turkeys. People still appreciate him and his stuff today, and I really don't understand why. There are currently many other directors and screenwriters who create much better entertainment in all aspects of their films. From now on, I will not believe the hype in the Tarantino film. <br /> <br /> The "inglorious" was too long, and, even worse, you felt it. Humor was, well, minimal and not so humorous. There was nothing new in the violence (minus the final scene). The dialogue was sometimes very VERY tight. <br /> <br /> For some, they will like this movie; and for others they will hate it. <br /> <br /> ... and I thought that the subject of the Nazis was finally put to bed with the amazing 2004 German film Der Untergang.
