One glance at the rating should tell you that the shills voted for this movie in an attempt to artificially increase the rating of this movie. <br /> <br /> This film brings nothing new to the zombie genre. In fact, it is ridiculously bad (in acting and cinematography) and derivative in its plot. Makeup looks terrible, and zombies look even worse when fired. The lines are tough and poorly calculated, with the exception of the bounty hunter woman, who is the only good actor in this mess of the film. The worst offenders are the Italian guy (Hans), the main character Rin and the main bad guy. I have seen the best delivery from a flat tire pizza truck. <br /> <br /> This is a self-proclaimed “western zombie”, but the only thing that makes it “western zombie” is the fact that people wear cowboy hats, and the real name of the main actor is Clint. The main character is not as cool and mysterious as the traditional hero Eastwood, and, as an anti-hero, he does not have the wise attitude to cope with this. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by fake luminous reviews. It's just another B-class zombie movie that is well-made for the budget that it had (it does have decent coverage), but it smells low-budget, directing and bad playing. There are a lot of really silly scenes that make this look really amateur.
