“How many people know about this?” ... “Keep it up!” Is it interesting at least some new dialogs can be done or not? The film is a real bad copy of the original. Bruce Willis probably starred in this film when he was half asleep. The way he looks at Richard Gere’s face with his cold-blooded look when they meet near the port ... My God! scared the hell out of me. Why he is killing Major Koslov and her comrades, it is still not clear to me. Another thing I could not understand was the solution of the poison he put on the car (what kind of world was it?). <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is awful, and the climax is boring. Another funny thing is how Russians were killed in the club. I fell off my chair, laughing when I saw this scene. Besides, what was this gay guy ... what did he serve for? I think the film is made too fast to be easy to understand. You have to really think what the hell was in the head's head. Lol <br /> <br /> In the end, the best scene was Richard Gere, who was trying to hold a pole between two fast moving trains. Someone must have lost his head if he did not come into contact with the pillar.
