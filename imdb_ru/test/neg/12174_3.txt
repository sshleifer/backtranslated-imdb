I’m completely surprised at how overpriced "Graveyard Man" is among the horror fans! Now I usually welcome movies that mix two or more genre styles into one, and I love almost every comedy about zombies I've ever seen. To my horror, this Italian cult classic really didn’t show me too much to be too excited ... He follows the unusual duties of a full-time cemetery caretaker and his backward male child, Curly Joe. looking like assistants, since they seem to have first of all the recently dead who jumped out of the ground seven days after their initial death. He meets a widow, whom he “surprises” with some awful cemetery atmosphere, and develops a quick love affair, soon having sex with her at the grave of her late husband. Her husband's corpse comes to life and bites her, causing a series of events that seem to absorb the rest of the film. The Graveyard Man tries to include every element that he can, for example, horror, romance, comedy, action, and fails completely in the long term. He strolls forward, never able to focus on any aspect long enough to make it interesting for the viewer, for example, the relationship of a big-bellied partner with a living severed head, a zombie on a motorcycle running from under the ground, the main character decides to shoot from the guns of random people on the sidewalk, etc. This thing is so confusing and boring that it is almost impossible to take it seriously. Of course, this is stylish and often "elegant", but even the most "fanciful" films need the correct pedigree to make it make sense. The “Cemetery Man” wanders, seems to be unable to concentrate on anything for more than a few minutes, which after a while becomes very tedious. People claim that "this is a more complicated movie about zombies." Honestly, when it comes to zombies, I don’t want anything more "sophisticated" than Romero ... There is a bit of blood and nudity - mostly in scenes where he wants to play a horror movie, but this is not enough. to compensate for this uncompromising lack of structure. Scary film.
