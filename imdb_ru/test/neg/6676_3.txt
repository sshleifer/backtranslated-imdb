Unlike what one reviewer said, this is NOT a robbery of the Magnum Force. In this one, Lieutenant Hal Holbrook gathered his own small squad of Academy recruits to send repeat criminals. In Honest Justice, this operation is authorized by the highest strata of the police. How much they sanction the exact methods used is questionable. <br /> <br /> This special investigation squad seems to be a real refuge for LAPD losers, those who have forgotten their first duty - protection and maintenance. That is why Scott Glenn believes that Lou Diamond Phillips, a detective who has more than his share of disagreement on internal affairs for excessive use of force, is ideal for the detachment. <br /> <br /> What should have led him to flee from Phillips is the fact that he has a good relationship with the Chelsea Field reporter. This one, of course, threw me in this film, you would think that Lou would be the last guy he would try to recruit for his team. <br /> <br /> And his team is a squadron of death. They are pursuing criminals and waiting to catch them in action. Then the open door season will come. <br /> <br /> Extreme justice turned out to be too difficult to try. Of course, there would be no harm if a gang of bank robbers had finished the robbery and took them out onto the street. None of the civilians suffered when the citizens of Coffeeville did it with the Daltons. Or wait for the three rapists to finish work before entering. That's what they asked to believe here. <br /> <br /> And frankly, I could not buy it. Many good players really get lost in it.
