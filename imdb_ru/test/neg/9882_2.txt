The only reason I didn’t delete this film in 20 minutes is that we already spent 20 minutes on it ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I repeat, the ONLY effect they used, is strange capoera (from India?) Jumping on a half-meter wall / trash bins, I mean, the effects do not make a film, but ... damn ... my friend and I hoped that the whole film would give some real effect (a huge wolf ?! something!?>!?!) but noooooooooooooooooo ... all we got is a jump! on the wall 0.5 meters + they used a pharmacy ..... and they found a weapon ?! at the pharmacy ?! I mean, what the hell? Oh, I forgot, there was another effect - contact spears like green eyes! Every 10 minutes we shouted “the only thing that can save the film from shame is the giant wolf that kills them all !!! except that the script was so terrible that you do not know who you would like to die first. actually pray (and I mean PRAYER!) that the “good?!” guy will die, I hope, at the beginning. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and send letters to remove the film from all the archives of the world.
