The great production values ​​that you usually find in the film Merchant / Ivory are all here, but this is an extremely boring view of what could be a very busy affair. I agree with the earlier poster that the story does not make sense to unfold through the eyes of an African-American family, and yet their ancestor, Sally Hemmings, hardly plays any role in the process. There is not much clarity to help the audience understand the motives of any of these historical figures. And I was very worried about the accents of some characters. Nancy Marchand sounded very British for being considered a French nun. Both Gwyneth Paltrow and Greta Scacchi seemed to try different accents in different scenes. In fact, Gwyneth is very poorly served in this biopic. Her role as the daughter of Thomas Jefferson, Martha, is written in such a way that we never understand who she really is. At one moment she slaps the slave, and at another moment she condemns the whole system of slavery. Nick Nolty performs the role well enough, but he never forces us to really care about Jefferson or any of his exploits. Very disappointing overall.
