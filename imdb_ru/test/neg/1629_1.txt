Even MST3K could not make this painful, long and ultimately stunning drek funny or interesting. Although most of the bad movies themselves are very bad, this is one of those few videos where the word “bad” is literally used. <br /> <br /> An element that makes watching a movie so terrible is not a shortage of history, but the fact that SOOOO has a lot of background is full in the first half hour, that it is completely ridiculous and harder to follow than the highway when you are driving . <br /> <br /> The hero of the film торtor is nothing more than a sweet tooth for this literal energetics of the film. Dressed in a loincloth and athletic “breasts like melons,” as Joel put it, he belongs more in a fitness magazine than here. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this stupid ONLY, and I mean diehard cheese followers. If you have an enemy, recommend this movie to them. If you can handle this, I recommend you. You should be able to do this through something.
