This movie is bad. Just bad In absolute terms, bad. <br /> <br /> Dialogue jumps from the screen and strikes the face with fully artificial banter, and then defecates from your ability to detect even minor traces of subtlety. <br /> <br /> Racism is bad. Racism in Los Angeles can be especially bad. I live in the city of Angels, I can testify to that. What is so terrible about fanaticism in Los Angeles is its insidious nature. He sneaks up on you with an understanding look or a swallowed word. Until the very end of the full fist fight, he almost never goes straight and says: “Why should he be black!” <br /> <br /> I clearly see that car jackets are black, the partner of the detective is Spaniard, DA is white . As the film passes through the projector, I can let the visual effects, the music and the words lead me to this conclusion without telling me the conclusion. Emotions of the characters, and we read between the lines to make connections and conclusions. <br /> <br /> This is a partnership and trust between the director and the audience. This trust is raped by this film. <br /> <br /> A good movie attracts an audience in different directions and tells you how to get to a certain point. This film hits you with its own point of view and insults you and your intellect along the way. My unanswered question: why do we, as a society, collectively say “thank you”?
