This is not a great movie. The film is shot cliché and in many places it is a copy of the original Carrie. The parallels with the original film are striking, but with the added low probability that the telekenetic abilities are innate. <br /> <br /> I can’t say that I didn’t like the film, because at least it took a couple of hours ... but they were accepted, as one could read an unpretentious book on a long train journey. This book would not have been a great literature, but for some time it would have absorbed it, and soon after that it would be forgotten, since it would fit into numerous other books in which clichés sounded. Similarly, the film was fine, although it continued, but maybe you can forget it. At least I think so. I can't remember much about it now !!
