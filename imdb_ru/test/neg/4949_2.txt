I just watched the Marathon "Lawsuits" on TV. The episode was identical to the plot of this film, right down to the secret of incest and the plot of “romance with my sister.” I don’t recall any reason for rejecting a true story, but in fact everything is written MOW. Obviously, it tells about the real murder of Ruby Morris by her husband Earl, sentenced to 25 years for her murder. Just to show you, the truth may be more strange than fiction, because I thought that the plot of Lifetime was invented and more than “stretched” how true. I am with other authors who said the game was bad. I did not notice this with all the players, though. It was really the protagonist, the daughter, whose performance was bad.
