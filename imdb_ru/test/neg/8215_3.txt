** May contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> The main character, a nobleman named Fallon, was stuck on an island with such stupid and deadly characters that it might be better for him to drown. Count Lorente de Sade (pronounced “di Side”) speaks with his own hallucinations and sees all the intruders on the island as invading pirates. He usually beats the silent servant Anna and torments his unwitting guests in prison. The occasional laughter is provided by the giant “Nubian” slave of the praying mantis, who speaks with an accent from the deep south and helps de Sade track the violators in the style of the most dangerous game. De Sad's mad wife, ruined by leprosy, gives some really scary moments when she wanders around the dungeon and hugs a helplessly fettered prisoner. (This scene was watched on night television by many children who brought the memory to adulthood.) One almost normal person in sight is Cassandra, who has self-deprecation before science. (“I used to be a nurse, now I don’t do anything special.”) She and Fallon plan to escape and end up meeting an enemy more formidable than de Sade and Mantis combined. <br /> <br /> This film was shot in San Antonio and directed by a man more competent in creating horror comics than in horror movies. (I will say so much for Mr. Boyett - he demonstrates his obsession with the infection here, as he did in his comic books.) This is more like Andy Milligan's melodrama minus the woodcutters. Periodic wardrobe, library music, mistreatment of people with disabilities, and general misanthropy make you wonder if Andy was called as a consultant. However, Milligan made the best costumes and wrote the best dialogue. There are too many technical mistakes to list here, but you know that this click is in trouble when you see a shipwreck opening up that looks like it was shot in an aquarium. In addition, in a film made in Texas, there should have been real spiders and snakes, not rubber ones. Gorgeous Eastmancolor gives this melodrama a bright look, which it so richly deserves. Fallon's first meeting with the leper countess is really terrible, as is the parting film shot. If everyone else was half so scary, the DANGON OF BOOK would be a classic of terror. Instead, it's a fun thing that jerks will love for all the wrong reasons.
