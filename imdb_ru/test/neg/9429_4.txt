If good intentions made the film great, then this movie could be one of the greatest films ever made. There are great actors in the film, the main director, an important topic - at least an important topic, a shade of the existential fatigue of the world of the fifties, aerial scenes that were supposed to excite both feelings and imagination, and characters that you could think deeply about It is about patriotism and healthy patriotism. <br /> <br /> Less than ten years after the film, as I knew the officers of the Air Force who trained my R.O.T.S. classes at the university. They were intellectuals. They thought deeply about their work. They have a sense of humor. One of them was a member of the crew of the first aircraft, which dropped the hydrogen bomb. I wondered if any of them died in Vietnam. I believe they performed missions there. Unfortunately, the film failed. The film lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feelings and celebration of patriotism itself, which emphasizes the narration. No actress was used worse than June Allison in this film. Her Susan Holland is a woman from whom you can run, not hug. Colonel James Stewart (who at the time was a colonel) copes well with this role of lieutenant colonel (and then colonel) of the Dutch Holland. But the most interesting thing he does in this role is biting a sandwich. I am not kidding. Stewart was good at biting sandwiches like in the spirit of St. Louis. <br /> <br /> You might think of Ted Williams, but I don’t think when I look at Mr. Steward in the role. I think William Holden is Lt. Harry Brubaker from Bridges to Toko-Ri. The comparison is not good for Mr. Stuart, who seems to have been wasted in this film. <br /> <br /> Shots taken from the B-36 look like commercials for the airline. Although aerial shots are beautiful, they are mundane. At that time, they could impress the audience. The disaster in Greenland includes restless modeling. You expect the result to be good. <br /> <br /> The subtitle is subtext — the film sounds the boredom that the Air Force flight crews were to experience during their long missions and the commonplace that the Air Force used to run a business — well, like any other business. Someone imagines how the director of “La Nouvelle Vague” can explore this topic, and then begins to think about how a person with imagination could make this film. Little moments missed. When the crews returned from long missions, crew members received scotch and massage before summing up the mission. A show of what might help. <br /> <br /> Banality was the way the BBC wanted, and Mr. Mann took the lead. Perhaps in this sense, the film works, but not for me. <br /> <br /> I grieve when I watch a film, because I think that all of us, the director, the actors, the film crew, the audience and the members of the armed forces might like to give and receive much more than we get here. <br /> <br /> I don’t think that this film should have been Dr. Strangelova or 2001, both of which he foretells, but he had the potential to never realize. However, I like to watch this. I think of pilots in their long flights and ground crews in isolated places. A certain sense of honor is celebrated here, and I celebrate this honor. <br /> <br /> Of course, I understand why people who praise this film here and in other places appreciate it. If there were not a deliberate mistake, I would get 10 points. <br /> <br />
