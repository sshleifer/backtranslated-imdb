This film spent 2 hours of my time and just makes me scream: "LAME". Nicholas Stoller is writing the film “Yes, dude,” but the director, “this,” maybe he should continue writing. <br /> <br /> I am so disappointed because I heard all the wonderful reviews. I expected something like flown. They say it is from the creator of the "hit"? Why I do not see the similarities? but it seemed to me that it was a small film with an excessive topic. I am so disappointed. In fact, this is not bad if you view it as a film with your regular girls, but this character of the “guy from the group” just gets on my nerves They have some funny lines and scenes, but I don’t feel originality. And the final makes the film a little better. At the very least, the end is not a boring cliche.
