The latest release in the “Karate Kid” series is predictable, does not work well and is so bad that it borders on the pleasant. But not really, it's just bad. In this issue, Rafe Macchio "Karate Kid" is absent, he was already in one of too many episodes. New Baby, played by Hillary Swank, is a teenage granddaughter of one of Miyogi’s buddies in World War II. Her parents died recently, and her grandmother unsuccessfully trying to raise this young helion. In the steps Mr. Miyogi, to fix it. According to the formula, there is a group of neo-fascist hooligans, called Alpha soldiers, who should be put in their place, and a new karate, called Mantis. As I said, this movie is a mess and should be avoided.
