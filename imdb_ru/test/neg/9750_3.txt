I just saw this movie. I liked the soundtrack. At first I saw the trailer, and it was great, like all Hollywood movies, they know how to sell. But the film is almost terrible, the first 30 minutes are interesting, but then .... how to blow up almost all new films. I do not understand why this child died ?? Is it a cliché, every movie should have a nigga child who needs to be killed, and everyone should be good after his death. Listen up I do not understand what is the connection with the film ... And it is so predictable, you know the end from the first minutes. Nothing new in this movie. I saw the same idea of ​​“you were served”, but also ... something new ... it is something like “Dear”, but there is no difference between them. If you have no other choice, watch this movie, but rest assured, this is the last option you choose. And the choreography is the worst in the world. This is NOT necessarily to see ...
