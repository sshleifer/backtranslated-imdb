I am from Australia and respectfully followed the extraordinary culture that surrounds rugby in New Zealand. I can fully appreciate the comments made by Qiwi regarding this film. It was a complete insult to the race of people and their favorite sport. <br /> <br /> Anyone who took part in making this brutal film should have made a formal apology to anyone who had the misfortune to watch it. Note: people do NOT get on their knees and do not cry, slowly pronouncing Hakka. What a miserable scene it was. <br /> <br /> Should we have any sympathy for this idiot who almost killed his girlfriend, who refused to listen to any advice from someone with a hemisphere, and then, obviously, saw the light? What an unfriendly character (visiting children's hospitals does nothing to redeem his despicable personality). <br /> <br /> And why do people even make a film about Americans playing rugby? They almost do not appear in the sport on the world stage, not so much as to even justify trying to make a film about it (yes, rugby is a “world” sport, unlike graidone and baseball)?
