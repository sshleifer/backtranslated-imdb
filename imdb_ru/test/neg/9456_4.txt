Oh !! What a mess we have here. Not so much a mess as a painfully boring, undervalued excuse for exploitation. Brought to you by the one and only, JJ "Pat" Patterson, yes, the same one, from the mountain of Samogon. I think Dr. Gore, formerly known as The Body Shop, is somewhat inspired by Frankenstein, and God knows what else. The late Mr. Patterson also plays a major role in this joke, being a heartbroken scientist / plastic surgeon who recently lost his wife in a car accident and goes mad with grief, and it becomes clear that the next step is to kill countless females, and then it is possible to rob several graves for parts of the body in order to “collect” the perfect mate. It will not be easy, but, thank God, his friend, Gregg, the hunchback, can reach out and give moral support. <br /> <br /> If you ever need proof that the goals of some nations are not intended to be fulfilled, here it is, a gang. This hay Patterson, obviously, never had any business, directing something, especially, following in the footsteps of good old G. as a master of blood. I have never seen a horrible film that simply refuses to give the viewer at least one reason to keep watching. Even blood is boring. From time to time it is almost ridiculous, but it is impossible to say whether it is intentional or not. I choose not. <br /> <br /> Filmed in Charolotte, North Carolina (the house of the California Ax Massacre), on a likely three-digit budget for a guy as worthless as he could have been, who was probably grateful for the garbage in the car, so maybe we should give a good old JG break, I mean, he tried (I guess) that more can be said for most, and this movie is better than any of the high-budget superheroes junkies that cinemas produce in these days, though, I understand, it says little. In addition, Dr. Gore significantly improved Patterson’s previous failure, the Electric Chair, so it’s possible that he would have improved his skills on time if he hadn’t died, so perhaps it’s not that awful, especially compared to another DVD movie, how to make a doll, so what the hell is check it out. 4/10
