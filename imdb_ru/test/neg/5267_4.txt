I was really looking forward to watching this movie. It had all the components of a great tongue in the cheek, but it just didn’t connect EVERYTHING. Kevin Spacey's accent was tolerable, except that he sometimes forgot to use it, and I would NOT have to listen to Linda Fiorentino's pale attempt. She and Helen Baksendale completely lacked charm and individuality, fortunately, their children had many things on the screen, so you could find at least some members from his 2 families. You could strain the spaghetti with the plot, and I am sure that the script was written by some teenage schoolboy at a school competition in English. However, when I didn’t cringe, I smirked, so it wasn’t wasted 90 minutes. I found the picture overlay of Kevin's face very clever and rather funny. Maybe I’m a bit rude, but I’d expect a bit of high-quality viewing, but he never came.
