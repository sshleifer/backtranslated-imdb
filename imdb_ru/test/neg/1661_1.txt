I understand that the budget for this film was low, but this is really a terrible movie. The script is just awful, and it was a free part. The effects are not bad, but this film unfolds like a regular R-rated film, with unconvincing fears and cruel violence, and not with impunity without the star-fierce festival that was specially made for the video. Who are these guys joking? As if it would be released in cinemas. <br /> <br /> The game is terrible. Editing, another free aspect of the film, goes beyond the amateur, and the plot, as I said, leaves much to be desired. There is nothing original in the film. Fans of Horus, avoid it. The creators of the film: next time try something original or stop shooting all together. You are not good at it. People hate trashy stir, especially one of these low-caliber ones. TO AVOID! Don't even laugh at this.
