This is one of those religious horror films that never explains why the forces of "evil" are 10,000 times stronger than the forces of "good." We have a satanic cult here that can: 1) “radiate” people (as in Star Trek), 2) kill with the help of small children's dolls, 3) transfer the soul from one body to another, 4) hypnotize telepathically from distances, and 5) cause harsh car accidents in which individuals turn into spaghetti, while others (in this case children) survive unharmed. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the forces of "good" can: 1) sit helplessly, 2) stand idle, 3) panic, 4) laugh hysterically, 5) spend time doing nothing, 6) read comics while dozens are killed and 7) come too late for satanic rituals. <br /> <br /> In every religious horror movie I have to assume that the world of this film is inhabited by God and Satan. I must assume that Satan cannot be 1,000,000 times more powerful if the film does not have a hellish world order. In other words, where were the sacred Iki in this film who knew something? The best thing a priest could do was to guess that there were some witches — and nothing else — from reading all these books in his office. At first glance at the violence the priest becomes catatonic, then laughs hysterically, only to end up in a serious panic attack. So, should this be God's contribution to the fight against Satan? Ridiculous. Every good religious horror film has the power of "good" equipped with some form or ) supernatural power or, p At least some of the specific knowledge of how to deal with "evil." In this sense, this film is rather idiotic. As with the creation of Martin's roll, to play the high priest (!) Of the Cult. Watching the bizarre Martin, the leading satanic ritual, is a very small threat or thrill. I mean, it doesn't have to be Christopher Lee or Langella, but could they not find someone less funny? Also, why does the couple return to the city after their car is decommissioned? After their "friendly" meeting with the people of the city, no sensible person would return; they should just go on. A man explains to his girlfriend (and the viewer) that "who knows what is in that direction."
