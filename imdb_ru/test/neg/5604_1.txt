What kind of production, what a waste of time and money on the screen. This is what some European so-called producer of a science fiction film thinks. Take the former model, Alexandra Camp, connect with the American actor of the c-class and find one of the most famous producers of the movie business, Harry A. Towers. Then Towers finds some little-known Munich work. House, Tandem Communication, Rola Bauer, and then mix it all up without any script, and you’ll get Sumuru, the priceless gem among the worst movies ever made! Get people alive, and do something else, no matter what you do, no movies, please! On top of that, the producers went to South Africa for filming. What you see on the screen is one giant sand hole where the “action” takes place, between extremely bad actors and extremely bad players, that any student of the film will be better.
