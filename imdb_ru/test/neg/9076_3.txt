Other reviews talked about how frank this film is, especially in terms of male nudity. Well, those who have seen Grande Ecole with her often naked actors and expecting something like that are in for a big disappointment. With the exception of a few seconds in the judo team dressing room, the shower of the two neighbors lasts a total of 15 seconds. The female lead has relatively short frontal moments. Most of the marketing of this film is aimed at gay audiences, but those who expect even a hint of homo erotism between two men (best friends who have a three-way relationship with one of their friends) will be most disappointed. There is not even a hint that someone is interested in others, or even barely realizes that the other is part of a troika. Like the movie, Douches Froides is curiously unappealing; the viewer understands very little who these three young people are, how they feel, why they behave like they are. Approximately one hour of the original cut was removed; perhaps that is why the finished film seems frustratedly underdeveloped. Stick to Grande Ecole, a French film that more than fulfills its promise.
