Is the 210-minute version (very hardcore or, as I heard) or is the R-rated version released in theaters? Of course, both are terribly awful. Peter O'Toole and Malcolm McDowell both said they would like them to never make this film (the last of the two men reported this in an interview with IMDb!), And I understand why. Nothing but a meaningless mess of porno erotica and a half-time conspiracy attempt. Not <br /> <br /> There’s not much to do here, apart from cheap stunts and silly scenes. I liked what McDowell himself said about the film: “It was like one moment when I watch, admire my mule or something, and the next scene will be two lesbians going to it.” <br /> <br /> true. <br /> <br /> What a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars.
