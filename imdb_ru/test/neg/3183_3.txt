Before I got to work as a reviewer, I never went to such films and thus remained blissfully unaware that at the heart of a Hollywood film lies a spirit that hates a woman that thrives when she puts her banging knees on silver screen for everything to either sympathize or vilify. Or is it just a particularly bad year? Ugly trend? <br /> <br /> Here we have another seemingly sweet, innocent, beautiful woman who has become a deadly weapon. The kind that warns us that under each pair of batting eyes and nesting instincts lies a wild-eyed beast, guaranteed to turn everyone’s lives within 50 miles to hell. <br /> <br /> This month’s sample is the Valentine's (Liv Tyler) Jewel), whose simple dreams include a private house, a backyard fountain, and the mondo home entertainment system. Unfortunately, Randy (Matt Dillon, in her first film for 3 years), the bartender with dim lights, which she takes for one night in McCool, intending to rob, is less financially oriented. The guy who drinks beer from the toilet plunger prefers to sit in his dead mother's house with little comfort to save his snowball collection. <br /> <br /> In the same bar with a low rent, the Devil in a red dress also stumbles upon Randy's cousin Carl (very funny Paul Reiser), an ego-sized lawyer the size of St. Louis. When things go south for a few hours, enter the widowed detective with a heart of gold (John Goodman). Result? Three men experience large and severe crushing in the leopard offspring of Stephen Tyler and Bebe Buell, which cause them to do what common sense is usually contraindicated. For example, to be involved in the process. <br /> <br /> Many perspectives and flashbacks bring together news on the first page about how easy it is to become a victim of your libido, especially if you are a man. As each of these people associates their point of view with a confidant, his desire to possess the Gemstone colors the “truth” of the situation. After about 70 minutes, things are pretty funny. But this is the very source that tells you that popcorn actually tastes like butter. <br /> <br /> MCCOOL'S is the first film by Norwegian commercial and music video director Harald Zwart, and his lineage is clear during some fantasy segments, including car wash, soap and hose, which you can probably extrapolate. This is also a debut project from a production company owned by Michael Douglas, who found his niche in the form of a tuft in a bingo salon. <br /> <br /> Dillon and Tyler are unlikely to win any gold statues for this, although given the one-dimensionality of their exaggerated noir-style characters, you cannot blame them. Several minor roles deceived by unexpected guests - Reba McIntir plays the psychiatrist Carl, and Andrew Dice Clay plays the role of Utah's bully and his even more frightening brother. (Finally, a way out for all this aggression.) <br /> <br /> This film unwittingly talks about the dynamics between men and women - or men and their moms. But in the end, you will probably find more persistent psychological truths in the Bugs Bunny episode. I will say that it is better, funnier, more sophisticated than other recent jewels, such as TOMCATS, but should we really choose what to look for based on what is the lowest in the misogynist scale?
