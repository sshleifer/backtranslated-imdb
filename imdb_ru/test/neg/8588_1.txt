Another unsuccessful attempt to make the film "sandy" and "evoking thought" - whatever the hell that means. They have Al Pacino says a lot of words like - "Television killed football." Yes whatever. This is another film that features Oliver Stone's “Magnificence of Greatness”. If Stone is trying to show us that football will be our fall or something like that, why does he insist on romanticizing the sport with his stilted camera movements and Kid Rock songs? He even throws Cameron Diaz into a fight for purely aesthetic reasons. It is a pity that Diaz and Pacino have to meet in such a bad film. <br /> <br /> Since Scent of Woman, screenwriters and directors have used Pacino to romanticize their pathetic scenes. His characters are nothing but loudspeakers — their voices hide what would normally be superfluous and banal. He needs to reinvent himself, showing how he can act without shouting. He should stop feeling sorry for hockey scenarios with fun lessons like “Organized football went bad” and play a good story.
