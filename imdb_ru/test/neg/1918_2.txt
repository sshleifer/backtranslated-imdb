Life is too short to waste two hours of Hollywood nonsense, like this one, unless you're an ignorant, naive 16-year-old girl with no sense of reality and nothing better. Boring characters, bad acting (artificial emotions), a weak story, a slow pace and the most important thing for this film is a vicious existence - nobody cares about excessively dramatic relationships.
