This is the best example I can come up with to prove the theory that when good ideas run out in Hollywood, they make a terrible continuation and destroy the first one. Don't get me wrong, I really love the first Beastmaster; I even liked the third one, pretty good, but this film is terrible. I am a big fan of fantasy / sword and magic, and I didn’t want to see such a horrible sequel made for such classics as the first Beastmaster. So why do I hate this movie so much? Well, where do I start? First, the very idea of ​​the movie is ridiculous. Dar and his evil elder brother Arklon (which was not mentioned anywhere in the first film ... Eh?) Cross our world through the convenient spatial gate of the portal of time. You see, the Earth is just on the same parallel interdimensional plane as the world of Dara. Considering that with the first film you are made to think that the film is happening only in the past, but with this you are shown that this is a completely different world ... this is only one of many things that I hated in this sequel. He did not work with the "Masters of the Universe", and, of course, does not work here either! Such films should take place and remain within their own time frame and in their normal environment. For God's sake, what's next? Hercules in New York ... uh ... bad example! Moving on ... <br /> <br /> Arklon is looking for a device called a neutron detonator to use as a threat to his enemies to control his kingdom. So Dar, his ferrets, his eagle and his tiger (this time not painted with spray) must leave and save the world ... but along the way they get the help of a young, tough, and poor daughter of a senator who gets caught up in all this mess and she shows Dar in Los Angeles, takes him for a walk in her BMW and helps to get him out of difficult situations here and there. How convenient, right? Speaking of convenience, I found that it is very convenient and easy for Arklon to penetrate a well-guarded military base and escape with stolen, extremely destructive nuclear weapons ... even with half of the US Army and L.A.P. after him .... vaaaaaaaa easy even to an evil barbarian sorcerer from another world. There are so many holes in the plot, I don’t know where to start; for example, why Arkon went to the zoo LA at the end of the movie?!? He has absolutely no reason to go there at all; and wouldn't it be the last place where you would lure your greatest enemy, who happens to have a convenient opportunity to MANAGE ANIMALS? <br /> <br /> And you don’t like such films, the police are portrayed as a complete idiot, and even with half a dozen policemen shooting at the same guy, they still can't hit him? The police in this film belong to the Police Academy series! They are about as useful in this film as reading glasses for the blind! Even the name of the film does not make sense: “Beastmaster 2: through the portal of time” ... they never actually passed through the portal of “time”, because the film does not occur in the future world of Dar, it is installed in a parallel world along our astral plane, therefore, they NEVER pass through time, only the spatial world along its own; so no actual time travel involved at all! This film is trying to seem ridiculous, and this is not because of humor, but because it is so bad, and this is putting it mildly. Acting, dialogue, plot, characters and finals are all so much fun that it's fun. What else can I expect from the guy who brought us the “Swamp Return” (another bad sequel)? Here there is a great lack of excellent direction and a serious sense of Don Coscarelli first! Avoid this stinky garbage like bubonic plague and a stick that is first and possibly third if there is nothing better on TV.
