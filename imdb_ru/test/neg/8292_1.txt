Although I'm a longtime fan of Shatner (as we used to watch the Track restart during the lunch break in the early 70s), I can't think of any possible reason why he wanted to make this film, whether for personal development or business the reasons. Did he lose the bet? <br /> <br /> As a movie fan, I like to appreciate bad movies along with good ones. But Shoot or Be Shot has nothing special or funny, unintended or not. <br /> <br /> While there was not a single nominal scene, there were no unwanted scenes (blink or miss nudity, cartoon shot) violence "with endless bullet shootings), so we can assume that the producers just wanted to save money needed to get the MPAA to appreciate it.This will pave the way for the telegram in just 10 seconds. Of the eight people who were in the theater with us, four of them went halfway, muttering statements like stupid. "<br /> <br /> Shatner plays an escaped mentally ill person who would denied release because he considers himself a screenwriter. The examining board seals his INSANE request with a seal. He is confronted with a group of directors of the Z-rank, who are "filmed because it is 80% cheaper than in the movies" and they decide to make them shoot his script at gunpoint.There are several background scenes that develop some minor characters, but for the most part this is the whole movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to spend 90 minutes on a Shatner feature film, see Free Enterprise, a much better film.
