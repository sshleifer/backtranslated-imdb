Alas, it seems that the golden times of stylish Italian cinema have sunk into oblivion. And the recent brainchild of the famous director Lamberto Bava is another obvious confirmation of this assumption. <br /> <br /> I was lucky to see many films from this prolific director (such as Body Puzzle, Delerium, Macabre and both Demons). Although they were not completely satisfied, they were never so boring. <br /> <br /> The suspicion that this new record in my DVD collection was thrown to the wind, appeared shortly after the car crash scene showed awkwardness and low probability. body position under an inverted machine. <br /> <br /> In the course of the heavy chain of events that followed, a sense of superficiality grew. <br /> <br /> Stupid dialogues, a meaningless scenario and a complete waste of talent from an international composition. The only character who provided a more or less tolerable performance was Markâ€™s mischievous son, who pumped out all the boredom. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the work of the son of Mario in all respects could hardly be hailed. <br /> <br /> I look forward to meeting his House of Assassins, which we hope will be an improvement.
