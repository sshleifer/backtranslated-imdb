This film was released in the UK under the name Blood Rites. He was completely banned and never transmitted again for release. <br /> <br /> As “Terrible”, he was supposedly a hit by the hungry residents of the famous Grindhaus track on 42nd Street in New York. If you are looking for some kind of bloody horror, then you will find it in this film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, to see how Kolin (Hal Borske) with disabilities has fun with a live rabbit, you have to come to terms with the shaky 16-millimeter camera work, thanks to which Ed Wood looks amazingly positive. <br /> <br /> Three sisters must spend three days in the family estate with their husbands before the old man’s money is paid. Naturally, in such a situation, people begin to fall dead. Family secrets are revealed and much blood has been shed, especially during the terrible dismemberment. <br /> <br /> The British may have objected to this, I know what I did.
