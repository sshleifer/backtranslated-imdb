Since I just finished the book, Mrs. Dalloway 'Virginia Woolf, I was thrilled to see that it was on one of the movie channels last weekend. However, I was faced with a boring, incomprehensible and meaningless film. No one can completely blame the film, he tried his best with the material that he had, but when the source material is Virginia Woolf, and almost completely written in a spirit of conscience with long periods of internalization and little actual dialogue, one would think it should not be made a film just because you can make a movie out of it. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave, who plays the main role, deserves no guilt for the failure of this film, as well as other actors. It's just a film that is impossible to understand from the story that Wolfe wrote, and did not even try. Do not watch a movie, read a book. <br /> <br /> Shelley
