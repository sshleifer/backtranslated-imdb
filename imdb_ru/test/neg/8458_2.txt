I used to think that “This is from Hollywood” was the worst movie I’ve seen that showed clips from horror films, fiction, crime and drama. Of course, I have not seen this beauty. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with the “Terror in the aisles”? Four things: <br /> <br /> 1) It is assumed that the most remarkable moments in the history of shock cinema began in the 70s, when directors such as John Carpenter and Brian De Palma appeared. And which bones are thrown into the true classics (that is, black and white films), such as Frankenstein, Dracula and The Wolfman, or shown with Martin and Lewis, or with Abbott and Costello, or not at all ! br /> <br /> 2) In most cases, the clips are so short and do not correspond to the original places, which simply shock the viewer, and for those who are not familiar with these films, there is no sense at all (actually, the moment when the shark jumps out of the water at Roy Shader in “Jaws”, has a strong effect on the aiming effect. In the context of the original, it was valid.) <br /> <br /> 3) Are we really in need of Pleasance and Allen in the audience, us, that "this is just a movie" or that much of the violence in horror films, "unfortunately uw against women "? So, is this an accusation against filmmakers for adding these scenes or viewers who run to the cinema and watch the same food again and again? Sorry, this is a whole jar of worms that can be opened for a more decent movie. <br /> <br /> 4) And most importantly, why is the film so SHORT? Not that such films were not enough. If they had just opened up their resources and used EVERY accessible film, they could have had “This is fun!”, Which would be relatively more interesting. Hell, even pull Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing (then Cushing was alive, mind you), and even better, even Vincent Price would be more than ready, I bet you! What joy IT would get from the audience! <br /> <br /> But no ... all we have left is a boring little click that pretends that it does justice to these films, but all he does is leave the viewer to feel cheated less than 90 minutes in which they could go and see a REAL movie. Do not get me wrong; It was nice to see which clips they showed, but if they could do more with the product! <br /> <br /> Two stars. Another good idea is to leave lying in the aisles.
