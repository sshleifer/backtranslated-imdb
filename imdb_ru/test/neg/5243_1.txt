No doubt this is the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Bad game. Bad scenario Bad direction and poor production. <br /> <br /> Why are they even worried? This whole film was a complete nonsense. Suspending disbelief can go this far, but it is pushing the boundaries completely. <br /> <br /> For a movie without humor, the public often laughed anxiously ...
