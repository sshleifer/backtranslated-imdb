Big fat whore "Uncle Buck" played by John (eating a lot) Candy visits sane family members for a week to look after the children of two cute children (Gabi Hoffman and McCowley Culkin) and a cute but avid teenager (Jean Louise Kelly) . Shenanigans begin when Buck makes breakfast and then tries to sleep on a bed that is too small for his body. <br /> <br /> Mostly boring, but strewn with two or three funny scenes, including Buck trying to talk on the phone with his wicked girlfriend (Amy Madigan) and meets a very disgusting clown. <br /> <br /> Candy looks like it weighs 600 pounds.
