Growing up on westerns and considering the current shortage of westerns on television and in the theater, I was looking forward to the Comanche moon. <br /> <br /> After seeing two nights and not another, it appeared to have been shot with a limited budget. Stars level Robert Duval and Tommy Lee Jones are clearly absent. There is Val Kilmer, but what the hell is going on with him? Four or five buildings on either side of the street plus the Scull mansion make up the entire city of Austin. The capitol is never seen, only inside the governorâ€™s office. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is often hoarse, meaningless. The storyline is divided. In general, completely forgotten.
