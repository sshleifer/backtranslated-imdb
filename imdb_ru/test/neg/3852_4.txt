The only reason anyone wants to see this film is John Leguizamo. I remember a preview, and it looked like another second-rate comedy. But the fact that Mr. Leguizamo was filming tried to redeem him. His name, as far as it was known at the time or not, was trying to sell it. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed with the performance of the Leguizamo. His days at Baggina’s House (In Living Color clone) were his pinnacle. There is a fine line between tomfoolery and idiocy, and we just say that the Leguizamo crossed it ten times. He looked like he was trying to be too outrageous and mad for the camera. In fact, I will say that he tried too hard. Crazy humor turned into stupidity, and the film was spoiled. I can not say that I accused him, if you were given this opportunity, you would have tried your best, right? Although your zeal cost you dearly, Mr. Leguizamo ... <br /> <br /> The pest follows the traditions of any comedy film, plays a "racing card" and much more. No group stayed out of ridicule. Among the selected blacks, Hispanics, whites, Jews, Koreans, Germans, homosexuals and the blind. Again here, things are getting too overboard, and trying too hard to fool in too short a time. The resolution of the film takes all five minutes to clarify the situation and return to normal life. <br /> <br /> When you have a movie, and you are going to get around the plot and reality for the sake of comedy, just make sure it’s funny, or all you have is 90 minutes of pointless movie. That pretty well summed up the "Pest" Leguizamo ...
