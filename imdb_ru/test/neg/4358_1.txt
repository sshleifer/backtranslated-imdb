I really hope that the creators of these “films” will read these reviews so that they know that people just don’t want their films. They are just rubbish and embarrassment for the horror genre of the killer clown. whether it was better than the first doesn’t matter, because both of them are just awful. I'm surprised they didn't learn the lesson from the first movie. Stop now !! Warning for viewers of horror films, DO NOT LOOK, RENT OR SEE IN THE BOXES OF "URBAN" HORRIBLE FILMS, AND EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING, DO NOT BUY THEM !!!!
