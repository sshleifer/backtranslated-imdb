Could you explain why someone would like to make a crime film “British neo-noir” with an almost entirely American composition? The accents mentioned in this film are damn terrible! But fully in accordance with the actions that are so wooden, you can be afraid of striking the arson of the actors. <br /> <br /> Really, what is this disgusting, idiotic, cynical brat? Even in neo-noir films there is some character that you either feel or want to experience, even if they are unhappy and doomed; they, at least, have the decency for them, some feeling that they did something wrong, or that a seemingly good plan went wrong, and that they are somehow responsible for it. <br /> <br /> Not in this smelly stew. These characters are rotten, they betray each other, themselves and the public. <br /> <br /> Also, notice that they are people with a low standard of living - everything is in order, there is nothing wrong with that - except for the fact that they seem to live a life of luxury. petty thieves, the key point here is ennui. It's all so awfully boring and stupid, you know. So let's just tear some people away, or maybe kill them, and go to a luxury hotel. What ambitions! <br /> <br /> Bringing this whole mess to some bottom of the swamp mud: a boring uneven step; predictable sequences of actions that are not; banal and rambling set design; made for bad tv work and editing; forgetful evaluation; and the complete absence of any fantasy or innovation in production and directing. <br /> <br /> Absolutely unbelievable, unbelievable, and for less loyal viewers of the cinema (or masochists), such as myself, is completely unnoticeable. <br /> <br /> There are other unpleasant things that I would like to say about this dirty film, but they would not print them here. Suffice it to say that you are likely to find something more rewarding for your time than watching this film - almost everything, in fact.
