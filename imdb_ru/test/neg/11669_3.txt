Even considering my shameless love for the first two films in the franchise and sweeping away any prejudicial addictions that I could have for the character of Max, I simply cannot bring myself to appreciate on average this caricature waste of space that it almost soiled before. <br /> <br /> A cruel, foul streak that brought a sense to Mad Max Rokatanskyâ€™s character left, an impressive sense of desolation in the apocalyptic world, and more importantly, the passion of the director George Miller for the franchise. The terrible assessment corresponds to the cartoon heart of the film, it seems that the producers really did not know what to do with the amount of money allocated for this third (and, fortunately, the last) installment. I am sure that the tricks are aimed at {waiting by now}, and, of course, Miller manages to draw a desert desert landscape, simply rising from what he did before. Nevertheless, he clearly fought for fresh ideas in this battle, as The Warrior's crowned glory about the pursuit of Petrol Tanker is reproduced here, only he uses the train instead !!. <br /> <br /> This is just a very bad show, which may seem like an ambitious turn of events in the mid-1980s; but now, when they watch three films together, Thunderdome simply turns out to be a director, losing his sharp approach, and, unfortunately, found himself between a mixture of comedy and fantasy action. And the truth is that none of these genre slogans would work alone, in the context of this series, anyway. I give a 3/10 movie solely for one really good battle sequence in Thunder House, while the stuntmen here deserve some respect at least. But this is the third time when I tried to love this film, and, despite the fact that, like me, no doubt, a glutton, I will not try again, ever.
