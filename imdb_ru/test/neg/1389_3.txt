I’m surprised that the comparison between Mind of Mencia and the television program Awful Truth, which worked several years ago, has not yet been made. Accompanied by controversial director Michael Moore, the show will start on the same estate as the show, with Moore interacting with the audience and representing the segments, namely short documentaries and skits that have been brought together to evoke thoughts of current issues. Differences? Mencia rarely delves into the surface and reactionary. What he says and does is often conniving and rude and insults his audience’s ability to make decisions for themselves. There is a difference between being “sharp”, with whom I have no problems, but Mencia is trying too hard to do this, and as a result, he is arrogant and with little support. He, however, makes glasses from time to time, but often, in order to get to them, one has to sit in some pretty daze, trying to shock him with humor.
