SPOILER - This film gives plot points and discusses the ending. I hated this film - mainly for political reasons, as well as for moral and aesthetic reasons. Politically, this film glorified war and military technology - blowing things up really well. We are pleased when the music swells, and the Afghans use our weapons to smash the Russians to pieces. And no American soldiers endanger their lives - so this is a fun war. From an aesthetic point of view, the film does not feel real human emotions, only self-satisfied, privileged people are sarcastic, feel superior and do whatever they want, regardless of the consequences. And if we talk about the consequences, the film only a few times struck those who were actually led by the weapons of the Afghans. I read the previous draft of this script, and it ended on 9/11 - Charlie Wilson realized that everything went wrong. But it would not leave the audience feel good. This is a good movie about the murder of Russian. And it made me sick.
