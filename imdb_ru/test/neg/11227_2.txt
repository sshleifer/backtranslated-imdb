I have seen the worst, which is an indirect way of saying how disgusting this film was. The plot is ridiculous: the student shoots a policeman, and five more capture him hostage? In a dimly lit, smoky New York school - and somehow this cliché situation with hostages takes 24 hours? Are you serious? Is the hostage situation all day long — with a wounded NYPD officer taking the least of a day? I understand that this film was made before 9/11, but still. I looked at my watch and thought how they could tighten this excessive plot for another hour and 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> The game was mediocre at best, and the characters seemed to have been invented by graders. Child abuse, frightened pregnant girl, gangster group, bewildered unhappy victim, wise white guy. You are welcome. <br /> <br /> Trying to turn this hostage situation into a mission for “more textbooks” and improving school conditions? Please - this is a weak attempt to justify writing a film about a child who shoots a policeman. These are tangled, ignorant idiots who fall into a stupid - far-fetched - situation. Do not try to draw them, suddenly, like a noble one. The funniest thing is Ziggy, who lives in the school’s attic and is so admired by Michaelangelo that he draws these amazing scenes on the walls. You must be joking. <br /> <br /> Are there signs of "not racism" in the protesting crowd? The black guy shoots a black cop and the black negotiator tries to fix it. This is a random post. <br /> <br /> I understand the general message, which was poorly depicted, although some of the actors went on a decent career. <br /> <br /> Although it was a joke, red sniper lasers on the roof? The worst scene was a child, fake snow, dying in the arms of his buddy on the roof, “promise me”, etc. How original. <br /> <br /> Epilogue “I’m in jail, but now I’m the law at XYZ University" ... the right way to end a movie joke
