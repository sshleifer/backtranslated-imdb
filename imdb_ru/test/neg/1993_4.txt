It's okay ... in a few years Chaefsky's classic “Network” will become his real cinematic BIG home show ... but now this dark comedy is not the classic to which it aspires. This is mostly terrible, although there are some good scenes in it: the first murder victim, the ER clerk responsible for billing patients for an unexpected discovery, Drummond's crazy confession and the latest scene where Scott's character restores his professional integrity and self-esteem. It also has some ridiculous scenes: Scott's weeping monologue during his early visit to the hospital psychiatrist, Scott’s character, Rigg’s violent character, Dysart’s horrible robbery in his short scenes, and OR The doctor pounces on the operating table to reanimate the wrong patient, because "I already have one claim of negligence." <br /> <br /> Chaefsky also tries TOO HARD to scatter every conceivable obstacle in this one hospital (i.e., mistakes, protesting poor people on the street, etc.). This could work better if you look at the industry as a whole. Acting wisely: Scott is demolished, Rigg seems mistaken, Hughes is inspired, and Dysart ponders his short speech. The rest of the cast is TOO one-dimensional.
