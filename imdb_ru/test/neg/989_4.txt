Talk about being boring! <br /> <br /> I got it, waiting for a fascinating insight into the life of the person who wrote the mythical Night on the Galactic Railway. I expected to see crazy stories and jokes of an eccentric person and learn his inspiration for such strange material. Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Spring and Chaos are mostly boring only because of episodic moments of innovative animation. This is definitely nothing special, and nowhere is it as good as NOTGR, which I suggest you look at. Leave it a bore in peace. If you absolutely MUST see it, then either rent it or find it somewhere cheap. Do not pay top dollar.
