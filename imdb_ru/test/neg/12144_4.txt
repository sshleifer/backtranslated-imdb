This is a serious film about black revolutionaries, not an action movie. Billy Dee plays a young man, tired of racism, who decides to take things into his own hands. He is rather crude and realistic, without the use of characters, but nevertheless he is not so interesting, and the character Billy Dee, although subjected to ill-treatment by white authorities, does not really look sympathetic. It also hurts because of the extremely low budget. Nevertheless, it is interesting to see, because it is a good description of the social problems of the 1970s.
