excuse my spelling. This is probably the funniest horror movie that ever existed. Think of the evil dead man * 1000. The game is terrible, you can see the line of makeup on the face of a certain woman. there is a lesbian scene that makes no sense at all. And the end, haha, the end ... be prepared that your stomach hurts with laughter. Now, if you watch this movie for more than 5 minutes and still expect something, look at yourself and ask what the hell is wrong with you. This is a very bad movie that you need to laugh and enjoy because of its sheer stupidity. <br /> <br /> Don't forget to watch all the clips after the movie, you will see how much the budget movie really was. Overall, this film is a rare gem in showcasing a pure and exuberant lack of talent / care / ability / money / and everything you will ever need to make a successful movie. But it is definitely worth seeing.
