I absolutely do not know why I watched Ali G Indahouse, except for the fact that Salon seemed to think that the crime was committed without appointing Sasha Baron Cohen Emmi for his work at the Da Ali G Show. I'm sure I will never watch this show, because there was nothing funny in the film. Comedy? The torture was more like that. It was the stupidest thing Iâ€™ve ever watched. I admit that I was captivated by Ron Mitra. I have not seen her in anything. She was not at Practice at the time I looked, so I think I will have to visit Boston Legal one of these evenings to see how she works in something that might be worth seeing.
