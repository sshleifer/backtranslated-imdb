Why there could not be the best TV films that I made today, I was at a dead end and watched this movie on a satellite channel in the UK. What a terrible waste of my time it was. Poor sets, bad game and oh my god, what a terrible stream. Damn, this woman can even overtake the flow of water! <br /> <br /> I really want people to make television films using better effects, better or at least more believable subjects and a much better game. Killer Flood is good there with a bad acting game. A few slices of ham cannot act worse. <br /> <br /> And the last thing, I really agree with the comment about the dog, but I believe that in real life it was no longer found!
