This spy melodrama has a good, almost promising cast and should have been very atmospheric; there is a desire or intention of the atmosphere, and also a desire, or lack thereof. <br /> <br /> Shin plays a dissident who now acts as an agent, he is a loner whom women love. but arrogant; Mrs. Fossey is his mistress. Neil plays a valiant, generous, knightly Soviet agent. <br /> <br /> Sheen and Nill are essentially annoying; Finley acted in a cameo, like other famous actors. Mrs. Fossi is hot; but again, she is always like that. <br /> <br /> Will I be your loyal friend and break you to him? The film lacks tension and excitement, it is trite and rather boring; Good that you see naked Mrs. Fossey. In addition, warm espionage exploitation.
