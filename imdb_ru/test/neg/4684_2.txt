It's terrible, you just could not believe it. The score is annoying, the shooting is bad, for example, sometimes you see the shadow of the operator appearing on the faces of some actors. The quality of the film is very poor, it looks like it was made in the 20s. It's horrible. There is some blood in the beginning and in the film, but the shooting is always too dark. No blood, no effects. The director did something better, for example, Blood Rites. But there are followers of this person there, because itâ€™s not so difficult to search for this cheap film, but you have to pay hard-earned money for it. Of course, this will fall into my top ten worst horror films, I don't know if I call it horror. Too much talk, you will be bloodthirsty after watching
