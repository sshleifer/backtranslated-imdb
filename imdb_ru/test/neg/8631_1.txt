This is the most frightening movie in the history of Hollywood. This is a cautionary tale about how to take a European masterpiece and suck its life until it becomes dry husk, like an insect carcass on a windowsill. It's scary because it shows how the world of Hollywood actually works: ignorant money begets dirt. It amazes me how many great films could fill the corridors of my memory, if the Hollywood process had not leveled them to memorable mediocrity. Cry for the dead children! See Spoorloos or read the Golden Egg if you wish, because they will return to you forever in the idle moments of your life: when you walk down the street and see the missing poster; on ordinary parking; when you hear the Tour de France on the radio; and especially when you think "what harm?" wearing a sock with a hole on a completely ordinary day. <br /> <br /> If only I could give it a zero.
