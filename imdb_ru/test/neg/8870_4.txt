Police officer Michael (Thomas Arana, "The Church") is full of energy when investigating the case of a serial killer who left the body parts of the people he killed in the house of one recently widowed, Tracy (Joanna Pakula). Mike must find a way to keep bodies from accumulating, while at the same time finding love in the process. <br /> <br /> The feeling of “old” films of the past permeates this film, although we know who the killer is from the very beginning, and the film contains some good scenes (the scene later in the film set at the school for the blind will be especially memorable), but it doesn't make much sense when everything is said and done either. In general, not as good as the early “Macabre” Bawa and his first two films “Demons”, but pleasant enough if you can forgive the rather outrageous plot twists at the end of the movie. It is a pity that there were no additions to the entertainment DVD, as I would be interested. <br /> <br /> My rating: C-
