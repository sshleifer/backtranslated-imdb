This film tried to make Stu Ungar’s life interesting by being creative. What they have forgotten is that his life was quite interesting, without having to invent. <br /> <br /> Short list of inaccuracies: <br /> <br /> 1) Stuey was not sent straight to Las Vegas for a gin tournament to pay off old debts, he spent a lot of time in Florida and went to Las Vegas, only when he ran out of gin games on the east coast. <br />> 2) Suey never contacted (or played Gina) with the casino manager (like the one that Pat Morita played in the film). <br /> <br /> 3) There was no magic turning point in preparations for the 1997 WSOP. In fact, Stuey had difficulty in the tournament. He snorted cocaine the week before. <br /> <br /> Either tell the story correctly, or don’t tell at all. 4 out of 10 stars for Michael Imperli's decent work (the only quality you can buy in this movie).
