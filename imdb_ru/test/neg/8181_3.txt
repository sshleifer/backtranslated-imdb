After watching Avalon (which was decent only because of very good digital effects) and a few anime films written by Oshii, including Jin-Roh (which is fantastic), I decided that I should watch the set for the trilogy in the Oshii movie theater. Given that Red Points and Stray Dog are related, I will comment on both here. And let me tell you that this was one of the biggest wastes of money I spent lately. At first I watched "Stray Dogs" and then "Red Spectacles". I am sad to say that these films are perhaps the most boring two films I have ever seen. For only 10 minutes in each film, you can see some action between the characters, dressed in Panzer Cop outfits for just a few fleeting scenes. The rest of the time you will see some very long scenes filled with boring dialogue in some less impressive places. I really do not understand the motives of these two films in general. I love the outfits of Wolf Brigade and the idea of ​​the plot, but the films themselves leave much to be desired. I would advise NOT to watch these films and, of course, not to buy a box set like me, unless you like to spend money. Oh, and if you're wondering what I think about the 3rd movie from the Talking Head TV series, I couldn’t even bring myself to watch it until I removed the set from my DVD collection via eBay with a loss of $ 20. If you want cool Japanese live action, watch “The Return,” “Ichi the Killer,” or the TV series “Zeiram.”
