Well, it will be about 1000 years in the future, and we have finally covered a huge distance between the galaxies! But, unfortunately, we still use weapons that shoot bullets, black men still call each other brothers, and become tall, stoned, fight, etc. Babes in tight black rubber pants that look like they are from Baywatch are sharing with each other captain and crew. People with disabilities still need wheelchairs to move around, no fancy medicine, implants, or robotic legs. Dracula still looks and behaves like gay. Do I need to continue ... In short, this move was filmed on a typical science fiction set of low-budget requisites, actors and real special effects that cannot be talked about. The beginning, middle, and end were pitiful. I have to go and shoot myself, now there is nothing to live for.
