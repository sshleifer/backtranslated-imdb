In fact, Showtime was the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Why? Because the presence of Deniro in the cast enhances confidence and makes you want to watch a movie. I also made a mistake when I recently watched “48 Hours” and “Beverly Hills Cop” before watching “Showtime”, and for some strange reason thought that Eddie Murphy is still funny. Well no. In fact, it seems that he is neutered. When I watched this movie, I was surprised that Deniro decided it was a good enough script to give his name too. No chemistry between him and Murphy. A terrible essay, terrible jokes, a film that you think should be good can not be much worse than this one. Shortly after I sat in the Showtime, I accidentally looked at National Security with Martin Lawrence. The movie had funny parts, but it wasn’t that great. But it was still 20 times better than Showtime. Please, if you are a fan of DENIRO, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE !!
