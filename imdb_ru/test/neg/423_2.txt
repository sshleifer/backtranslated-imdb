I think I would not hate this film if I spoke Polish. I chose the English version in the first menu, but this gave me a Polish dialogue with English subtitles, just like the Polish version. Perhaps the dialogue was so fragmented, because the person who did the subtitles could not translate it into English very well. To exacerbate the problem, some dialogs had no subtitles at all. The game was pretty bad, especially in the lead role, which was melodramatic in everything! One scene that bothered me was when a German woman was caught stealing, and when the crowd pushed her around, her shirt opened and the director showed close-ups of her bare breasts for the next 15-20 seconds. I could not see how her breasts added to the drama of the scene or film. Perhaps the director was trying to increase the number of teenagers in the audience. Most of the film takes place in a death camp liberated by the Americans. First, the “American” uniform was not similar to the uniform of the US Army. Secondly, not one of the death camps in Poland was liberated by the Americans. I think that a Polish director, who turned 19 in 1945, knows better than an American born in 1966 that all six death camps were liberated by Russians. In general, this is simply not a very good movie if you do not speak Polish.
