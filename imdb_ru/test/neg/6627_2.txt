Or at least forced retirement! This film is terrible, terrible, terrible, rank, rotten, putrid ... well, you get the idea. Under no circumstances, do NOT observe this piece of decaying garbage, unless you have a death wish, because it will surely kill you. (I survived only because I missed the first half hour.) Carrot Top is a bad comedian and an even worse actor. I can not believe that he got someone to finance this huge waste of time and money. It simply means that some people have no doubt if they think they can earn one or two dollars (literally ... I can't imagine that it brought in more than $ 2!). tell me what possible motivation did courtney thorn smith (a half decent actress certainly be above that anyway) for signing on this steaming pile of manure. Was IT bored with her during the 3.5-second dry spell between Melrose Place and Ellie McBill? Or did she owe a karmic debt to the most annoying person on the Planet's face (aka carrot top)? <br /> <br /> I give it 2/10, and this is probably too high. I'm trying to keep my 1 for movies that make me vomit, and since I haven't seen it all, my stomach contents, fortunately, remained restrained. I don’t think I’ll watch it again to see if it really costs 1!
