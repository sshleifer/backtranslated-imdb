Lou Gossett Jr. is an excellent and fascinating actor, but so that he assumes the role of "president" and then forces him to act as if he is James Bond, runs with a gun and enters the warehouse to uncover a conspiracy to kill Christians and then the possibility of escaping from the supposedly High Security Service to live another day does not make it fair - there are so many unsolved problems in this film <br /> <br /> I will try to list just a few of them: <br /> <br / > 1 - what was the purpose of "accumulating" a vaccine if no one was vaccinated van? - for example, the preacher could have been vaccinated if the "power of grief" already had the vaccine on hand - later the wife of Buck Williams goes to the sick preacher, and she falls ill; so was the virus contagious? “If it was contagious, then why did Ray and his wife go to church without proper protection?” - why didn't they become sick too? - and when Chloe drank wine and "recovered," how did she suddenly find out that wine was an "antidote"? - was it a Californian wine, an ordinary red table wine? - could red grape juice be adequate - and, if the preacher took the “sacrament” at least every time he preached, perhaps he would already have an antidote flowing through his body? - Buck and Chloe received a “heavy” box of vaccine that was never used — what mysterious message should we see in this? <br /> <br /> 2 - the idea of ​​the “evil” forces that work with Antichrist Nicholas to destroy the world, like Russian, Chinese, etc., is indeed a relic of the 1950s and early James Bond era, demonstrating ignorance of modern society and humanity - should we believe that Russians and Chinese are constantly trying to destroy this planet? - and for what purpose, just destruction? - it was such a narrow view of this world, and it was so cliché to be ridiculous <br /> <br /> 3 - the main purpose of this film was the scene at the very end, where Kirk Cameron and Lou Gossett, the Younger proslit the unbelievers in audience (showing Kirk, proselytizing Lou) - it was a film without a meaningful storyline, too many passages from reality and a completely inappropriate plot for a great actor. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I rate this as 1, since Zero is not available
