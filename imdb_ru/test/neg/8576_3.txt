This week, the horror film “The Nun” (La Monja) turned out to be an unexpected showing of the film in GV. Seriously, I think horror movies should try to come up with more creative titles, although the story is about a character as described in the title. Who knows, soon we will have by-products, such as Monk, Priest, and others belonging to different religious sects. <br /> <br /> The basic premise is very simple: the hum, dressed in nun's clothes (so that he can claim the title) goes around the murder of former girls of the monastery. It seemed that there was some kind of conspiracy involved, as the daughter of one of the victims, Eva (played by Icelandic Anita Brim), continues to discover how to break off with the help of several good friends I know what you did last summer (by the way, it was also mentioned ). <br /> <br /> As the number of bodies increases, this is a race with time for our emotionally injured (is not always?) heroine, in order to uncover the truth and save the day. Revealing the sins of mothers, the film did the unthinkable, with an episode of dreams as an introduction. I hate sequences of dreams, because it’s a pretty cheap technique if it’s not done right, and there are several of them in the film. <br /> <br /> In particular, the film, which was sometimes shown how Joo-He was wrong with the many references to Dark Water, and they could rename this Unholy Water, based on the circumstances and plot of the film. However, there are many holes in the plot, so do not look too deep into the plot. You would expect the standard textbook turn closer to the end about the sadistic nun, and the sets that look as if they can compete with the recent Thai hostel horror film Dorm. <br /> <br /> The casting is rather forgetful, the actors speak perfect English with a strong accent. And since most of them are pleasing to the eye, the story should weave in a love scene in the middle of a witch hunt. What gives? Hi, got a hunt, still have a mood ah? Again, the ghoul is a fairly cheap animated / SFX, which has a built-in AI that pops up from time to time in different ways, just to cause shouts from a timid audience. Characters also break all the unwritten rules in Do-Nots in horror history, so you know and expect them to be just desserts. <br /> <br /> Can you enjoy this movie? What can you do. Just make sure you watch it in a full house (it should be easy, because the locals do not like anything terrible), and laugh at those who are so excited that they shout at every "frightening" scene. It is quite fun, and adds to the atmosphere, besides what happens on the screen. Surround sound doesn't even come close. <br /> <br /> Think of this as watching an episode of Scooby-Doo without wise men, and it’s a pity that the bloody moments in the film had to be censored for the PG rating. Perhaps these were the best bits now rotting on the board for sex censor.
