Look at all the positive comments of users of this film, then check how often each of them publishes user comments. They publish once. It seems that companies are probably paying for services that post unwanted comments on IMDb videos. <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible. The plot was stupid. The game was bad. The jokes were not even funny. The film included slight nudity from what looked like porn actresses, but none of the other characters. <br /> <br /> It was clear from the first 15 minutes that the film is not funny. There was some kind of slap here and there, but most of the humor had to come from characters speaking behind each other and spreading rumors. It is not even done well. Every joke is obvious, and you see that it is coming. <br /> <br /> The film is worthy of fast-forwarding, or, better yet, not watched. <br /> <br /> I regret that I watched this film, and if I could entrust the Studio and distributor for 1.5 hours they stole from me, I would.
