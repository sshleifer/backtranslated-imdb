This film is one of the worst remakes I've ever seen in my life! The game is ridiculous, and Corman has not improved his piranhas since 1978. 90% of special effects are removed from Piranha (1978), Up From The Depths (1979) and Humanoids From The Deep (1979). This makes Piranha II: The Spawning look like it is on the list of the American Film Institute.
