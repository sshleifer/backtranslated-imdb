Troma's founder, Lloyd Kaufman, is The Crapkeeper in this anthological film, made up of two films that were such celluloid feces that Lloyd tried to save them by combining them into one anthological film and throwing out a large number of naked people when possible. It works? No, it's still crap that I should have scraped off my shoes if I went into it. Would anyone like this mess? Of course, young Mongolian teenagers with a combined IQ of Vienna sausage probably laugh at something. For those who have brains that even partially function, stay away and watch something less offensive to your intellect, even "Dude, where's my car." <br /> <br /> My rating: F
