I was in this film as a supplement at the filming in Dallas in July 1975. In this film, some of the things that you see today that you take for granted in the process of making films have been realized. Movie room, costumes, special effects, acting. Everything was ahead of its time. This opened the door to films such as Star Wars, Terminator, The Matrix, and X-Men. Now people look at it and say: “Well, it does not mean that this is a new story about special effects ...” There was no computer graphics in it, as in new films these days. He had a story, a wonderful cast and hellish director! Places where he was filmed, like the World Trade Center of Dallas, the Zail building and the Fort. Standing Water Gardens were at that time the most modern and futuristic scenery for filming. Director Michael Anderson was very creative, and he tried to show the perfect future, imperfect with human and weak desires. It was my first film experience, the first of six films I was in. Just because he was filmed in Texas, does not make it no less remarkable work of the director. See it again and appreciate it more. This film became the foundation that set the standard for many great films that we now like. Well, my hand is blinking ... I have to run. Santuary is waiting ...
