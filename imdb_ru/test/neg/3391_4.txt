Some of the greatest and most beloved horror films have a wicked sense of humor, but when a film appears that is not as original as “classic” but just laughs at it, then a bunch of people like to be critics completely spanked. I laugh out loud several times, it shows how this film came up and was shown. The two main roles look natural and believable, and it really helps this film. You cheer for them all the way and laugh with them, everyone has friends like these guys. Another important point for me was a truck with monsters, it is awesome, frightening and really good shot. Inspiration (theft) from a variety of films, the most obvious of which are Duel, Jeepers Creepers and, probably, a reference to Jack Black, who looks like his counterpart Orange County. But in fact, you can choose any road trip and find the link here. But well, this is not an attempt to win an Oscar, just give the viewer a good dose of fright and laughter, and in that respect it is 10! Obviously, this is not 10, I give real reasonable reviews and ratings, in contrast to 99% of people on IMDb. There is no way this film could get zero, as so many lazy idiots give too many films, and no matter how funny it gets, and 10. This is just a good funny film for anyone who has a sense of humor and has fear. . You really can't get simpler than that.
