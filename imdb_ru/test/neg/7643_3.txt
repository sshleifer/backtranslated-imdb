Sails had a very interesting film with “Silver City”, but he somehow became very muddied as he went from beginning to end. Chris Cooper did an exceptional job, embodying the essence of his hero, a kind of Dubyu, but he was hardly given enough time to screen. Instead, we are furious with a character who felt less personal, less developed, and generally too confused. The path that this Danny Houston leads us inevitably becomes the failure of the film. Too many characters presented to us in such a short time. These characters were accidentally associated with the development of the plot, which became too confusing with every minute. Sales knew what he was creating, I just feel that it doesn't translate well to a silver screen. <br /> <br /> Sales is a master of his craft. His films continue to inspire and inspire thoughts, even if they are not commercial successes. The problem with Silver City is that I think it went too deep, not having enough money or time to explain all this. At the beginning of the film, I had an idea of ​​what was going on, but as more and more characters appeared when more and more plot twists appeared, I lost the sense of the film towards the end. Although the final was very clever and very dark, I needed more explanations. I think that one of the reasons why I lost my train of thought in this film was because Danny Houston became our guide. He was pathetic. I didn’t look like he was a very exciting person to lead us on this adventure. He seemed to be going through the motions, but he didn’t really achieve much. It was the first fall of an important film sales. <br /> <br /> Although I admit that the characters played by Richard Dreyfuss, Miguel Ferrer, James Gammon and Daryl Hannah were interesting, I just needed to find a better guide to Help me understand their role in this political scandal. Danny Houston just didn't cut it for me. In addition to the characters, Sales needed a stronger script. Sometimes I felt that if I was not deeply rooted in the political world, some references were above my head. The whole logic of the construction of the Silver City and the corruption behind it eluded me. I am a simpleton who loves advanced films, but this one didn’t make much sense to me. Several times I asked myself "why" instead of seeing the whole picture. I felt as though the individual stories were as clear as glass, but the whole picture was dusty and muddy at the same time. Sales should have focused more on the big picture, not on the smaller issues that ultimately confused this film. <br /> <br /> I may have gotten into this movie with the wrong idea. I expected to see another version of Primary Colors, but instead I witnessed something less spiritual and more technical. Without giving up the ending, I thought that the final scene was one of the most beautiful moments in the history of political cinema. The brilliant symbolism remained in my memory for the last two days after watching this film, while the rest of the film quickly disappeared from my memory. Perhaps the second viewing will be better for me, but for some strange reason, Silver City simply did not agree with me. It seemed like too many loopholes that were never explained or explained. An ensemble piece is always good with me, but when characters are introduced without giving reasons, they simply lose their power. It was one of those rare occasions. <br /> <br /> In general, I was very upset by this movie. Being very democratic, I wanted to see a side of a policy I didn’t know about, and another side that would make you laugh. I wanted to devour the world of corporate money and dufus that were elected. I wanted intellectual humor framed by the words of George W., but instead, all I found was a very confusing story aimed at a specific audience, a part of which I will never be. Unfortunately, this picture had so much vain promise. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** of *****
