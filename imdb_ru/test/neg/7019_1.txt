To begin with, I really love Lucy. Her TV show still makes me laugh. She was one of the greatest comedians who ever lived, right there with Chaplin and Keaton. But her performance in this film is disappointing. She was too old, and the gauze filters on the lens make her look like a London refugee out of the fog. She could not sing, and her voice was so frosty that she pierced every song. Her dance days were in the past. Just because you are a fan of Lucy, do not embellish this erroneous, sad performance and sing his praises. I prefer to remember Lucy in her wonderful series (“I Love Lucy”) and draw the curtain of mercy over the terrible mess of the film “Mom”.
