I was on a mission to watch Uwe Boll's films to see if they were as bad as all that. The first one I saw, Bloodrain, was not a complete loss. I liked it more than most people, and actually rated it 4 out of 10. The next one was House of the Dead. Now it was terribly bad. I could stand watching this for ten minutes and rewind a little forward, and that was all. I could see where he was going, and I didn’t need to see him anymore, in order to rate him only 1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> But I also had access to the sequel (which however is not Uwe Boll, mysteriously written by the same guys who wrote the first one so incompetently), and since he got a higher IMDb rating than the original, I thought I would give him a chance. And I really managed to watch it all. It all started with funny references and interesting phrases (for example, how the president received orders from the vice-president!), And, acting, these light years are better than the first one. Here we have great tormentors, such as ultra-hot Emmanuel Voigier, whose coolness is in alliance with Carrie-Ann Moss, Claudia Black and Evangeline Lilly. Dude, I hope that some movie in the style of the Matrix will appear for her someday. And always amazing, super-aerobics Victoria Pratt. I love sports women. And there was Nadine Velasquez (Catalina in the movie “My name is Earl”), which proved to be good. <br /> <br /> The story was not very good, and the action was not very good, and the End was a disappointment, as they did not succeed in their mission. Oh well, at least two networks survived. I think this is also a small victory. <br /> <br /> Good cast, but pretty bad movie. The actors make it watchable, but there is no real substance. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
