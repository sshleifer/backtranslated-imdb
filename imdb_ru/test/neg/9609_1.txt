This show doesn’t like so much that it’s hard to know where to start. Incredible characters, horrible plot lines, terrible writing and terrible game. Don't even start me with disgusting themed music. <br /> <br /> Among other things, the show is not related to the American audience because of the heavy Canadian mentions throughout the film. “Oh, let's say, Derek, you will go to Queens College in the fall! How are you? <br /> <br /> Of course, other shows are being filmed in Canada for financial reasons, such as Stargate: Atlantis, but although these shows may have suffered some trouble (for example, Rodney calls ZPM "Zed-PM"), the show there was no dwell on life in Canada. <br /> <br /> MTV holds Degrassi (another show based on the experience of a Canadian teenager) during the daytime when no one is watching to fill the time (most teenagers are at school when it is ventilated). I bet that for the same reason. Shows on teenage life in Canada have a bad effect on the American audience. <br /> <br /> This show should be canceled, and the remaining masters are burned in the furnace.
