I liked the movie, just the heroes run without much meaning in their madness. As I said, the poor goat. The goat stared while the guy pretended to be threshing. I would like the rape scenes to be more visual (but not with the goat). Jane Rill, who played Celia, starred only in this film. She was very naked in all. This crazy couple who killed and tortured many people ended up in their rightful places. I almost forgot about a couple of transvestite gays who were also chosen as sinners. If you like crazy things, then this is your movie. 3/10
