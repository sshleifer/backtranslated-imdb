I recently discovered this film on one of my husband's VHS tapes (an empty version that he uses to record tv material). The film looks as if it was last shown in the eighties, and I donâ€™t remember having been seen since. He (as far as I know) was not released on DVD or VHS, although I will look for a copy. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of three young people: two girls, one on the verge of puberty. and the other is much younger, and a young boy who lives with his mother's brother and his young, dumb Irish wife. His wife also has two brothers who live with them. The children's uncle is a nasty freak, forcing his young wife to wear a silver collar while she watches a puppet show that he and her brothers are having at his toy store. <br /> <br /> The older girl and one of the Irish (younger) develop love for each other while they live in the same house. The girl helps her aunt in the store, and her brother helps her uncle do things in the workshop. <br /> <br /> There are many very disturbing elements in the film. The uncle views his wife as some kind of stupid (literally) obsession (illustrated with a collar), while the Irish indulge in dancing, drinking and some forbidden love. Interestingly, I have seen much more explicit themes that have been played out in other films shot today in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Makes you wonder if the British film industry and the BBC have any hidden agenda? <br /> However, despite the fact that this is not a children's film, there are many playful, magical moments in it, and one Irishman makes some wonderful pictures.
