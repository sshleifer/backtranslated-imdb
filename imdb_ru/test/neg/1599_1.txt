It is assumed that this is a story about a man named Wiley Spindell aged from 8 to 36 years old, told by a hero in every age point of his life. So, for example, when he is eight years old, this is the voice of an eight year old who makes a narration; when he is in high school, he is the one who makes the story, etc. This is the only interesting thing in this movie. It seems that every actor playing Wirey is a separate character. Not only do they not resemble each other, their life experience does not seem to coincide. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like a cold.
