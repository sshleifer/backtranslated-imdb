Blood Camp is an absolutely awful slasher. We mix Friday the 13th with the Blair Witch project and add ... a killer in a clown mask. <br /> <br /> The budget of this film should be very low, some actors played a few details and the camera used gave a picture equal to the color version of the original Night Of The Living Dead, which, if anyone watched this version, will confirm to me that she is bad. <br /> <br /> This movie was just so bad. There is nothing in the film, even worth seeing. The very fact that I watched it all the time stunned me. Just take my advice and do not buy or rent this film. It's horrible.
