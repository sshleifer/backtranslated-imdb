Sorry, but I just honestly don’t understand why anyone really likes it. This is stereotyped, and REAL homeschoolers have ANYTHING like they were on this show! Personally, I am glad that it was canceled after the first few episodes. I mean, this kind of show would certainly be good if everyone knew that home schoolchildren are not really like that, and the whole story was only for the show, but unfortunately not everyone knows about it. If someone who watched it really believed that this was what was happening in the home schoolchildren’s life, then I, frankly, feel sorry for them. It reminds me of how they portray homeschooled children in the Mean Girls movie. In fact, it's sad that people think that. This is complete bullshit, IMHO.
