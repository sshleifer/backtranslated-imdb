The exhausted, horrible exit has an innocent teenager (Meg Tilly, attractive as always), trying to get in good with a popular clique at school (despite the fact that they seem to hate her directly), and allowing themselves to undergo their likeness as a waste night in a creepy mausoleum. Despite the complete lack of originality, this low-budget thriller manages to come up with some decent special effects and some good performances (in particular, Robin Evans, sympathizing with evil, as the leader of girls). The script is not very sharp, but it has its own quirks to make the process somewhat tolerable. ** from ****
