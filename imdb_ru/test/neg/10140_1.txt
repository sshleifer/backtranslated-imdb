Reba sucks. It sucks. This is about this terrible country singer trying to comedy. They could also call this show "Generic", because that is what it is. It is dumb and common. Reba, you're not funny, and I'm glad that your late show was canceled because you suck, as did Brock, Barbra Jean, the red-haired teenager, that jockey guy and 12-year-old who was beaten. You all suck, and none of you are funny. Oh, and I heard a rumor that the Reb is in fact a devotee of a gay devil who idolized Hitler and tortured animals. And she puts subliminal messages in her show and in her “music” in the hope of getting the children to kill their parents and kill themselves! But it was just a rumor. In any case, this is the worst show ever, Reba is gay, I don't like her, I think Office is better than this show, and this show sucks.
