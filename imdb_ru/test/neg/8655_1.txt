I would give this movie 1/10. This film is deprived of the generally accepted cinematic substance and concentrates too much on the current "skin trend" in Bollywood films. I definitely do not recommend teens watching this movie. What really makes me feel dejected is how could such an impressive banner, like Yash Chopra Films, ever succumb to such a horrible staging? They may have forgotten to bear in mind that there is a wider audience than the “adult” audience, which, being exposed to such rude films, can destroy their growing thinking and succumb to things devoid of meaning and recognition. > <br /> In general, films should not only be entertaining, but also contain meaning. Of course, this film is a huge disappointment for Yash Chopra fans, especially for myself. I am very disappointed with the plot, acting and everything else. Why can't people introduce some substance that can be cherished after a collision in films at least once during the entire movie? The essence is clear. I would like to briefly express my opinion: "Awful - Disappointment - A lot of material for adults - Lack of reasonable" substance "- Lack of a normal psyche - It's no use - Instead, you could take Cornetto or Temptation chocolate
