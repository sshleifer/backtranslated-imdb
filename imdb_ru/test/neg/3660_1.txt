I know if I were a director of a low budget movie, I would probably go to this page to find out what people are saying about it. Therefore, I really hope that the filmmakers really read it! I think you should find a way to pay me back for the half hour of life I wasted watching this garbage. Please stop making films about what you are probably dreaming about. Just stop filming all together ... you are one of the reasons independent directors find it so difficult to succeed. Do the world a favor and find a job at McDonalds or something like that so you can do something productive in your life! I want to call the blockbuster to complain that they actually carried this film in their store.
