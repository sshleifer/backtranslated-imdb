Seeing the name of this movie "Stupid Teens Must Die", I believed that it was some kind of parody. Later, I discovered that the original name was “Blood and Guts.” Both names are misleading, though. This is not a fake, nor a serious splashing film. This is something that fails in both areas. A group of teenagers attend a session in a creepy house, and then the murder begins. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? Well, this movie adds nothing to the endless stream of similar movies. And this is badly done. Due to lack of light, the entire film is grainy. Now this effect can be very effective, but it is not. The young cast does not work too badly, but the director has no idea what to do with the actors. In numerous scenes, the actors are clearly waiting for instructions, but they are given too late. Of course, this may be a mistake of the editor. Characters are unrealistic, and the storyline just stinks. The sound is sometimes terrible: the conversations are indecipherable, but when they speak loudly or shout, the actors are really very loud. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst horror movie I've ever seen, but it's still a bad one. For me, 3 out of 10.
