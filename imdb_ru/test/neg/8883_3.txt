Maybe I missed something, but I found the GOYA GHOSTS tedious costume melodrama. As for the story she was trying to tell, I found a tangled jumble that scattered in all directions. And perhaps this should have been done by a Spanish director with relevant subtitles in languages, and not in English with an unconvincing accent. I can not judge the historical truth of this story, but it seems to be moving along with the plot line, similar to the plot "The tragic fate of the artist's model", like "GIRL WITH PEARL". Was the film a commentary on the religious injustice of the Inquisition, false piety, torture then and now, or both? I could never understand it. Natalie Portman's various characters also seemed ridiculously stereotypical. And ultimately, the film crowned with a final melodrama about Bardemâ€™s disheveled head and body hanging on the edge of a cart heading for sunset, and Ines and Goya follow him. what is it?
