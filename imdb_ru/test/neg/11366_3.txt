Not much to say, besides the plethora of wires and supposed Sholin's monks telling the ego about kung-fu and caricatured Japanese conspiracies to seize China. All this would not be so bad if it were not for a completely fake fight with a Japanese sword. If you watched the movie “Samurai” or two, you can say that the “Japanese” battles in the film are just the same Kung Fu stunt (real circus acrobats) who do the same except for the Japanese sword. However, there are a couple of funny moments, for example, when a Japanese Ninja rips off her clothes in flight to disarm a monk and captures him with a fishing net. The plot seems to have a bit of schizophrenia as to whether the Japanese should be shown as completely despicable or there may be exceptions. The “Japanese” protagonist is shown as being largely noble, but not beyond unreasonable cruelty, such as when he kills a sleepy monk so that he can have his duel. Quite disappointing with a very stupid ending. For a moment, it does not even arouse the idea of ​​an epic battle.
