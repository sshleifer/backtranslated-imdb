This film cannot decide what it is - soft porn or science fiction movies. Not enough plot for a real movie, but too much for porn. <br /> <br /> In a galaxy far far away, a good princess (we know that she is good because she has long blond hair, wears a white toga, politely and dreamily looks at her dying mother when we first see her all the while she scoffs and twists her lip and speaks imperiously about the horrors she will do when she becomes queen). The evil princess gets upset and tries to make a coup, but the good sister goes to Earth. Of course, she materializes a male naked in a bar during a wet t-shirt competition. It really goes down from there. The actions are ridiculous, the dialogue sounds like it was written for porn, and the general plot is ridiculous. There is not even enough skin to make happy those who follow the skin. I love "good" bad movies, and this one doesn't even like at the level of "bad movies."
