I always wanted to see ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE for a long time. I was always intrigued by the title, the star and the desert, but for some (now pretty clear) reason this film was never shown on TV, or I accidentally missed it if it ever was shown. Well, after watching the DVD, I now know why the film is rarely shown: it is because it is not so good. In fact, I would say that this is largely a mess. <br /> <br /> “ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE” was created for the first time by the director, and it shows. The film is basically a series of vignettes, which contain absolutely nothing. More like a collection of short films randomly linked together. The film can be reduced to the following: introduction (murder); a cop and a girl together; introductory loans; cops go to work; a crazy guy tells a story; a policeman finds a corpse; a policeman, a chef and a girl in a bar; chase scene; etc. Scenes just don't merge. They are very distinctly independent of each other, and because of this, the characteristic is weak, borderline amateurish. The scene at the bar with a friend, the scene at the hippie farm, the scene with Big John and the chief shouting at each other were terribly worthy. I almost stopped the film in these (terrible) moments. <br /> <br /> The director’s lack of experience is evident throughout the film. Style, like the 1970s, is everywhere on the map. The introductory credit scene makes the film look like an advertisement for law enforcement. Then it tries to be a buddy film (Big John and Lightning) then the murder mystery; then a melodramatic love story; etc. In order to succeed, the film should not have one particular style, but I am afraid that the style in ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE was confused. You can clearly see that the director had no idea what he was doing or where he was going with him. <br /> <br /> The film is not a complete disaster. While the content of ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE is almost amateur, its appearance is extremely (and deceptive) professional. The cinematography is awesome. Each frame is worthy of an exhibition in an art gallery. Or because the first (and last) director was involved in a music business worthy of an album cover. The beautiful appearance of the film gives the final product more confidence than it deserves. And thanks to the acting of Robert Blake (a really poorly written character), the film maintains a certain level of realism, although nothing else makes much sense. What is remarkable about the appearance and composition of the film is that it was copied and duplicated a million times. The opening credits reminded me of something like TOP GUN, which was done 13 years later. The scenes of dressing Johnny with his clothes on the bed reminded me of an American gigolo. Oddly enough, ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE looks very modern due to the stunning visual effects, even if the history and philosophy behind it are hopelessly outdated. <br /> <br /> So ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE - On the one hand, this is an amazingly underrated and undervalued film, because it has clearly influenced many future filmmakers when it comes to appearance and composition. Very few films can claim to have achieved this, and the legendary cinematographer Konrad Hall must take a full assessment. But, on the other hand, EGIB is also deservedly forgotten because of bad characters, confusing history and confusing directions that should not be remembered.
