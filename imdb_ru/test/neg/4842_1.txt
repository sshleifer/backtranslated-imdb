I mean, come on! Now my compatriots have started making westerns! Is it not enough that our cinema already sucks? Now you need to infect English-language films with Polish acting, and no point? Please stay away from this movie, do not waste your eyes on it. A 5 year old kid can make a movie that makes more sense. I am from Poland, and I am ashamed that you really should look behind it. Please, I beg of you, DO NOT watch this film, and if you do this, DO NOT judge Polish people and Polish films by what you see there. We had some good films in our history, and we had some bad ones, but this one is nothing worse than what I've seen in my whole life. Stay away !!!
