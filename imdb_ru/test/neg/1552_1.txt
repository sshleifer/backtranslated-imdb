I rented this bitch only because of its relatively high ratings. It totally sucks! I can not imagine how someone might think that this is a good film - even a good film. None of the characters had ANY redemptive qualities. In varying degrees, each of them was selfish and mean-spirited - or offended and damaged by a man who had no idea about the spirit of Christmas (when it happens!) I know Canadians and love them - but I can't think that even THEY think this is a good movie. I would prefer a sharp stick in the eye than watch this insulting movie again. A huge waste of time and money. Do not believe the person who wrote the opinion that it is "worth seeing". This person will probably like it when the dentist drills his teeth without anesthesia. I do not want to be unkind, but I can not imagine what this man was thinking. Unless they had hidden motives. Perhaps he / she was the director or producer. If so, I would ask them to return my money to me. If your money is important to you, save it instead of renting this piece of wood or rent something (anything!). More. Iâ€™m running out of good reasons for NOT renting this film. If I were a Canadian, I would be ashamed that it should be a favorite Canadian film. If this is the case, I would say that those who think that way definitely need a lot of potent drugs. YECK!
