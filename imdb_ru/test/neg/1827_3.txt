This is a pretty lousy picture. It does not offer anything unique, original or even interesting. <br /> <br /> A medical student discovers that a secret society at her university is engaged in grim medical experiments. And, of course, she is involved in Solving strange deaths at school. This film began with a promise of several cool special effects in which the guy partially splits alive and tries to escape after he wakes up, but even when the rest of the special effects breaks out, beautiful routine plastic models of the human body and that unreal looking blood There is always in these second-rate horror films. <br /> <br /> And as if the routine plot and the lousy game were insufficient, this film had subtitles that many times didnâ€™t even correspond to the duplicated English that you hear when you speak and then add it to the mouth movement coinciding with duplication ... well, let's say, an attempt to coordinate everything in your head is not worth this mediocre film. <br /> <b r /> In this film I, at least, counted on some kind of skin, and, moreover, during the opening credits, this film also failed. <br /> <br /> This is the boring mill routine. Horror film / blood - not enough horror and blood. Skip this movie unless Ernest goes to camp is the only rental.
