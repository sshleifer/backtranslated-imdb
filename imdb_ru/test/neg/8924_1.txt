Last night I stumbled upon this film on a local TV channel. Honestly, I have never heard of this movie before. Simply put, I lost track of the latest Seagual films, because each one is worse than the previous one. Here again, Sigal is dismal, as if his girlfriend insisted that he shoot this film, and he forcibly agreed. The plot is ridiculous, the acting is below zero, and there is not a single aspect that the film does not fall apart. I just have no idea why Segal made this film. Dude, it's even worse than Kill for Murder! If you watch this movie, you will begin to feel sorry for Segal. He seems to run out of ideas, enthusiasm and money. Avoid this movie and do something worthwhile.
