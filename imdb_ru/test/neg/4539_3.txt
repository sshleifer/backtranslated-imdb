Anyone who sees this movie will notice that the creators have thrown a lot of money on this movie. I wonder what they called this "Hole"! Performance figures are good for a short film. The hole tries to look like a big budget and in a sense does it, but this is hampered by the video format on which it was shot. I assume that if it were shot at 35 mm, it would look incredible and would increase the content somewhat. Many Hollywood movies look good, and this is enough for the audience, regardless of the plot and content. <br /> <br /> My honest opinion is 3 out of 10 for this job. Perhaps the next movie Ishimoto deliver.
