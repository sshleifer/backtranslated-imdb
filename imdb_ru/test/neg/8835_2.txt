I have no idea how commentators might regard this as a decent b western. Or, as one commentator said, the plot was more cohesive than most. Nothing could be further from the truth! This film is a HUGE non-whitelist! This is an insult to the noble Western films of the 30s. I have seen many of Wayne's early Westerns and the Lone Star and the Republic, and this one is probably the worst. <br /> <br /> A bad guy known as Shadow - for crying out loud! Initially, The Shadow scheme supports trainers with open walls. At the same time, his gang rustles all the cattle in the territory. Then they decide to go to bank robbery. To do this, they need to shoot the city with a machine gun - no explanation why this is necessary, or how he got this little toy! <br /> <br /> No scheme has been disclosed in sufficient detail to suggest a Story here. Shadow is obviously just a bad guy with all types of evil intentions. <br /> <br /> He transmits his instructions to his gang through a fake safe in the wall. (Knock, knock, who's there?) He is clearly clairvoyant, because whenever his minions need to talk to him, they knock on the wall, the safe opens and - PRESTO - he is there. (I can only imagine that he came face to face with them and said: "I have some secret, vile instructions to give you about our next crime - meet me in a safe, and I will pass them on to you.") why Shadow requires a safe to communicate with his army of criminals, like most elements of this mess, is never explained. <br /> <br /> He has an elegant tunnel to an old hollow stump across the street, from which point of view various his villains commit murder. He also has a hidden panel, NOT in his secret In the main room. <br /> <br /> When he is not in the safe, he hangs on his ranch without cows, disguised as a ranch. Matlock. We learn that he killed the true owners of the ranch - two brothers - and took on the identity of one. The daughter of a dead brother recently came from New York in the 1930s (judging by her wardrobe), and she obviously never met her present uncle because he, too, was deceiving her! > <br /> If you thought that the bad guys always wore black hats and the good guys white hats, you should see this movie. Here, the good guys all throw their hats in favor of white headbands that make them look as if they were all injured in the head before the shots were fired! It's like a basketball game - only Wayne makes them tie bandanas around their heads, and not just take off their shirts. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the strangest thing is the end. Immediately after the submission of Shadow and his gang, we jump far enough into the future to see Wayne and his wife (former niece) on the porch of their house. (Never mind that there was a meager romance.) There the Yak is playing with Wayne's 3-4-year-old son, dressed in Indian clothes! (Hiyoo, skookum is fun!) <br /> <br /> No, thanks to this nonsense, Wayne became a screen legend. Only a superstar (packer or not!) Could have overcome this entry in the film's resume. Long live the duke!
