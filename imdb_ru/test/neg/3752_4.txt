The howl of the 1950s is so bad that it is unintentionally ridiculous. Tom Conway portrays Dr. Gerard, a scientist who turns natives into monsters using voodoo. His poor wife, played by Mary Ellen Kay, is held captive by her fool husband, who has no time for her, but threatens to kill her if she leaves him. Along with Marla English, there is a greedy killer who has already killed a man to find treasure in the jungle. Her idiotic boyfriend, pictured by Lance Fuller, on a safari together. They hire Connors "Touch" (later renamed Mike Connors, known as Mannix) as a tour guide. English is a terrible actress, but, hey, none of the cast members participated in award-winning performances. “Touching” (sorry, I can't even print the name without cracking, I mean that ...), gave the only half of the decent performance of the group, and that says a lot. The monster is only visible for a short while, and the final is at least predictable. I would say that this film falls into the category of films "this is so bad, this is almost good." This is good on a rainy night when there is nothing else on the pipe.
