I have never voted 1 for a movie in IMDB before, but because of this, I’m sorry that the scale does not go down to -10. <br /> <br /> All I can say about this film is that I saw it in the preview, and this was my worst movie experience ever. I'm not against stupid jokes. I can live with a silly story. But when I see these stupidly grinning "main characters" with their pseudo-foreign speech (only the Germans will understand what I'm talking about), I felt a disgust, which I never thought I was capable of. (If they did not take them into account, this could be acceptable ...). <br /> <br /> About this say a little more. You may laugh once or twice because it’s so funny, but it doesn’t make it any better. This is definitely not funny. <br /> <br /> If you live outside of Germany, be happy and be glad that this terrible work will most likely never reach your cinemas. <br /> <br /> If you do this live in Germany, avoid this film at all costs.
