I'm not going to talk too much, because this film is not worth the effort. Simply put, the movie absolutely sucks! This is the worst movie I've ever seen. The storyline was stupid, you couldn't follow what was going on, the characters were so annoying, especially the main guy. I wanted someone to kill this child and save him and the film from suffering. <br /> <br /> Very, very bad.
