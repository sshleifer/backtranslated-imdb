My boyfriend and I decided to watch this movie after we heard on the radio that this is a good movie that is worth seeing, even where there is “Cars”. In the first ten minutes of the movie I was horrified. To begin with, the cows, which should be females, had male voices. Then I realized that they really should be guys. I put aside transvestite cows for a while and tried to watch the film without prejudice, but it was so banal that I could not help but shake my head. I probably checked my phone ten times to make sure it was almost over. The plot was decent, if not predictable, but it took a long time to reach its point. It was hard for me to sit, and I'm 19 years old. The children in the theater actually got up and ran up and down the aisles. I wanted to join them. But my biggest problem with this film was that there were a lot of mentions of drinking in it, not to mention that the cows / bulls were actually with hot wires and stolen the car, and then they drank and drove by car, broke in to the boy's house and pushed him away from the bed (although he deserved it), then ran away from the policemen, whom the filmmakers made look like horrible people. This is not the thing that I would like my child to be exposed to. In the real world, this is too much, if I wanted my child to watch the guys drink, drive and drive the police in pursuit, I would pop them in front of the 10 o'clock news. Children's films should be an escape from reality, not absurd. What happened to good morality and the happy ending that children's films boast of? That is why old Disney films such as Beauty and the Beast, Lady and the Vagabond, The Little Mermaid, etc., are classics. If you want your children to see a magnificent cartoon with almost the same plot as Animal Farm, rent a King the Lion. You can get a great story without the awful drunk driving and driving a car. The authors of “Stockyard”, obviously, tried to continue the great trend of creating a children's film, which parents could also enjoy, but they did it with a very bad taste. I would never have taken my children to see this, and I suggest you save money and see something else.
