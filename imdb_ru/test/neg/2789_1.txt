According to the budget information provided on this website, Dark Harvest is estimated at $ 130,000. Where this money was spent, I'm not quite sure. Let me see .... costumes ... no ... place and scenery ... hmmm, don't think .... special d / s ... NOT ... acting classes ... ah, no. Dark Harvest tells an epic story of a young man who inherited a family farm in the hills of West Virginia. His girlfriend persuades him to take their friends there to check the place. Once there, our fearless hero finds out that his great-grandfather used a unique method to grow his crop, and now it is time to take revenge. The killer scares revenge !!! Fuuu scary. Well, no, not really. We all know that there were some amazing movies made with very little money, but this is not one of them. This film contains some of the worst actions and dialogue I've ever seen. Terrible cliches with terrible delivery. In general, do not be fooled by a decent cover and avoid at all costs. I would like to give the filmmakers at least a D-try, but I’m afraid they haven’t even done a good job with it. Grade: F
