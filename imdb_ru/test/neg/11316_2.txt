Leslie Nielsen is usually the one whose films I really like (even such critical panoramas as “Dracula: Dead and Lovers” and “The Wrongly Blamed”). So the fact that I scream "Mr. Magu" should show that this is a piece of garbage. Nielsen calls him a short-sighted hero, something is thrown at him, and he spoils everything. It seems that Nielsen’s combo and director Stanley Tonga (behind Jackie Chan’s two films) would make this hilarious movie, but it’s not; It seems they just have people who can do something, and there is no real humor here. <br /> <br /> So, the original cartoon with Jim Backus, providing the voice, was worth watching, so avoid this movie. Leslie Nielsen also achieved much better results, so there is no reason to spend time on it. Also starring Kelly Lynch, Stephen Tobolovsky, Ernie Hudson, Malcolm McDowell and Miguel Ferrer; they probably do not want to emphasize this junk in their careers.
