Historically terrible. It is unlikely that the exact moment in 4 hours of absurdity. You can not track inconsistencies while viewing. As with all tracks and movies, no one bothered to ask for track advisors. Showing events and techniques that were not even created until the next century. From shots of runners running 400 meters to an overweight actor depicting a winner in high jumps and long jumps, you would have to know absolutely nothing about the track in order to be entertained. Most likely, he was cast in 1984 as a tribute to the games before the Olympics in Los Angeles.
