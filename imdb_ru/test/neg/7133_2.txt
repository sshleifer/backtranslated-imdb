People may say that I am rude, but I can do nothing about it. The film is so bad that I was completely stunned. The first movie was bad enough if you ask me. It was greatly exaggerated and stupid, but this, despite the terrible scenes, has a serious idiotic story. They actually went deep into investigating past Kayako and found out that she has a mother (who speaks English in a miraculous way) who was a spellcaster and “fed” evil spirits with her daughter. Stupid? Yeap. Well, it started with Kayako, who was an ordinary housewife who dealt with some guy and died. This part is still in order. Because of this moment of rage, she became a vengeful spirit that kills anyone who enters her home. Acceotable. Now her killings have begun to expand a bit, where she really had the opportunity to travel all over Tokyo to finish off her victims. (Her victims traveled, didn't they?) It struck me. Now, if a ghost can really do things like travel around the country without paying for public transport, I would not refuse. Ask someone to come kill me then * snorts *. And, to crown it all, the ghost that once was depicted as very vindictive (In Ju-on: The Grudge, which was much better than this trash), is now portrayed as some kind of ghost who really enjoys himself and that this is her mission to finish people. Everything became worse (for me, the viewer) when the ghost began to come in the form of large strands of hair. I mean, ??? If the ghost was so powerful, I seriously did not mind it. I never liked ghost movies like monsters because it’s not. The overall results are just bad. Like The Grudge 2. With a better plot and less exaggeration, this show would be better.
