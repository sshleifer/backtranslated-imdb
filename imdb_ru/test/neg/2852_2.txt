This is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave him 2 stars out of 10 is the appearance of the magnificent Lydie Deneir in some scenes. Despite her 42 years. She is an amazing woman in all aspects, her nude scene in the bathroom with Armand Assante is hot to hell. <br /> <br /> In any case about the film, well, nothing particularly interesting to say, neonazi and the Turkish gang fight for Berlin in scenes where people open fire on the street in daylight and in a club where 30-40 people shoot each other to a friend of the machine guns in a place not exceeding my house, and, surprisingly, after several hours of shooting, only three died and ten were injured. Lol <br /> <br /> While the gangs fight over the Berlin territories, a serial killer kills young children and then drops them, painted white, in different places in the city. <br /> <br /> Armand Assante appears as a Turkish detective who, although now working in the police force, was the former leader of the Turkish gang, and now he has to solve the crimes of a serial killer. <br /> <br /> This film is obviously a very bad excerpt from the classic film "M". The murder of children, participation in the criminal world, the character of a serial killer and the final scene with the "trial" of a serial killer are more than influenced by this classic film. <br /> <br /> The game is terrible, the script is just stupid, production at the lowest standards is possible and in general It was a huge waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> Not even worth hiring this one.
