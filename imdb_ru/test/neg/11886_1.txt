This film tells the true story of escaped black slaves who found their own community on the top of a mountain as free people in 17th-century Brazil. The story is interesting and instructive. However, this film - like a film - is terrible. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack is not period music or tribal music. This is Afro-Brazilian pop music from the early 1980s. Battles fight to the sound of raw rhythms of pop music, which are best left at the disco or in bad cops. Admittedly, the lyrics are folk tales of slave heroism. The special effects are absurd. Instead of referring to the mysticism of the African religion and atavistic beliefs, they simply make the film cheap. They are absolutely unbelievable, and I do not mean just believability. <br /> <br /> Life in the commune of Palmares could not be what it is portrayed in the film. For this society, as shown in the film, this is a kibbutz from one part, an afro-pop festival consisting of one part. Moreover, it is almost embarrassing to watch the director play on the black cliches as talented singers and dancers who just want to be happy. He portrays everyday life as a series of dance parties in which freed slaves paint themselves with bright colors and whirl to the sounds of pop music of the 80s. On the other hand, they have abundantly beautiful food, but the viewer hardly sees any work that is being done. The king denounces private property beaten and cliché. When a person complains that people take vegetables that he has grown for months, the king says: “What comes from the land belongs to everyone, because the land does not belong to anyone. If they need food, they have the right to take their own. “<br /> <br /> I’m glad to hear about this episode in history, but I’m glad that a film with such low production figures and selling such worn stereotypes is not likely to be made today.
