The cover of the case and the premise that is written there is so promising. As a weak-minded maniac, I expect a lot from this. But what the hell is going on? The film is terrible. Direction, plot, suspense, and the cast are so amateur. I even thought they were shooting a home video camera. Fortunately, I still manage to give me good moments that make me love it. Thank you for the bad package with the so-called "Camp Blood". <br /> <br /> 1/10
