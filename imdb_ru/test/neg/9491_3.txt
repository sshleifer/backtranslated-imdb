I would like to know the real name of the Lodge, where scenes from the movie were filmed. It is really beautiful and dates back to the architecture of the 20s and 30s, like the Hotel Del Coronado. I know that it was at Lake Big Bear or Lake Arrowhead, and I would like to know if it still exists. As for the film itself, it’s really amazing that Jane Wyman was even nominated for an Oscar. It must have been a time when she liked her colleagues at the Academy. It would be really interesting to get a real impression of Wyman and other actors in this movie about the script. The screenplay of this film, like the recent Kevin Costner film with the message in the bottle, is so incredible that it limits the trust that actors can add to their roles. Rock Hudson can be forgiven. He was never a great actor, he managed to get along mostly with his appearance, and he did not get credible roles until a later period of his career (with the exception of “Beautiful Maidens”). But Wyman must have been forced to take this film through contractual requirements or a studio system.
