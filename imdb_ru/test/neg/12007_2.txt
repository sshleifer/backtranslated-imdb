I find it hard to find words to explain how much I hated this movie. The historical process of Henrietta Delusion-Desport and Herzog Praslin is a tragic and convincing story that, I think, could have become a fantastic film, but failed. <br /> <br /> Although the cinema definitely had something to say, it could in no way compensate for the terrible structure of the film, a poorly written script and, above all, horribly overzealous characters. The worst of them were the children of the duke, who were so banal and disgustingly false that it was almost painful to look at them. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film left me only irritation and irritation. deeply disappointed.
