An excerpt from the TV guide: <br /> <br /> This week, Captain Stubing on the LOVE boat is full of hands when a cryptozoologist comes on board with an unexpected cargo! Join the captain, Isaac, gopher and Julie in a fun Halloween special. The guest starring a guy in a really bad lizard costume like the Chupacabra. <br /> <br /> This is a typical, inefficient tariff for the Sci-Fi Channel. The captain of the cruise liner, played by the once respectable John Rhys-Davies, is responsible for the carnival cruise along the coast of Mexico. His daughter is ready for the trip, and she earns it by being a kickboxing instructor on the ship. Please note that kickboxing will come in handy later! It should be noted that the captainâ€™s daughter is rather inconsistent and painful to watch. It would be nice if she took a couple of lessons on kickboxing before trying to play the role of an instructor in a movie. <br /> <br /> Captain Stupid and his daughter join Mrs. Thurston Howell from Gilligan Island, a strange cryptozoologist and a dark, mysterious stranger in this 90-minute boredom trip. <br /> <br /> That's right, I said to a cryptozoologist. He goes on to mention that he brought the precious cargo that he needs to check. Needless to say, there is a chupacabra in the box that someone decides to release. From now on, a man in rubber clothes Chupacabra runs around the ship, killing people. Captain Stupid can't stop it. He decides to call the Marines, but informs them that there are a bunch of terrorists on his ship. <br /> <br /> Marines respond. They say everything they say in the nautical language, such as "Hooya" and "Get Some". But these stupid marines are no match for the chupacabra. They don't really tell anyone where they are going, so no help can be seen. I think no one will miss some lame battalion of dead marines But do not forget ... The daughter of Captain Stupida, fortunately, is a kickboxing instructor. Yay for a little stupid! She comes just in time, beats up a bloodthirsty goat sump and saves the day. Chupacabra means "goat sucker." Therefore, chupacabras suck. But by no means Chupacabras can not suck as close as this film.
