Poor old Robert Taylor. Aside from the Fed, nothing really came on his way - this almost shocker spends ninety minutes and not much. This is one of those stupid crime detective films with the protagonist narrating all the way - usually reserved for comedies these days, but this film takes itself too seriously! A pity; Australian films, especially from 2000-01, were generally of exceptional quality - but I suppose there should be a few blunders. Why even make such a film, which obviously will not be good?
