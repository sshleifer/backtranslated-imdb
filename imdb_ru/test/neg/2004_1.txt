I will not repeat what many others have said about this film; I will try to add some new items. The Coolio-as-vampire beat is a tribute to fans who are familiar with his move to the Blondie song “No Exit”, in which he plays the role of rap vampire (in fact, it works as a musical concept and is actually a great song). Casper Van Dien is not worse than Brad Pitt and in fact more beautiful. And really, that someone goes to the Brad Pitt movie with the exception of eye candy? The same thing here, although it is badly filmed (see the “Star Troopers” instead). And, of course, Udo Kiera, who played Dracula in the Morrissey / Warhol film, has a little more than a cameo. Enjoy it if you can.
