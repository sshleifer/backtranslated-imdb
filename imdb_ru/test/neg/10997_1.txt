I saw it by cable. Someone had to lose his job for the green light of this radio station. If the film is shot, it does not mean that it should be shown! Savage Instinct should be shown in ALL cinematic classes. This is the perfect template to not make a movie. The editing alone is so mixed up that you will think that it was collected by a team of trained (bad) monkeys traveling along the dirt canyon road behind the jeep, blindfolded and drunk. The sound is often unreadable. The acting? I can not name anything that I saw acting here. Reading? Hmmm I can't call it that. Otherwise? It works. All this, as they say ... is fun! I can not emphasize that in this "film" there is not a single justifiable factor, except for the fun caused by his incredible ineptitude. Fun, strictly masochistic. Look ... if you dare.
