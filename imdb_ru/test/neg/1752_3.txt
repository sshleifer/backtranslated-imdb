Some movies are not for everyone. This accurately describes Igmara Bergaman’s “Scammen” (“Shame”) movie. At 18, I still have what I believe can be called a secondary form of ADD, and I watch movies for fun. Shame was a film with a very interesting premise, trying to convey the influence of war on ordinary people, but I did not succeed. I don’t know if these were subtitles, black and white filming, the length of the film or the fact that it took me two hours to study for a huge chemical test, but I didn't like it. I understand that this is an excellent film, and it is very important in the history of cinema, however, as my teacher noted, not everyone likes or likes this. I think I just want him to finish all his many side scenes. Maybe the translation lost something, but I felt that there were endless little shoots that had never met the conclusion. You will meet the characters and never see them again, or really understand why they were included in the film. My general recommendation for this film is something that is worth seeing, but only to form your own opinion about it. Whether you like it or not, you need to consider what it is trying to convey.
