I can't believe that I even wasted renting a NetFlix to this full CRAP piece. How long did it take to make this movie? 15 minutes? On a budget of what? Fifteen bucks? I can spend a few hours with my Sony camcorder and come up with something better than this cunning piece of bile, and is it even available on DVD !? !! It is very sad to think that a classic such as “Stepfather” was not released on DVD, but this piece of smoking manure falls into the format. Here I hope that my rating “ONE ONE ONE ONE” makes the overall (already) pitiful rating of 2.5 down.
