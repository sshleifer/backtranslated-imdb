I don't think I can add much more to what has already been said about this film. However, I can offer a little memory from watching the ST-V in the theater. In the last (terrible) scene, when the camera shoots from the camping site and it seems likely that the credits will start to roll at any second, the audience seemed to grow in unison. Usually, for such a film, at least some stubborn fans remain to watch until the final reservation. When people left, I remember that I did not hear any laughter, no merry banter, only quiet noises. <br /> <br /> I remember reading a film review in a local newspaper, in which the critic said it was so bad that only Track fans would like it. What an idiot. The fans were the first to tear it to pieces! <br /> <br /> Favorite worst scene: shooting targets with a Voyager space probe, no less through a periscope! The space should be a much smaller boundary than we thought.
