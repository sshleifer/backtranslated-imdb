Klossius says the Baltic Storm is banned in Sweden. It is not right! Instead, you can buy a movie almost everywhere, for example, at gas stations, in malls, on the Internet (of course) and so on. Often at a very low price, because this film is very bad, and no one wants to watch it, despite all the tricks to maintain interest. The film attracts only conspiracy theorists, psychos and other people living in La la Landa, and those who "know the truth." <br /> <br /> While working on a museum in which the Estonian catastrophe was a topic, I met them all! I heard about every existing theory, such as cocaine smuggling, arms smuggling, biological warfare, nuclear smuggling, red mercury, newcomers, Russian - American, Estonian - Swedish - and Finnish intelligence, often in different combinations. <br /> <br /> Some normal people ask why we don’t show the film? The question is asked only by those who have not seen this horrible meaningless film. <br /> <br /> Once again “Baltic Storm” is not prohibited in Sweden. He has some entertaining qualities, but what the hell is Donald Sutherland doing in this movie?
