I was in 6th grade and this film was shown on PBS during a TV show called “Wonderworks”. I clearly remember sitting on the couch and watching a movie with tears on my face. In the film, Jesse, the protagonist, forms an unusual friendship with a girl named Leslie. Due to a very simple but careless mistake, one of the couples dies. At that time, I found this story very powerful, because the fatal mistake is exactly the mistake that a child would make, and therefore it would be very easy for any child watching a movie to identify and feel the emotional weight of the tragedy. <br /> <br /> Last year I finally sought out a VHS copy of the show. I probably should have kept my memories. Watching the show when I was an adult, I was completely shocked that it was a terribly made movie. My friend also had a similar memory of the movie, and she was also very upset because of how bad the movie was compared to her memories. <br /> <br /> Many adults probably remember this film well when they were children. I strongly advise these people to leave their memories intact and avoid watching this movie as an adult.
