Yes, I wrote it correctly. This film is so predictable that the actual word needs additional letters to illustrate predictability. From the moment the main characters and the situation are presented, it’s just by the numbers of where this story takes us. The omen was as thin as a two-ton sledgehammer. You can take numerous fragments of dialogue and anticipate the role that he will play in the final. <br /> <br /> Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhard coped well with undemanding roles, and Abigail Breslin perfectly played a nice role. Just the film did not bring absolutely nothing new in the genre of romantic comedy. The novel was cool, and the laughter was weak and not numerous. Of course, this is a good movie if you have nothing to watch, but you don’t miss anything by missing this one.
