The “core” meets the “crack in the world” (1965, made for television). Action - stock, waiting. As soon as you have subtracted the entire area, cut off from the "Core" - basically, a manned drilling machine - you will receive the plot "Cracks in the world." "Crack" was really an excellent movie with Dana Andrews in the lead role. His team of scientists, working in South Africa, drilled to the bark and “pierced” the nuclear device to provide a permanent source of geothermal energy. One of his subordinates, also a brilliant scientist, does not agree. He believes that the explosion does not pierce a simple hole, but instead forms cracks in the crust. (Possible spoiler) He is right. To stop the destruction of the earth from the cracks formed, they must place another nuclear device in the path of the crack. <br /> <br /> Although I posted a warning about the spoiler, I don’t know if I really messed up for any movie. And since “Crack in the World” is available only in a very rare VHS format, if at all my decision not to disclose whether counter-explosive work is probably academic. <br /> <br /> Overall, I rate the “Descent” slightly below average.
