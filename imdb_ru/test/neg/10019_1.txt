It is truly, without exaggeration, one of the worst Slasher films ever made. I know it appeared in the 80s, following the trend started by Friday the 13th. "The Prey" copies the aforementioned film in many aspects. Surrounding the forest, the killer, stupid teenagers, blood, etc. <br /> <br /> But the "Prey" is as bad as you can expect. I didn’t even remember about it if it weren’t a coincidence. <br /> <br /> Well, actually the killer is human, so don’t expect the supernatural killer in the spirit of Jason. The situations are pretty boring and lack of tension, bloodshed, violence, etc. This just does not work for slasher. <br /> <br /> The game is just awful. The score is terrible! a combination of boring instruments with gentle melodies of the 80s ?! I will not even mention the technical aspects of the film, because, believe me, it seems that it costs only $ 20. <br /> <br /> Please avoid it like the plague. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen, and this is what needs to be said. Thank God, it seems to have disappeared from the earth.
