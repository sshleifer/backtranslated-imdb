I rented it because I could not miss the chance to see Clive Owen’s pre-Hollywood fame and Catherine Zeta-Jones together, but it was definitely not worth it. The only reason I give him two stars instead of one is because they saw them before they grew over the pond. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones, which is usually fun to watch, even if it’s not the biggest topic in the world, is terrible. Owen seems to be very uncomfortable to be in such a turkey, plus he wears a ridiculous, blatantly inappropriate chin wig (at least I hope this is a wig, not his real hair). And the scene where he dances a village jig with Zeta Jones just bothers him. Joan Plowrayt stuns the entire movie - she probably wonders how she got into such a mess. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays Clive Owen's wife is not terrible, but almost everyone else, Oh, and the letter also stinks.
