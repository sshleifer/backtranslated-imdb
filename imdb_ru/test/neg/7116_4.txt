Mr. Brento wonders if the movie was shot by the same people who filmed the Dragonball Z series. Of course not. <br /> <br /> This is a true Hong Kong-based action movie based on the first episodes of the Japanese original cartoon (which was also based on a comic book series). And I really do not know whether it was produced under the license of the creators of the Dragonball ... <br /> <br /> However, the story of a monkey boy with special abilities is an ancient story known throughout Asia (in Japan, the boy in the fairy tale is called Songoku, China - Sunwukong, in Korea - Sonogong, etc.), and the story in the "Dragon" is largely connected with this story. <br /> <br /> By the way, as I said, this film is based on the first episodes of the Dragonball series (which was followed by Dragonball Z, although I think there was a different ethereal order in the American version). And all the scenes related to sexuality were also contained in the original animated series (without much revaluation and perseverance!), But because of your comments, I can assume that they were completely removed from American dubbing. <br /> <br /> In any case, I agree with you about replaying the film and how bad this adaptation of the original cartoon is. But perhaps because of this, no one can forget it after watching ...
