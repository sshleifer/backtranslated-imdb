Caddyshack II is one of those pictures that makes you ask "Why?" How in; “Why was it funded?”: “Why was it done?” And “Why was it transferred to the public domain?” <br /> <br /> At least it's a bad movie. This has no particular purpose, but emphasizes how excellent his prequel was, setting almost identical set of characters against each other in the same storyline, as the developer of the land “New Money” tries to redeem a golf sanctuary at the establishment. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, to prepare a continuation 8 years after the original looks somewhat strange. I mean, if you are going to make money on a very successful picture, such as the first one, you have a window for a few years to do it. But if you leave it for 8 years, it means that the formula is hardly fresh enough to simply perform a sequel or a bad imitation, as it is, so your view is obliged to reward the fans of the original, giving them at least a link to, if not really , the real contribution of the actors who made the first one so memorable. But little of that. <br /> <br /> Instead, we get cheap imitations. Well, the passing of Ted Knight in the intervening years would have made it impossible for the unforgettable judge Smails to return, but including Robert Stack as Chandler Young (a WASP elite companion, akin to Smails character) is inconceivable and serious in its own way. anarchic disorder that made Knight’s move so watchable. "Jack Hartunian" Jackie Mason - a weak attempt to recreate the nonstop sages created by the first character Al Chervik (Rodney Dangerfield). While the role of Dangerfield was endlessly quoted, the role of Mason is completely forgotten. <br /> <br /> The ridiculously absurd guardian of Bill Murray’s land “Karl Spackler” and his war of attrition with the annoying local gopher replace the role of his colleague in the film “Ghostbuster” Dan Aroyd as a militant “captain”. Tom Everett, whose high voice just upsets your sides of frustration, unlike supposed laughter. <br /> <br /> Randy Quaid, brilliant as his cousin Ed in the series “Vacation in the National Lamp”, is completely the opposite, playing the unstable Hartunian. lawyer. The views of unbelief, shown by the actor looking at Quaid’s character, are gay acts of inappropriate violence, replicating the views of viewers. You are not laughing. You just ask, “What the hell is he doing?” <br /> <br /> Chevy Chase appears, be it from time to time and wisely, rather fleetingly, considering the disaster around him, as a professional of the Tai Webb club in films, only a direct link to the original, which cannot stand the golf course itself, which is. With his tanned skin and loud Hawaiian shirts, Chase looks as if he has just returned from a long summer vacation and needs a salary. He is so distanced from the events in the real picture that he assumes a bit of guilt and leaves with some, albeit small, authority that is not yet affected. <br /> <br /> Jessica Lundy, in the role of Mason's daughter, “Kate” assumes the role of “Danny Noonan” in the role of a teenager fighting against class divisions. It sounds funny, doesn’t it? At least in the first, Danny (an Irish Catholic from a blue-collar family) and his ridiculous attempts to penetrate the world of whites and Anglo-Saxon-Protestant racers and shakers, dominated by whites, played some memorable sets, such as dismissed as a resident of the Lutheran bishop, and also mocked the descendants of the local yacht club. The embarrassment of Landi due to her father’s inability to adapt hints that he is due to his Jewish roots. In addition, this may also be due to the fact that he is a classless idiot, but such tricks are not taken into account, although I stopped caring long before they were solved. At the end of the day, Noonan was trying to advance in life. Miss Hartunian’s biggest problem is getting a cooking lover at a local golf club to love her multimillionaire father so she can meet the prodigal white child of the club. Or so I collected. <br /> <br /> In any case, if to summarize, it is poorly written, poorly written, written in unconvincing plays and spends a lot of talent. Indeed, thank you, if you could come to terms with it before it is completed. This is really repentance. However, there is the question of why so many original actors did not return, and were not replaced by performers who, at least on paper, looked equal. Maybe they just did not ask. Or maybe I suspect that they are actually reading the script. Stick to the original !!!
