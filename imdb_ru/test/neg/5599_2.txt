Well, if you are looking for a fun lesbian prank. This is NOT a movie if you are looking for a funny movie with hot sociopathic characters (in line with "cruel intentions" or "wild things"). This is NOT a movie if you are looking for a classic lesbian vampire movie. This is NOT a movie. <br /> <br /> However, if you want to spend an hour of your life, this is your movie. It is badly written, badly directed, badly sounded, badly removed. He had bad special effects ... I mean really bad special effects. I think you can produce the same special effects in Imovie lol. <br /> <br /> This is a really bad movie. <br /> <br /> The actors were classic starlet beauties, but more like porn stars. it acts like a soft core of porn, however you never get money shot, and the actors all look boring out of their brains. The “girl on girl” scenes that suck by the way were so HAPPY that it is hardly worth mentioning. go and see “almost sex scenes” on youtube, because this is the only reason you want to watch this movie, and even there is not worth it. <br /> <br /> LOSS OF MONEY AND TIME !!! don't even pick it up; instead, watch Cruel Intentions 2 - the same movie without bad special effects, a bad plot, a bad letter, a bad dialogue and a bad game. in fact I could go see it now just to clear my mind
