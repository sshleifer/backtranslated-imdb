I became interested in this film because someone made a beautiful video for Bj√∂rks "Bachelorette" with clips from it. So I watched the movie. And it is really amazingly beautiful. A masterpiece of animation. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story does not have time. Everything starts well, with interesting stories about people protecting the Bride of Roses for possession, but suddenly the elevators fill with water and lose their walls, people float away, and finally, for no reason, Utena turns into a car and high speed follows. <br /> <br /> I really like the anime for its ability to create alternate universes, but this universe is just stupid. If you're going to watch this movie, turn on the sound, so it will be better.
