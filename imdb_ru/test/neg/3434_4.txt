So I got it at the box office, where I work before it was released (issue 8/21), just looked at it today, and now I am speechless. They might have had a decent movie here, but they spoiled it in some painfully obvious ways. <br /> <br /> First, the roles with John Krasinski were funny, and this is the only reason I gave it above 3, but they are overwhelmed with bad actions and terrible "serious" reflections about life between the main character (Andrew Keegan) and his girlfriend (annoying Lacey Chabert). It would be much better than the direct comedy a la Lock, Stoke and two smoking barrels. <br /> <br /> I liked it because I think Krasinski is funny and wants him to succeed. The story is also not bad, just not very original. But the direction (and a lot of acting skills) was terrible. I swear, they had problems keeping the faces of people in the frame, and they still did it. <br /> <br /> Their carelessness is shown when a weapon expert corrects another character and says that the “Dirty Harry” pistol is not. 357 magnum, but .45 (as everyone knows, it was .44 magnum). <br /> <br /> So if you are 1 - John Krasinski really likes 2 - you like to watch low-budget (and poorly-directed) films or 3- Too much time on your hands (it's me!)
