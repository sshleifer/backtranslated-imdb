Revising old movies that you thought was average is not necessarily a good thing. They sometimes get worse. With the support of the Fangoria camp (in Gorezon, they called it “the most terrible film since the Texas nonsense” - no, no), Luther Geek inexplicably developed the cult that followed the “intense” horror scene. In fact, this is just an ordinary stalk and a cutting film that briefly breaks away from the flock, showing the killer who is cracking like a chicken. Yes, cracking like a chicken. To the credit of the director, at least they did not make the killer look like a duck a la NEW YORK. That would be just silly. <br /> <br /> Narrative logic in LUTHER THE GEEK is completely abandoned. I'm not saying that slasher films abound with reasons, but at least in HALLOWEEN Michael Myers escaped. In fact, Luther is conditionally released after a long scene where people claim that he is reformed, although he is cracking like a chicken and he has shaving prostheses (which he apparently fashioned in prison). This is a movie in which the couple sees the broken door, and the girl rejects it, saying: “Oh, my mother must have forgotten her keys. She has forgotten a lot since my father died. ” A film in which a hysterical mother runs into a policeman who is looking for Luther and tells him: “The killer is in my house!” So ​​what does he do? He grabs her, literally drags her back into the house and says: "Just show me where he is, and I will do the rest." Why not call back? <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the film is filled with such terrible actions and dialogues, because the character of Luther is actually quite interesting. Much of the credit goes to Ed Terry, the dead bell for Tom Noonan at MANHUNTER, which gives Luther a real threat. In the hands of the right director LUTHER THE GEEK can be on par with SONNY BOY or SANTA SANGRE and be a real cinematic oddity. But Albright is not the director and simply puts Luther’s charming character in tedious slasher attributes.
