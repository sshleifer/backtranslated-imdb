This film was pure boredom from start to finish. So, I welcome Bormann for raising global acceptance of the events in Burma, but that’s all he wants. About 10 minutes after the start of the film, I thought, “Oh, we're here again,” and I could tell you exactly what will happen in the next 80 minutes or so. Patricia Arquette was not at ease in such a role, and her game was wooden and unconvincing. Keep in mind, being burdened with such a terribly ordinary scenario, perhaps boredom began, and it was so reflected on the screen. Most of the film was just ridiculous. At one stage, the elderly satellite Arquette was shot and he was lying on the ground. In the next scene, he runs through the forest, clearly trying to break the world record by 100 meters! - or maybe he is just trying to run away from Bormann !! If it’s hard for you to sleep one night, play the Beyond Rangoon VCR and you will instantly snore. I very rarely criticize a film as much as this one, but in this case it is fully justified.
