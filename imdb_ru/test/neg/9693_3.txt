Dramatic? Yes ...... Historically reliable? Not really! .... This film distorts the biblical details of the flood by placing Lot, who meets with Noah, during the construction of the Ark. A fascinating time travel for Lot, partly made by NBC! 2136 BC, 234 years AFTER the flood (2370 BC) ... This is similar to the meeting of George W. Bush with William Shekpiir! And what about this guy who swims selling things and a nickname to Noah? <br /> <br /> You can make a film based on historical facts dramatic, but don't turn it up by putting people where there are none ... especially when it comes to the Word of God.
