First of all, what's really great about this movie: <br /> <br /> - Ryan Reynolds, great game! There are very few actors that I really like, and while he is one of them. He has an amazing ability to impersonate characters. <br /> <br /> - Soundtrack! Very good music plays at the right time. <br /> <br /> - The idea of ​​a nine lost in their own world, unable to escape. <br /> <br /> However, I give him only 3 out of 10 for certain flaws: <br /> <br /> - The terrible second part. It seems that the director really wanted to do something new, but, despite all the efforts, it was really boring. <br /> <br /> - Melissa is very annoying. I could not stand the scenes with her - that is, it was constantly annoying. She represents everything that is wrong with an American woman. <br /> <br /> - Awful explanation of numbers. The director was so busy with character development that he completely missed the point of a good story .. sorry, koala? Brr ... awful! <br /> <br /> This film had a lot of potential. The filming is well done, the music is really good, but nothing more. <br /> <br /> See her only if you are a Ryan Reynolds fan or you have plenty of free time.
