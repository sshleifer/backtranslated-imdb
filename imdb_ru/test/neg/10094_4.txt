In a nutshell, a film about gang war in the 1950s. Leon, the leader of the Deuces, begins a gang after his brother OD on "junk". He vows to protect the neighborhood. The leader of a rival gang just got out of prison and wants revenge. <br /> <br /> The film is not for me. The "good guys" were no better than the "bad guys." It was shown that very little says that the twos really care about the community. I believe that the authors strive for realism, but I did not care which side would win. None of the characters was cute and could not even make me like him. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there were some lively conversations between Annie and Bobby, and the whole acting was well done.
