A really big step forward in the perfection of a painful movie. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is bad. Acting (if you can call it that), lighting, sound, script (if there was one), editing, direction, camera work - all this is terrible. There is no element that is well made. If I thought it was intentional, I could give credit to the film, but I can't believe that people intend to make such a horrible film. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth buying and showing to your worst enemies,
