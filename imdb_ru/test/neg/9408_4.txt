Al Pacino was once an actor capable of performing role-playing without resorting to the constant use of profanity. In other words, when he could act, he did not have to speak like some kind of street junkie. McConaughey must have been impressed by Pacino because he became the promoter of the word "F". It may be a society in which they actually live, but most of us have a common decency to see what we say in a mixed company. I donâ€™t remember the exact words that the professor used to explain the constant use of profanity, but it was something like that. "It shows a lack of intelligence, poor language skills and disrespect for all who should listen." Perhaps the time has come for Al to go to acting classes again to hone his talent. Oh, yes, the film ... Probably the worst thing McConaughey played in. I hope his next role will be in the company of more talented people. Rene Russo, as always, was hot.
