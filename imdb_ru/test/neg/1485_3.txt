Yes, the film was so boring and tasteless. after a certain moment, I wanted the crocodile to eat these people just so that we could end this film. <br /> <br /> The plot is such that three Australians go fishing up the river in a small boat where the fishing straps are on the gun. He says he just does it for insurance purposes, all crocodiles hunt from this river. He was immediately eaten by the Crocodile. Then the trio is chased by a tree, and a reptile selects it in an attempt to escape. For most of the movie, they argue about the best way to escape. <br /> <br /> As expected, one survivor finds a guide gun and shoots a crocodile. Oh, they killed the only cute character in the movie! <br /> <br /> Where are Paul Hogan or Steve Irwin when they really are needed?
