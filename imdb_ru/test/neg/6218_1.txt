Avoiding watching a movie at the cinema, but buying a DVD for my wife for Christmas, I had to watch it. I did not expect much, which usually means that I get more than I expected. But “Mama Mia” is a full, full Cree **. I like ABBA, I like songs, I have old records. But this movie is just awful. The stage show looks like a musical, but these races, along with songs, hastily replacing each other, no performance, dance numbers (which were largely staged in accordance with the additions on the DVD) are simply thrown away with half the bodies. ever on the screen, the northern Europeans' dancing choir appears on a small Greek island at will, while the set and the set of numbers would disgrace the musicals of Cliff Richard in the sixties! Meryl (see, I play) A strip can't even make her usual loot effective in a musical! Her grandiose work - “The Winner Takes Everything” - this is Meryl in Met! Note to the director - he should have been shot motionless, and the camera gradually showed a growing distance between the Strip and Brosnan! Some of the singing is terrible karaoke on an amateur night. The camera can't stop moving like a bad MTV. You can never calm down and just enjoy the music, enthusiasm and characters. But what's worse, how did this spoiled piece of excrement **** become the highest-grossing film in the UK and the best-selling DVD for download? Did Blair, Campbell, and New Labor really turn the UK into zombies — anybody’s critical abilities ???
