He laughed at my ass, but probably because I was stoned. This is out of the way ... this is by no means a horror movie, there is no horror in this whole film, and the holes in the plot are so big that even a lower than IQ I think this is stupid. Besides, I live in Denmark and my whole life I can assure you that Denmark is too small a country for which you need GPSS and maps to find your way back if you get lost. I would appreciate that if you really do not make the effort, you can never be further from the city or other people than a maximum of 3 hours on foot. Secondly, I do not think that any part of the film, except for two shots from Copenhagen, where none of the actors was, was actually taped in Denmark. Swamp woman speaks Swedish, not Danish. The helmet on the first body of the marsh is brand new. The girl, who they find in the forest, hides under the guise of a stone that is not in Denmark. This is just stupid.
