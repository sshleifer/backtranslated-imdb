Gulliver's Travels 1977 hybrid version with live animation (or, more likely, Journey, as it reaches Liliput) did not receive a significant release, and it is not so difficult to understand why. Michel Legrand comes up with several memorable melodies, but they simply inspire songwriter Don Black to the words: "One simple fact remains / No one here suffers from the pain of growth." Richard Harris again indulges in his passion for excessive makeup, this time softening his eyeliner for too strong a basis, trying to hide the fact that he is at least 25 years old for this role, but at least he (perhaps inappropriate)) reduces his tendencies to life, which are mainly reduced to patronizing whisper. The Belgian animation looks only slightly better than early morning French children's television, but Peter Huntâ€™s film is not as bad as it seems - using Real Model Sets for animated characters dates back to the Max and Dave Fleischer version of 1939, while a couple of satirical moments persists - although it is definitely aimed at the youngest children.
