Sorry, this movie is badly made for a television movie. Are the rest of you taking drugs when watching this? I thought that hair, makeup and characters were bad 2-dimensional types. The story is doubtful, especially since all the main characters are dead or almost dead. I think it's not so good ... what happened to this hair on the main guy in Turtles? He looked badly glued, and the whiskers looked as if they could fall at any moment. There was nothing new in the history of the group and how the participants met with other groups and people. I laughed to the end, Frank Zappa looked silly, like Cass's mother and the Beatles. They were decorated to look silly and funny. In addition, other band people like Jim Morrison, Donovan also tried hard to look silly. It's terrible if you remember these people so much. This is a bad history lesson about music, it is fictional how it was made.
