“Destroy All Planets” finally agrees to “Destroy All of Tokyo” by the end of the film when a space monster resembling a giant squid falls into a reptile oven known as Gamera. In fact, Gamera saves the Earth from the very beginning, knocking out Varian's No. 1 spacecraft before the first set of titles falls out. The scene switches to the Japanese scout camp, where we meet a couple of annoying young heroes Jim and Masao who take part in the exploits of Gamera after they were abducted by aliens and shone on board their ship in an electrified bubble shield. <br /> It is rather surprising to see how boys convince a scientist to allow them to fly a newly invented submarine, which may be out of order. Earlier, the boy-genius Masao ordered the device to work in the opposite direction from his controls, but Dr. Dobi did not think that it could be checked. At the very least, it prepared the boys to intervene in the control of an alien spacecraft, playing switcheroo with a bunch of triangular blocks. <br /> <br /> When Viras boss says, “Activate VideoTron,” hold your seats for a second discussion. footage from earlier Gamera films, where he battles Barugon and Gyaos. They take quite a lot of time on the screen, but are not suitable for the fast forward button if you want to continue. For a long time, Viras turned to an invisible team, and when they finally appeared, they were Eastern, who knew how to fly - imagine! <br /> <br /> Seeing how these films were made for a young audience, it is amazing to see how horrible some scenes are. Hamera comes to mind drawing blood, and how about a headless pair of space crew members. When the squid tentacles began to emerge from the headless bodies, I contacted the alien films; combining individual units into giant warriors was an elegant device. <br /> <br /> I think that attractiveness for small children can be to identify with the two young heroes who made friends with the giant monster, moved fairly freely on the alien spacecraft and get everything you want with using alien telepathy technology. Seeing how the film was apparently made by adults, it could be a simple case of wish fulfillment.
