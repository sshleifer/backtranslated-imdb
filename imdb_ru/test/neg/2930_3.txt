Well, I generally like Iranian films, and after watching “10” by Kiarosta last night, I was expecting a great movie. I was very disappointed. This is by far the worst Iranian film and one of the most boring Asian films I've ever seen. If you have never seen the movie Kiarostami before, watch “Ten” instead. If you need good Iranian films, you can also try Sib, also known as Yabloko. This film is divided into 5 parts, and it is worth watching only the fourth with funny ducks. If this is the first Iranian film you see, you probably don’t want to watch it anymore. I don't blame you, but you will miss some great movies.
