I just wanted to leave a quick comment, because they don’t listen to him here, but I just saw this film, the version I rented was released in 2005, as far as I know, and in fact it was called “Don't go to the attic” . “I only realized that it was the same film as“ Devils Harvest ”when I was looking for some actors who looked familiar in the film. In any case, I am in Ireland, so maybe it was released only here and in the UK, but that's what it is called here .......... not really, how important it is, because I would did not recommend this movie. The only words that come to mind when watching him are CHEESE CHEESE CHEESH !! My one point out of ten - only for one slightly worried: o)
