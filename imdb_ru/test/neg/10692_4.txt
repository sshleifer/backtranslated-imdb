I was so looking forward to watching the documentary self-immolation of the mastermind of the Boondock Saints, one of the most aggravating and meaningless films I have ever seen. But the creators of "Night" - friends (former?) Of this mastermind - must also learn how to make a movie. The various unpleasant remarks, blatant obscenities on the phone and the enjoyment of his alcohol really make Mr. Duffy look rotten. But this does not shed any understanding on why the guy got the contract in the first place, what is his creative process or vision - what are the Boondock Saints in general? How difficult is it to meet Patrick Swayze? What is this strange institutional fraud, which fall into our disgusting heroes? Since the film does not attempt to answer these questions in any consistent manner, it also has no right to talk about Hollywood. So who cares?
