This film had terrible lighting and horrible camera movements. This film is a catchy horror film that has no meaning. Slashes look completely unreal. It seems that some 17-year-old idiot wrote this film, and a 10-year-old child shot it. With the worst acting game you can find. People are tired of knives. At least go for a weapon or fire. It contains almost exact lines from When a Stranger Calls. With horrible murders, only crazy people will enjoy this movie. Obviously, the writer does not have children and does not even care about them. I mean at the mercy. Just to sum up, this movie is the movie "B", and it sucks. Just for your own sake, donâ€™t even think about wasting time watching this crappy movie.
