I myself am an animator and a promising lover of the environment, so when I saw this film in the bin for $ 5, I decided that it was worth adding to my collection. Although I never regret that I have a new addition to my animation library, this film has definitely disappointed. <br /> <br /> The premise has enough potential. A penguin named Hubi finds the perfect pebble to give to a girl he loves, like a penguin, like an engagement ring, but before he can give it to her, he is banished from an evil rival and lost at sea. He then became friends with another penguin who helps him find his way home. This setting is not great, but enough to create a fun adventure. Unfortunately, the feats of the duet are never significant, and everything becomes quite repetitive. Most of the situations in which they find themselves are actually boring and they lack creativity ... and gluing the two of them on the go is shoddy and forced. <br /> <br /> The animation is good, but not up to the usual standards for Don Bluth. This is the guy who gave us the “Secret of Nimha”, “Earth to Time” and “American Fairy Tale”, each of whom had attention to details that often surpassed Disney, the grandfather of artistic animation. This is not too much outside of the high level TV fair. <br /> <br /> The music is in order, but rather memorable, and the voice actors are all vain talents ... Martin Short is all wasted here, as the main character of which, despite the fact that he is spoken of as rascals, almost the whole person is playing straight. <br /> <br /> In short, the film is likely to appeal to very young children, but a good family film should appeal to all ages and, unfortunately, it didn’t get what it wanted.
