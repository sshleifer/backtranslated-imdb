Peter Hunt began as a very gifted director and got his first directorial experience when he directed James Bond’s film “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service” (which many Bond fans consider to be the best in the series). Other titles in his filmography include large-scale epic adventure films, such as Gold and Devil's Creek, both adapted from Wilbur Smith novels. Gulliver's Journey is strange in his list of films; it seems odd that the director of the style and experience of Hunt decided to make a film of this kind. Half live action / half animated retelling of classic Jonathan Swift satire, the film looked twenty years outdated, even when it was made, and, frankly, it just doesn’t work. And there is not one devilry that Hunt (with his usual striving for quick action) or star Richard Harris (who usually can liven up the most running roles) can do to save this one. <br /> <br /> Lemuel Gulliver (Richard Harris) is a brilliant medical student living in the 17th century Bristol. His father (Norman Shelley) wants him to go to London to get rich; but Gulliver prefers the idea of ​​getting much less pay, but a hell of a lot more adventures as a ship surgeon aboard a ship called the Antelope. During the voyage, the Antelope breaks off course during a storm and hits a reef. The ship is sinking, and all are lost, except Gulliver. who is beached in the kingdom of the Liliput people. When he comes to, Gulliver finds that the strange land where he washed ashore is inhabited by incredibly small people, not taller than his toe. To them, he looks like a giant. They convince Gulliver to help them in the war against another race of tiny people who live on a nearby island. But Gulliver doesn’t like being manipulated for war and devastation, so he plans to escape. ?? <br /> <br /> Harris remains to carry the entire movie here. Other actors take part in his first two scenes, but after he crashed in Liliput, he spends the rest of the film, knee-deep and knee-deep and filming along with his animated colleagues. The idea of ​​mixing live action and animation was not new at the time, but of course it was not done a lot. Several Disney films, such as “The Song of the South,” “So dear to my heart,” and “The Dragon of Pete,” faked this idea, but it was still in its infancy. Gulliver's Travels is not a particularly good animated film, but the scenes showing the interaction between Harris and his colleagues in cartoons are, at least, well-done. Sometimes the film tries to be truthful in its satirical roots (there is one scene in which we learn that the Lilliputians started a war with their neighbor because of eggs!?! - and the fact is that wars can start because of the most ridiculous things) . But in fact, it is a very childish film, and satirical overtones are almost not considered. All involved have done the best things during their career ?? Gulliver's Travels might have filled an otherwise empty day, but beyond that it is an unforgettable and disappointing experience.
