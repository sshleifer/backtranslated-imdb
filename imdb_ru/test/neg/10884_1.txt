I have seen a lot of movies. Actually, I love horror films “B”, they are one of my favorite genres. However, this “Garbage” (I refuse to admit that it was honored the film) was the worst piece of shit I've ever experienced trying to watch. In fact, I subscribed to IMDb simply because I needed a way to at least voice how terrible this "Trash" was. I watched “Films” (at least they deserve the honor) taken in the basements by high school students who were better written and directed. I have nothing left but pity for the poor actors in this “Garbage”, because they were just trying to get paid. They will now and forever have this spot on their records, like a virgin who was raped and got Herpes! If Writer / Director John Shiban has at least some merit, after countless people obviously failed to do this, he should never allow himself to face the camera again and try to use his something more suitable for him .... How to clean the floor on the Peep Show !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
