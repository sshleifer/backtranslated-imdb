... but memorable, because there is an actor in it, whom I really recognize! James Horan, by these standards of movies, Laurence Olivier. He gave some decent performances on such things as Highlander and various Star Treks, so it's pretty funny, though slightly depressing, to watch him degrade here. Well, yes, there is a plot. The character of Horan and his wife are fighting, he has an affair with a film reviewer when he tries to make the film “Masterpiece” and their guest decides to enjoy the wonders of undressing. But watching Horan is truly the only pleasure that can be found here.
