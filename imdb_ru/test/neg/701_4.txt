The Riders of Fate were the first of several Westerns that Wayne made for the Lone Star monogram between 1933 and 1935. In this recording, the producers are trying to turn the duke into a singing cowboy named "Singin 'Sandy Saunders" with fun results. Any fan of Wayne knows that the duke could not have played the melody if his life depended on it. His voice was apparently dubbed by Smith Ballou, whose deep baritone does not sound like Wayne. Wayne looks awkward and uncomfortable in the "performance" of the musical. Thank God, the experiment with the singing cowboy was soon over. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, it contains the standard “B” plot about the struggle for the rights to water between the villain (Forrest Taylor) and the local. ranch. The duke, of course, plays the hero. He has not yet developed his character on the screen and still looked like a poor cowboy. <br /> <br /> The film also starred George (before Gabby) Hayes, the father of the heroine, Cecilia Parker as the heroine, and Yakima Canutt as "one of the boys", who performs his "fall from racing horses under the cart", doubling Wayne . Both Canutt and Hayes will appear along with Wayne in most of the other entries in the series. Kanutt, in particular, would have a profound effect on Wayne’s future development, teaching him, among other things, how to move, fight and feel comfortable on a horse. <br /> <br /> As Westerners "B" walk, it is not. Too bad, however, I have to give him an unsatisfactory rating due to "singing."
