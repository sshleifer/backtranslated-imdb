KOC had his moments. I liked the action sequences, but I despised the script and plot. I hate this movie so much, I'll just write about the stupidest part. First of all, the plot will never happen. Secondly, the gloom of the Chinese president was inappropriate. This will never happen. Finally, the dialogue. To understand that actors from outside China play Chinese roles is understandable, but writing a dialogue for them that is completely disabled is stupid! For those of you who understood the Chinese in the film, you understand what I mean.
