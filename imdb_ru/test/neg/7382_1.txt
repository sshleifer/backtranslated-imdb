I found that Super Troopers was at best only slightly amusing (it seemed to me a renowned police academy), and I rented this film in the hope that it would be better. This is not true. <br /> <br /> The script is absolutely terrible, and the pace of this film is even worse. It doesn't seem like something special is happening in this movie, or that it really gives us a reason to spit on any of the characters. <br /> <br /> The actor playing Felix is ​​not at all inspired by the possibility, partly because of the dialogue with which he had to work. In short, this film was simply mistaken in many places. <br /> <br /> I got the impression that because films such as Clerks, independent directors seem to think that they can make such films through long, disconnected scenes of dialogue. where the characters are trying to be funny. But where dialogue in clerks pushes the story forward, in this film he hopelessly burdens it. It is assumed that films should have a decent balance between actions and dialogues, and, no matter how tempting it is for filmmakers, to try to conduct subtle, lively, funny dialogues, this does not always work. Especially if they are not so good at writing a dialogue. I hate to say it, but even "Extreme Heist" was more interesting than this film, and this film was so low-budget that it was filmed.
