This is a pretty pointless remake. Starting with the initial titles of the original shots was a real mistake, as they remind the viewer of what a wonderful little chiller it was. The subsequent new version is an exercise in redundancy. <br /> <br /> Brian Kerwin plays a “urban boy” photographer who returns to a semi-abandoned desert city populated by a scattered number of underdeveloped cliches: “sucking candies” Daby-Doll Lolita, a good old scout, a crippled veterinarian and his Asian wife , and so on. <br /> <br /> Kerwin’s character witnesses how “something” falls on the side of a hill and soon after strange things start to happen when pieces of a strange blue stone are scattered around. The temperature starts to rise, all the water in this area disappears, people start behaving strangely, things explode. Kervina's character gets into the car and gets out of it more often than is possible in one movie. In the film there is no sense of place, no development of character, no humor, no tension. Everything that made the original Jack Arnold an eerie little classic of the paranoia of the Cold War was abandoned. It just goes through minimal hoops, and then just ends. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not very special - the inside of the ship looks like pieces of adhesive film wrapped around the ropes, which are then hung in front. cameras to create some of the most boring and awkward wires ever put on the screen. The script repeats - everyone says everything at least twice, Kerwin says “let's get out of here” at least three times during the film, twice in one scene. In the end, much remains unexplainable - why, for example, do aliens need all the heat and water? - not that someone watched it; if filmmakers didn't care why we should? <br /> <br /> Acting is adequate - better than the script, which sometimes has insufficiently rehearsed improvisational quality, it deserves. Although the actors often look like they just want to get it over with as quickly as possible - a vivid example of this is that Elizabeth Pena records the shortest, symbolic moment of the “frustrated gesture of desperate hands on face” before chasing her son Stevie outside to look as he makes a gesture of "an angry sullen teenager smashing something off the table." <br /> <br /> Continuity faults include a sticker (GB) on the back of a Kerwin jeep, a gas that appears and disappears in the exploding car, when a citizen is in two places at the same time - once in POV from alien Stevie, and then immediately after the return shot, Elizabeth Peña seems to have closed the car door twice ... you can say that I was captured, right? The film makes the greatest of mistakes. It's boring.
