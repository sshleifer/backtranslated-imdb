Carlos may not be the most original comic, but the first episode was funny, his candid comments and observations were fresh. I missed a couple of seasons, but after all the accusations of stealing material I caught a couple of episodes of Mind of Mencia at the end of July 07. I see some changes! Carlos is much more interested in toilet humor and sexual jokes than racing observations. In one of the episodes, he seemed to be implying that he was in the same league with Chris Rock and Dave Chappell. I think no. Perhaps Comedy Central will give him another season, but the episodes that I saw sounded tired and of the same type, with more sounds than Osborne. Carlos, go back a couple of years ago, get some fresh stuff and try again.
