I do not see the point. It's hard. Lively people are creepy (look at the creepy valley). Scenes continue and continue for a very small purpose. The plot is skeletal and needs to be filled with a host of meaningless dramatic, screaming roller coasters, as if Disney or Spielberg were planning a trip to an amusement park based on the film. Most characters are annoying and unlikely. Some of them continue to appear, as if they have something important to add to the climate scene. They are not They just disappear without prolonged exposure. Someone summed it up like this: “If you don’t believe in Santa Claus, you’ll be stolen on a train on Christmas Eve.” That pretty much sums it up.
