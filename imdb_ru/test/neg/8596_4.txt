I liked this movie when I was a teenager. Loved it. It hasn't grown with me, though. Maybe this is because it is a melodramatic load of old rubbish, full of macho posturing, wacky dialogue, exhausting chatter and characters, saying “Damn it” a lot. A piece of the narrative picture passes gracefully from one character to another, from one plot to another, never putting it all together, and it does not help that William Baldwin’s mono expression is wet enough to put out every fire in a film for a long time. Robert DeNiro and Donald Sutherland deserve attention, but here no one is at the top of their game, and women are particularly unhappy. The only real influence is the impressive fire fighting episodes and the majestic Hans Zimmer score, which remains one of my all-time favorites.
