Since he played at Lonely Wolf in McQuade, actor / stuntman Kane Hodder has been busy. His movie "Ax" was widely publicized last year, but he still shoots a couple more films every year. He should have skipped this one. <br /> <br /> Hodder seems to be the king of slashers. He played Jason Voorhees from Friday 1988, 13th part VII: New Blood (1988) to Jason X (2001). He is working on a new movie that looks like a Halloween remake. He is very similar to the one I would call a serial killer, with his methodical, inexpressive thirst for blood. <br /> <br /> However, there was not a lot of blood in this film, and there was very little action on the camera. It seemed to me that I was watching an episode of this law enforcement against A & E. <br /> <br /> I will not put all the blame on Hodder’s shoulders, since the rest of the actors did little, either. br /> <br /> Michael Berryman (“The Hills Have Eyes,” “Devil's Deviation”) just ran through until Hein shut him up. Adrienne Franz (“Brave and Beautiful”) was cute. Veteran actress ("Company of the Three") and Penthouse Pete, Priscilla Barnes did a decent job. I’m sure there are other horror favorites, but they all seemed to just run their roles.
