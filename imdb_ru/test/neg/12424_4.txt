I completely forgot that I saw it in a couple of days, which in itself is quite revealing. I have already heard that this version of Gaston's “The Phantom of the Opera”, captured in Leroux’s country house, was interesting and witty. Thus, it emerged from a cute title sequence and a few neat strokes in the opening scene, but the film very quickly stopped and became vaguely tedious and completely unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> As a mystery, the main problem is that it is fundamentally intractable from the audience: like the worst agates of Christie, it depends on the character appearing in the final act with a huge amount of background information to which we were not involved. As in the film, be it a comedy or a thriller, the key problem is that there is almost no feature. With the exception of the killer, everyone is the nominal version of the typical suspects in a typical country house murder story - a reporter, an endangered heir, a suspicious groom, the father of a scientist with a dispersed mind (surprisingly poor Michelle Lonsdale), etc. , and often overripe or erroneous views do not help. You honestly don't care about anyone in it, so there is no danger or expectation. Only Claude Rich and, in the last video, Pierre Arditi can work with anything, and only in the last video the film becomes close to the feeling of resonance, which is too fleeting to be really effective. <br /> <br / Otherwise, we get endless exposure and a couple of ineffective potential comics (promising with a photographer locked in his grandfather's clock, too badly thought out to pay off), and Dennis Podalides is shortened to Irving The exporter of the last third of the picture. I don't like country house movies or Agatha Christie comics, so those who can do this may be a lot weaker, but I found this a bad show. As Rich says, when the mystery is revealed: “It’s rather a disappointment.”
