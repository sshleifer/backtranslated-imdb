I have never written IMDb comments before, but this film was so bad that I had no choice but to warn you not to waste two hours of my life. As an avid historian of World War II, I don’t even know where to start, how historically inaccurate this film is. Korean War bayonet tips, missing K98k cleaning rods and visors, German uniforms that didn’t exist — this list goes on forever. It’s also loaded with flaws, literally has no plot or climax and operates on a par with the local high school theater. The embodiment of the cheese. <br /> <br /> PLEASE ... there are too many good Second World War movies to waste your time on this garbage.
