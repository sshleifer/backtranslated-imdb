John Candy was a comic actor. His death was a tragedy, and we all miss him very much, but WAGONS EAST, in which he plays the awkward master of wagons, who agrees to lead a group of pioneers from the wild west, is even more sad. I do not understand why it was even released. The story is meaningless and weak, but there are no jokes. It upsets me even more that Candyâ€™s latest film will be his worst film of all time. So, let's forget all about it and remember it in his best films, such as SUMMER RENT, PLANES, TRAINS AND CARS and UNCLE BAK. <br /> <br /> 0 of 5
