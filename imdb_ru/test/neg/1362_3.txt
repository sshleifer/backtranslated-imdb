This film is full of pseudo-deep reverie, and it is hidden in its author's writing, which includes a voice-over canned ham and some incredible dialogue. Hard and deaf dialogue, as sometimes (not always) Spike when writing "certain" characters. For those who love mindless movies, such as “Pieces of April” and “One Hour Photos,” this is another one for you. <br /> <br /> However, this comment has nothing to do with Ryan Gosling, who showed his amazing videos in “The Believer.” The film, which proves that the films are director films, and when the film is rotten, it's fair to say that the blame here is not in the actors, but in them.
