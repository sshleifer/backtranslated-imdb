To be honest, I have not seen this film for many years, but several times I tried to capture part of it in memory, as anyone who saw it would understand. I first saw it as a child at a Halloween party at the YMCA in the early sixties, and it scared the hell out of us children. I remember having a genuine concern about the unknown, which is hiding in a maze. I can not risk giving the ending, except to say that it was surprising, if not more. I vaguely remember how the entire audience of young guys made a loud, frightened cry, followed by laughter when a terrible secret was revealed. The ending was regarded by most viewers as one of the greatest unintentionally funny movie climaxes in film history, and at the same time strangely moving. You have to see it for yourself, which is not so easy these days. I do not know whether it will be available on home video or not, but it will still be an excellent Halloween feature for children and adults.
