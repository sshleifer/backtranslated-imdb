Tyrone Power was played in the role of Solomon. However, halfway through the film, he unexpectedly died. The studio chose Yul Brynner as the lead and re-shot the scenes that Power took. Looking back, considering how terrible this film was, Power was lucky - it would be a terrible way to end his excellent film career !!! <br /> <br /> Of all the biblical epics that I have seen, this one is the worst - and that says a lot, because there were many boring biblical stories in Hollywood - so many interesting films were an atheist's plot !! In fact, the film was so boring that it was deservedly included in Harry Bear's brilliant book Fifty Worst Movies of All Time. There are so many reasons to hate a movie, but the worst thing is how incredibly hard it was! Of course, casting people with Italian, Eastern European, Scottish and English accents to play Egyptians and Israelis was pretty bad - but at least it made the film strangely humorous. Busty Gina Lollobrigida, who plays the role of a woman who is said to have come from Ethiopia, was also terrible, but at least she was beautiful even if she could not play. Playing with the weight of George Sanders at post-middle age and playing such a young role was also pretty bad, but at least he had a beautiful voice. Creating an orgy scene that was choreographically and disgustingly boring was pretty bad, but at least you can see in the credits mention of a person as an "orgy choreographer"! No, the worst thing about this movie is that for almost two and a half hours, it seemed like nine, it was so bad and tasteless! Considering that the only mention of this Queen of Sheba and Solomon is contained only in a few pitiful verses of the Old Testament, it is surprising that the film only continued and continued and continued. THE BIGGEST STORY, EVER SAID, was a bit longer, but this film was based on four Gospels, not a dozen or so verses! <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that the film is practically all in all respects (except for Ginaâ€™s splitting). Even for devout Christians and Jews, this is a film to be avoided, because it plays so quickly and freely from the truth, and also introduces an amazing amount of sex in a biblical film !!! Terrible in almost all respects, this is indeed a blessing for Tyrone Power, whom he did not remember how he starred in this bloated turkey.
