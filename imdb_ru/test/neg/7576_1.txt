One of my colleagues recommended this one, implying that it was one of the scariest films she had ever watched. I checked it with my girlfriend, and we surrendered after about 50 minutes. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I had a long conversation with my colleague (we are still friends!). <Br /> <br /> This film is as original as the last movie starring Steven Seagal. He brings absolutely nothing original to the table. Creepy roles have been made thousands of times before. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake is the painfully slow pace of this film. The periods between panic attacks are completely in vain, with meaningless dialogue and a multitude of ... nothing ... 1 of 10 Molotov cocktails
