This story of American pilot Ted Bryce, who remained the only survivor after the crash of a reconnaissance aircraft in Belgium in January 1944, is largely confused. The name makes you think that this is basically a story about the Belgian armed resistance groups, but it seems to be just the background to support the stupid love story between Ted and Claire, a woman who accepts Ted. Claire Henry's husband is a devoted member of the resistance, but it is Claire who decides, in the absence of Henri and against his wishes, to provide asylum to Ted. <br /> <br /> Critical details of the plot do not make sense. The central place in the history is taken by the search for a recorder on a downed plane, which contains navigation codes and the location of targets. But at the opening we see how the Belgians rob the plane, including members of the resistance. Why did they not take away valuables at that time, instead of waiting for the Nazis to come and guard the plane? And the whole process of transferring Ted out of the region was carried out using secret instructions and code words, when the transaction could be just an exchange. Heavy music tries, without success, to give some weight to this cool undertaking. <br /> <br /> The funniest part of the film is how the novel develops between Ted and Claire. First, Claire dedicates to Ted's care after death, and when Ted starts to get better, they become physically involved (while Henri comfortably leaves, engaging in the business of resistance). Julie Ormond does a decent job as Claire, but she produces a French accent, which I often found impossible to understand. At times, her answers seemed a bit weak — when she was informed of the deaths of several city residents, she responded as if she had just been told that there were no peaches in the local grocery store. Like Ted, Bill Paxton seems to be just reading his lines; his performance is so boring that it confuses. A true American pilot may testify to such a flat personality, but this does not contribute to convincing cinema. I did not feel any chemistry between these supposed lovers. <br /> <br /> The most idiotic thing is how Ted and Claire behave like lovers on vacation. Maybe sexual release from such difficult situations is understandable, but it is difficult to fully understand the seriousness of the situation. Ted goes to the attic first, and Claire worries that he will even enter the house. But as events unfold, he not only enters the house, he dances with Claire to loud music, enters the next barn to play baseball with a local boy, and eventually goes on a car trip with Claire to a nearby city. br /> <br /> A young boy seems to be most devoted to his role, but he is undermined by the script. He has a supernatural ability to be at important events so that he is not noticed. And when he says lines like: <br /> <br /> “Have you ever seen someone hanged.” They look like dancers, but they cannot find the floor. ” <br /> <br /> You feel what the screenwriter is saying, not the boy of thirteen. <br /> <br /> And by the way, there are scenes showing that the Nazis are pretty bad guys. <br /> <br /> Comparing this film with the brilliant “Ashes and Diamonds” about the Polish resistance or with the same stellar “Lacombe, Lucien” about the French resistance, one can understand how gloomy it is.
