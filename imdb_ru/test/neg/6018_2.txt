Mockumentaries have recently expanded to such an extent that the approach requires the injection of fresh and creative material each time it is used to maintain its vitality. In this film, there is nothing but worn repetitions of similar stories, a pointless script, weak advertising, uninspiring acting, and unfunny self-satisfied humor. <br /> <br /> The premise seems to be quite promising; The legend of the Loch Ness Monster is custom-made for one of these silly mocking misadventures, with a huge array of stories and legends waiting to be used for outrageous satire. However, the filmmakers completely spend this huge potential. We get a fool inserting a fake Nessie into the water. Gee, it's original. In another scene, one nasty idiot threatens another nasty idiot with a gun. Hilarious. A few free shots of a beautiful girl in a bikini. Annette did it 40 years ago (and, by the way, much better). Throughout the film, someone always seems to be screaming: I believe that this is intended to wake the audience, who nodded in this matter. <br /> <br /> But the worst part is that this is a merciless volley of this reality to show the type of "interview comments" made by the characters. They not only shoot you with this tired joke every five seconds, but, apparently, the actors also improvise; this is the only explanation of how joking is a joke. If lines such as “I have never seen anyone write a book on non-proof” were actually scripted, then the writer should be shot dead and fed by Nessi. <br /> <br /> No wonder Nessie has become cruel; he obviously saw this movie.
