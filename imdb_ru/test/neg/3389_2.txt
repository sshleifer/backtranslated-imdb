I completely disagree with the previous reviewer: this film has funny moments, but hardly a riot of laughter. (if you really donâ€™t think that whipping out of a septic tank and head banging in a vice is a riot for laughter) Actually, the only reasons I gave it 2 instead of 1 is because a.) two actors are worthy b. ) the soundtrack is above average with some melodic pop songs added for contrast and c.) the monstrous truck is pretty scary. <br /> <br /> In addition, this is a film with some intermittent, creepy or interesting ideas that are overwhelmed by inexorable rudeness, rudeness and meanness. The former best friend is one of the most annoying of all I've ever seen, and the little grace that the hitchhiker character has disappeared in yet another invented ending of the turn, which does not make sense at all. <br /> <br /> A waste of a leading actor who shows some nervous charm and the aforementioned actress depicting a hitchhiker character ...
