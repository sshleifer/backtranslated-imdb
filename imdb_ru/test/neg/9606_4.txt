I tried to give this show a chance, but it really does not suit me. Although the performances are good, but the writing is not. The two older stepchildren, Derek and Casey, are equally annoying; I have the impression that we should take the side of Casey, given that she is the main character, but I do not find her at all pretty. Parents are constantly portrayed as completely ignorant. Three younger children - the most watchable things on the show; Lizzy and Edwin are beautiful in how they come together, and Marty is amazing. The storylines are a bit contrived, and the whole premise is mostly hard to swallow - mixed families are common, yes, but this family is not really trying to mix. Overall, I think this is very bad.
