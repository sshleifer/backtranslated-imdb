I bought this video on a flip-flop in a video store, expecting a good cast in what was advertised as an award-winning British sex comedy. I guess I should have read a smaller font. I rarely write a pan review, but here everything goes. <br /> <br /> These actors in the role of gays really play games with your memories of many much more worthy films. This comedy was a very cruel joke at the expense of the actors, theatrical audience and all the good films that contributed to their reputation. <br /> <br /> I repeat: this is a joke about the defeat of the actors “Other highly respected characters on the screen with this reckless foolish flick? Can the reference to Osten's classics “Pride and Prejudice” and “Sense and Sensitivity” be something else? How political was the creation of this melodrama using these stars? Should we just assume that all actors are homosexual, that all actors are gay, and thus their role-playing on the screen affects our lifestyle and also accepts their personal homosexual relationships on our faces? Sorry, but I do not think so. I say NO to this.
