I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many films since his heyday in the 80s as an experienced young actor. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD because it was cheap and partly for the internet-related storyline to see how much older C. Thomas Howell is; I donâ€™t remember having seen him in any films since the 1980s. <br /> <br /> In two words: what a great disappointment. I give a chance to low-budget films, but this one started badly. During the first 15 minutes of the film, this elusive woman is chatting with an Asian guy. They basically stimulate themselves to their own chat, then she insists on a personal meeting with the participant. She meets him, has sex, binds him and then kills him in cold blood. Then the plot gets even worse. <br /> <br /> The plot is thin and fragile, and the action is very tough. It is not worth renting it much cheaper, even if it is in the DVD basket for $ 1. I plan to take my copy of the DVD in Goodwill. I'm really amazed that any of the previous reviewers gave this film a bad rating.
