This film has some good performances - and that’s all it has. Leaders, especially Paulie Perrett, are attractive. (Although some of the bit players seem to act from a teleprompter.) Material is a problem. I feel as if the screenwriter / director watched the entire Felicity film in one sitting, and then sat down to write the script without falling asleep. It really reminded me of Felicity — a thoughtful young woman who finds herself, finds love, with the “shake them and see what happens” approach to the characters and their relationships. Except that while I used to love watching Felicity, this film left me cold. The letter is just awful. It's amazing that the actors could play as well as they did, because the dialogue is dull at best. In the worst case, it becomes banal, stilt and amateur. There is nothing original here, with plot elements learned from tricks that were not so brilliant from the very beginning. (Angels and fortune tellers? Come on.) In the first half of the film I was rooting for the actors and hoping to get a reward for their patience. By the second half, I just wanted it to end. My sympathies for the cast, who deserved the best car for their talents.
