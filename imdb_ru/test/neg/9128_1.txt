Koyaanisquatsi is simply the best movie I've ever seen. This is a masterpiece where everything is in the right place. Some scenes are not “good” or “beautiful”, but the camera never looks in and does not interfere. This is exactly what is happening here. The camera is used for invasion, shame and ridicule. There is no magic flow, no sense of greatness or respect. Instead, some scenes are connected without a larger goal or plan. The music is disturbing. Just as I rated Koyaanisquatsi as the best movie ever made, this one is the worst. This is also a “pure” film, but this is a negative form, exactly what should not be done.
