First of all, I have to say that I'm not a big fan of werewolf movies at all. It’s not that I don’t like them, they just don’t really like me. There are some that I liked ... London's Werewolf (1935, Stuart Walker), American Werewolf in London (1981, John Landis) ... and some that I thought were fine, but nothing special ... Wolf Man (1941, George Waggner), Howl (1981, Joe Dante), Dog Soldiers (2002, Neil Marshall) are some examples ... but in general, a werewolf subgenre is not my favorite. But I had this on one of these 50 sets of films, so I decided to give it a watch and see how it was. <br /> <br /> Spoilers follow ... <br /> <br /> A mad monster is a story about a werewolf, but a werewolf is primarily used as a means of revenge by a mad scientist, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco). Dr. Cameron discovered a way to turn people into beasts, particularly wolves, but was ridiculed and ostracized by a large scientific community. Forced to leave a prestigious position, he goes crazy and plans to take revenge on those who mocked him in an old country mansion, where he lives with his daughter Lenora (cute Ann Nagel) and his assistant Peter (Glenn Strange) with limited mental abilities. Using his serum, Dr. Cameron turns Petro into a werewolf and sends him to kill his old rivals. In the end, however, werewolf Peter gets out of control, and the mad doctor and his creation are killed. <br /> <br /> The film also looks like a drama about murder / crime, with journalist Lenore (Johnny Downs)) investigating the strange behavior of the doctor and a number of murders. It seems that the story borrows a lot of elements from other big pictures that came before it. There are reminders of Frankenstein (1931, James Weil) in creating a monster that infuriates, and the creature kills an innocent child. The visions of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931, Ruben Mamulyan or 1941, the version of Victor Fleming) and The Wolfman (1941, George Waggner) also come to mind. And this, in my opinion, is one of the problems with this film - it looks like a mediocre mix of some great movies. This adds little to the genre. <br /> <br /> True, there are some redemptive qualities. The speech by George Zucco was convincing, and the scene in which Dr. Lorenzo speaks with his visions / hallucinations about his tormentors helps me to show his insanity well. There is some reasonable character formation, at least in the case of his character. But the character of Glenn Strange is not convincing at all and seems to have this comedic quality - intentional or not, I'm not sure - it just does not fit into the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> I thought I liked it more than most IMDb users, based on my 4/10 rating, but it was a movie below average. It might be worth seeing if you are a fan of early werewolf films or a big fan of horror films of the 1930s and 1940s, but you’d hardly like it if you don’t.
