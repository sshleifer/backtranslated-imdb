In this film there were very few moments of real drama. After the first minutes of the film, the film descended in a spiral that did not quite lead us to hell and back - the view was pure purgatory, to say the least. Acting was more terrible than the subject of the film, and sometimes I could not stop laughing. The continuity between some scenes was terrible - the characters disappeared from the scenes without giving a reason, and they were replaced by other characters who had been someone else minutes earlier. Of course, it was a parody of the Exorcist. The collection plate in the church must have been full of copper on the day Mr. Russo signed up for this one. Do I speak Latin? Et tu brutus.
