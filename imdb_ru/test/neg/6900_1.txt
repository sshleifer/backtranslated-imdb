When my six-year-old child fell asleep in the theater during this film, this was all the evidence I needed for this film to be ugly. It was boring. The scary parts were boring. Parts of maudlin were boring. Even the funny parts — with two small exceptions — were boring. And predictably. And did I mention predictably? Examples: 1) A rude but loving dad indulging his child. 2) Rude but loving dad buys a farm (while singing a song?!). 3) A child who decides to cut himself and run away, but thanks to his friends, sticks out things because they need him. 4) a child who won with incredible chances. 5) And the cheeky character voiced by an African American actress. We must pay tribute to these filmmakers for this originality and for the preservation of this stereotype. I mentioned two funny parts. In both cases, minor characters are introduced. The mouse bouncing on the farmer's pulse was fun. The dog on the farm, sacrificed for its dog's weakness, fighting for the lead, was funny. But other? Painful. Someone tried to make the film “Hipness-Thru-Committee” and make it even more exciting by creating an animated computer film, and this was the result. And why make coyote-batman-villains dumb, monologues with their victims, and not just eat them? Oh yeah. Blood in this film for children is not needed, already concentrating on the false use of alcohol, destructive behavior and slight humor. And the fuzzy thing in the box? What exactly was it? Porcupine? Tasmanian devil? What, besides a really stupid plot to help the Otis Cow win the Mother of All Battles? The farmyard is a bomb. And I didn't even need to mention the udder.
