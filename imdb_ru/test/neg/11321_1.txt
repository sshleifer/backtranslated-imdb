I like a good new song. No, I'm taking it back. I love a good novelty. On the other hand, I absolutely despise GGROBAR and hear from the first note. When I found out that someone had created a cartoon based on it, my head almost exploded. Now that I saw this, because my children begged me, I would like my head to explode. This would save me from the agonizing suffering that was cr @ pfest. First, a funny idea to make an hourly show based on three-minute novelty. Stretching such a song, which should sound like crazy, to be so long, an entire hour, is even more funny. Dear God, is it bad?
