First of all, I am upset that there is no “0” out of 10. <br /> <br /> Tonight I was bored, and, watching the channels, I see Dr. Chopper. Since there is nothing more there, I decided to watch it, expecting it to be just another crappy horror movie, similar to the story of Cabin Fever. <br /> <br /> Dude, I was wrong ... Doctor. Because of the helicopter, the Cabin Fever looked like it was supposed to receive many Academy Awards. Let me remind you that in “Cabin Fever” there is a scene where a little guy turns around a porch shouting “pancakes !!”, characters who leave their dying friend in a tiny shack to bleed to death, and Sean from Boy Meets World mistakenly goes through the hole in the girl's thigh. <br /> <br /> So, needless to say, Dr. Chopper was a big, stinking bunch of crap. It was not even funny shit. It reminded me of a horror movie I was supposed to make in 8th grade, called “The Campout”. Except for the fact that “The Campout” had the best script (we wrote it about an hour before the shooting), the best actors, scenes, bloody scenes and camera work. I was hoping to laugh at a poorly made horror film, but instead I could only watch with surprise, thinking to myself: “Did the 8th grade do it?”. <br /> <br /> The game was terrible, the events and various small plots were combined and had no meaning, and the bloodshed and violence were very minimal. I liked how people instantly died from a small stabbed wound, and the killers' only weapon was small pocket knives ... if you are going to make a horror movie, at least give the killer (s) an insane murder device. <br /> <br /> Besides, what the hell was the reason why girls participating in the women's club didn't give promises? A good way to show some scenes of running girls in bras, even if they have nothing to do with the story. And I have to say that my favorite phrase was when the blonde said to Dr. Chopper, "I would like to introduce you to someone ... my inner bitch." Then her “inner bitch” starts collecting the trash can, throwing it at Dr. Chopper, miss, and in fear of killing the killer. <br /> <br /> Wow .... well, that was a long time. But I felt I had to express my feelings about how terrible this “film” was. I know that everyone has their own opinion, but if someone appreciates this film above 2, it should be shot in hell ... <br /> <br /> ... seriously.
