Not finding the right words is a problem for everyone in this urban comedy like vaudeville. They do not know what to say, and they do not know how to say it, so they enter into a potentially humiliating enterprise of pre-organized speed dating. Unfortunately, they all look like cardboard characters, not like real people. The story follows the usual three-stage structure: familiarity with a significant cast in their pitiful solitary lives, a real dating scheme and the final band of romantic attacks that demonstrate some of the madness of the newly-opened couple. Since all this is so predictable, I would say that “Narration” is a failure. Like a comedy, most of the time it’s too stupid to be really funny. Thumbs up Catherine von Steinburg. She stands out from the crowd of the soap opera as alienated, independently rich in Miriam. Great makeup too (Verena Weißert): heavy eyeshadow is found with a gloss of skin in the tones of the lips, creating a brooding and bohemian, but girlish effect. Also thank Stefan Zinner as a Bavarian car of love and Tanya Shlyif as a hot nutritionist. They bypass the communication problem through the eternal body language of copulation.
