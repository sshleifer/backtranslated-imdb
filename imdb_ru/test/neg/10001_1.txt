First of all, I hate those moronic rappers who could not have acted if they had a pistol pressed to his forehead. All they do is curse and shoot each other and behave like a clich√©-version of the gangsters. <br /> <br /> The film does not take more than five minutes to explain what is happening before we are at the warehouse. In this film there is not a single sympathetic character, except for the homeless, who is also the only one with half brain. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton and William Sadler are both Billy Billy and the character Sadlers is a villain like gangsters. I did not like him from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with meaningless violence and the specialty of Walter Hills: people fall through the windows and glass is flying everywhere. There is practically no plot, and this is a big problem when you support anyone. Everyone dies, except Paxton and the homeless, and everyone gets what they deserve. <br /> <br /> The only two blacks that can act are the homeless guy and the addict, but they are actors by profession, not annoying ugly rappers. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this shit and instead look 48 hours 1 and 2. At a minimum, they have characters you care about, a sense of humor, and only real actors in the cast.
