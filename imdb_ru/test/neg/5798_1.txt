I can laugh at almost anything, but unfortunately there is not a single one in this smelly bomb! I honestly watched this movie from beginning to end and did not even smile. I am shocked that Sandler, Schneider, Spade, etc. have put their names in this piece of shit. Worse than the worst SNL player ever. What else can I say? How could such a tasteless, extremely unfunny nonsense of so many obvious talents !! Maybe I lost my sense of humor (unlikely), but I can't remember a movie that I really disliked for a long time. What a waste of 2 hours, I will never come back.
