Another recent comedy that shows that Hollywood can't even do the basics when it comes to filmmaking, which he has been doing in a dream for decades. If the writer / director had some brains, they would have based the film on the character of Stamp tyrant-boss Jack Taylor. When he makes an early film, there’s nothing special about it, but he’s a little promising and sometimes funny. As soon as he leaves for the most part of the film, and Kutcher arranges his “merry” adventures, sitting at home with a guest after a boring guest bored into him, the film completely falls apart. <br /> <br /> As a result, a passable Timewaster had to be turned into an inept abomination.
