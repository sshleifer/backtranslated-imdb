The relations of Western-style feminism to various subcultures of India have so far practically not existed, two entities belonging to alien spheres and threatening (in the name of tradition) never coincide. Art imitates life (or is asserted), and popular Hindi films are no exception, reflecting the underlying misogyny, which, unfortunately, forms the basis of much of the collective Indian culture. But why? What is it about the female gender that has made it so hateful to culture that women are usually subjected to the most unimaginable horrors, including rape, murder, infanticide, imposed illiteracy, infidelity and submission to the spirit that goes by the name of "dowry"? Rajkumar Santoshi’s last sentence, Lajja, asks the same plaintive question, linking the atrocities committed against women in three separate chapters / episodes, which include a journey of shame that its main character, Vaidehi (Manisha Coyral), experienced. <br /> <br /> The direction from Santoshi does not correspond to the level that history requires. He does not achieve the necessary sensitivity in the image of the saga of sadness and is faced with the problem of misogyny from the side, not the forehead. Santoshi recently said that he was shooting a film not for the international film festival, but for the broad masses of his country. Unfortunately, stickiness is demonstrated, and the film too often delves into the action movie genre Santosh specializes in. The film suffers from a sharp episodic tempo, and its ending is too contrived. <br /> <br /> The female cast gets much kinder and rounder characteristics than their male counterparts. The main character is played by the gently glowing beauty Manisha Koyral, who proves in Ladj that she is one of the most competent leading ladies of our time, and, considering her role and mood, comes out with a really meritorious game. One wonders how brilliantly she could shine if the film had been shot by the director with the appropriate creative intent and understanding of the subject matter. Mahima Chowdhury performs a meritorious performance and continues to show that she is an untapped talent. In the role of Dzhanki Madhuri Dixit performs with unmatched zeal and joy for what really deserves the name "acting”. The role of a smart street performer, who finds solace in alcohol and the promise of an unborn child, represents the greatest risk to her cannon as song and dance roles, which have retained her tent status over the past decade. This leaves the last and most disturbing performance in this possibly feminist saga, the game of the continuously gifted Rekha. Lajja is a film of Manishi Koirala, there can be no doubt about that, but it is Rech that plays the main role in the performance, which penetrates your bones and sends an echo of horror through the threshold of your heart. Reha blinds like Ramdulari, refusing vanity and complacency to present a performance so full of authenticity and ingenuity that emotional nudity becomes the mantra of this part of the film. Comparisons are indeed odious, especially when they are opposite one of the great leading ladies of the world, but in the gracious presence of this reigning screen legend others disappear into its shadow. <br /> <br /> Lajia has nothing sophisticated proto-feminist dramas, such as Zubeidaa, Pinjar, or even the celebration of Laadla's Queen of Hell: it fulfills its feminist goals in two early moments: a loud tirade in which Mahima scolds her relatives for the abuse of them, her father did not commit any other crime than the birth of a girl. She breaks out, leaving the wedding procession in ruins. Seeing that her father is devastated, she begins to cry, blaming herself for the chaotic destruction in front of her. She complains: “Why did I say something? I messed up! It's my fault! ”Her grandmother, silently watching the cruel treatment of her, consoles her, saying,“ Why are you crying? You have no reason to cry. You are not guilty of anything. I'm sorry. Every woman who came before you is to blame, because if we had the courage to say today what you said today, you wouldn’t need to say anything today. ” In this scene, the importance of the Feminist Heritage is clearly visible through words. <br /> <br /> Another, more subtle point comes very early in the film when Vaidehi (Manisha) fled from her violent husband to the shelter of her parents' house in India. To viewers of Western societies, it may seem perfectly reasonable (indeed, natural) that any woman who has been subjected to violence will look for the protective custody of her parents; this, however, is a social taboo in many eastern cultures, including India. After a woman is married, she accepts the identity of her husband and his personal assets (family, business, children, etc.). For her to give up these responsibilities is a serious social sin, which really does not have an equivalent for a Western woman. After that, she is considered a spoiled and “spoiled commodity,” whose value has been completely negated by her own actions and her refusal to fulfill the role she was given. She is not so much a person as an emblem of family honor. Her father reproaches her for her actions, worried that his family honor will be irreparably tarnished by his daughter, which he has already transferred to another person. His main concern is the upcoming marriage of Vaidehi's younger sister, the likelihood that a divorced older daughter in the same house will become much less likely. He tells her unconditionally that she must return to the person to whom she legally belongs, no matter how cruel and sadistic he is. He imposes on her a centuries-old proverb: “The honor of every house is in the hands of his daughter.” Quietly and thoughtfully, she replies: “Yes, the honor of each house is in the hands of his daughter. But for the daughter itself there is no honor. ”
