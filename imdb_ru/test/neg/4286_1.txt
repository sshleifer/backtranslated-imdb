The blame for this terrible film lies with director Martin Campbell. After viewing several of his works in the following years, this was supposed to be one of his first directorial performances. He had more than a decent cast, but unfortunately he had no idea what he was doing. There were scenes that didn't make any sense at all. Where was his head ............... he was on drugs? I was looking forward to this film only because of Oldman and Bacon. Maybe it was a short filming schedule, and Campbell just had to “hit”. I can not imagine that the story that Campbell directed was even closer to the story that the author wrote. Oldman and Bacon, along with the rest of the actors, must have slipped under their chairs if they went to the show. As one of the authors pointed out, Karen Yang played a pretty good scene with Bacon. She really let go. It is unfortunate that I need to fill more space in order to stay within the guidelines of what IMDb requires, because I really have nothing more to say about this boring movie. No one should be forced to be a "talker" when criticizing a terrible flick, and would like IMDb to change the word count to fill out the criticism.
