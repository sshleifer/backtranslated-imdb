Bled begins when young artist Sai (Sarah Feruoki) meets a mysterious but charming man named Renfield (Jonathan Oldham), and they eventually return to her studio apartment, where he gives her the bark of some kind of tree that is used in as a hallucinogenic drug. when melted. Sai quickly gets hooked when she is sucked into an alternative fantasy reality involving vampiric creatures. Sai's girlfriend, photographer Royce (Chris Ivan Tsevich), begins to worry about her, when she moves away from reality, when she becomes addicted to a drug, whether Royce can quit his drug or he will eventually ruin her life, and why mysterious Renfield caused her Dependency first, what does it have to do, and do complex fantasy dreams like traveling have any significance? <br /> <br /> Co-created and directed by Christopher Hutson, this anemic artistic film "Vampire" is largely 95 minutes of fatigue and fully deserves all the bad comments. The script was written in an interesting way called Sxv'leithan Essex (how the hell do you even say it?), Who is also considered a production designer, and his unusual name is actually more interesting than anything that ever happens in Bled, I think that the creators intended to make a very serious horror movie based on fantasy, with a strong moral message about the dangers of drugs, drug addiction and drug rape on a date. Much of the film is about the drug problem with Sai’s first acquaintance with drugs, how great it was for the first time and how she became hopelessly addicted, which ultimately destroys her, her life and the lives of her friends. It never explains where she continues to receive this drug, since Renfield gives her a little during their first meeting, but who cares? The first twenty-odd minutes of Bled are really boring and dull, the next hour or so is not much better before the mess of the last ten minutes, in which the monster vampire and Renfield reappear. Moral elements patronize, fantasy elements seem like an afterthought, but horror does not exist. There is also a dialogue that is terrible, each sentence tries to be deep, has a lot of hidden depth and just tries to make so much sense that it becomes tiresome to listen to. <br /> <br /> The concept of the film - Terrible, like the penalty, because there is no blood and violence in it, and all this happens in an apartment in which there seems to be no light. The fantasy setting looks a little better, but it is rarely visible and underused. There is no panic, no atmosphere, and, even worse, the creators decided to use muted very faded colors, which I just hate and find annoying, what is wrong with a good colorful image? It seems to me that this is the passion of current directors, who seem to think that it automatically makes the film cool or adds an atmosphere that it certainly does not do, more often it just makes your film dull and boring, as confirmed here by Bled. <br /> <br /> It was probably a small budget, and it was shot in Los Angeles, and it has reasonable production figures, but it's all so boring. The acting did not impress me, I did not care about anyone or anyone, which was never a good sign. <br /> <br /> “Bled” is a terrible film about vampires, which tells about psychological horror, as well as physical and psychological diversity. parallels with real life, dug addiction, and what it can do to have little or no effect, because it's all so boring. There may be an audience for a film such as this one, but considering other comments, not so big.
