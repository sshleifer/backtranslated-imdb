This was the first feature for Clinton, I was there while he was shooting this mess in Adelaide around 98 ... <br /> <br /> Although I did not directly participate in the shooting, I witnessed typical delusional behavior, post-post that collapsed: parties, drugs, illusory glamor - really an example of what should not be done when making a film, but also a by-product of young, talented people who fall into the classical ideology Slava and worldly position. <br /> <br /> I like Clinton, we had a curious friendship, he deserves another track with a more mature scenario ... there are problems there, and I’m sure that much better work will be done if there is a next round. Because, to be honest, he certainly didn’t do himself a favor with this in his resume, and also the actors didn’t ... but hey, it was a paid job, in a country where the actors regularly starve to death <br /> < br /> In general, it is fascinating to watch “creation” in principle, not so fun to experience (alas!).
