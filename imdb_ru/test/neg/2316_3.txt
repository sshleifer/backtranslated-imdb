"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"! If IMDb allowed for word tests, it would be mine. Initially, this film was intended only for children, and it would not be easy for adults and older children to watch the film. Singing, history, everything is boring and blurry - like this public press. Like other comedy films with roots in traditional children's stories (such as the terrible Snow White and Three Series and overvalued BABES IN TOYLAND), this film has limited appeal and simply does not age. Now that I think about it, I seriously doubt that many children nowadays would even find this film enjoyable! So my advice is NOT TO WATCH this movie. If you MUST watch Abbott and Costello films, almost any of their films (other than A & C GO TO MARS) would be an improvement.
