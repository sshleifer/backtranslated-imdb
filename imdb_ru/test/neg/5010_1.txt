I tried to watch it, and was very disappointed. Do not expect Amy's brother, smart and insightful humor, David, among this sunken ... this is the polar opposite. But if you joke about poop, fart and slip, you will get to the seventh sky. I believe this is a bathroom humor aimed at those who have had a few bongs, which can only explain why many enthusiastic reviewers called this shit "the best television letter in history." I assume that those who hate such simple humor could not look long enough to try to present a review, but I just send a warning shot to those uninformed viewers who are looking for high-class comedy. Characters replay. The shock coefficient is set to 10. And laughter is set to zero (unless, of course, you are looking for a youthful, low eyebrow humor.) <br /> <br /> I did it after 40 minutes, praying all the time it will turn the corner to the side worthwhile entertainment, but alas, worse and worse. And beware of Amy and Hammy's ubiquitous facial expressions - it will make you roll your eyes. I was pleased to see cameos from famous comedians that I like, but I can only assume that they agreed to participate as a favor for the Sedaris family. <br /> <br /> For those who loved it, Iâ€™m sorry. it's my opinion. It was so bad that it inspired me to write my first review.
