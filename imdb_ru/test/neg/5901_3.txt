When it was released, this film caused a stir. I watched it and was delighted. Beautiful, usually young, naked women were shot in a classy style that we knew so well from the photograph of director Hamilton. His photos never become porn and the same is true for this movie. Today I saw it again and was very disappointed. The soft core in extremely slow scenes shot with Vaseline on lenses is, in fact, all that is. There is no real story, the characters remain beautiful and beautifully shot bodies, but they are not real creatures with a soul. In fact, nothing happens. This is similar to how Hamilton takes pictures using moving images, not photos. And it gets so boring after a while. I did not even watch it all the second time because I fell asleep. This is all that remains of this masterpiece: it is a very good hypnotic. And you will never become addicted to it! <br /> <br /> Then 7 out of 10, now 3 out of 10
