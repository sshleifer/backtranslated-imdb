After watching the movie, I must say that this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. It takes away my worst movie award from Komodo, which is not an easy task. This is not a porn or a legitimate movie, and it gives them as a bad name. Acting, camera work, plot, script and sound are terrible. My personal favorite part of the film is the duck asking the bartender if he has any grapes. Why was there such a joke in the movie? Did the director think; “I need a humorous scene to balance a great game, so I will use some kind of joking joke that I read on the Laffy Tuffy wrapper.” Another late part is when Norman sheds an invisibility potion on himself, trying to keep him from spilling. Why did they even bother to give the film a NC-17 rating, did they hope to get as large an audience as possible? At least, if he were assigned a rating of X, it would be more sexy and therefore would distract the attention of viewers from the overall poor quality. I pray that someone who has worked on this loss of panties will answer.
