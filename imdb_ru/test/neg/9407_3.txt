I will leave it to my players, yeah, itâ€™s better to laugh here and gawk at this wonderful amazing film and just say that I thought it was smelly. whatever it is. I will not say what you will get out of the film. For me, those who have seen through the simplicity and machinations of this have my money. There was one, perfectly flawless, when he pointed out two great moments of things that belong to Pacino. Meeting and airport. In addition, well, what a waste of time. Through. Pacino just does the same thing over and over again, it would be better to serve him, reducing his productivity by about five steps to about the level of his protege. Everyone always says, but this film could be much better. Of course, they could all be. But in fact most of them simply should not have been done. Including this one.
