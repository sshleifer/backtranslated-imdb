A strange, deliberately distorted biopic about Diane Thomas, in which we hear a little more than a dozen lines of his poetry. Instead, we have to endure the gross exposure of the character, seen through the prism of his proto-bigam relations with his wife (Sienna Miller) and childish love (Keira Knightley). Matthew Rhys plays Thomas with enough charm to instill us from his otherwise repulsive self-interest, and Cillian Murphy makes up a constantly tense love affair. <br /> <br /> It seems that the film never decides where it goes. There is no arc as much as a viaduct from one end of the war to the other. Maybury seems to be much more interested in her two women (who would not!?) Than the man who unites them and then shares them. Miller is a choice of two (I found Knightley at best competent, but then I never found her sympathetic), but they both offer terribly inconsistent Welsh accents. Other fun solutions include too much for the unessential character of William (Murphy), artistic production (for example, double crossing), which is neither impressionistic nor symbolic, and the old chestnut act of cadres of the period, which is not mixed. 4/10
