It's sad to say that the film is really terrible, and everyone is trying to find a way to say it. However, this is a terrible movie. Gene Hackman is wasting time (and, as is suspected, a lot of dollars) reprinting his most famous and often re-created role, "Gene Hackman." Otherwise, television actors are given the opportunity to become movie stars and successfully resist temptation. Patrick Swayze has a minor role, and he took up more significant things, for which he should be eternally grateful. <br /> <br /> I watched this film as a result of someoneâ€™s review and felt that it was another honored worker. You may not agree with my review, but now, at least, you have been warned.
