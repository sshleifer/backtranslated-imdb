I made and lost two and a half hours of my life, which I can never recover. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I have no idea what critics and fans see in this film. And this is not because I can not appreciate the "art". I like a good movie with deep messages, brilliant cinematography and great directing. <br /> <br /> This film is not one of them. <br /> <br /> My main complaint about this film is that it is so terribly slow, to such an extent that it tires its audience to death. On the other hand, the sequences of the dialogs are too fast, and there is not enough information so that people who have not yet read the book know what is happening (my mother had mercy on me and explained everything before I looked at it). Would that kill them to hire a narrator? At least for the beginning and the end? <br /> <br /> Let me sort this out for you: (Spoilers are everywhere) <br /> <br /> For the first two minutes, you are viewed on a black screen with no music, waiting for a real movie to appear. Start. <br /> <br /> Over the next one and a half minutes you will see several photos of the sunrises and landscapes of the savannas. As if the audience could not figure out how to make a scene if they did not see the shot from the place three or four times. <br /> <br /> The next eleven minutes are occupied by grumbling monkeys. They fight, they see a monolith, they still fight, they smash things with bone. Presumably they are prehistoric people whose evolution is influenced by the singing of a monolith. Not that you could say you didn’t read the book. <br /> <br /> * Finally * we fall into space. Only to be subjected to the twelve minutes of the ships, slowly rotating to the Blue Danube waltz (a fairly fast pace, as I understand it, yet here it feels absolutely painful). Finally, we get some kind of innocuous dialogue and a rather mysterious statement that the government does not allow people to land on the moon. It remains for us to think about this for another fourteen minutes of the “Blue Danube” and rotating ships and neat foci of the antigravity camera. <br /> <br /> Four minutes of observation follows as the ship flies over the surface of the moon and the dock at the space station. We get a little more exposure in the next conference room scene. Then we return to the street and travel at the speed of a snail across the moon. The second monolith is revealed, again filling our ears with this terrible ringing (I had no idea that it was a real piece of music!). The monolith holds its own small light show, and then the story jumps forward. <br /> <br /> * Seven * minutes of observation as the ship moves toward Jupiter. By this time, my brain turned into a mess. Can it move slower? Maybe it is “realistic” to portray it as such, but we still do not need to see five or six different pictures of the same thing in order to understand the concept of its “realism”. Let me tell you about this "realism" thing; I greeted when the character of the second astronaut died. Not because I'm a sadist and I love to watch people die, but because after five minutes I was so annoyed by the sound of his cursed breath! I have to take care of this character, feel when he dies! Instead, I expected blissful silence, whatever it was. <br /> <br /> In any case, now we come to the most interesting part of the film - the part with HAL. Forget about Dave, the main character of the tree. The real star of the series is a cold, impersonal, frighteningly villainous, ruthlessly merciless bad guy at the computer. He's great. And the “Open doors in the compartment” sequence is wonderful. But it is too short. And soon the director starts again for too long. <br /> <br /> Four minutes to die HAL. And he will die. Slowly, painfully, with every minute losing the intellect, the voice becomes lower and slower, sings “Daisy, Daisy”, all with a low and constant hiss, which becomes as annoying as heavy breathing. <br /> <br /> Seven minutes of flying flowers, when Dave enters the monolith. Seven. I felt my brains melting and dripping from my ears! Seven full minutes is absolutely nothing, except for some guy, stunned by the psychedelic version of space travel, again with this damned three-time damned chorus! We got the idea at the beginning of the sequence! Why pull it for so long? Unless he wanted LSD users to become mentally ill and have memories. <br /> <br /> I will not even try to explain the ending, mainly because I do not quite understand. He may be in the aliens research lab, and they teach him deep and deep things, while he watches as he grows older and older, and then they send him back to Earth as a kind of cosmic celestial child. . None of this is found in the film. As far as you know, this is just a sequence of images without a goal or plot. In many films it was. <br /> <br /> When I first tried to watch this movie, I gave up halfway. The second time when I suffered because of this patient excuse for the film, he had to help my sister determine the time of filming, to see how long they lasted. It's so boring. <br /> <br /> Call this disgusting film "art" if you want. I would not. I saw a more interesting "art" in the local museum. And I will never again suffer so much.
