I ... I don't know where to start. Dragon Hunt may just be the worst movie in cinema history. Even Anus Magilicutty was better than this, because it was intentionally bad. Showgirls? No, he had a kitschy meaning and was technically a good movie. But Dragon Hunt takes the cake and eats it, then vomits it back and feeds the homeless. This is a big parody. <br /> <br /> The game, if you can even call it that, is rough. It does not have the charm of an improvised acting game, so it should be written according to the script, but it is read with an almost evil tone of poor quality. Several lines were printed in such a way as to show that the actors (or, mostly, people on the screen) either regretted the connection with this film, or thought of a special joke from Saturday Night Live, which they watched before they appeared before camera. I could write three more paragraphs about the quality of the game in this film, but you and I both don’t want to hear it. <br /> <br /> Makeup and special effects (which are just fine in most movies) were ridiculously bad. An antagonist, whose name is so ridiculous that I cannot remember him, was stuck to the mohawk to the crown. Yes, glued to his head. And you can say that it is also glued, if you look at the place where it meets with its skull, you can see a plastic strip similar to that on artificial eyelashes. Fortunately, he is pretty much the only example of unsigned makeup on a film. <br /> <br /> There is a horrible character development, to say the least. Women who are allegedly rudely treated by supposedly benevolent furry brothers (and I mean, they are really being pushed) are not only ugly, but ... choking ... they don’t know what they are doing! In one scene, they give birth to their obvious lovers, join an even more ugly bad guy, and then sniff a cola. Apparently, they managed to get some good cocaine, because they started shaking and laughing EVEN before it all went up to their nostrils. Great time, girls! In addition, they wear really awful things, clothes that belong exclusively to the late 80s and early 90s. <br /> <br /> In general, this film, this film, I must say that it is a waste of a film, is also a waste of time. Watching him will hurt you and will require a suspension not only of your faith, but of your whole brain. If you want your friends to chat and laugh, see if you can get this movie (you will probably have to download it), otherwise don’t even think about it. I hope I was helpful.
