<br /> <br /> I saw this film during the festival in Munich with a huge crowd of real fantasy fans. Around the middle of the film, one part of the audience slept, and the other part was delighted. Boring dialogues, poorly set combat sequences, a terribly dull story and even worse special effects. Well, at least the actors had nothing to do, except that they looked worried or (if they were women), showing their breasts in the right light. Even Goetz Otto, who was among the audience, admitted that he could understand the disappointment of the audience. Be warned, folks, of the cheapest fantasy movie ever ........
