This film has all the components of great horror, and he loses in the last half. Few films can actually give me cold blows. This one did. Few horror movies give me a sense of fear. This one did. It made me guess. I took care of the story. I took care of the characters. The game was decent. Unfortunately, around the middle of the film, the story does not have many good indications. It becomes obvious that everything cool in the plot is going to self-destruct. It does. What is built in the first half as a great concept of horror is shifted from horror to absurdity. Plausible fear turns into a series of implausible reactions from the characters. The story ends with disappointment. Although this film seems complete, there is one free end that can be customized to continue. The film is not good enough to continue. This movie is worth seeing in the theater, just donâ€™t expect to be stunned. This is best suited for renting a movie. This is probably not the movie you would like to have.
