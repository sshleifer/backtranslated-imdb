Barbershop 2: Back in Business was not as good as the original, but just as fun. The film itself lacked the little things the original had, which made it much more pleasant. Back in Business seemed to be just another useless extension made to bring money with a very subtle conspiracy. Cedric the Entertainer's terrible excuses for the memories destroyed the film and seemed like a bad way to try to get the audience to adapt to the character more. Overall, Barbershop 2: Back in Business was a sequel that was not needed, without the original charm, soul and spark.
