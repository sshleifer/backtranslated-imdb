This film is rubbish, it looked very funny on the preview, but I didn’t laugh even once in the whole film. Do yourself a big favor and don’t waste your money on it, don’t waste anyone’s money on it. I gave him 1/10, believe me, I would give less if I could. I’m a 15 year old boy and I thought it was a mess if you wanted to watch a good movie and see how Jay and Silent Bob hit back.
