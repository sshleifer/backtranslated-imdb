MASSACK CHERLIDER (2003) <br /> <br /> Starring: Tami Sheffield, Charity Rahmer, Erin Byron, Leonard Johnson, E. Eddie Edwards, Samantha Phillips, GG Erneta, April Flowers, Nikki Fritz, Tylo Tyler, Brad Beck Summer Williams, Brinke Stevens, Melissa Brassel. Plot. A group of fans, along with their coach and three guys are going to the game, when suddenly their van breaks down and they take refuge in the next cabin. Soon they drink, have sex and brutally kill one after another an invisible killer. <br /> <br /> Okay: a little laugh, an amazing killer personality, a cameo to Brinke Stevens, my favorite scene from the SLAMBER PARTY MASSACRE is used as a memory. <br /> <br /> Bad: I was excited about this film, I liked all the three massacres in “Elephant Party” because they were just funny, and I expected a lot from this “Sleepy Party / Massacre at Sorority House with screaming tones "), but it just sucked! They overdid it on “We are cheese, but proud” things and mostly from soft-veined porn, but with good ones — grayish-he. <br /> <br /> **
