Boring film. Bad plot. Poor actors. The film takes place in a room that should be in Morocco, but in fact in some American city! “Arab terrorists” are patriots, and a blond patriot is “Arab terrorists” ... DAMN! <br /> <br /> Although there is something good in this film (this is why a score of 2 out of 10). The director turns the ridiculous stereotype about terrorism that the media daily feeds us, into reality, the terrorists are Americans (or Westerners, if you will). <br /> <br /> The film is divided into two parts. The first part of the film is devoted to the journey of the Dutch (15 seconds), and the second - to stay in an amazing dark brown room (1 hour with something). <br /> <br /> A Dutch guy is going to deliver money to Morocco for some kind of “charitable organization”, comes down from the plain, gets on a bus and is eventually stolen in a dark brown room. He was kidnapped by another guy who was shot after he said, "They will not shoot at us." The surviving Dutchman has to play chess for so long with an Arab guy like Morpheus that you will learn to play chess too! In the end, the Dutch guy reveals his plot, not because he was cut off with four fingers, but because he is being deceived by such an unconvincing game that you should watch a movie with! <br /> <br /> Well, when you are so tired I can not sleep.
