Blimey! I just don’t know where to start, what made this movie so terrible. Maybe I should start by simply saying that during the “hot confrontation” between the antagonist and the main character I had to leave the theater because I was laughing so hard. Yeah. Acting was really so bad. The game was not even the worst part yet. The plot was almost completely shown in the preview. All characters are very underdeveloped. The dialogue and the “dramatic moments” are ridiculous. The bad guy is a caricature of an uncontrollable, drunk, sadist. <br /> <br /> But hey, the actors are beautiful, so guess what should have done better.
