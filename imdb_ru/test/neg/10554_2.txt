Wow, Kiss the Bride is not so bad, but not so good. It certainly was not the "Late Day Saints." The film sags in the center ... perhaps a shutdown of about 30 minutes would make the film more enjoyable. But the film gets bogged down again and again from annoying scenes and throwing out scenes - the entire golden sequence comes to mind. <br /> <br /> Although Kiss was created for theatrical release, it looks and sounds more like a television movie. Each scene is illuminated as a department store. So many characters are thrown away. <br /> <br /> And dear Tori is, in fact, a pleasant surprise. She steals every scene in which she appears. <br /> <br /> One scene really annoyed me. It was a rehearsal dinner in this large room with many tables - all decorated. But only 5 or 6 people in a room for 250! Where are all gone? <br /> <br /> Gay cinema has dropped to a new low ... but not as low as the horrible films produced and shown on "Here!" Channel.
