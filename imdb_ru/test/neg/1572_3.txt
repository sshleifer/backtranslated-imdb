Such a long-awaited remake of the cherished musical classics and such a bitter pill that he had to take. It is very, very difficult to swallow ... all this. He had not a drop of credibility anywhere. And when you don't have a rose, you don't have a show. <br /> <br /> Bette Midler seems to be born to play this role. However, all that she could produce was Bette Midler's sweet, funny, brilliant trademark ... burdened by all the familiar middlelerisms. Rose Russell has nothing to worry about. She can rest in her grave, knowing that she is still the best mom Rose (in any case, from the film). <br /> <br /> I thought that Midler is really going to survive this ... to immerse himself in what is. one of the greatest musical roles of all time ... as she did in The Rose. But no, she did not venture. She played herself. She made Rose a full animation of the dinner theater. Even her songs were boring. To look at it was unbearable, knowing that Midler has the talent to rise above her earning money. She showed promise only once in this “Gypsy”, and it was with “Rotation of the Rose”. But by then, it was too little, too late. <br /> <br /> Sincere Cynthia Gibb in the role of the main character gave the film the only true spark, and when the role of the Gypsy overshadows the role of Rose, you know that there is a problem in River City. <br /> <br /> A huge, huge disappointment.
