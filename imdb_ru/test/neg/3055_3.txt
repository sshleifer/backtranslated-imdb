When I first saw it, I thought it was pretty scary. But the horror is a little undermined by the fact that the dense teenagers are so annoying that you do not care what happens to them. There are some really good moments, such as Angela’s talk about demons, and the shortly seen demon is effective. But it really does not withstand repeated viewing or careful analysis. It's all pretty sticky and cheap-looking and often completely stupid, pornography and naughty jokes too often replacing horror. The music is excellent, however, and the epilogue is, of course, funny, but in this film there is nothing special to recommend, it just looks like another “stem and slash” like Jason.
