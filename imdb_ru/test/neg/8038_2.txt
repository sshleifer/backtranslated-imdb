This is one of those "family" films that I cannot imagine in order to have someone around 9 years old. A group of brothers and sisters discovers a “sand fairy” (yes indeed), conveniently located at the end of a not very secret passage in the country house of their eccentric uncle, into which they were evacuated from the London blitz. ... and here, all in one sentence. This story is about the role of magic in childhood and the dangers of fulfillment of desires, but none of these questions are considered in a way that would be interesting for adults or instructive for children (or vice versa!). The only reason I can think to watch this is to see how Freddie Highmore's outstanding talent stands out from the rest of the mediocre performances.
