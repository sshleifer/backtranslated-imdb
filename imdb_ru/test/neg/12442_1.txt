I could crap the best movie. It is a waste of time and money. I'm sick of the fact that such films are actually being made, and people who make them think they really think they are good. I like teen comedies when they are done well. This film, however, takes this genre to a new level. With such films, people think that it is actually normal to do this dirt, and they ask unsuspecting people to pay money to accept it. This is sadism.
