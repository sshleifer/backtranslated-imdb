I found this film extremely homophobic ... the main character does not know that he is gay until he realizes that he likes Barbra Streisand and he has a lame wrist !!! I was so offended that after the screening at the Toronto Film Festival, I approached and talked to the screenwriter to complain about this film. This is the film that GLAAD should work to be banned.
