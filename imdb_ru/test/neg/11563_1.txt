This movie is really bad. Most of them look as if they were filmed either in the park or in the basement. There is a giant spider, but we see only one leg. There are some worms that live in a cave, which are simply cheap nasal dolls with cardboard teeth. And the plot is a bunch of post-apocalyptic mumbo giant who does not make sense at all. All this is just ridiculous.
