This movie is very similar to any other modern horror movie. It is predictable in how it is created and developed, and it is simply never possible to bring something original or shocking to the screen. This is indeed the biggest disappointment of the film, because overall there was still a promising basic concept for this kind of film. <br /> <br /> You can call this movie a great walking modern horror cliche. It has all the elements that make modern horror films are often not very good to watch. One of these aspects is a moaning and very naive little child. Why do they keep putting things like that in movies? The same goes for the dramatic aspects affecting the family. It just does not work for the film and is far from interesting and not effective. It often instead makes the film piece by piece and becomes annoying to watch. <br /> <br /> Thus, all the cliches are present in it, but also none of these cliches can be displayed on the screen. Like a horror movie, it's just really bad. He does not do well with his horror or tension. For fans of the genre there is very little to enjoy. The film, its history is not very well connected and built in the film. Too often, a movie sleeps piece by piece, and it never allows its horror to fully unfold. <br /> <br /> The film is also often too dark (no doubt, like trying to hide your rather low budget) and it also shows very little blood, mainly due to the fact that you just can't always see things so well . <br /> <br /> You can simply say, looking in this film, that the director is J.S. Cardon has no special talent in this genre, and he does not know how to properly handle these ingredients. In the past, he made several attempts, but so far all his films have failed. he just keeps trying, unfortunately. Who knows, maybe with the right people behind the camera (for example, with Tob Hooper, who was originally tied to directing), this film could still be something decent. <br /> <br /> This is a poorly played movie, mostly with big unknowns in it. The biggest movie title is Ben Cross, but its role is too small and, in a sense, not relevant enough for the film and its history. It did not even seem that he was very fun to play. <br /> <br /> Just skip it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
