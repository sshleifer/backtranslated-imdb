How can you make such a bad movie with such actors? Were they forced into it? The plot has nothing to do with the idea of ​​how things will turn out if the comedian is running for president. They do not even try to create an impression about it. Just at the time when you thought you were watching the comment of well-known liberals on the politics of the District of Columbia (the first five minutes), the film gets out of the way and ends up in a B-movie drama about 1) computer voting error, 2) ordinary evil corporate lawsuits who wants to hide it with the most extraordinary lines in history, and 3) a neurotic but very beautiful woman programmer who is trying to tell the future president about it. Soon she became a victim of evil masters of computer companies engaged in secret materials, who, instead of killing her, injected drugs into her to make her seem unreliable. But when she gets to DC, she doesn't tell him. In fact, the film then changes from the B-film drama to the idiotic B-film-love-drama drama. So far, we are so far from the original starting point of the film that most people turn it off. I almost did. If it was just an INTELLECTUAL love drama, but no! Is not! It's something like, “oh, I'm so nervous that I’m stupid all the time, so please love me for it” - a kind of love drama. All with a slow, slow pace that has nothing to do with the political plot of the film, the plot of the X-Files of the film, or the plot of the comedy of the film. All stories fail at all levels, as every annoying bit of meaningless dialogue reminds of. The love part should be the result of a decision during drunkenness "Hey, there must be a dynamic of love between a presidential candidate and an extremely pretty female programmer, yes, it will work! Put it in there!" br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Lewis Black is castrated and put in a role where he does not invent a single line of Lewis Black. The anger of Lewis Black is being replaced by the hope that he will ever appear in the film, which he never does. And Christopher Walken is thrown into the hospital with a heart disease, to duplicate the dramatic effect of a heart attack with the immediate assistance of the president in Westing. Watching how Christopher Walken is castrated, like Lewis Black, in roles that constantly struggle to appear casual and shrewd, but fail every time, like Titanic, is like watching a big man die on the beach blue whale. Heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> And then enter the low point of the entire film: this raises a stunning, extremely complex ethical question: should Robin Williams become president, knowing that he was elected because of the computer Crash? The American dream and all the good things prevail when he gives up the live presidency, like Lassie the dog. With the usual Patriotic Glamor of the Presidency and the clever history we create, the atmosphere Westing cultivated in abominable abundance over the next million years. <br /> <br /> The director and screenwriter Barry Levinson is now on my personal list of authors and directors I’m forever remaining. This film should be seen as a sign of an erroneous production process when people (including Barry Levinson) are forced to spend money on production because of their personal relationships, and not because of their skills. This is a project created to satisfy the desire of inexperienced people to achieve career success, and the previously mentioned great actors were deceived to participate in it. This is the only explanation. <br /> <br /> PS: Error voting in computers was caused by double letters in Dobbs, Kellogs and Mills. Of course, this was what else could be when you write the script and you can not distinguish the computer from the dishwasher.
