****** Spoilers inside ******* What a boring, predictable, not scary snoring festival. The film had no character development: I did not feel sympathy for any of the characters (except, perhaps, a little boy), and I didn’t care what happened to any of them. There were so many bits or items that were stolen from other horror films. <br /> <br /> The film was so predictable. Many times I told myself: “Let me guess what will happen? Yes, I was right. Even in the initial scene, I predicted that a man, possibly a father, had committed an “attack” on the family (since only his wife and children had attacked him). Of course, this is exactly what happened (of course, you need to wait 79 minutes to find out for sure). And, of course, another "evil man." Why was he angry and killing his family? Because he is a man, yes! <br /> <br /> As someone else said, this film can be scary for someone younger than 13 years old or for a 1970s movie, but this is far from being a “scary” movie by today's standards. . And, like many other crappy horror movies, many of them were fakes. Scary music, Scary music, Scary music and ... Suddenly a crow flies out the window! Wow, scary! <br /> <br /> How did an old man from a bank manage to walk several times in an open area so that his father would not see him? I definitely thought the old man was a ghost. No, just a shitty movie. <br /> <br /> I rated this film as 2 out of 10 because it held my attention enough to sort through all of this.
