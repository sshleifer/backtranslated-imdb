The original Road House is not an award-winning film. But this is one of the greatest pleasures of all time. It should not have been so difficult to make a sequel. No need for big budget, loud stars and impressive visual effects. Even the story should not have been original. All that is needed for this is a good mood and excellent fist fights. I don’t mean Matt-style “wire fu,” just some well-placed bar fights. A lot of them. There are some decent battles in the film, but none of them are remembered, and more attention is paid to the weapon game. Plus, the way it is associated with the original film is ridiculous, bordering on insult. Jonathon Shek plays Shane Tanner, an undercover DEA agent who is good with his arms and legs. But the kicker ... he is the son of Patrick Swayze Dalton's character !!!! What????? Let's see, the original Road House was made in 1989. So for Dalton in 2006, a son will be born at the age of 20 (maybe even 30) ... well, you understand. They give him a funny explanation that he lived with his uncle Nate (Will Patton) while his father "traveled a lot". Oh please. This in itself almost guaranteed the closure of this film. But I digress. Schaech is completely out of his element. Of course, he can throw a couple of blows, but nothing happens as an actor. In addition, in the film, the bad guys call him "cute boy." I have never studied men closely, but I do not think this guy looks too good. He looks sick. His face is too thin, and his sunken eyes create the impression that he will faint at any moment. I have never heard of him before, but I think he should give up acting and return to his daily work. Jake Busey plays the local drug lord Wild Bill. Blouse is not a terrible actor. He was good at Starship Troopers, and even made a formidable villain in Hitcher 2. But here he just chews the scenery in the standard mode of the bad guy. Even his “menacing” dialogue is worthy of a yawn. We should buy it as a person who has a whole city in his pocket. But why? What does he do? Because he wants to buy a bar from Patton "by any means necessary"? Ellen Hallman plays the role of a friend. Woman with a secret. It is a pity that the secret is as complex as 2 + 2. She is a local elementary school teacher, a former army soldier. Guess what that means? This means that, although she may be shaking with fear for most of the film, she will be ready to smash her head when the fur begins to fly. Well, at least she is hot. In fact, the struggle between her and the Wild Bill girl is the best in the film. It is fast, cruel and interesting. Which leads me to my next issue with the movie ... fights. As I said, Schaech knows how to strike. The same can not be said about someone with whom he faces in the film. Obviously, the film all comes down to Schaech versus Busey. Busey is an actor, not a fighter. He does not have the skills necessary to fight in the movies. Swayze may have been an accomplished dancer, but his athletic ability gave him the opportunity to conduct well-set fights. He also ran into a pair of worthy opponents and had one deadly (literally) move. None of this is here. With a few exceptions, fights are forced, poorly organized and routine. The beats sound like someone slaps 2X4 on concrete, and there are even a couple of parts where the sound doesn't even match the beat. This confuses. There is not even a good southern / country music of the original. Road House had a group of Jeff Healey, which at the time was somewhat popular. In this film, there is a singer named John Otto, whose music is cool, and his playing is even worse. He was given one line in the film, which was probably inserted to appease the fans he might have there. Or this, or someone owes him a favor. My last claim to the film is that I'm just picky ... continuity. Films are shot out of order, and then the editor must put it all together. Well, someone has to give a push to the editor of this movie. Problems range from such trifles as people who do not look in the same direction when changing the frame, to reuse material at the end of the film. In the beginning we get to know the bar The Black Pellican. When the camera moves through the bar, you see a group, bouncers and dancing people. At the end of the film, when the bad guys were defeated, we get another shot from the same bar, with the insertion of shots of our hero sitting in a bar with his girlfriend. The problem is that the shots of people in the bar are the SAME shots from the very beginning of the movie !!! I am not kidding. They are the same people standing (or dancing) in the same places, in the same clothes. Want to know the funny thing? You see the bouncers in the frame that were killed earlier in the film. Do yourself a favor, do not watch this film unless you feel the need to go out and hit someone. This film will make you angry enough to do it.
