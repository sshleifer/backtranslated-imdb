Watching this film, and then listening to the comments, it becomes clear that Michael Radford does not understand this play. The first clue that he is not able to fully understand the work is that he is making an effort to install the film in Venice of the seventeenth century. Yes, it sounds really strange, yes, this misunderstanding of the film will mean an attempt to make it as accurate as possible in terms of its location. But anyone who has studied Shakespeare knows that, although he puts most of his plays as exotic locals, the culture and values ​​are always modern England. This does not hurt the film, but shows the lack of necessary knowledge. <br /> <br /> Where Radford is killing a movie is how it makes him so serious. He manages to suck every joke out of the script, leaving the entire production apartment. Every ounce of passion is out of character. Even Shylock's “Will we not bleed to death” speech is a soft, awkward chatter from a choleric person who seems to say and do only what he does because he must. The lovers are solemn and too restrained (Joseph Fiennes pronounces some of the most romantic lines in the movie this year in a barely audible whisper), Graziano (who should promise to behave in one place) is more sober and collected than Bassiano (which makes him promise to behave) Jessica does not want to part with her father and spends her life with Lorenzo's pouting lips. <br /> <br /> In the commentary to the bleak and blurred scene of the court, the director expresses his shock that the audience laughed at Portia's proposal “Pound of flesh, no more, no less”; ultimately concluded that this was supposed to cause laughter. The Merchant of Venice is a comedy, and Radford scoffs at the idea that the most absurd and hysterical parts of the story are nothing more than the wildest provocative drama. <br /> <br /> The film does not yet have a clear understanding. cuts out some of the most interesting scenes. The characters are driven into high dramatic veils, so they look like Ibsen characters reading Victorian poems. And the comedy finale, where all the good guys go to bed happy, is buried in worthy despair, which seems like they are finding a tough world with impending death, rather than reconciling with lovers. Even Lancelot and Antonio come out of the film, holding their hats like aristocratic mourners. <br /> <br /> The film is poorly made, because the creative forces do not understand the script. It is harsh where it should be hysterical. It is reserved where it should be passionate. This is Michael Radford, where William Shakespeare should be.
