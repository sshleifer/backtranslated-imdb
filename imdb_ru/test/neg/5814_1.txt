I found this gem in a rack, at the local video rental store there were ribbons that exchanged various rental locations. "The man who was skiing down Everest." Hmm ... never heard of it. The box says about a Japanese guy who always wanted to go skiing on Everest and really did it. Sounds interesting. I rented it. As expected, it was a documentary style. The first part can be summarized as follows: "I always wanted to go down to Mount Everest." Then follow some footage of the preparation for the event. MANY training frames. Well, I suppose it takes a lot of preparation. Then we consider a protracted figure on a skier, Yuichiro Miura's philosophy about life, etc. Then another filler follows, and I begin to wonder how skis approach this show. More preparation is shown, and they begin to make the journey uphill. More philosophy is shown. Finally they arrive at the mountain, and maybe, perhaps, it will cost to ski down below. Many videos about climbing, later there is a description of the parachute device, designed to slow down the speed of Miura on a steep slope. Finally, he fastens his skis and prepares for the exit. <br /> <br /> He leaves ... The skis are about twenty feet tall, and his skis run out from under him, he deploys the parachute and tumbles in an inglorious bundle for some distance down the mountain and that's it. The end of the story. What the hell was that? <br /> <br /> Well, I can buy that he always wanted to go skiing on Everest, prepared carefully and really tried it with a film crew in tow. It did not work, and he ended up collapsing and almost killing himself, so what glaring arrogance would inspire a person to make a film about him and call him skiing in Everest? Perhaps the name “The man whose legs fell out from under his feet, and he slid down his ass to Everest” was too long for the tape.
