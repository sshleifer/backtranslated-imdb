it was so hard to watch a man! it was not at all funny, not very well done, and there was no point or plot in it. the game was terrible. It was not very well done at all. it looked as if the guys my age were just hanging out and making a meaningless film. This is by far the worst movie with a broken lizard. if you are the same as I am, a movie with a broken lizard, you will be disappointed and boring to death. please skip this meaningless movie about ugly guys looking for chicks. You will not regret my advice. By the way, do not say that you did not find this review useful only because you did not agree with it. it's stupid like this movie. The only scene was OK when the main guy played rugby and he was kicked out of shit. I liked it because I found his character damn annoying.
