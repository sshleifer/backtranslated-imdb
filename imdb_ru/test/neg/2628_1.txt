Milo is a full slanderous film Mikey 1992, if you really check it out, both films have the same tagline! But if you want to watch an incredibly funny movie without any plot ... well, then this is the movie for you. Acting is terrible, and the overwhelming majority of flashback scenes are confusing. The story of this atrocity is simple: Milo Jeder is a child with serious family problems, his father is an abortion doctor who holds unborn fruits in a jar (Nice!) And desperately needed his own child, he came up with a way to bring one of these interrupted children to life and he called it ............. MILO !!!!! <br /> <br /> In addition to all the bad actions, terrible directing, annoying sound of Milo's voice and shrill sound of a bell on his bike, if you remove all this misfortune, this is still a bad, but funny movie attempt. <br /> <br /> I will give him bank bankruptcy 1 out of 10
