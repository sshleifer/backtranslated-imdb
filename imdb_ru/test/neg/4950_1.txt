I don't know why it got any decent reviews, as it might be the weakest horror comedy I've ever seen. Englund just for this is a cameo, and his performance is just as unnecessary as the majority of unsuccessful attempts at joking (and scaring). Direction is terrible, and the game is worse. It seems that every year the producers try to make another Evil Dead, but these weak non-original attempts simply come up against memories of the real horror classic. <br /> <br /> Do the filmmakers say: â€œThis is not a remake but this is the return of the 80s (which, in my opinion, is just as unoriginal as the Ax) or people trying to relate it to other horror classics still misleading and does not compensate for the absence of panic, horror, comedy or even a decent film in this regard. <br /> <br /> AVOID ALL EXPENSES !!!
