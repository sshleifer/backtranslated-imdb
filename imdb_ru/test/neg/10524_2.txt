Worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot. Acting is terrible, the plot is terrible, the idea is terrible, and no research has been done, as always! Well, I admit, Air Bad was a pretty good movie, but not Football Dog. This "dog" is smaller than my cat! How can he play football? Even for children 10 years old, it will not be difficult to hit the ball hard enough to brake a stupid dog in half! It's terrible, don't watch this movie.
