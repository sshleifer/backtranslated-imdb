I give him three, not the smaller number he deserves because of his story. Full-length film made by schoolchildren! This also shows, but it is part of the charm and appeal. Meet some of the things that George Lucas was doing at the University of California; this is better. Perhaps due to group effort. <br /> <br /> Monster of toxic waste and too much garbage - these children are far ahead of their time! - Milpitas begins to ruin the city during dances in high school, the Monster is destroyed at random, leaving trash and smelly marks. <br /> <br /> The film has local television and radio amateurs, the mayor of Milpitas, the director of the high school of Samuel Ayer, as well as a whole group of high school students and parents, not to mention the mayor’s daughter, like inge. <br /> <br /> Dumb? Yeah! Fun? Yeah! Great screen recording? Come on, they are unprepared high school students! Copy this comment for acting, cinematography, directing, and so on. <br /> <br /> Milpitas is located right next to San José in the heart of Silicon Valley; perhaps one of the graphic geniuses will somehow update the video. Now there is a problem.
