Breaking Dawn begins at a California college, as Professor Simon (associate producer Joe Morton) tells his students that they have to conduct an intensive six-week study of a mental patient at Cape State Hospital as an essential part of their education, fail, and they will never become a qualified doctor. A bright, young, attractive and intelligent student named Eve (Kelly Overton) is especially hard to learn. His name is Don Wake (James Haven) and he is a convicted murderer, he was found drenched in blood, except for the dead body of a woman (Diane Verona) and her young daughter (Jennett McCardi). At first, Don won't even look at Eve, much less talk to her, but, like a soldier, she is Eve, who is trying hard to find out. In the end, Don begins to speak, but what he says scares Eve, he says that someone is watching her and mentioning Malachi's name. Then Eve begins to see a dark, dark figure at every turn, when Don releases conspiracy theories and strange statements. Eve slowly begins to go crazy, as the line between fantasy and reality becomes more and more blurred. Is there anything more to the alleged nonsense that Don is talking about, except that he is a crazy nonsense psychiatric patient ...? <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Mark Edwin Robinson: I have nothing but negative feelings about Breaking Dawn. Now we all like a good ending, one that takes us by surprise, surprises us, blends well with the rest of the film and remains in our memory, like cool finals in Sixth Sense (1999) and the fight club. (1999) to name only two good examples and, to a lesser extent, the end of films such as Scream (1996), where the identity of the killer becomes a pleasant surprise and is not so obvious. Then, of course, there are films whose ending spoils everything that happened before, and as an example let's take, oh, I don’t know, say, Breaking Dawn, because I have never seen such a terrible end of a film, never. Dawn begins as a decent psychological horror thriller with horrible things that start to happen to Eve, this is not the most exciting film in the entire history of imagination, but it is interesting, it is not the most exciting movie ever, but it is more than watchable, and it is not so bad, until the movie ends, I have to keep mentioning it, because everything else up to this point (which was normal, to be honest) suddenly becomes irrelevant. I am sure that there are people who think that they are dealing with this confusing end mess to the last detail, all I can say is that no one can explain this thing to me in a satisfactory manner and as far as I understand, it does not make sense and never will. Breaking Dawn is crap, and it's a waste of time to see how it is awarded the brightest finale in cinema history, it's just as simple and straightforward. <br /> <br /> Directed by Robinson didn’t make half of what was a decent thriller, he probably thought that what he was shooting would have played well, or maybe it was destroyed in the editing room, but I would suggest that this is most likely a rubbish scenario, as it tries to tie all the absurdities together for a few tangled minutes and give us all happier than a happy final shot. In the first 80 minutes and a half, he builds up the tension quite well, but at the end of the day it leads to nothing. <br /> <br /> “Breaking Dawn” technically is good, and, as a rule, it is good in everything. The acting is quite good, Overton is pleasant, easy on the eyes and demonstrates a decent game. Was it just me or that guy who played Don, looked like a John Morgen star in such classic Italian classics as Apocalypse Cannibal (1980), City of the Living Dead (1980), House on the edge of the park ( 1980), Cannibal Ferox (1981), Stagefright (1987) and The Church (1989)? Well, maybe it was just me ... Dawn - it's rubbish, I hated it all because of the last few minutes. Don't get me wrong, it didn’t really bother me, but everything was fine. Definitely to avoid, as far as I'm concerned, although there seems to be a fair share of positive comments on IMDb ...
