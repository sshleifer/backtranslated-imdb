I noticed that many of the films that were shown in the Mystery Science Theater received a lot of low marks on IMDb. However, some of the films shown in the films were not so bad, and it would be unfair to evaluate the film that received the MST treatment - the hosts made funny comments during the film. Now I am NOT saying that “The Girl on the Lover's Lane” is a great movie, but it is not so bad as to earn him the current IMDb score of 2.1. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a Bicks and Danny meeting. Bix is ​​a rogue veteran, and Danny is a young guy who seems to have little reason to wander around the country. As soon as they get into a small town, Bix needs to save Danny again and again, because Danny is rather naive - a good way to say that he has tomato intelligence. <br /> <br /> Along the way, something happens for the self-confident Bix - he finds a cute young lady and finds the bait to stay put, pulling him. And, in a strange plot, Jack Elam plays a super-creepy patient who wanders around the city, scaring the hell out of everyone - but, oddly enough, the police do not seem to pay much attention, and no one does anything to them on their own. account, however, when Elam makes the girl Bix fall in love with, everything is under way. <br /> <br /> In general, although the film was not at all good, it contained many interesting plot elements. This film is enough to earn a score above 2.1. The biggest negatives are a simplified conclusion about a secret that happens closer to the end, and Danny’s complete stupidity once too often. However, given the small budget, this is a small watchable movie.
