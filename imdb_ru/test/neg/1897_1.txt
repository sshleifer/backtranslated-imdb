God, I hate this movie! I saw it in the preview 13 years ago, and I still have bad memories. It was, without a doubt, the worst movie I ever paid to watch. It was poorly written, misdirected, and (surprisingly considering the cast) did not work well. I would prefer to be thrown off the roof on razor-sharp spikes, and then take off my skin than sit through it again. Can you guess what I didn't like?
