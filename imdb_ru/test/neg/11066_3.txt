Monday, October 2, 2006. So, I met my father, as always. We ordered takeaway Japanese food, turned off the lights and started playing. I'm an avid horror movie fan. However, The Cavern, released on DVD in October of this year, was certainly disappointed. It seemed promising, meeting all the standard requirements of any horror movie machine: stretched, starting with the presence of the antagonistic character, the sex scene could not be left out, and the too-familiar preliminary ghost (when they frightened you, but it turned out to be an idiot, buddy) Reached the smallest detail, I was ready for some real bloody actions. The director, I admit, was fascinated. Of course, you would need to fill all 81 minutes with people running back and forth in a space about 10 feet wide. It all starts when some "cavers" associated with the college get together for another dive into the cave. They all seem to be experienced professionals, very serious and spiritual in relation to the whole experience of the cave. This time they take with them a new, annoying photographer, too blinded by his National Geographic cover, to understand the dangers of diving. When they descend deep into what they call the “Pit of Hell,” they soon realize that they are not alone in the abyss of death. I will politely lower any spoilers if you are naive enough not to listen to my advice and not waste your time. Although the atmosphere and background music were creepy; and was sure that a lot of blood and blood, when the moments came to witness some actual dismemberment it was more like watching porn without a complete front. The film was purposefully dark and fragmentary. I think the director used this for effect. I suppose in the movie I liked the moving characters the most. They deserve the Acadamy Awards for these touching scenes. I almost shed a tear when they finally "understood" ... A tear of joy! If you like dry horror, soft porn, and you hated Braveheart. Then this is the right movie for your next Saturday night.
