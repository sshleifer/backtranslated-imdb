STAR RATING: ***** Works **** simply do not hit the target *** It's a bit between ** Pitfalls behind <br /> <br /> Based on another long note of Stephen King, this happens in a small New England's sleepy town of Castle Rock (also called a film company!), where a new antique store, called Needful Things, opened. The owner and owner Leland Gaunt (Max von Sidov) hides, one might say, the diabolical secret. There is a thing in his shop that everyone wants in a small town - a small cash price is first required before a much more sinister price is requested. As suspicion, hatred and madness tear the city apart, police chief Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris) has to restore order and save the city from a terrible end ... <br /> <br /> I read the novel "The Needy" Things early this year , and I could not wait to see the film adaptation again to compare them (as if it would be any competition!) But it was removed on video and DVD, and I could not find anywhere to rent it. Therefore, I was happy when I finally found him at the flea market during the shopping trip ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the most cruel ironies that King’s novels are best to read, but when they are adapted to the Screen nine times out of ten, they are complete trash like here. For some reason, the material that makes his books gorgeous is simply not well translated into a movie script. And I suppose there is always a question: why look at this, when could I read the book again instead? <br /> <br /> I appreciate that some of them are just too long (for example, “This”, “Support”), so that they can be turned into a full screen that includes all situations and characters, but there are no reasons for which this could not be included. all the material from the book. As a result, many key characters from the book (for example, Ace Merrill) are not included at all, and we have terrible character development, which means that we don’t care about the characters that are involved because they are so devoid of depth and motivation - for example, we have one character from the book, Danforth Keaton, who kills his wife near the end, but we were not shown any hints that he didn't get along with her or hated her, and therefore has no effect when this happens, difference from a book where much depth has been invested and this Valid The has involved you, to find out what happened to the characters involved. All the material in the script to fill the cracks, if you will, is really stupid and banal, as well as the typically stupid material that is included in King’s adaptation, like this one. <br /> <br /> Most of the film’s problems are that it deviates so far from the book, but there are also some terrible acts from the cast that obviously cannot feel the silly stuff that they are asked to perform. In the 90s, most of King's work began to skip the cinema and simply turn into a territory created for television / video. Such garbage certainly hints at why. **
