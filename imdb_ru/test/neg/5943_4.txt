Midnight Clear has a great background. A group of uneducated, overly bright soldiers are sent by incompetent leaders with an uncertain mission of patrolling around an isolated farmhouse on the eve of the battle of the Ardennes. The GI is confronted with a group of tired German battle customers, and it becomes clear that they no longer want to fight. <br /> <br /> This is the problem. It is really quite simple. If the Germans want to surrender, they do it, and this is the end of the film. If the Germans want to fight, they do it, and this is also the end of the film. Thus, instead of playing GI and the Germans, they play games with each other, even throwing snowballs at one point. Interesting for one or two scenes, but it soon becomes very annoying. After all, these are GERMANS. Enemy. Nothing in this film makes me think that they can neither be taken prisoner nor shot. The film does not make them more human. In fact, a lot of what the German characters did made me want to shoot them, including one scene in which a German officer refuses to deal with a Jew or surrender to a simple soldier! Why should I care about these characters? Just shoot them, and let's move on to the battle of the Ardennes. In any case, it is much more interesting. <br /> <br /> One good scene: the soldiers return from the intelligence of the German position, where they saw the Germans, but did not shoot. Passing through a clearing, they understand that a group of Germans is aimed at them. Germans about 100 yards. Then GIs do what I have NEVER seen GI do in any Sillywood movie. They throw their rifles and throw up their hands! Unusually, as it may be in films, this is quite a reasonable reaction to the fact that the gun is aimed at you from such a distance. Although it seems far away, in fact this is the exact range for these rifles. I will believe that someone working on this film was a scam!
