I give this film 2 stars solely because of a slightly liberal storyline. Without going into details. <br /> <br /> The game in this movie is terrible. Really awful - wooden, shallow. <br /> <br /> Graffiti at the exhibition is weak, so damn weak that I can only wonder why they even tried to use graffiti artists. In the scenes of spraying it was obvious that they attracted other people to do the “work”. With the same success, they could allow actors to make a picture and save themselves a few cents. <br /> <br /> I would have avoided this movie at any cost. <br /> <br /> In the past, the sound of the film “child loko”, something that I listened to on my iPod, will take a long time before I can return there, fearing that this film will appear again in my head. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. Unless you thought to yourself: “Wow, it's been a long time since I watched a really crappy movie ...”
