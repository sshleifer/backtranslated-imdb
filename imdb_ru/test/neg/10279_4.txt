"Electra Glide in Blue" is a slow B-click in which Blake plays a cop in the desert who wants to be a murder investigation detective and is involved in a murder investigation. At best, the mediocre film "EG in B", which features some members of the group "Chicago", the spirit of action, philosophy and many boring dramatic fillers. Not worth the time.
