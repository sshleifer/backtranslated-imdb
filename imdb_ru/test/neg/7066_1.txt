I had this film, in my heart I saw it. I wanted to tell people about it again and again, but never remembered. now i found it. now, finally, I can tell people exactly which is the worst, most crappy movie I've ever seen in my whole life, with no exceptions. <br /> <br /> This film is garbage and unsuitable for a landfill. All prints and other copies of this film must be rounded, loaded into a large rocket and launched into the sun. only cleansing heat and solar pressure can clear the materials on which this film is stored, so that they can again be useful to the universe. <br /> <br /> I like movies. I like bad movies. and yes, this is an opinion. but this film was pure rubbish, dirt and excrement of some beast, which could never be seen, not to mention the name of the person. <br /> <br /> I would rather watch the marathon of Uwe Boll than watch this movie. and I hate Uwe Boll films.
