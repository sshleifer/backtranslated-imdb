It is very important to check your expectations when you see a HATCHET. * The buzz created on this site far exceeds the real impact of the film. What can help someone to see a movie is to realize that it should not be scary. This is a clean camp and an attempt at fun. This is not funny, just polite. Don't expect something like SHAUN DEAD; not something like Friday the 13th (part II to infinity). <br /> <br /> HATCHET has tolerable actors. Cinematography is straight ed wood. Effects of creation and makeup are stupid - probably on purpose. Blood and blood are a cross between Romero and DEAD ALIVE. HATCHET is a movie about relationships. This is between Shaun of the Dead and Leslie Vernon. This is between kampa and comedy (there is a difference). This is between ultra cruel and cruel comics. <br /> <br /> Instead of “capturing the essence of American horror” or some other silly jargon that was used to describe the film, he tries to catch something between the original - -American-- Horror as Friday th and new horror as sean. Fortunately, he keeps away from the horror of torture. <br /> <br /> In the end, HATCHET is between a bad movie and a decent movie. <br /> <br /> * I think that this is happening more and more when people participate in cinema flocking to sites like IMDb to rate and comment on the films with which they are associated. At the very least, there is a campaign for people associated with partners to leave positive reviews and ratings. There is no other reason for this film to look high 7 with 600 votes and quickly fall after a wide release. This film is better than HorrorFest releases, and should not be so bloated.
