Another TV show becomes a movie. Steve {The Office} Carell plays dumb agent Maxwell Smart in a movie that is so bad that it makes the worst movie you have ever seen, the second worst movie you have ever seen The story of the seventh year - if you can call it, in which the megalomania is trying to take over the world It is so unfortunate, it is completely pitiful. The only thing Anne Hathaway does as an agent for 99 is that she looks good â€” she doesn't seem to be able to do anything else. Bill Murray has the common sense to limit his screen to about 90 seconds, and several individuals from the series find themselves in very small roles. The film must be partly a fighter and a fighter. It is neither one nor the other. Despite the fact that I really was not a fan of the series, at least it was light years ahead of this piece. All it does is drag it through the dirt and reduce the price of any good memories we have about it. Thank God Don Adams is not here to see this. Keep it up, Hollywood! Keep making these shit movies and send them weekly to multiplexes. No wonder the film industry is falling apart. This film is so rotten that it is not even good for laughter. If this film were a newspaper, it could be used to flatten the bottom of the bird cage. There is absolutely no reason to watch this movie. The root canal is more pleasant than this. Rating - zero minus five stars. If you are not a masochist, stay away. Better yet, do what is written in the title - get smart and save your nine dollars. With it, you can buy about 2 gallons of gas. Put it in your car and thank you for not wasting it on multiplex to see this bomb!
