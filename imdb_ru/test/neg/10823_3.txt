I shot this movie from Blockbust because of the cover and title! Sounds intriguing !! This film suffered because of the writing, he needs more waiting. "Monsters" needed more time for the face. We need them to have some special power and definitely more “Oh, Shu” moments. The photo did not bother me, except for the scene where the explosion is a breather. There were too many close-ups. But apart from this, the film seemed to be pulling in, and the characters did not work for their freedom. In general, I would say that everyone devotes a lot of time even to writers. But this film is definitely below average. <br /> <br /> There are definitely better options. I would recommend Anacondas 1 or 2 on this choice.
