I was hoping to learn something from this film, but I was disappointed. It's all about Rommel and praises him as a great general, but never for the whole movie did we understand why he was great. What made him so successful? Was it his desire, his unwillingness to accept defeat, his discipline with his people? I was looking for a presentation that looked like Patton, which actually penetrated the character, but it didnâ€™t work. Most of the dialogue is invented and sensational, and seems outdated and artificial. There are good actions here and there, but not many. The end of the story, where his involvement in the plot to assassinate Hitler is discussed, was the most informative and probably the most interesting. But as a history lesson about the greatest general of Germany, it was a failure.
