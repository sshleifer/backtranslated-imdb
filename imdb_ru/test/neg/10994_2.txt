It seems that in the 90s it became familiar to play with cliches. Some manage to do it with great talent. Herve Hadmar is not. On paper, the film looked interesting, though: a weak plot could have been saved thanks to great comedic moments, dark humor and a very “neckline”. Director Hadmar, unfortunately, kills his direction with his camera angles and absolute lack of rhythm. Every joke is confusing, because no one reacts in the theater. The film is incredibly slow, and the actors seem to be wondering what the hell they are doing in this ridiculous carcass. What could be a stylish, fun, meaningless comedy ends up being a boredom cathedral.
