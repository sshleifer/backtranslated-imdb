I never thought about watching this movie. I continued to see him on the horror movie shelf in my local video rental store and never thought about that. Just your run of the mill, a soft zombie film with a little blood and sex scenes. Nothing special, you could see Python as well ... oh no, wait, this is a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> I decided to watch it only when some of my friends saw it on TV and said it was a terrible garbage thing. So, I decided to check out these tales, and only then did I realize how awful the movie was, hiding behind a soft and uninteresting DVD-box cover. <br /> <br /> Not that the idea was bad. An airplane is a limited area, and it will become a real death trap for people on board if zombies appear ... a good prerequisite for a zombie movie. But this film was in a good situation and was spoiled by a bad game, unstable cinematography, annoying characters and a terrible score. <br /> <br /> All characters have a different level of hate. There are two young couples who are mostly friends, going on holiday to France. One pair consists of an athlete and his annoying girlfriend, who has an affair with Mr. Jock's best friend, who came along with her blonde blonde friend. There is also a policeman accompanying a fraudster (effeminate and very annoying cheater). The policeman is probably one of the least annoying characters of all. In addition, there are a lot of flight attendants who mostly turn out to be zombies ... no, I haven't watched the whole movie, it was too painful to survive, almost as bad as watching the Holocaust cannibal. Oh, and there is still a golfer on vacation with his wife, some strange air marshal, who really doesn’t seem to matter until he is called to help fight the zombie runaways, a trio of scientists who are all victims of the undead, and a couple of pilots. Working with the camera is often wobbly, and although many people don't seem to mind, after a while it can really unnerve you, for example, constantly buzzing with flies around your head. It is small, but it is also annoying. <br /> <br /> The couple is genuinely annoying. All they do is have sex in the toilets of the plane, while their spouses are not watching ... in fact, all the young people in this film are annoying. They whine, quarrel, argue and lead one of the most senseless and heartbreakingly boring dialogues in the film ... yes, it pleases when they die. <br /> <br /> The account is terrible. It is so common and boring that it kills any anxiety that the scene could create, and replaces it with the feeling that someone is scratching the board with nails and laughing at you. Actually, it sounds like a score from ... Python! This movie will never stop chasing me. <br /> <br /> There is also a character that the filmmakers seemed to have incredibly intended to make as many frames as possible. A nun sitting next to young people and squeezing her Bible, which is included in so many frames, that you begin to wonder if she plays any major role in the film ... but no, she does not play, so why is she so much in the scenes? Was it because the original project of the film’s creator was a nun porn movie? No one will ever know. <br /> <br /> Zombies look pretty good. They have good makeup, and they are probably much better actors than live characters, they are much more convincing and pleasant! The guard in charge of overseeing the illegal cargo of a scientist was pretty funny. It seems that a large box falls on him, and the camera briefly shows the audience that his leg was pierced with some kind of sharp object ... but he does not scream, does not shudder or moan in pain. He just grunts and wriggles, trying to pull the thing out of his leg ... in fact, he looks more like a man with overweight trying to scratch his back than a man suffering from pain. <br /> <br /> Ah, well, in general, I give 1 for an interesting setting and 1 for a zombie. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie only if you like it when young people quarrel and throw themselves at each other, and, unfortunately, in reality this is not the case. something funny in all of this, so watching laughter is likely to fail if you don't have some kind of psychoactive drug.
