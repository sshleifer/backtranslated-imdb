Lowe returns to the nest after another failed relationship and discovers that he has been appointed to the jury position. He plans to somehow get out of it when he realizes that the respondent is a girl he has seriously fallen in love with since the first grade. <br /> <br /> Living in the past, telling other people about His feelings for this girl (played by Camp) Low remembers these feelings and does everything possible to clean Camp from the assassination attempt, while avoiding the real bad ones guys and succeeding in making a successful movie at the same time. <br /> <br /> I heard that St. Augustine is the oldest city in the United States, and I also know that it has some connections with Ponce de Leon, so the background is a good place to start. Unfortunately, this is the only thing that is good in this film. The local police are clumsy, the judge is an idiot, and the defense attorney does everything in her power to look like Joanie Cunningham! I do not know whether to blame the director for bad leadership or simply for the fact that the actors made such ill-fated efforts. <br /> <br /> In short, this film was so boring that I couldn't even fall asleep for it! 1 out of 10 stars!
