It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Along with Blair, the Witch is just as annoying. The flashing helmet lights made it difficult to see things, and I think epileptics should be taken into account, as there are gating moments that make this film even more annoying. I think that if they were quieter, they could find a way out. Then, when you think that a geek can trump up, even he resorts to a nervous breakdown. Yes, and when a boyfriend who has sex understands that when a girl says she can hear something. She can really hear something. One of these guys must have even seen Scream (where they draw your attention to such things). It is also a big disappointment when the premise offers so many promises, and then someone writes the script. Sorry, guys, I got it at the video store every week, and I still would like to get my money back.
