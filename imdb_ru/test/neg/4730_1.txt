Mmmm, the previous summary reads: “If you like aliens and predators, you will like this movie,” I couldn’t disagree more, this movie pays no attention to its weighty pedigree and reduced two of the most beloved science fiction chains to level a little more In the movie "Horrible Horror" there is no tension or foreboding present in previous films about aliens or predators, and there is no noticeable main character, I really did not care about any of the characters, and I really wanted to see how the retypic cast will die as soon as possible, in the vain hope that something better will replace them, superhuman incompetence is really needed, so that the two most formidable creatures ever invented are clearly unable to make an exciting exciting film, just watch it, if you want to see how NOT to do this,
