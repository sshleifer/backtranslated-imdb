I liked the understated character that Laura Linney played in Actually Love, and she is very good at Man of the Year. <br /> <br /> but wow. Robin Williams does not provide such great performance, with a few minor exceptions, it was weak. Laura Linney may not have been wrong, but the editing raped her character, or it was just a sad performance by director Barry Levinson. <br /> <br /> And I think it was Barry Levinson who grew old. So many weak speeches, such uneven results are the fault of the management. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum superbly play supporting roles. Goldblum plays the ominous side with joy, and Walken’s combination of artist manager and commentator for the film is wonderful. <br /> <br /> But the story is cliché, the presentation looks as if she could (should) be a very good picture, and too many actions are indecisive. The pace, plot and direction - all this is weak compared to, say, the "Head Office" (a parody of "The secret of my success").
