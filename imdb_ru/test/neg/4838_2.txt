I DO NOT understand why someone can spend their time or money on complete trash like this ... Don't get me wrong - I LOVE a good western - Note, I said "GOOD" is just rubbish <br /> <br /> The action is terrible - Val Kilmer should know someone or should do a favor or something for them, just to use his face and name in this ridiculous piece of shit ... <br /> <br /> For those of you who liked this movie, I make a list of your names to make sure that I DO NOT watch anything you offer - our tastes are certainly different, but this is your right Express your opinion, no matter how far away it is. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 2 just in case, if they throw out all their own, and do not consider them .... Just bad in all areas ...
