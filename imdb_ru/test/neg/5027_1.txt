Oh man! This series should be the worst possible anime I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It all started new, exciting and fresh. And I really liked it then. Kagome was a good role model for the show. And Inu-Yash was funny and hot. <br /> <br /> Then, as the series progressed, it fell more and more ... and I will tell you all the reasons. (Warning: warning about a spoiler !!) <br /> <br /> Well, they basically destroy Inu-Yashaâ€™s relationship with Kagome at an early stage, reviving his 50-year-old dead girlfriend, who is a juicy, juicy and waste of time . . <br /> <br /> They represent a pervert named Miroku, who must be a kind of religious figure of the show. (It really got me in trouble, because it was inappropriate and stupid.) Then they introduce the killer of demons named Sango, whose only purpose in life is to try (and fail) to save his brainwashed brother. <br /> A big bad part of the show, Naraku, who started out as a really good bad guy, lost contact after a while. (He got old pretty quickly. And I was worried that he was the only villain in the series who did something.) <br /> <br /> All the characters were wooden and unemotional. And then, the end of this horrible series was a disappointment for any anime fan. Nothing happened. Naraku was never killed or won. Kagome and Inu-Yash never completely fell in love (because he was still in love with his 50-year-old dead chick). The openings for the conspiracy remained open. As the series progressed, the animation became worse and worse. And nothing has changed in the plot. (I mean, they dragged it into more than 150 episodes, and nothing changed in the plot ... at all.) And they expected that I (like other fans of the show) would be satisfied ?? I was disappointed, disgusted and annoyed like crap. I, at least, had high hopes that the series would have a good ending. Instead, all I got was a protracted manga commercial. Seriously, if you want to see good anime about swords and the like, I highly recommend Ruruni Kenshin. This show is progressing and going somewhere, plus it has really good animation. <br /> <br /> But stay away from this easy anime excuse, as best you can.
