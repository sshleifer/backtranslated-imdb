"Crapper Stories" are terrible, disgusting, tasteless, offensive, low-browed and scatological. But everything is in order, I was prepared for all this from my previous experience of Troma. What I was not prepared for was that it was also stupid, ridiculous and boring. Very few of the genuine anarchic spirit of films, such as Nuke'em High Class, remain intact; instead, we get endless farting jokes (to the point where you start wondering if Lloyd Kaufman is becoming senile, thinking that adults find a loud fart so damn fun!) money to watch the "film", which even Kaufman himself seems to know, should never have been released in the first place. Oh yes, there is a lot of female nude on the screen, but let's face it: the average porn film probably offers a better plot, higher production values, funnier humor, and, above all, more respect for its intended viewer than this atrocity. <br /> <br /> P.S: Kelly Powers AKA Suzi Lorraine (blonde lesbian student from the “Make Your Own Movie” segment) is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen.
