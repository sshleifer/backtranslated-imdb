I only voted for 2/10, mainly because Hitchcock agreed to lead him. He definitely had a day off with predictable storylines, silly childish characters who are desperate to be funny. There was a "twi" hygienic, sanitized, emasculated "sex" "scene at a time when the Hollywood production code was in full force. The lazy male characters in the film who like soap characters never do the work for which they pay It always annoys me when the food is usually never eaten by the actors (one exception was in the food scene in "Tom Jones" (1963); although a lot of drinks are consumed - the actors must leave their mouths free for the next line! Carol Lombard, of course, matched idealized Hitchcock’s “cool blonde” is a heroine, but what ever possessed him to control this useless unfunny scenario, he had to stick to his thrillers. Of course, he didn’t wear very well in the last 69 years. until it ends, because it gradually annoyed me there is no end.
