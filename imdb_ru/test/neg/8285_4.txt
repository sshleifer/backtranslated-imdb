Six months after the high school sprinter Laura dies during the race, the killer begins to kill the rest of the track team, using a variety of sports equipment as a weapon: this is the stupid story from the early 80s Slash Day, a weak addition to the genre very little in terms of style, originality or decent blood. <br /> <br /> However, he gives amazingly terrible musical interludes, several familiar faces (including the early appearance from the queen of the screams). Linnea Quigley), and a bit of nudity (a prerequisite for any slasher film!). <br /> <br /> Forget the scenes of death - they are lame and rather bloodless - and instead enjoy the movie more memorable shit elements: fast editing, which can cause migraines and epileptic seizures; disco on the rollers, accompanied by a long heavy rock song 'Gangster Rock' performed by an unforgettable horrible Feloni; improvised jam sessions by school students; Christopher George appointed him head coach of the red herring Michaels; and a stupid music teacher who pursues his students (who for some reason find him completely irresistible?!?!). <br /> <br /> By the end of the film, the action is slightly enhanced, with the discovery of the bodies of murdered children under the stands and a rather perverted scene with the image of Lauraâ€™s corpse in her cap and dress, but all this comes to the end of the day to save this film from mediocrity .
