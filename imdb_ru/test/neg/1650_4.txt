Mad, slightly vile energetic, infantile humor abounds in this urban boy, who has become a farmer's passionate adventure. This is not outrageous enough to appeal to the Will Ferrell crowd, and not interesting enough to carry the length of the function. Most of all I can praise "son-in-law" - to say that for the most part he avoids toilet humor. The main problem is that all the characters do not have enough heat, and Paulie Shore is so abrasive that he is the most implacable hero. There are some fun moments with farm animals, and thatâ€™s all. The story that is there is so simple and predictable that it makes "Jury Duty" sound like "Gone With the Wind." - MERK
