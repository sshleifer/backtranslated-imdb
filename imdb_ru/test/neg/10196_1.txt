This movie was terrible. This is not what people have to pay to see. Looks like some kind of Christian group did it to convert people. I do not understand why he was released in cinemas, and not on television. <br /> <br /> It started out as an old-fashioned sci-fi film BBC from the 1950s, but quickly changed. After about 30 minutes of the movie, the characters start talking about “God” and “Do you believe in Jesus?”. He quickly enters the territory of pure religion. <br /> <br /> I thought I would go to a sci-fi movie. The film has a bad acting game; bad angles and amateur. <br /> <br /> AVOID IT!
