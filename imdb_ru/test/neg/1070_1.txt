It's amazing how the average viewer can call this title something new and innovative (quoting some comments). Murali K. Talluri must have thought himself: “Oh, great! Elephant ... What a fantastic movie! I will try to make the exact same movie and see if anyone notices! ”Unfortunately, he even failed with his outrageous idea. The film is a complete failure. Considering that he is struggling to catch the glitter of “The Elephant” by Guus Van Sants, he makes him look even more ridiculous - the most awkward case for the director. <br /> <br /> The film begins with suicide. student in the school bathroom. This scene already shows the awkward acting skills of each of the participants in this scene. You are not buying a single word that they say. He continues, interrupted by short pieces in the style of interviewing children who “live their own family life,” and every bit is upset by its simple folly based on every useless monologue. Talluri means to present the characters in such a way that they look into their hearts like junk food and fail again. Less than five minutes later, as Talluri, the audience eventually shouted, “Yes, people! I stole this film, and for some curious reason I am proud of it! ”Taking Gus Van Sants to the most unmistakable style of narration from“ Elephant ”: he twice shot scenes to allow the viewer to follow each character participating in the scene on his particular ways and roles in the school situation. Hmm, doesn't that sound awfully familiar? For me, this certain level of very forgiving tolerance was broken right to such an extent that I could no longer tolerate this horrible film. Shame on you, Murali K. Talluri, I say! I am especially surprised that “2:37” reached the official selection in Cannes since 2006, while everyone probably remembered “Elephant” (2003) at the same film festival just a few years ago! So, how in the name of the Lord was this most shameful robbery turned out to be there? I find myself completely puzzled by this error. <br /> <br /> Directors such as Talluri use the ignorance of an audience that does not know (and cannot fully know) about each independent film. Since the Elephant has little to do with the main cinema (although this is undoubtedly a masterpiece), few people notice that the story told in “2:37,” was told before! How this is possible at a film festival of such importance as is attributed to Gangnam, I cannot say. It is sad and embarrassing that such things are transmitted, and it is unlikely that anyone will see in them a true fraud. <br /> <br /> 2:37 in all respects exclusively commercial, useless as an independent film and (at a certain level Rather, a strange parody of his obvious idol "The Elephant."
