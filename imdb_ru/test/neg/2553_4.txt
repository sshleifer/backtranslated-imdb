I have to say that I was disappointed with this film. Although it is well played and directed, the main story is simply unfolding too slowly. <br /> <br /> Of course, in a different mood, I would have liked it more. I often laughed, but rarely laughed out loud; and there was actually a sense of suspense to find out who won. But unlike the other film that my wife shot the same day (which none of us had heard of before), this film turned pale in comparison. <br /> <br /> If you see a lot of movies, then by all means watch it - this is clearly better than your average fare. But if you (like me) have limited time and you want to see only the best and most interesting, save it for later. <br /> <br /> [Rating: 7/10]
