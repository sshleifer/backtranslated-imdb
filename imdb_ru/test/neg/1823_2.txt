Just a poor car Lana Turner-Ezio Pinza. Pinza had a beautiful voice, but he rarely used it in the film, which reminded me of "Student Prince" with adults. Pinza is also not a leading person. He looks like an old man, ready to collect social security benefits and fish. <br /> <br /> The plot is very subtle, and supporting actors Barry Sullivan, Marjorie Mayne and Debbie Reynolds do little. Sir Cedric Hardwicke comes at the end to announce that our king Ezio is better to return to his people. As I understand it, the sooner the better. Is this Lana Turner really singing with Pinza? Not bad if it is she. The film also reminds me of a 1960 film The Prince and the Dancer with Marilyn Monroe and Lawrence Olivier.
