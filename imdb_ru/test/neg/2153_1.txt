Experienced actors in this really know how to act, and proved that before, but the director, who also wrote and created this parody, is incompetent on many levels. OK. This is a low-budget project, but I know that films are shot by students with a smaller budget and little-known actors who can achieve much more. For example, since there were people involved who should know better, some of the weapons settings were completely irrelevant and never existed in those days. The stunt work was awkward - the story is stale and deceptive. If someone gives you a copy of this, use it for a stand. By the way, I love westerns, I know many stuntmen, and even went to school with one of the actors, so I was looking for it to be good.
