Of course, this must be one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. I watch almost every movie that is included at night (either showtime, hbo, cinemax, etc.). “Three” AKA “Island of the Survivors” keeps you in the same tension, as well as monitoring the drying of paint, to bring you even more miserable. If you want to feel that you have just wasted what seems like an eternity in the worst movie ever made, then by all means watch this movie. I must have shouted at least 900 times from idiotic turns. If I had 4 hands, I would give this film 4 fingers DOWN. <br /> <br /> In my personal opinion, the only people who would like this film are people with terrible morality.
