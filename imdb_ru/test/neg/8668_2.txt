At one time I read a lot about Jane Austen and approve of several adaptations for film and television, but we simply donâ€™t need this one. <br /> <br /> Rating - 2, because I would not even say that it is terribly so boring that you will feel that you have wasted 90 minutes of your life. The boring scenario coincided with an even more boring game. I heard Billie Piper in Doctor Who (not a fan, so I can't confirm), but she just sucks. There is absolutely no chemistry between the leads. This is Austin, this must be a romance! <br /> <br /> Please do not let this push you away from Austin or historical dramas. There are many better programs to watch.
