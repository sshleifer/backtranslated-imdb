At least, it is vaguely possible that this film served as a source of inspiration for The Soprano Clan, since its main character, Martin Blank (John Cusack), is a hired killer who has so many problems from his past and his profession that he is on therapy . trying to handle it all. Everything finally comes to an end at his 10-year high school reunion. The problem was that by the time Blank arrived at the meeting, I stopped caring. To be honest, I found this movie from start to finish. <br /> <br /> He had the potential. There was a pretty good cast, led by Cusack and Dan Aykroyd, playing Grozer, his main rival in the hired killer, along with Minnie Driver in the role of Debi, Blanca's favorite high school, and he had a limited role for Alan Arkin in the role of doctor Oatman, psychologist Blanca. However, it seemed that this rather talented cast was never met. Drama lacked intensity, and comedy lacked real humor. What I thought was the most likely for the comedy story was Groser’s proposal to create an assassin’s trade union, but despite the fact that he had become something of a joke, this idea was never developed. As for the novel, I wondered why Déby even thought about allowing this guy back into her life. <br /> <br /> There was a few chuckles, but in fact nothing caught me and did not deter me, and I spent most of the film wondering if this thing was ever going to start clicking. This was not - at least for me. 2/10
