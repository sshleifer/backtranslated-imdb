The film "Smile razor blades" has an interesting title as well as the main role. Now, most people may not like this movie for the plot, and the acting was a bit cheaper, but this is the attraction of such a film as “The smile of a razor”. In a sense, it was a bad movie. <br /> <br /> However, if you watch this movie to the end, you will see that, as I said, a cheap vampire film with a bit of humor. (It is also very interesting how they manipulated the colors in several scenes.) <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film is the type you are shooting, you laugh at your friends and enjoy what is. For no film is too bad. <br /> <br /> As Lilith Silver says: “People just don't smile enough ...”
