I rented this pile of sewage in the hope of laughing. With a name like “Zombie Bikers from Detroit”, and with “Dead Alive” written on the front cover, you might think that this could be a funny / horrible movie, but no. This is the worst film I've ever seen (and yes, I have seen all the films of the Police Academy). The story (it's a joke inside yourself) and the dialogue is terrible. The composition of the so-called zombies looks like they used one of these two-dollar “Make yourself look like a zombie” sets that you buy at K-Mart. <br /> <br /> I would prefer to watch the Beverly Hills 90210. while listening to the Backstreet Boys and being knocked down by the 400-pound model of the New Year greeting card, than to go through another minute of this pitiful excuse for the DVD. Honestly, I could have made a better movie with $ 3, a bit popsicle and slinky. I feel as if 90 minutes of my life were cut off from me and taken to the land of Sakdom. I know that tagging on the production of Dead Alive does not guarantee great success, but you expect to get your money. <br /> <br /> The only thing that made me happy (salvation, the return of the terrible mass of elephant feces) was that he was not called "Biker zombies from Pittsburgh." I feel for the Detroit people who have wasted their hard-earned money on this. Unless you were lobotomi ?? Do not buy, rent, if necessary ?? But ??. You will regret it.
