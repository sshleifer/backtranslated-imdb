The feature in this film is one of the worst I've ever encountered. The dialogue is banal and cliché to the utmost distraction. None of the problems that the characters face is designed at all - it’s just superficial details designed to convey their point of view without actually having to come up with a plausible dialogue in support of this point of view. In addition, the image of Chinese characters leaves much to be desired - it is hard for me to believe that the Chinese father is learning perfect English from the book (or so it is meant in one scene) so that he can teach him to his daughter, etc. <br /> <br /> The Smile Train is a great organization, and it’s a good idea to make a heartbreaking film about the impact of such a program on the lives of children, but overall I found this film to be more frustrating than anything.
