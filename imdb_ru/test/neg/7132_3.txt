Let me start by saying that I loved the original Grudge. It was one of the most terrible and exciting events that I have ever experienced in a full movie theater. I am not kidding. Being a self-proclaimed Japanese fan also made the film look better in my eyes (if the situation was changed to some American suburb, I would probably end up hating the movie). <br /> <br /> That said .. this movie is a complete mess! I will not say that it sucks, because A) the film has several positive moments, B) “it sucks” - this is the loudest suppression in the history of failures. So what movie is going for this? Well, for starters, it looks pretty cool: thanks to the filters and the use of dark, blurry colors, Takashi Shimizu almost recreates the dark, gloomy atmosphere of the original. A few scenes are really shocking and unpredictable. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is just bad. Period. <br /> <br /> The story is everywhere, unduly told in the style of Tarantino, that is, the scenes are not in chronological order. This technique is meaningless in the case of this film, and it just makes things more confusing. Honestly, a simple plot would work better. In the original, there was also a lack of plot, but it made sense, and the film more than compensated for its delicate plot with a lot of fright and a really tense atmosphere. There are none of these elements in Grudge 2, and it's just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget the acting skills on the TV show, thanks to which the actors from the original Grudge look like Emily Watson and Katherine Hepburn. Simply put, the movie does not work. It's too slow, too boring and just not so scary to compensate for the tangled plot (by the way, it doesn't add anything new to the story, so even Grudge fans won't be happy). <br /> <br /> Oh, and what is it with an old man playing Japanese pikabu on a bus? Should it be comic relief? An artistic statement? Or what?
