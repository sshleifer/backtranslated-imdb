All the hype! Everything adds up! I was upset that I missed it on the big screen. Where this film worked was in fine detail. Otherwise it failed. Over the past few years, Arnold has achieved much better results. I thought the days of Commando and Last Action Hero were in our lives. Unfortunately, this film indulges the least common denominator and turns Arnold into roaring, grunting, face-distorting muscles that simply know how to shoot rifles and blow things up. At the last moment of the cliche (and at another time), which was predictable from the very beginning, we see a glimpse of the actor who proved that he was more than he paid at the beginning of his career. The film did not impress me, as it never opened up new opportunities and did not go anywhere except in the place where you expected.
