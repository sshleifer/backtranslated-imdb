If this film is an accurate demonstration of the acting skills of J. Smits, I think he made a big mistake leaving television. Did he watch any movies starring David Caruso, especially The Cold Heart? In terms of acting ability, as for Mary-Louise, she did much, much better. Yes, this is a terrible scenario, ineptly edited and completely devoid of continuity, but experienced actors can and overcome such obstacles. Very big disappointment.
