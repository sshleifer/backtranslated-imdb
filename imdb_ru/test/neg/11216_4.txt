Young Michael Dudikov, as well as young Lord Greystock, was left in the jungle on the Pacific island in infancy. But instead of being raised by monkeys, he fell into the hands of a Japanese soldier who still lived there because he did not hear that the war was over. And, like young Luke Skywalker, it turns out that he fell into the hands and learned the ninja combat skills. <br /> <br /> Good, because they were separated, and the young child had amnesia, but those fighting skills did not go away. The orphan child, now named Joe Armstrong, is enlisted in the army and is located in the Philippines. In the meantime, his Obi Van Kenobe, played by John Fujioka, flees himself and sets out to work as a gardener on the estate of planters and terrorists, going over Don Stewart using a silly accent that seems to vary between French and Spanish. > When such things happen, everyone meets, and Dudikoff simultaneously solves the secret of a part of his past and saves the commanderâ€™s daughter from the bad guys in this Golan-Globus. Charles Bronson became a little longer in the tooth, and Golan-Globus needed a new star for their fighters. Michael Dudikoff filled the bill pretty well and made a lot of films for them, including several sequels by American Ninjas. <br /> <br /> This movie is an action, and Dudikoff sends the bad guys at a record pace. What he doesn't do, Steve James does his best by imitating Rambo, and demonstrates his considerable martial arts skills. <br /> <br /> There are enough holes in the film to drive through one of those war machines, as you see in the story. But this is something that the public buying tickets doesn't care about. Dudikoff certainly looks gorgeous stripped down to combat clothing. No wonder so many sequels have been made.
