I must admit that I chose this film only for actors, and although Sutherland, Scacchi and Prokhnov were - as usual - great performers, the rest of the film was so disappointed. It seems that it was composed by a team of teenagers with low-level scenarios, i.e., non-depth scenarios, horrible photography and editing, and a funny lousy account! I canâ€™t believe that I could watch this seemingly long film to the end ... The sad thing is that it could actually be a great political thriller, considering the interesting plot. There was all the potential to make it a hit; that is, there are two main components: a great history of national conspiracies and a great cast (although many other actors are pretty much like soap operas). But maybe I missed something; until then, it still does not cost more than 3 in my opinion.
