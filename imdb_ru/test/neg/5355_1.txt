This is the worst movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, the characters are unrealistic stereotypes that never look as if they themselves believe it. Are white people such monsters that they will continue to call two white rapist children at the age of 20 “good boys,” and they need to be convinced that this can be a reason for provocation? Do black people always inspire? Does the Ku Klux Klan really stand outside the courtroom, shooting at lawyers, and no one intervenes? Do judges really think that a fair trial can be held when the jury can hear the crowd outside shouting "Kill him"? Do black people really stand shoulder to shoulder with the Clan awaiting sentencing? Do wives really need a few months to realize that their husband can protect a man from unfair hanging because he knew that he could have done the same? Do jurors really justify killing people because they feel sorry for them? Do lawyers use sanity protection to convince people that their client is temporarily insane? <br /> <br /> Worst of all, any high-profile principles of this film were lost due to the completely exploitative and unreasonable use of sexual crimes to attract the attention of the audience. Was the subject of rape, let alone child gang rape, really in competent hands? Is this really a subject that belongs to Hollywood hands? And if so, why is the completely useless abduction and stripping of Sandra Bullock? And an absolutely pointless rape charge against one of the witnesses? It seems that the director didn’t treat sex crimes very much. <br /> <br /> It was a great storyline “To Kill a Mockingbird”, from which a coarse, shallow, tasteless spinner was obtained. Shame on them.
