Atoll K or Utopia is one of the saddest swan songs of Hollywood. Filmed in France "The Country That Loves Lewis (Jerry)" in 1950 and released the year after five years of dismissal, the boys are in really terrible physical form. However, they are not in such bad shape as the script. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the funniest comedies ever made. <br /> <br /> Look at this legendary team, the funniest duet in cinema history, the two couples who made “The Devil's Brother” (1933), “The Music Box” (1932), “Gather Your Problems” (also 1932 ) "Babes In Toyland" (1934), "Bonnie Scotland" (1935), "Flying Deuces" (1939) and many other classic comedies, grueling to laugh, in such a film. <Br /> <br /> But the fighters and ball players do it all the time. They stay in the game one season or one fight too much. In this case, although it’s awfully exciting to see Laurel and Hardy at this late stage of their legendary career, they are also tryali too much.
