This film is really BAD, there is nothing attractive or worth commenting about except the beautiful settings: the Chilean landscape. I know that I have to provide four lines as a commentary on this film, but the fact is that this is such a bad movie that I can only say that in reality it is BAD. Michael Ironside - the only one who saves money in the film.
