Lucino Visconti, an artist with a sword. Audacity must be the first word associated with his entire opus. Film. Theater. Music. Revolutions, artistic, cultural, personal. A legacy with powerful consequences and endless consequences. He presented neo-realism through the work of American novelist James Kane in Ossesione. He gave Anne Magnan the most extraordinarily beautiful close-ups of her career. He gave us Alain Delon and Maria Callas. But the last word about his life and work depends on the talent of a certain Adam Low and the voice of Helmut Berger. What a terrible fate. <br /> <br /> For those interested, there is a 61-minute documentary film directed by Carlo Lizzani (a man who really knew Visconti) called “LUCHINO Visokonti Portret” It comes out on DVD distributed by Image Entertainment
