This film was extremely disappointing, I thought it would be another “comedy with marijuana”, but do not mislead, it is not at all so. Hardly jokes connected with weeds emerge, I do not even think that in this film they smoke weed. The marijuana field is just a plot device. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I got the impression that the four friends were bored in the summer, and they decided to write a script full of (their idea) witty dialogues and make a movie. The product is a soft dialogue, supported by a mediocre game; to say that this film does not have a 'hook' is a great understatement. Do not waste your time or money.
