Given the budget and the inexperience of all participants, Livin 'th Life could be worse. Jamal wants to be Chris Tucker (whom I have always found very annoying), as noted by the previous commentator, but Peanut (Edward D. Smith), while some of his (excessive) reactions go on too long (the director's problem) has some relatively subtle and funny moments, for example, when he tries to instruct Jamal about the proper way to smoke a joint with a friend. Everywhere, as a rule, he is more balanced and self-sufficient than Jamal, which could serve as a good incentive to explore contrasts in relationships, but was not developed very far. <br /> <br /> But inexperience is a writer / director / filmmaker / etc. There is no excuse for his inattention. Has he ever seen a movie? Faces are important! Has he ever heard of close-ups? Even Ed Wood could do a close-up. I don't think this is a big budget issue. I could only give a general description of what any of the actors looks like, not only because of the lack of close-ups, but also because of the lighting ...! Lights for street shooting may cost too much, but you can make a reflector out of pieces of paper! This would require moving the camera closer so that the reflector does not fit into the frame, while at the same time helping to solve the problem with close-ups. If this is too technical, you can turn the actors so that they are not in the shadows, or you can set them for the shadows, and if they were not filmed in Los Angeles, I would say, took advantage of cloudy days. It goes without saying that the films from which this film steals are all, with the possible exception of Bernie's weekend, better than this one, but Livin 'th Life would have left a much better impression if it had not made the viewer squint. a way to just catch a glimpse of what the human factor could be. <br /> <br /> PS The scene at the barber shop is just dumb.
