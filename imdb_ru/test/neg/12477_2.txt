Back in 1994, Power Rangers became a huge franchise and TV. The US network leaders were hoping to take part in the action and came up with tattooed Beverly Hills alien fighters in whom the evil Emperor Gorganus, who looks like Darth Vaderâ€™s home costume and his talking bird, is like a toy for chewing a rubber dog came to Earth to invade it with the help of giant monsters that look like rejected from the Godzilla movie of the 1970s. Fortunately, Nimbar, an alien like a giant piece of pure jelly, recruits four teens to protect the earth. Nimbar gives each of them a tattoo from another stellar constellation, which allows them to turn into enhanced superheroes that look like dancers from the eighties technique. they could also combine the music video into a giant knight. Forty episodes have been made. The US Network clearly did not have the money to try and adapt the show from Japan, as the Power Rangers did, and they created the show themselves, using the budget of a science fiction film from the 1950s. The fighting scenes are general in nature, the special effects are bad, and some sets look as if they might fall. The actors were pretty much aware how ridiculous the show was, and they pretty much confused it and beat it. I can only imagine their shock when the show was canceled.
