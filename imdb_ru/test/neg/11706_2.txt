I can't express enough how bad this film is. First of all, it is a waste of some legendary stars, although they are rather old and rather inconclusive. Fred Astaire, I think he should have done a great service to someone, since this was his last movie role. The screenplay is a mess, and the film seems terribly heavy. I suppose maybe if I saw this when it came out (1981), I would have thought that was decent. However, having seen so many really good horror films, it was one of the worst. The only real convincing thing in this mess was a very young and beautiful figure / creepy Alice Krieg. The main young character tried to act as he could, but he was absolutely terrible. I was not sure how much of this was due to his lack of skills or the lack of an understandable script, but in any case he was just bad. Do not look if you do not want a bunch of old guys scared.
