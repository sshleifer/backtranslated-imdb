I just recently watched "Shame," directed by Ingmar Bergman. The film was interesting and very unique. I liked how it was in Swedish with English subtitles and that it was also black and white. These features allowed me to relate better to the characters, the time period and their stories. I didn’t like how the film was very slow at the beginning and how you didn’t know what was really going on. At first, it was basically the story of Eve's relationship with Jan. The film also ended on a very depressing note, because nothing good came out of all the conflicts and changes over the course of the film. I probably wouldn’t go to see shame anymore, but it was a very cultural experience.
