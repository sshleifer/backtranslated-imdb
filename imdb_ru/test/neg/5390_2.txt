Most of the other posts beat this movie, and deservedly so. I just have to intervene in the technical ineptitude of the filmmakers. It would be nice if the director at least had lunch with someone who knew what a gun was, because he had no idea. <br /> <br /> Ahead of spoilers !!! YOU WERE WARNED !!! <br /> <br /> Stupidity: <br /> <br /> The special forces team consisted of various military units whose members had never met before. <br /> <br /> Maybe two people in a unit use weapons that use the same magazines, parts, ammunition, etc. <br /> <br /> The sniper school instructor uses a submachine gun (pistol ), rather than a rifle, with which we believe it will be more experienced. <br /> <br /> The night vision optics of one poor team member weigh more than a rifle. When he copes with this, you can say that he is SERIOUSLY very hard. <br /> <br /> The team leader sends a team member to “challenge” the Skeletonist when they first meet him. Challenge the 200-year-old reanimated skeleton of Native Americans with a long spear and the world riding an undead horse with a heavy nosebleed? I think not, Bubba. <br /> <br /> Bullets don't flare when they hit trees, Mr. Director. (A couple of people have already mentioned this.) <br /> <br /> The “air support” of the teams consists of the omnipresent “black helicopter”, only this one has several launch vehicles suspended below. Someone forgot to tell the crew of the helicopter that the Skeleton does not fly, and they are located above the American center, where there will be no enemy aircraft. Instead, they had to carry several air-to-surface missiles. <br /> <br /> The helicopter’s air-to-ground ammunition consists of a door-gunner with a semi-automatic AK-47 (or 74?). Needless to say, it only strikes dirt. Should have brought a light machine gun with belt power. <br /> <br /> The door gunner later learns that a grenade launcher is also pretty useless. <br /> <br /> The wooden arrow of a bloody bent bow makes no helicopters, Mr. Director. <br /> <br /> I could not stand it after that (about 30 minutes) and gave up. You seriously need a morphine dropper to make it through this click, it just hurts.
