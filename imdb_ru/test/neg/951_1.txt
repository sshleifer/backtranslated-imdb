Since this show was changed from TSS (screen savers) to AOTS (attack on the show), it went down. TSS with Yoshi and Kevin Rose Alex ... and so on. They made the show amazing, then they were fired from TSS for some unknown reason. When the show switched to AOTS, it became less about computers, and more about games and magazines. It also promoted groups that no one had heard or cared about. Finally, I could no longer watch it when Kevin Rose was gone. He kept it interesting, but he left to do his own thing, which is good. Kevin Rose now has several online castes, shows, etc. Online REV 3. Check it out. REV3.com I think you can reach it by going to www.systm.org. If you want a real technical show, not aots, then watch Kevin Roses' shows or listen to the tWit podcast. <br /> <br /> j <
