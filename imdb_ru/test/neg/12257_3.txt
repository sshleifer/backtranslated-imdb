A truly strange, surrealistic mess of visual ideas that probably looked extremely puzzling on the printed page; what attracted Robert Redford to the project might never know. Sydney J. Fury directs this fascinating journey of a selfish motorcycle racer who has taken the arsonist under his wing; the child looks at this anti-hero, and eventually begins to justify his immorality. Fragmented and repulsive - although for some, the sight of Redford undressing, about to undress, or shattered may be sufficient to deserve attention. Lauren Hutton also undresses, but all sexual flashes are just teasers for sensible ones; There is simply no story. Perhaps Fury made esoteric comments about mediocre wheels and their cluster around 1970. If this is true, then this approach before the “Clean Generation” had the opposite effect, since the film was not successful. * 1/2 of ****
