Leni Riefenstahl would be embarrassed by the disgusting propaganda that Moore is trying to call "humor." The fact that this film and Mooreâ€™s other motives really attract fans proves that, alas, some people can be fooled all the time. <br /> <br /> Let's see if we can lure foreigners. See if we can extol the outdated factories. See if we can add to the amount of hate in the world. See if we can pretend we're funny. See if we can beat the isolationist Charles Lindberg. The only thing that Moore lacks in comparison with Lindberg is the Goering medal. <br /> <br /> Admittedly, in this film, Moore is a bit self-deprecating to his nonsense. In this film, Moore mocks Roger Smith, CEO of General Motors, as an aloof, indifferent elitarist. Moore could have done this in 1989, but now that Moore has surrendered to aloof, indifferent elitism, this characteristic of Roger Smith has an ironic tinge. Who would really prefer to be Roger's friend than Michael Moore?
