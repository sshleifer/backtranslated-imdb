The only reason I give this film 4 is that it was made in the episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. The terrible direction is only slightly overshadowed by the characters' complete inability to act. The main role is an actor whom I have never seen, and it shows. No chemistry with a love interest and so gently that you almost don't care what happens to it. Dick Sargent was not convincing, because the villain least suggested that this guy was super evil ... he was more annoying than anything else. Peter Graves was the only person in the film who was not terrible, his role was small, and even he could not compensate for the lack of talent of his colleagues. In 2004, someone tried to make this mess again, it was called “The Island”. Personally, I have not seen this film, but, as I understand it, this is the same film. If you want to make fun of this movie, get the episode of MST3k, it’s really funny ... full of charmed and biographical links, it makes this movie finally watchable
