Michael Feifer writes and directs this fictional story based on the arrest of Edward Heine in Plainfield, Wisconsin. Gein was responsible for a series of horrific murders that led to the shock wave of terror in his rural hometown in the late 1950s. His wicked mind and distorted world are believed to be caused by his overbearing zealous Lutheran mother. Ed was nicknamed "Butcher from the Plain." He robbed corpses from fresh graves of women similar to his mother, and had sex with them before “dressing them like a deer” in his garage. Cut off heads with bodies hanging upside down are his personal trademark. After his arrest, many items of human skin were found in his house. In this film, young deputy Bobby Mason (Sean Hoffman) makes the search for Gayne (Kane Hodder) personal when his storekeeper (Priscilla Barnes) disappears. Acting is much better than the ridiculously liberal presentation of documented events concerning Gein. Also in the cast: Adrienne Franz, Timothy Oman, John Burke, Michael Berriman and Amy Lyndon.
