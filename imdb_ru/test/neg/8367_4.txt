At least, if you are a Disney fan (well, among those who love their live films, as well as animated films), if you are a child, if you are a child at heart, to such an extent that you hardly understand that you are an adult man, if you like absolutely any movie that depicts animals, especially when they do stunts, or if you're just not too demanding, Air Bud: World Pup is a bit more pleasant. I am a Disney fan. I liked this film enough and I’ll be happy to watch it again. <br /> <br /> But he has a lot of problems. The main disadvantage is due to too many characters, too many story lines and not enough time to take care of all of them. For 82 minutes we have adults who marry, teenagers fall in love and try not to be awkward in this, teenagers' competition for love and jealousy, children play spy games, dogs fall in love, dogs play football, dogs. There are puppies, manipulative parents, who will do everything for their children to win, what lessons they learn, housewives and fraudsters' dilemmas that prepare and execute complex plots. I probably forgot something, but these are 10 major plot problems that need to be dealt with in less than 10 minutes for each stream, and, apparently, their interweaving into a single whole, which is not too difficult, are children. the film is, after all, and it is also with humor and heartbreaking. It is not surprising that director Bill Bannerman, who was completely responsible on the first move (he has extensive experience in the second division), did not cope with this task. I am sure that it did not help that at least three screenwriters participated in it, and, probably, dictating producers. <br /> <br /> The end result - Air Bud: World Pup is extremely volatile. Events take place with little excuse and, even worse, often with a little explanation. People understand and do things, first of all, because they need - and quickly - so that everything can come to the right place in less than 90 minutes. From one cut to another, time can jump forward after six months or so. We have both adults who seem to be mentally retarded, and children who just intuitively understand what the dog is thinking about and throw themselves into some kind of unexpected action. Some of the topics should have been simply deleted, because it is difficult to get carried away with the film, when, as soon as you got acquainted with the idea, it already passed by you. <br /> <br /> Also, the fact that one of the strings is mainly plagiarism “One hundred and Dalmatians” (1961), minus the character “Cruella de Ville”, does not help either. And another problem is that, considering how the film is being edited, I have to assume that the dog, Air Bad, probably could not do anything with the soccer ball. Unlike the first two films, the dog is involved in sports, it's almost an afterthought, and when we see it, it has very quick glimpses; From time to time, these fragments, it seems, even helps computer animation. <br /> <br /> However, for people like me, Air Bud: World Pup has a charming charm. Scenario and performances often balance between a ridiculous, deceptive and a kind of cliché. I like this combination. This makes the film a bit predictable and slightly bizarre. And from time to time, as in the final, when the film completely abandons consistency and basically becomes a commercial for the US women's football team, Air Bud: World Pup is so brazen that you can't help but love it.
