It is difficult to delve into such things, since there is absolutely no piece of even a partial reason for viewing, not to mention expressing an opinion on this matter. I do not know anything about it - I looked at this laughter and stayed on fake breasts. Apparently, this is an informal continuation of the 1982 year "Slumber Party Massacre", which I REALLY enjoyed as a funny killer. The "Massacre Cheerleader" looks like late infinite soft core Cinemax porn! No wonder chicks like Nikki Fritz and Samantha Phillips (prolific T & A actresses) are involved. A lot of nekotki hooters and nothing more ... A group of 20 with something high school fans, two random guys and a fat, stupid ridiculous slug find themselves in a distressed situation in the country and find a home where they plan to stay overnight. The recently escaped “Bachelorette” killer is in the area and starts killing them. There is no blood and originality, and I would not say that nudity is a real “point of sale”, as it is a boring movie. Absolutely awful ...
