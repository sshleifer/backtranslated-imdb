Oh my God. I would never have thought that soon I would be able to see a thriller worse than Home Anxiety, but here it is. Armed with a rotten plot, horrendous editing, unnatural play, and headache-inducing “style” (sorry, I have no other words for this), Sanctimony is a type of film that almost makes you reconsider the whole genre; that is, this film is so bad that even thrillers, which I have condemned as total failures, now seem a little better. <br /> <br /> Now, not only Sanctimony is a terrible movie in itself, but also a success in a difficult task. pluck the best movies and do a pathetic job with it. Right from the main titles - nothing but a blatant attempt to reproduce those of the Se7en - I got the impression that something did not smell quite right. As soon as the film began with a series of banal-fast short haircuts filled with bloody images and pompous colors, I understood where the smell came from. <br /> <br /> It turns out that two policemen, or rather police officer Jim Renard (Michael Pare) and police officer Dorothy Smith (Jennifer Rubin), are investigating a murder in Vancouver. The serial killer, known as "Monkey Killer" (what a threatening, frightening nickname, eh?) For his methods of work, he killed quite a few people. You see, this nut obviously works according to the proverb “I see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil” and cuts off the eyes, ears and tongues of its victims. So far, six eyes, six ears and three tongues. Very ingeniously, Renarth and Smith find out that the Monkey Killer is probably going to kill the other three people ... well, because he probably wants to complete number 666. So suddenly the film focuses on Tom Gerrick (Casper Van Dien), young A successful, handsome businessman with a terrible temper. And here begins the robbery of the American psychopath. <br /> <br /> So, we are following the lives of two police officers and a young psychopath, none of whom are of any interest until they finally meet. On the way to this disco, where Renarth almost misses Herrick, inadvertently offers us one of the funniest scenes in recent memory: Renarth goes at the end of the disco club because ... well, just because the script tells us that this is the suspect site; then, with a single blow to the stomach, Renard gets rid of the big guard who blocks the way and they never hear about the guard again? Does this scene seem to someone else completely unrealistic? <br /> <br /> In any case, after another murder, Gerrick becomes a witness, but Smith and especially Renarth immediately suspect that he may be a murderer. In the typical manner of Basic Instinct, Smith meets a young businessman, suggesting that she can reveal his true identity. <br /> <br /> I won’t spoil the final, but it’s rather embarrassment; there are contradictions, some gaps in the plot, problems that will never be solved, and especially there is one last scene where a brutal massacre, which should be shocking and sad, sounds so ridiculous, excessively and meaningless, that I, frankly, do not can imagine no one could laugh at this. <br /> <br /> In the 87th minute, Sanctimony really insists on it. You never care about a single character, because they are all so flat (not to mention boring) that you know exactly who is who when you first meet them. You are never drawn into the story, because the scenes are connected through weak subject devices when they are completely unnecessary and irrelevant. The action ranges from medium (Wang Ding) to completely atrocious (Rubin and most of the auxiliary composition); music is a terrible universal techno, and photography is one of the worst I've ever seen. Of course, like any fiasco of the genre, we are given a bit of gratuitous nudity. <br /> <br /> 3/10
