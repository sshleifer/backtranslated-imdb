Yes, I made it to the very end. Although it was quite difficult. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I wondered if there was even a director on the set. The game ... well, I don't even know what to say. I thought that the girl who played Emily did her best in a boring, sometimes stupid and sometimes predictable dialogue. <br /> <br /> I know that it was a low-budget project, but the dull sound and lighting, unfortunately, made it look like a 100-minute tape for listening. <br /> <br /> I’m not even going to talk about the ending ... <br /> <br /> The best thing in the film is music. <br /> <br /> said, I do not recommend this movie to anyone. Even for lesbians who do not have a large number of films to watch as a whole, it’s nothing to waste their time on. If you're looking for a sad lesbian film, watch “Children's Hour”, “Lost and Crazy” or “High Art”. All this will leave you depressed and discouraged, but you will not have to suffer from cinematic hell in this process.
