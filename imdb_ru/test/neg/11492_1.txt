the film is a complete disaster. I don't know who is writing screenplays for films like this, but I would definitely like to meet one of them and talk a bit with him. Maybe the writers really do not know how things are going in foreign countries in the present or recent past? or they just do not care and write everything that they find interesting. <br /> <br /> an excellent and eternal formula with a crazy dictator + 1 lonely hero (of course, an American) may seem like a good idea. But come on ?! we had such a tyrant in Serbia (Milosevic) who did a lot of bad things to his people, but I just can’t imagine him shouting “shoot at them, shoot at them” with such barbaric passion as in medieval times. perhaps they wanted to show how evil he was, but it was a stupid idea. a much better impression would have been if he had just done it in cold blood, as real monsters do. <br /> <br /> The list of nonsense is too long, but the funny thing is: no matter how many national TV channels there are in Russia, the president of Russia watches American news SNN (CNN) ?? OMFG! <br /> <br /> Give me a break! <br /> <br /> burn this piece of trash please! <br /> <br /> HORRIBLE!
