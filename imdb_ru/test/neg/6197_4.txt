A dull walk through the commonplace Mormone prostheses. Not at all funny. Evidence of a widespread theory that in order for humor in a bathroom to be funny, it must be vulgar; it also supports the claim that having a close relationship with Jesus makes you not funny. More propaganda than the movie, do not worry about any acute social problems that arise at the dinner table after that. The saving grace of this film is his exact depiction of young Mormon women as especially attractive. Well, that's your $ 7.50.
