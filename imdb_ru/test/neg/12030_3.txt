This homemade horror film tells the story of a dude who kills people using the motive of stories by Edgar Allan Poe. Local police for several years interfered with this case, and now the FBI has taken possession. They know exactly who this guy is, but apparently, no one thought to swing at his house, because there he hangs out, runs around in his vintage clothes and tortures random locals. Therefore, the FBI is kidnapped, in which her father, a former leading investigator from the local police, is involved. To top it all off, a flock of stupid schoolchildren decided to camp at home and smoke a bunch of weed. <br /> <br /> Basically, an FBI agent shouts and runs around like a little girl and not one of the hefty college guys thinks to just stop and swing at a weak boy. Mostly replayed, and sometimes not distracted, Dead End Road smells like a low-budget play “Playing with Friends,” in which there are too many stupid points to cover them.
