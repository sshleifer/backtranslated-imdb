I remember when I first heard about Jack Frost. I was at Video Ezy in Miranda with my family in the tradition of monthly video hiring. It was at this time that I plucked up courage and went towards the horror shop. Looking through the various names, I finally stumbled upon Jack Frost. The covers were enough to convince me that the film was beyond my viewing pleasure. Years later, the film disappeared and was replaced by an inevitable, but unnecessary continuation. I again ventured on the horror section and took the case only to come to one conclusion: will the movie be scary ?? but not intentionally. <br /> <br /> Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Killer Mutant Snowman (full title) follows where his predecessor left him. Sheriff Sam is looking for advice after his tests, and Jack is now in the form of antifreeze. To escape his past, Sam and his wife are sent to an island hotel where he is in company with a wide range of stereotypical slasher films, including busty female models, fat sports athletes and Caribbean personnel. However, Jack was released from his liquid grave and returned to his icy methods. He goes to the island and continues to kill everyone who is in a terrible death. Only Sam can stop him. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that this is a direct film, so it will definitely be bad. But it's terrible, even in the eyes of other films. The camera work is bad, it uses a camera that looks majestically in a soap opera. Half of the actors look like they came out of pornography, and the other half look like they came out of a nursing home, but in fact they actually leave the shelter. The film widely uses special effects that alternate between soft puppet art and computer graphics, which can be enhanced by an infant, and the death scenes are mostly off-screen, showing us not only what happened to the unfortunate, but deserving victim. But the film is the most memorable, because it kills those who love, for example, “There is something that requires a little Christmas stuffing” and “I know that I officially declare you killed!” Ultimately, the goal of the entire film like this , is to make popcorn for those Friday boredom nights, and even in this case it fails. To make a sequel to the film, which was a bad slasher with a concept that a child would have thought incredible, must have needed some nerves of steel ?? or complete frontal lobotomy. Director Michael Cooney ?? Thanks for your time. For everyone else ?? Avoid like arsenic.
