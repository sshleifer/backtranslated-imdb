I found it almost impossible to sympathize with the character of Ricci in this film. If she was supposed to be depressed, I think that the screenwriter and director neglected depression studies before making this film, because Ricci's character was more like an image of selfish, useless crap than a victim and depression. /> <br /> The forced attempt at introspective narration was as ridiculous as the painful interactions between her and the people around her. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but I could not buy it. This is straight to the video of Schlock. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this.
