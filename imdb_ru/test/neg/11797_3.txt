Obviously, someone was looking to catch the Blair Witch wave. <br /> <br /> This film was created like all the haunted “reality shows” that have recently appeared on television (and I must admit to enjoy them), but this film is much more fun! Probably, the first three quarters of the film are filled with "participants" who go around the house, WHY. Give me a break! Spending 10 minutes to go up to the attic is not my idea to have a good time. Any paranormal phenomena are obvious attitudes. There are no strings, but captured too well on the camera to be real. The "participants" were also not very pretty. Two stupid guys who don't take it seriously, one girl who scares the hood, and a typical replayed "paranormal" person. Is this becoming a cliche - a “formula” for a ghost film? <br /> <br /> I have to admit that the last 15 minutes or so were pure tension. They filmed every ounce of tension in the film and inserted it into the 15 minutes. I admit, I spent this time walking in the kitchen. I really would not recommend this film to younger viewers, even if it is PG13. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for some entertainment, if you don’t take it seriously, you will enjoy it. this movie. There are a lot of situations that can be hacked! If you are looking for a great plot ... look elsewhere;)
