What is in this film? Lots of gunfire and expensive effects. Nothing makes sense on any other level. <br /> <br /> Watching Arnold cry, sees himself so bad that it is ridiculous. The plot is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you think that the devil will be impressed by a bad actor with a gun, then this film is for you!
