Why was this movie ever made? They tainted the original Caddyshack with this shit. I could only watch half of it, and I did not laugh even once. At least I did not pay to see him, because he was on television. but I will not return the hour of my life, which I spent watching this terrible mess. The first star was not, except for Chevy Chase, and he probably regrets that he shot this film. Jackie Mason was supposed to be an outrageous Funny jester, like Rodney Dangerfield, was the first, but Jackie Mason was not at all funny. Jackie Mason is not Rodney Dangerfield. This film stinks like a barnyard in July. Avoid at all costs.
