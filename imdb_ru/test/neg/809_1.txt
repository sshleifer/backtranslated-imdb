Do not watch this movie! It's disgusting! The start is really very good, but in the middle everything falls, and I really regret that I spent 80 crowns (about 11 dollars) on a ticket! Peter Dalle should see this as his last chance to win people's interest. HORRIBLE picture! The only bright spot is the magnificent work of Robert Gustavsson, Lena Naiman and Gosta Ekman. <br /> <br /> I hope you listen to my advice ... Painting - trash
