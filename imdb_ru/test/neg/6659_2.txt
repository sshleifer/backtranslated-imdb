Extremely bad! I don’t expect much from Garcia, because he is one of the most overvalued actors today, but Keaton really should have known that this film would suck and come out while he could (not that I particularly love him, but hey, he really Batman). <br /> <br /> In one scene, Kiton is transported to a hospital chained and wearing a mask like Hannibal Lecter when two attacking dogs bark at him (dogs can feel evil, which you know (vomiting)) and Keaton growls at them , forcing them to retreat and whine their tails between their legs. Is the film a comedy? Garcia is fooling himself in the interrogation scene with a dialogue that only a complete mentally retarded child can find believable, and the child is too annoying to regret it. <br /> <br /> If you are going to make a film with a story as poor as this one, you need some charm, some humor, some solid actions. Take, for example, “Hard Hard”, which is great, despite the rather stupid plot. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that Keatson’s character was a joke, I’ve crushed him all the time. I wanted to see Garcia crying over her dead child and Keaton, sipping martinis on some paradise island! This film makes you laugh ... Watch it with a witty friend, and you can have fun, as this film begs for miracles in almost all scenes. <br /> <br /> In general, this is an insult to the intellect and a huge waste of money. Greed made this film and thank goodness he bit his ass.
