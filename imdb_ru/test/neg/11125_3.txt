First of all, I accept the question for the title of this film. "Chupacabra" is not a Spanish word. The name to which they refer is Chupacabra. I believe they dropped 's' because it sounds plural, but I assure you, this word in Spanish is the only one. <br /> <br /> Then I thought that this film was shot several years ago. It sounded like one of those horror films that I watched when I was an early teenager at home, when my stepfather was not in the city. Then it would be a little scary. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about special effects. The most important "effect" is the costume used for chupacabras. Given that this is the main character, you might think that serious money would be invested in him, but this is not so. The shape, color and texture were stupid, like some kind of stupid haunted house in Disney World. <br /> <br /> There were times when chupacabras were walking, when no one could walk. At that time his movements were sharp and strange, but the movement on the floor looked like any normal person. <br /> <br /> Another thing to which I belong is that there are no animals in the world that would kill everything he sees, regardless of how to eat it. Chupacraba would have killed one, then the other, but it seemed that he had not really eaten the victim. You say, “This is just a movie,” and I agree. But the idea is so far away that it is stupid. <br /> <br /> What country is Dr. Pena from? It sounds like Jamaican, Hawaiian, British, something else, but I think it should be Hispanic. The problem is that his accent is so bad that even a Russian can say that he is not Hispanic. <br /> <br /> Soldiers fired at this thing after the round and didn’t make a dent, but continued shooting Do not they understand that to shoot and try something new is a waste of time? They did not. They just kept shooting, while the chupacabras kept killing, and not eating them. <br /> <br /> Did they have to kill the dog? :) In any case, my vote was 3 for this film, because it was bad. Why did I watch all this? I'm sure you did the same thing in some cases, so don't let me quarrel. ;)
