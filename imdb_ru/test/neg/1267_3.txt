The film is a powerful political statement about extraordinary extradition, torture and the war on terror policy. Others have already commented on these and other aspects of the film. My review may contain spoilers, so if you haven’t seen the movie yet, you may not want to read further. <br /> <br /> This film raises several questions. First, was the main character guilty or not? There is no satisfactory explanation of why the NSA decided to first select and visualize it. Is there an innocent explanation for why he got phone calls from what the NSA considers a terrorist? If there is, then the film does not seem to give, and this made the whole film completely unsatisfactory for me. It’s good and good to say whether the torture is right or wrong, but first prove to me that they tortured the wrong person, then we’ll go to the next step. <br /> <br /> If the main character was guilty, what was achieved by freeing him? Perhaps we were well prepared to resist up to a certain point, and then pretend to break down and give answers that may be erroneous with a little research, which usually makes torturers believe that they tortured an innocent person in a plea . without actually being guilty. However, there is nothing in the film that proves his guilt. <br /> <br /> Various other weaknesses are as follows: 1. So, the CIA fraudster agent released him and sent him home. What is stopping the NSA from picking it up again? A small ad in the Washington Post? Please give me a break here ... If the senator does not wish to put his neck on the line to intervene on his behalf, what should Corin Whitman fear? 2. If the NSA was tracking which phone numbers they were calling, why could they not listen to some of the calls to find out if something backstage was being discussed? 3. The plot is even more stupid in any case. Any criminal who has more than a dozen brain cells will conduct his criminal business through an anonymous prepaid cellular line, and not according to the one that can be traced back to him and his house. <br /> <br /> The whole movie revolves around jerks. in the hearts of viewers, showing graphic and unsubstantiated torture scenes. But when you think about it with more depth, there’s nothing substantial in this film, just a lot of unanswered questions and the feeling “what is it? !!! ”at the end of the film.
