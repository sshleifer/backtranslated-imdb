I bought this film for one dollar and decided that I would never be wrong, my big mistake was to watch it. Enjoyed playing Ice-T and rap, which gave many lessons to this film about Los Angeles and the world of pimps. There is a boxer who kills one of his opponents in the training ring and has a career, but due to mental problems since childhood and killing another boxer, he resigns. He is hired by a pimp who is looking for a bodyguard to protect the girls who work for him in their trade and to ensure that they are not beaten. This boxer falls in love with a boss girl, and all sorts of troubles begin. This is interesting, and then it becomes a big laughing comedy.
