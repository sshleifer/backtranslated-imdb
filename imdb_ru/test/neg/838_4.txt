Recently, I watched a lot of westerns from the 1930s to the present. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, there are several excellent low-budget spaghetti westerns. In this film there were all the elements of a decent western: a good story with talented actors and everything else. Although this is a parody of this genre, and for me the way it was done simply did not work and made for a disappointing film. <br /> <br /> This film can be easily divided into two parts. <Br /> <br /> The first part is gorgeous; He has a great opening scene and develops an interesting story of a bounty hunter (stranger), a stalking gangster who stalks a large banking party, guarded, in part, by a banker. During the film, these three characters form alternating alliances, trying to get money. There are subtle comic hints at the tricks of earlier films from this genre, but comedy does not destroy the common story. <br /> <br /> The second half of the film is where the comedy goes beyond and essentially destroys the film. The turning point comes right in the part where the barmaid causally scolds the dwarf to stop shooting at customers while she waits until other visitors seem to notice the four dead bodies lying around this place. From this point on, the film shifts from a decent spaghetti western with comic hues to a silly and silly parody. <br /> <br /> There are three terrible scenes of fistfight (one on the river, one on the market and one in the baths), which follow in quick succession, as if one was not bad enough. The fight is so fake that it's funny, and since the sound is not in sync with the image, it makes it even worse. On the battlefield scene in the market, a banker jumps on hidden trampolines and spins on poles, as if he were in a circus; this is clown. Although the worst part of these battle scenes is music; This is a carefree, hearty mix, more suitable for a square dance or the ridiculous episode "Hee-Hou." These scenes almost nullify the main story. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film was disappointing because it had a lot of potential as a decent western, but comic twists just messed it up. If you want to see a good western deception, then look at "Burning Saddles". If you want to watch good spaghetti westerns, then avoid this movie.
