Trying to capture the wildlife of this area on film, our photographers intersect with a wild animal hunter who stalks animals for another reason. The hunter decides the witnesses of his illegal activities ?? in accordance with the summary of the DVD cover. <br /> <br /> Beautiful guide Peter Brown (as Jim Pendrike) invites cute blonde Ahnu Capri (like Terri Green) and her pretty brother Tom Simcox (like Art Green) to the Venezuelan jungle to admire the view and take photos wildlife. After they connect with the fanatical big game hunter William Smith (like the Caribe), psychological dramaturgy appears <br /> <br /> A beautiful scene is the key scene in which Mr. Brown is resting in the tree on the tree and sharing a cigarette with mr simkoksom. The circular direction reappears in the later “battle” between Brown and Mr. Smith; and it is effective. Simcox's early sexual romp adds nothing to the story; this could be reduced to take advantage of what seems to be flirting between the characters of Brown and Simcox. The attraction between Brown and Miss Capri could also increase. <br /> <br /> Music, including Love All That the Sun Loves, is beautiful by Jim Stein; but the film needs to be revised to cut out animals that do not appear on the screen. And there are too many extra frames. “Piranha” is the case when less would be more.
