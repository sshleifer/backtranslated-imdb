I stumbled upon this film while watching the channels, and it looks like it was another poorly made Christian film about the End Time (which I find quite interesting because they take themselves so seriously). To be honest, I only saw the last 30 minutes, so I missed a piece about UFOs and science fiction materials. But this was enough to classify him as an embarrassing and terrifying view of the Christian faith, as well as a rather pathetic film in any artistic sense. <br /> <br /> Like the movie, the script was terrible, the action was mediocre, and the move was bad. Cinematography and directing were low: no interesting visual effects, no multi-layered storyline, no creativity. It's not easy to blame the budget for this - movies can be interesting without special effects. This was not. Christian films cannot justify their mediocrity and lack of originality in the artistic sphere only because of their message. And the message here was hardly “Christian.” <br /> <br /> ** Disclaimer: The rest of this comment is for Christians ** <br /> <br /> First, it’s unethical in any business to lure and switch its customers. I do not like being told that I can win a free iPod, only to realize that I must first spend $ 300 in participating stores. Non-Christians do not like being told that they are watching a sci-fi film, and then are bombarded by Christian propaganda, which has all the subtleties of a sledgehammer. Hidden programs do not win your friends, and even more so - converts. <br /> <br /> Secondly, you should not use obvious threats to convince people that your beliefs are true. The actors who represented the Christians acted as soulless, self-righteous hooligans when they were dealing with a skeptical "unbeliever" - they even went so far as to make a delight to frighten him to faith. Representative dialogue: “Turn to Jesus — OR GO TO HELL!” “Well, don't trust me, BUT YOU WILL BE EXTRACTED!” “On the day when you die, I can guarantee that you wish you paid more attention to this material of Jesus — WHEN YOU ARE IN THE ADMINISTRATOR!” Well, I can exaggerate, but it just happened. If you think this is a “clear message for Christ,” you are mistaken. I do not remember Jesus using threats and coercion. And I do not think that people can make a genuine decision to believe in it for fear. So Christians, please do not use this as a “testimony tool” for your “unsaved” friends. This is a rude, offensive and inaccurate description of a true Christian message. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the theology was bad. In addition to describing Jesus as a means of insurance against hell, he did not leave room for discussions or debates and did not try to raise the question of whether there can be a UFO or alien life. Instead, he offered one answer: “UFOs are the devil’s scheme to deceive people when it comes to admiration,” which is neither biblical nor widely accepted by most Christians. Since the Bible does not mention UFOs or aliens, you cannot use them as a source to draw conclusions anyway. The rapture is not necessarily even a widely accepted, sound biblical concept, although nowadays most evangelical Christians seem to believe this because of the popular book series. If you do your research (as many fellow reviewers believe), the idea of ​​the two coming of Christ (the first as an admiration) is a relatively new phenomenon in the church tradition, popularized by some traveling evangelists at the turn of the 20th century. Most orthodox Christians are likely to find the message of this film a rather large segment, based on many unsupported premises. <br /> <br /> In fact, this film is not popular as a useful entertainment and as an accurate representation of Christianity and its beliefs. I would not recommend it.
