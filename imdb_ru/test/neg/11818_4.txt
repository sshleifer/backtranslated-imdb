The plot for Black Mama White Mama, revolves around two female prisoners, in a female prison in the Philippines. One black and one white. These two women are thrown together in prison. Pam Grier - Lee Daniels Lee is imprisoned in a hell of a women's prison for dancing like a harem girl. <br /> <br /> Guy Lee owes her some of his profits from his drug trade. Mostly Lee is interested in breaking free from prison, in order to get her drug addict's money so she can leave the Philippines and live better. Margaret Markov plays Karen Brent, a white woman from a privileged background who is also a revolutionary. Karen joined a group of revolutionaries who decided to change the corrupt Philippine political system. She is captured by the authorities of the Philippines and is held as a political prisoner. <br /> <br /> The storyline takes off when Karen and Lee leave the prison where they were together. Two of them were also chained to the wrist. When they run, they also fight each other, because they have different goals. Naturally, they can't stand being together. But they also understand that they must put aside their differences in order to help each other survive while they evade capture. <br /> <br /> If this film seems very similar to Big Cage Cage, itâ€™s because most of the cast in the Two films are the same as their location in the Philippines. Roger Corman has always had a permanent cast of actors that he used in all of his 70s films. In addition to Pam Greer, Sid Haig, Robert Collins, Claudia Jennings, Betty Ann Rhys and William Smith were also among the many actors who were often filmed in Corman AIP films. <br /> <br /> Like The Big Bird Cage Black Mom White Mom relies on too much bloody violence to be acceptable. In this film, Pam Greer conveys his usual tough heroine and shows his competence as a heroine of female action. Margaret Markov is less spectacular in her portrayal of the revolutionary Karen. She just seems fragile and balanced to be committed to a political partisan. With the exception of Sid Haig, as colorful Ruben, the rest of the cast is forgotten. <br /> <br /> This film does not have great entertainment value, unless you are excessive, heinous acts of violence. Only the performances of Pam Greer and Sig Haig make this film worth seeing.
