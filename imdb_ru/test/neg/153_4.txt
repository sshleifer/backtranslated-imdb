I suppose I understand why critics give this film two out of five stars, this is not fiction, but I think it's worth seeing from director Shawn Levy (“Cheaper on a Dozen”, “Night at the Museum”). Mostly 14-year-old Jason Shepard (Malcolm from the “Middle World”, Frankie Muniz) often lies to his parents and teachers, and his teacher warns him that if he doesn’t make his creative letter, he will fail his whole semester and will have to repeat evaluation over the summer. Thus, he finishes his work, but, receiving support from Hollywood producer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti), who hit him on the way to school, he manages to leave his article with the story “Big Fat Liar” in the car. He learns from the trailer for the film that Marty stole his newspaper and turns it into a major film, so he and his best friend Kaylee (she is Amanda Bains from Man) have to prove that Jason is telling the truth this time. Marty, of course, is too nasty and self-satisfied to call Father Jason Harry (Michael Brian French), and he even burns Big Fat Liar. So now Jason and Kaylee are determined to make Marty’s life as hellish as possible, until he agrees to name Papa Jason. They added blue dye to his pool, orange hair dye in his shampoo and even more pranks creating havoc for Marty’s career. There is an obvious moment when Jason looks as if he wants to give up, but don't worry, all the characters who despise Marty help in the last operation, and with the arrival of Jason's parents, he wants to finally prove his truthfulness, and the boy does he deliver, great style. Also starring Amanda Detmer as Monty Kirkham, Lee Majors as Vince, Donald Adeosun Faison as Frank Jackson, Sandra Oh as Mrs. Phyllis Caldwell, Russell Hornsby as Marcus Duncan, Christina Tucci as Carol Shepard and Jon Jones Phillies Caldwell, Christine Tucci as Marcus Duncan, Christina Tucci as Carol Shepard and Jon Jon Phillies Caldwell, Christine Tucschi as Marcus Duncan, Christina Tucci as Karol Shepard and Jon Jon Phillies Caldwell, Jonas Hornsby American cake in the role of Dustin Dusty Wong, Muniz is cute, Byrnes shows surprisingly talented support, and, although he spends a little time and talent, Jamatti perfectly knows how to be nasty. This is a children's film, so if it seems trivial, delicate or predictable, just remember this and try to enjoy the performances and slaps. Good!
