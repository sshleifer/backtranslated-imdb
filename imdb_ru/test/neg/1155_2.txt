Just saw it at the horror film festival in Madison and was disappointed. Some shocking, funny moments (fist of hollow Carla, urinating harpies in the Land of Dreams) and two competing interesting rooms (similar to the “New Nightmare” with faith reviving the mythical character, as well as “The Lost Highway” with a man living in his fantasy head) , but there were long stretches without movement and inconsistent plot development. Just because you use the frame of dreams or the mental state of the fugue, it does not make them lynch. You need compelling visuals and creepy performances. <br /> <br /> Positive things: Dr. Maitland had a very funny time, and all the girls were very cute. Carla's father, Chalmers and Ingrid Pitt looked like they were having fun. And Tom Savini, at least, looked as if he remembered his lines, and we could not understand whether he was reading only hint cards. <br /> <br /> I’m getting links to Hummer, but it seems the director understood that the script was a snoozer and just added a few shocks to try to laugh at any shots he could collect. But they do not work, because they are too few and they are far from each other and create a contradictory tone. Cut it to 30 minutes of all the fun parts, and you might get a surreal stupid little short, but miss the length of the function. It's not “so bad, it's good,” it's just “so bad, it's boring.”
