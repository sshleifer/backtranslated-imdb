Usually, when the BBC releases a series, he is used to a certain guarantee of satisfaction. Usually the series is great, even if the plot is boring, you can believe that acting will meet your expectations. When I stumbled upon "Persuasion", here in the local library, I was looking forward to a pleasant evening, because I read the story. <br /> <br /> I am glad that I first read the story, otherwise I would not appreciate it. In addition, I was relieved to find out that the production date of this television series was from 1971, because until that moment I thought that BBC had lost it. This is really bad and should be used as a horror film in acting schools. <br /> <br /> The only positive thought I have about this series is that people in this film are unlikely to appear or be involved in BBC or another product this century, except for the young the Musgrove sisters, who appeared to have taken the first steps in acting, and they did remarkably well under that other guidance.
