The acting was flat (at least none of the actors sounded like they had just received the script that morning), and the quality of the sound and the film made me think about the 70s film about the weekly bombs. The only thing that told me that it really wasnâ€™t a 70s-week film was the reference to DNA testing. But for me, as for Eastern Orthodoxy, the most glaring thing in this ... film ... was the total romism of religion. Romania is 88% Orthodox, but you will never know about it from this film: Father Soren is Irish. And I would have known it, even if I had not seen the actor playing in the Irish pub Michael Sullivan in the Star Trek: Voyager series Fairhaven. The bishop had Roman vestments (and, by the way, even Orthodox bishops do not wear them, unless they speak the liturgy, especially if they live in a monastery). The only non-Roma paraphernalia I saw was a cross with three rods on the door of the church, and even then I had to squint to see it. The first reviewer said that the producers did their research. Well, if that's true, they got it wrong on the religious side of the film.
