This is a sad Hollywood remake of a classic British film. Everything that made the original entertaining program “Italian Work” was removed from this purulent sore from the film “The Script” by Donna and Wayne Powers and sluggishly by “director” F. Garry Gray. I am amazed that Troy Kennedy Martin (screenwriter of the original film) allowed him to use his name in the credits behind the ear of this pig. Martin has worked on some of the best film and television projects over the past 40-plus years. Even vaguely associated with this stinky - this is not good. <br /> <br /> Humor is imposed, the drama is difficult, all the characters are cute forensics (with the exception of the implausible, beautiful Charlize Theron). safe cracker / rally driver) and the plot corresponds to the original only in the following points: <br /> <br /> (1) Three Minis (modern versions of BMW, but nonetheless Minis) <br /> <br /> ( 2) Using Crocker and Bridger names for two main characters <br /> <br /> (3) Disrupting the city’s traffic control system to ensure a safe route through it. <br /> <br /> (4) Uh, that's all. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, you will get a soft and implausible American film about stealing numbers, in which a gang of cheerful pirate buddies will eventually overcome their evil partner. Believe me, it's awfully long before they do it. The actors do everything they can with what they are given, but it seems that they all took it as an exercise to polish poop after reading the script. None of the bizarre nature of the original film and the distinctly British flavor survived by being filed in a Hollywood hamburger machine. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and watch the original 1969 film instead of this sucking wound on your chest. Surprisingly, Noel Coward didn’t make Aunt Nelly jump out of his grave and kicked everyone who participated in this cool remake halfway to his throat. <br /> <br /> Italian work? More like Italian Jobby.
