Despite the fact that the film “Die to Love You,” well prepared for a television film, smells of melodramatic brilliance of poor quality. <br /> <br /> The film opens with Roger Paulson (Tim Matheson, looking much older than I remember him), he is a struggling businessman, leading an empty, lonely life after his wife Ruthie (who looks suspiciously like Rosanna Arnold) leaves him with speed. Now all Roger has is his cats ... and his advertisement in the newspaper. <br /> <br /> As soon as he received a response to his ad, he calls Johnny-Elaine-Lisa. Oh, no matter who I am, Lawrence. Then ... they have phone sex. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure where you're from or when you were born, but I remember that phone sex was played out in the late 80s. Sorry, but it was trashy. <br /> <br /> Soon Roger and Shirok caught their ears, and they had a tumultuous romance. They fall in love, visit the zoo to see the gorillas, and then have sex with Roger's son in another room. She ties him to the bed and seduces him. <br /> <br /> Roger is just so stupid that he doesn't understand that Johnny-Elyan is just a jerk who likes to sleep around. God forbid women sleep with only one man. Soon, strange phone calls begin to occur, Johnny Girl wants Roger to marry her with absolute speed, and she continues to rant and rave about his former husband, who used to beat her. It's funny to see how Roger believes her in all this. Until a clumsy colleague tells him to spy on her things, like a curious housewife. He listens to her shitty advice, and now, he finds a suitcase full of fake IDs, wigs, weapons and a crossbow. He immediately takes the suitcase to the police and arrests her. Despite all this jazz, he still loves dull broad. She lies so much that her tongue caught fire if she once said the truth. <br /> <br /> Roger continues his life and meets an ugly woman named Angela who looks like something from Gremlins 2. She also has a child, and Roger likes her very much. But something in Roger's subconscious mind keeps him in touch with Lisa Ron (even if it is her real name), and he keeps coming back to see her. <br /> <br /> Now Liza is “the former who will not leave,” since she “earns” a card without getting out of prison and appears at Roger's threshold, and his son Matt is so busy trying to check it, he pours juice all over the floor. IL 'The horn is so stupid, he throws out Lisa and doesn't even change the locks. Boy, if all people were so stupid, I would not even write this review. The ending of this film is so banal that you would not believe it. <br /> <br /> Tim Matheson is the king of Made for Television. he just looks like a mummy in this movie. He is a little wooden and hard. Dazzling Tracy Pollan works well with her role, and her springboard sounds believable. She is very beautiful, and I see what Michael J. Fox sees in her. <br /> <br /> This movie is great to watch when you are at a late night tea party, but again, you can fall asleep, considering how boring and boring it is.
