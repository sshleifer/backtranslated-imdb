when I first read about Berlin I am Meer, I did not expect much. but I thought that with the right people, the right places, the right music and fashion, you could at least make a trivial film about hip-Berlin, which everyone seems to be talking about. but Eisler failed, it is so absurdly unreliable. this is a complete distortion of what is happening in the so-called scene of Berlin. Of course, it's not all about hippos, but you should expect more from a movie that is being sold as a “definite Berlin movie.” <br /> <br /> and among other things, this is a really bad movie. mediocre game and rather boring plot. Interestingly, some actors in other films have proven that they are in fact very talented. so these are really bad management skills. <br /> <br /> don’t worry about watching “berlin am meer”, if you are not 17 years old, you come from a small town in western Germany and want to move to a big city after you finished school. then you can find it pleasant and totally cool.
