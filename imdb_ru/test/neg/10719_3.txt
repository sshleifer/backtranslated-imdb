This film was perhaps one of the most unoriginal and unfunny films that I have seen in a long time. Honestly, I did not expect some kind of revolutionary comic formula, but I expected at least some fun. With such low expectations, how could I be disappointed? <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey, perhaps my favorite actor (not sarcasm), did no more than plain water in this film. It seems that he has temporarily returned to his ridiculous roots and created a character who is no different from his Fletcher Reed from The Liar Liar. This new character, Dick Harper (a.k.a. Fletcher 2.0), is a poorly drawn and poorly written puppy. If you smile while watching this pathetic and essentially dull character, most likely because Kerry is trying his best to bring him a third dimension. Kerry's out-of-the-way posing is embarrassing with humor - and, ultimately, sad. <br /> <br /> Thea Leoni, since Jane does a little more than just provide Abbott Costello Kerry. I usually find Leoni's tea refreshing and underused, but not in this case. Jane Harper could easily play any actress between the ages of thirty and forty-five, and it was because of this non-specific character that Jane’s character became uninteresting. She simply does not have a defining feature, in addition to her following the general theme of the film, which seems to be that ... Wait, no, this film does not have a theme. If you do not consider "Big Business - Evil" topic. I thought it was more than given. <br /> <br /> Richard Jenkins and Alec Baldwin are both likely (although tired) to act as support, but neither of them seemed to be really interested in the role they play. It is clear that Alec Baldwin put as much effort into playing his part as the sinister SEO. how he puts a sandwich in his meal (which he seems to be doing a lot lately). <br /> <br /> A little bit related, but did Alec Baldwin play any roles in the past few years that didn’t require him to be a powerful leap in a suit? <br /> <br /> In any case, take my advice, if you have not yet witnessed horror: save your money. This is the one that catch on HBO for several months. Dick and Jane are present, but not fun.
