You know, I am very tired of the general music used in films of this type (see “Jaw”, “Harassing Behavior”, etc.). Each scene of genuine tension here (and there are some) is immediately undermined by some kind of cheese pop composition, fully diluting the tension. Why do they do it? Of course, in order to sell several soundtracks, but in this case the mission was not fulfilled - did anyone buy this CD? <br /> <br /> And yes, Miss Mirren attacks her role with a twist and joy (with some surprise to add a beat). But what are Molly, Leslie and Vivika doing here? Their roles (they are so underestimated that I cannot use “characters” here) do not make sense in the storyline, so I cannot understand why three famous actresses played. <br /> <br /> Oh and the end is so incredibly beaten and irresponsible. Children go unpunished and behave as if nothing happened - everyone is smiling at the graduation party. They are criminals, people! No consequences for their actions (kidnapping, assault, unauthorized intervention) - nothing. <br /> <br /> Small things - is Tingle's fairy tale about her husband true? What about the crossbow? Will virgin heroine Katie lose her cherry on such a whim? (Great message guys.) Why did Mackin go to her house? How did Kate's academic enemy go through the door at that very moment? How do pupils even get teachers home addresses? WHAT WITH GEFFREY TEMBOR? On what basis did Mackin dismiss Tingle? For her, bloody, beaten and taken hostage by students! <br /> <br /> Well, okay, I spend a lot more thoughts on the script than, apparently, Mr. Williamson, so I’ll stop here. br /> <br /> 3/10
