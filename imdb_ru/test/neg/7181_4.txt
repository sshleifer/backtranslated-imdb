If this is the best film about Commander Hamilton, I have no curiosity about the others. <br /> <br /> The film's greatest tools are his eyes, but when Peter Stormare wants to show strong emotions, he closes him, so for five or six seconds we admire him for centuries, while his feelings remain unknown. Lousy acting technique. <br /> <br /> Stormare sometimes shudders when it shoots a pistol, turns its head and closes its eyes. Watch closely. With such a competition, James Bond can rest easy. <br /> <br /> There are several interesting performances by other actors, but they are not enough to hang a movie. Cinematography is beautiful, copes with the seizure of northern colds. Even the Sahara looks cold. Hamilton may have its own climate. <br /> <br /> There are some good action sequences here. Unfortunately, the only sense of humor on the screen belongs to the villain who turns the hero into a big tablet. The jokes of James Bond may not be particularly good, but at least he does not look constipated all the time. <br /> <br /> One of the positive points in favor of the film is that the psychotic, distorted, vicious hatred of Israel in Guillah was omitted. What has been preserved is the worship of the noble, heroic PLO, which it shows us operating in Libya without the knowledge and control of the dictator Gaddafi. This fantasy is hard to believe, since Gaddafi actually threw the PLO out of Libya for four years. And at the end of the film, Hamilton gives the PLO a very disturbing gift. Where will they use this gift? Hamilton doesn't care. <br /> <br /> We are very far from "For Whom the Bell Tolls". <br /> <br /> Commander Hamilton will remain a local phenomenon. Although Henning Mankellâ€™s books are selling well around the world, Yang Guillau will never achieve the same success. <br /> <br /> Regarding this film, bleeeeaaahhhhh.
