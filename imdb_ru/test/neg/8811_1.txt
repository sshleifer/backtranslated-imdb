There was so much bad in this movie that I had problems with getting everything straight. But the one thing that really bothers me is that if Jigsaw was lying on the bathroom floor, what would happen if Zep never showed up? What if Zep was killed by Danny Glover before he got to the bathroom? Jigsaw just gets up and leaves? Can a guy in the middle of the bathroom not be a puzzle, and another part of the puzzle game? What if Zep killed his wife and child, how did Jigso get him an antidote to poison if he lay in the middle of the bathroom? Why is the doctor waiting until the last minute to finally cut off his leg? It was too late, it was already six, and as far as he knew that his wife and child had already been shot, it was not the best time for heroism. These are just a few questions that I had about the film, but I may have missed something or something else, because I only saw the movie once. Please help!
