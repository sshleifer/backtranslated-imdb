“You're in the Navy” is terribly bad: very likely the worst film Gary Cooper has ever made. Supposedly, it is based on a true story, but the incident that inspired this film does not seem to have enough plot to sustain the full-length script. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on local television when I was at home. sitting for my mother-in-law in Long Island, New York. Outside there was a fierce snowstorm, and I was literally covered with snow. If I could get out the door, I would definitely stop watching this movie. <br /> <br /> In the cast there are several interesting names, in particular, Charles Bronson (under his original name), Lee Marvin, Harvey Lembeck, Jack Webb and Jack Warden. Forget it. Everybody stinks in this movie. Even the usually reliable Millard Mitchell is terrible. Lee Marvin and Jack Warden are on the screen so briefly that it makes no sense to watch them. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper plays an obscure naval officer who is in command of commanding a ship that feeds on a new experimental steam. turbine: basically the entire ship is a giant teapot. Cooper understands that this assignment is not prestigious: if it were, it would be a better officer. <br /> <br /> Cooper was a good actor in dramatic roles, but he simply did not have the ability to comedy. He made some bad comedies, and this is his worst. Jane Greer always missed me, and she bothered me more than usual here. This ship sank with all hands and sank without a trace. Did I mention this movie stinks? I rate "You are in the fleet now" one point out of 10. Whistle! Whistle!
