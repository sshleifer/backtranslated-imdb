The Twilight Zone has reached a certain mythology about this - very much like Star Trek. This is because there are many dedicated show fans who, no matter what they think, each episode was a winner. They expose each person to 10 points and can not objectively evaluate the show. Because of this, some time ago I reviewed all the original Star Trek episodes (good and bad) because the overall ratings and reviews were too positive. Now it's time to do the same for the Twilight Zone. <br /> <br /> Now I was very surprised when I saw reviews of this episode, which described it as “one of the best” and gave 10 points. If so, then why does everyone whom I know, who saw this episode, hate him as much as I do? It is quite possible that I, my family and friends are eccentrics, but it is also possible that this is another case where fanatical fans fan the rating to an average or below average. <br /> <br /> The episode itself plays the main role William Windom and others as different archetypes - soldier, dancer, etc. They are all stuck in a cylindrical room without an exit, and only at the end do you understand the “shocking truth” - not at all shocking and in fact mostly lame. No, this is a poorly written and unforgiving episode. Yes, there were many episodes of the series that deserved 10, but few are as unworthy as this one, due to the minor script and unattractive resolution.
