Was this adaptation of the Marvel comic made ?? and on the shelves ?? so his production company can retain the copyright on the characters, this does not change the fact that this is complete nonsense. The costumes of Dr. Dome and (especially) Ting are amazingly good, but everything else suffers from a shortage of cash or talent. Directed by Olya Sasson cannot even point the camera at things, not including such screams like the POV of a blind woman, the dialogue is absolutely gloomy, the team's costumes do not fit properly, and the effects are terrible: the human torch seems to be painted on tape with felt-tip pens how Mr. Fantastic's powers come to life with a curved blue stick with a glove on the end. Joseph Culp makes up for wearing a mask, waving his arms wildly, Jay Underwood is incredibly annoying, the rest of the actors hit terrible levels, and although it’s hard not to feel sorry for all these guys who thought that the film was to be released, it’s equally hard to imagine that they believe that it was actually good.
