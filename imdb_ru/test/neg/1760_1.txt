I had to write a review of this film after I saw it last night, and read some comments from people trying to classify dissatisfaction with this film, go to the post wfmitchell)). None of these classifications suits me. Another classification that should be on the list: 5) people did not like this film because it was not good. I found that the film was bad and forced. My wife chose him for us to see, because she is a big Kidman fan, and she also loves Jude Law. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the law, it took me a lot of time and a huge amount of removal from the faith, believe its southern accent. I can't help but wonder if they didn’t make his character less talkative on purpose, so we don’t have to hear this haggard accent so much. <br /> <br /> As for the film, it took a long time for it to become interesting (about 1 or 1.5 hours), and then failed in its end. What was interesting was that I did not know that this film was made by Minghella. After about 40 minutes of the film, I asked my wife: “Will this not be another English patient?” This is absolutely true. <br /> <br /> With regard to the battle scenes. I try to come up with a word to describe the initial scene of the battle, but I think that the most descriptive word that accurately describes it is simply “stupid.” It was forced, it was unbelievable, it was stupid, and it was stupid. (After the battle, I looked at my wife and asked: “Is this just nonsense?”, To which she vigorously nodded her head. <br /> <br /> The only highlight in the film was Zellweger's performance. The role was a bit more decent than any decent comedy role, but it worked. From her speech pattern, her walk, her mannerisms and especially. her little jokes (my favorite: “If you want to rise 3 feet above the bull’s ass, all you have to do is listen to how the beloved are talking to each other”) work is very good. <br /> <br /> I just didn’t like this film, and I have to wonder what people say they like it (or the English patient for that matter). I suspect that you could classify them into one category: 1) soap opera fans
