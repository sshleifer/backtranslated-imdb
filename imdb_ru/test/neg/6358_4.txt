* Spoilers - sorry! * The first word that came to mind when watching a movie was Gremlins. This is the only film about the creature, which I saw from four films, but I liked it. It was not too difficult, since I had not seen the last two, but I still thought it was a pretty good movie. <br /> <br /> Critters start by saying that a man, his son and daughter stop on their way to vacation (although it turns out that they end up in their own home - that I have no idea what the hell happened) The girl is dating a boy (played by Leo DiCaprio), and they hang out in the nearby forest. They meet this strange guy who tells them to be careful and all that because of the creatures. He looks a bit mentally ill, and if I were in such a situation, I would not talk to him. The creatures steal the car of a girl and a boy and end up in their apartment. They hide in the basement and kill this lazy jerk. Then they almost killed this fat woman and girl's dad. They are pursued higher and higher in the apartment until they hide in the attic. The creatures eat something in the kitchen (faking scenes from the kitchen of the tremblies ???!) And I can't remember (not a good thing), but I'm sure they should come back for someone / someone. In any case, they end up leaving and rescuing. The psychotic returns, and before he kills the last two critters, he is told that he cannot, because they are in danger of disappearing, and therefore he sends them home. <br /> <br /> The ending was disappointing, and it annoyed me that only a lazy guy died, since there were a lot of annoying characters that I personally would have killed. This is an exciting, exciting movie that is worth watching. But, if you are looking for the best version of this genre, I recommend films with gremlins. Sorry!
