The girl in the alley of lovers: 3 out of 10: homoerotic overtones in films are a well-known phenomenon. Numerous dissertations have appeared in film schools about hidden implications of films such as Top Gun and Spartacus. The girl in the Lover's Alley, of course, is coming to the homoerotic path. In fact, it is so blatant that even MST3K, which rarely notices such things in its riff, simply cannot avoid it. <br /> <br /> The film tells about two drifters. One rich child (Lowell Brown) runs away with a hundred dollars and no street minds, the other a professional tramp (Brett Halsey). A tramp rescues a child from a gang of thugs, and they end up in a small town consisting of a snack bar, a billiard hall and a brothel. Our tramp scientist gets a second look from a diner waitress (Joyce Meadows as the title "Girls at Lavers Lane"), who clearly passed through the age of fastidiousness and whose only other perspective is the creepy Jack Elam, who impresses Steve Buscemi. <br /> <br /> At first glance, this looks like a strange film for treating MST3K. While the cast for the characters they play is quite old, the acting is actually quite good, and Brett Halsey and Jack Elam give solid performances. The story is not long, but the material “Robot vs. Aztec mummy” and production values ​​are hardly cheap, but relatively competent. <br /> <br /> Strange Batman and his homosexual charges make this movie both awful and fun. Hulsey's excessive objection regarding the fact that children are trying to get into a brothel is ridiculous, his inability to obey the waitress (or at least go through first base) speaks volumes, and dozens of views between him and the child; hand on the shoulder, sleeping places, dating the girl so that he and the child can shave each other. You do not need to be Freud to understand this underwater current.
