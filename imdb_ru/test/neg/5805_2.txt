Positively funny movie. <br /> <br /> If Doris Roberts, Shirley Jones and Shirley Knight continue to make films like this, they can apply for retirement and get full-time social security. <br /> <br /> Although the idea that a 35-year-old swinger who works on video games loses his apartment and has to move to Grandma Roberts and borders Jones and Knight, itâ€™s silly to fight. Imagine that 3 bags stuff things that a grandson Alex left at home, and Jones goes to bed with someone who can be considered her grandson! <br /> <br /> The sequence of video games is as stupid as everyone else. film. The range of characters Alex is working with is incredible, as he loves his weed along with the rest. <br /> <br /> This pitiful movie is desperately best described.
