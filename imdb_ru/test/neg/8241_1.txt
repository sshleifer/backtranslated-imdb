Sorry, I could not disagree with the latest comments. Honestly, I thought it was worse than Kerry on Columbus, enough said. The last film for THE usually brilliant Charles Hartree, which seemed out of place, because the humor moved to a very witty level on buses, whose films were being made at the same time, was frankly funnier. Barbara Windsor was embarrassing, a character like one of your flirtatious girlfriends who still think sheâ€™s eighteen, on vacation with some non-Scottish creature Slave Nesbit, which he is not. The series miraculously intertwined with things like Carry on Behind and Carry on England. It was not bad to continue Dick, but in fact with this movie the end of the series was close, sorry, because before this movie I could not remember a bad movie before that?
