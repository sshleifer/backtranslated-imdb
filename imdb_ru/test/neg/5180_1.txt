"R" was established for sexual content, including naked body and vicious dialogue, language, a rude sense of humor and drug use. film, although it would be useful to know whether it is possible to remove it as an opportunity at all, I, as a reviewer, would rule out such an opportunity. This is a film in which just 1 is not equal to the number, since it does not qualify as a film to be counted, in fact, such as this goal, with this film, therefore such a goal should be with this film in general. This is an undesirable and undesirable sentence that should have been received by a much more rigorous interpretation, because in no case is the behavior or language suitable for viewing, and this type of film may require a blacklist, rather than a stricter definition of its content. It is hereby proposed that a stricter definition would thus make a criminal charge. way regardless of his rating. This is a dubious world that can harm any person viewing this film, as its goal is to commit a crime. This is a crime, and it is offensive in its purpose. There is no sense of humor in the film, but a depraved and indifferent goal in relation to its undesirable basis. Without reservation, this list is not visible and may not be absolutely necessary to tell an adult who counts, but those whose interests relate to the environment in which children grow up are not allowed and do not allow any young person to watch this film is unfriendly . The public often sends the wrong message when problems of this kind are made public, and may not be one of those cases.
