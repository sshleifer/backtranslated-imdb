Dude, this movie sucks. It seemed that at the same time there are seven different plots, and all of them mean almost nothing. Special effects, costumes and all that was beyond horror. The game was especially bad. Everything seemed so intrusive, especially the lines from a woman with huge eyes and a small child (his “Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooet” is so unpersuasive that it’s funny). A good part of this movie is pretty funny anyway. The death of one woman, when she puts a knife into a toaster, gets an electric shock and magically turns into the most stupid skeleton dummy in the world, made my friends and me laugh for a full ten minutes. If you like to watch really terrible movies, look for it. If not, run after your life.
