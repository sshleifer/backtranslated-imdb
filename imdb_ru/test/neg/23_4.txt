When people say that children are annoying, you think that my little cousins ​​can be annoying, and I said SMALL. These children are 10 years old, and they are without doubt the most annoying, stupid children you have ever met (in the film). Let's start with the blonde - Debbie - she is a slut from a girl, I mean, she is wearing a mini-skirt, she has dull curly blond hair and a freckled red rabbit, like a face. She acts so innocently. Then we have a second child - a geek who thinks he is so cool, with his long-range shooting and use of a silencer (a coat over a gun), and, above all, his wicked, dull smile. The next child is a quiet one that you do not care about, that's all. This film angered me in childish intelligence, and the only pleasure I received was from my cousin, who continued to whine about them.
