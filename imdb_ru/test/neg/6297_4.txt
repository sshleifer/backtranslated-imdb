Mostly road movie. Topics about gays, transsexuals, and other gender issues are troubling, especially when it comes to the child. You should pass it on to costume designers. As for the actors, the only one I knew was Terence Stamp. I think it was a very good performance, outside of its (or someone else's) normal range. The film as a whole was shallow, just a means for intelligent, bitchy banter. In general, I do not recommend this.
