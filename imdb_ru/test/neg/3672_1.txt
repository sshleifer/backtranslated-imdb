If you like to sit in the dark, literally and figuratively, for ninety minutes, then this film is for you. <br /> <br /> Loss of actors, resources and audience time. Ultimately a waste of space. Resist the temptation to resume. There is nothing more substantial than this. The film lacks all the basics that can be expected from the genre; plot, character, development, denouement. The cast may be inspired by the knowledge that in this case their efforts will be completely forgotten and their careers may improve over time. <br /> <br /> Absolute deception.
