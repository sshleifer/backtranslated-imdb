Now 2008, which really worries in the world such a guy like D. B. Sweeney, even then he wasn’t that big. <br /> <br /> “Two tickets to paradise” is a well thought out story. true, when the three friends go on a journey under each of their personal circumstances. Again the proven plot. The problem with this film, besides the fact that it is “so bad that it is convincing,” is in the script. <br /> <br /> Cliche, after the cliché, three guys do what you saw in any other road movie ... and blow up the House of White Bath. <br /> <br /> John S. McGinley's acting work is great, especially when compared to the work of the late D. B. Sweeney. (His career is dead, so it's late. Although I heard that he is going to television, good for him). In addition, John S. probably has the least awful character in the film. <br /> <br /> The score is so general that in fact you feel that you are watching the third film from the 1993 film or the Jeff Anderson film Now You Know (also threw me back a few years, but at least At least it was more exciting.) I mean, yes, I think I liked parts of it. But, the annoying guy is annoying, DB is trying to be this cool unlucky guitar player (with some rough influences, such as some of the worst in classic rock), who has some weird relationship with a stripper, and John C is a player whose wife and child left him after the death of his father, and also to visit one of his minions. <br /> <br /> I always think about how to make this movie better. But I think recording a script would be a good start. <br /> <br /> But, as I said, this is not the worst movie ever. And any chance that I have to see McGinley in the lead role, I will take advantage of it. Hopefully he will start getting better projects.
