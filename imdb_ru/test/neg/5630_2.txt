The Riddle was written and directed by Brendan Fowley in an attempt to make the riddles of Charles Dickens novels a modern story, but this attempt fails because of the choice of using two periods of the time format in which the Riddle is solved. Despite the fact that the actors of famous actors are trying their best to make this film directly on DVD, the final product is a long, tiring, amateur mess that can only be considered as entertainment if viewers are fans of the cast, as others remember. films. <br /> <br /> Mike Sullivan (Vinnie Jones) is a journalist limited to reporting on dog racing while he is dreaming about important reportage tasks. Mike's old friend Sadie (Vera Dey), who runs a pub on the banks of the Thames, just discovered an old valuable unpublished manuscript by Charles Dickens, and has a heart of gold that gives sandwiches with such miserable creatures as the old hobo-tramp (a Derek Jacobi). Sadie’s murder draws Mike to the role of detective journalism, and with the help of the police officer Kate (Julie Cox), he begins to link the investigation with the evidence that he finds while reading Dickens’s manuscript. Disrupting the flow of this rather simplistic story is the use of the memories of Dickens’s time, since Dickens (again Derek Jacobi) tells a rather personal story about peculiar murders. The parallel between stories and cross-casting between actors may have worked in the hands of others, but this kind of fiasco avoids writer / director Brendan Fowley. He finishes his story (finally) with a weary Hollywood finale. <br /> <br /> In addition to Jones, Jacobi, Cox and Day, the film somehow caught the attention of Vanessa Redgrave, Jason Fleming, P.H. Moriarty and Mel Smith: their contribution is minimal, but it distracts happily. This is a fragile molasses, which makes the viewer think about how films of this quality ever find funding.
