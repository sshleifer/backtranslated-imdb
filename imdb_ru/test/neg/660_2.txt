Porn legend Gregory Dark directs this trashy horror film that Glen Jacobs has (Kane from WWF / WWE / whatever she calls herself at the moment) in his cinematic debut. He plays Jacob Goodknight, a blind serial killer who just throws people's eyes. The plot, however, contains a group of restless young people who are cleaning up the historic hotel where GoodKnight lives, and he later deceives him. Hammingway is not. It starts as a funny crazy B-movie, but soon becomes too tedious to be fun. I am glad that I entered with rather low expectations, but even those did not meet. How can you have a king directing porn and still suffer from lack of nudity ??? ashamed. <br /> <br /> My rating: D- <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Samantha Noble briefly bares her ass
