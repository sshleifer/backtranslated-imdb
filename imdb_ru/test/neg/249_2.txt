I'm a big fan of horrible horror, cheap horror, b movies and all these 100 movies, and I don’t deny that these are the worst things ever on the big screen, or even home videos. Some of them, such as the infamous Manos Hands of Destiny, are really bad, and watching them, especially without friends and beer, is torture for good movie taste. <br /> <br /> La Momia Azteca Contra El Roboto Humano, however, was not so bad. Well, of course, this is BAD - this is stupid, outdated, trite, cheap, and so on. There are the Aztec mummy, the tin robot, the masked villain, the mad scientist, the Mexican gangsters, and so on. , the lines are not theatrical, FX and SFX are the best of what Mexican low-budget products could offer, etc., etc. However, the film is ridiculous. it is so bad that makes you have fun laughing for an hour. Of course, it depends on a sense of humor, but I am sure that La Momia should teach all newcomers to this kind of movie how to enjoy it. Please note: the film lasts about an hour, and I think that is a rather stupid time that you can easily digest. <br /> <br /> There is one more thing - viewing La Momia can give you an idea of ​​what the concept of the SF / Horror genre was back in the 50s, if you compare it with the modern era of cinematic entertainment Matrix. I think it also shows how the industry and the audience have evolved, because such watches as La Momia still attract full house in cinemas for some special shows (films like this are especially good) and often get ovations. ,
