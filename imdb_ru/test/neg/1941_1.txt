Does anyone remember the first CKY, CKY2K, etc ..? Back when it came to creating crazy cool things, not about how Bam Margera behaves like a jerk, a spoiled 5-year-old super / rock star wannabe. <br /> <br /> The show was awesome, but Glory and wealth made him believe that now we enjoy being so childishly idiotic, more than just the cool things that were in the past. CKY2K. <br /> <br /> The actions are so repetitive, there is nothing new except annoying stupidity and rehearsed comments ... The only thing we see is Bam Margera, so busy showing how he doesn't care how much money he got that either. <br /> <br /> I really have nothing more to say except to return CKY2K to us, because Bam sucks. <br /> <br /> I like to watch Steve. Oh, Knoxville, etc., a thousand times more.
