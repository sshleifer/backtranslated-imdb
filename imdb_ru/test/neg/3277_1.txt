Although I agree that it was the worst movie I've ever done, I can proudly say that I have a copy simply because I and a group of my friends were extras (mostly in dance scenes club, but also in several others). I had the potential of this film with Bolo and the director of Join the Dragon, but as a person who was on the set almost every day, I can tell you that Robert Klaus was an old and confused person time to create this movie. Interestingly, he could find his way to the set every day. I would also like to think that this film could have been better if most of it had not been destroyed as a result of the fire in the studio of Morning Calm. I can not say that it was for sure, but it would be nice to think so. I was really surprised that he had ever been released, and that someone like Bolo would have attached his name to him without a fight. Oh, OK. Also look for add-ons for professional wrestler Scott Levy, AKA Raven. He was a wrestler in Portland at the time ... a good guy, very clever.
