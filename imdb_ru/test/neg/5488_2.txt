The story is this: the actor's troupe of the beginning of the century, together with the producers and owners of the theater, have very difficult relationships. Resident playwright wrote psychological drama. He wants to get a good performance on stage, but he cannot, unless he convinces the expert reviewer, to revise the production and give a positive review. If its production is not continued, the troupe will deliver the “Doll House”, recently written by Ibsen. Many different relationships between managers are studied; none of them is interesting. But the attraction of characters to each other leads to the fact that the play of the resident will play the second scene. <br /> <br /> This film is just an excuse for the director and his friends to get together and put on a film; The only reason I didn’t leave the theater in about half an hour was because the fat lady at the end of my row was resting on her full chest on her stomach.
