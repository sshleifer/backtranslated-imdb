The obvious contribution to * Insert a monster here * In a plane stunt, "Flight of the Living Dead" is what you expect. <br /> <br /> There is little or no plot in the film, as one would expect from a movie of this type. Although it is fun piecemeal, I have to say. Zombie action is especially interesting. As soon as the film begins, it never stops; The pace of stimulation. <br /> <br /> Practical effects are pretty good, but CGI is terrible and distracting. <br /> <br /> The ending seems to leave the film open to continue. Hopefully this will not be realized. <br /> <br /> If youâ€™re a dedicated zombie horror movie fan, I would recommend it to you; It is worth at least one hour. However, if you are just an avid fan of the genre, leave it on the shelf. <br /> <br /> 3/10
