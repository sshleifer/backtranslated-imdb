Look .. I really wanted to enjoy this movie. There were moments when my heart beat faster, when the hair on my neck began to rise, when my muscles began to tense ... but, like a striptease, I didn’t have any real actions, no permission, no money, my wallet missed. <br /> <br /> Jaume Balaghero and Miguel Tejada-Flores, apparently, do not know the correct recipe for creating a horror film and therefore used the method of the old amateur chef to throw everything into the pan. <br /> In this movie, The Shining, Poltergeist, Amityville, and Hellraiser are all in one. Amazingly, I know, but it's true. All the flavors are there, you can try every one of them, they just don't mix well. I'm not going to go down the list of all things wrong with this movie; In short, good cinematography, mediocre game, the worst dialogue. <br /> <br /> The real problem with the theft of multiple movie plots and combining them into one movie, with the exception of confusion, is that you CAN have multiple plots working at the same time, you cannot have multiple endings. And what does Jaume do when faced with this problem? Just as in English First-Year Student 101, you end your story with ellipses: “The little machine disappeared into darkness and ... THE END.” Not really. And very anti-climatic. The end left me confused and disappointed; Almost empty. <br /> <br /> Take your $ 10, rent the Shining, Poltergeist and Risen from Hell ... scare away your pants, have a great time and forget that Darkness has ever existed. <br /> <br /> -Bzhamin
