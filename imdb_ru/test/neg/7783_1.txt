I could not wait for the end. This is absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen. If you thought that anyone could make a movie to watch, these people would prove that a minimum set of skills is required. This is a film without any redemptive traits. This is a score of zero in each department. This is more than just an “amateur”, since attention and attention is not paid to the audience at all. There are no serious attempts to act or entertain. The plot line is aimless, senseless and senseless. Cast look very uncomfortable and totally lacking direction. The technical aspects of the film are scarce. <br /> <br /> Like a DVD, it turns into a coaster for good drinks.
