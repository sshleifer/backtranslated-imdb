This is NOT TOO bad, but ultimately it lacks the quality that is in the Australian TV series. <br /> <br /> Jokes are rare and far apart, the actors are attractive (should not be), the filmmakers think too much about cinema (it should look like a home video), and this is like a serious version of Kat and Kim . this is stupid. <br /> <br /> It's too normal to be Kat and Kim. It is assumed that Kat and Kim are two seductive middle-aged women who think they are hot and wear funny clothes. There is no "Look at me, Kimmy!" jokes Kim's fat girlfriend is anything but fat and not even slightly dumb. She is a stereotypical black / latino chick. <br /> <br /> This is not as stupid or ridiculous as an Australian TV series. It does not compare. Nothing like this. I admit that this show is quite funny from time to time, but this is not something like an Australian TV series. I waited with impatience for the Americans to take up the Bogan family. They failed. It should be really stupid and fun, but the actors don't behave stupidly! For me, this is just a typical American TV show. This is a disappointment if you want it to be something like an Australian show. <br /> <br /> 2 stars, because this is a normal show, just not like what it should be.
