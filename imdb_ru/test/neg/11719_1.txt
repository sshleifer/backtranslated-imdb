No blood, no blood, no happy scenes of death ... stupid, stupid, dumb, dumb. Dear God, sitting in this film, made me sick. Patients get sick, get sick. Very boring ... very boring ... <br /> <br /> Theres not even a humorous aspect of this film! I can't find anything good to say about it, except that the main guy had a good body ... I think. Definitely not worth the fifty cents I paid to rent it.
