What a stupid movie. Although it looks beautiful, it does not make much sense. On the one hand, the film suggests that Juana’s “insanity” was that she was just a woman ahead of her time. On the other hand, she has an obsession that is right from the worst Victorian novel about an offended woman, and it seems to be a kind of mental problem, like Miss Hevesh in the castle. This film is what Elizabeth could be if Elizabeth could not overcome the sexual attraction of Essex.
