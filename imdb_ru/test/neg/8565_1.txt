Well, firstly, sorry for the unfortunate pun in the title. I was looking for movies for hire the other day and saw this. I heard something about this, so I picked it up and looked at my back, and it had a little little review from John Fallon, also known as an arrow in my head! At that moment I thought, “Well, if he likes it, then I like it!” So ​​I rented it and only finally found the time to watch it last night (the college keeps me so busy). Yes, and I would like to add that I read a small part of the Aerrow review, and it turned out that out of 4 stars he gave her one and a half. So my expectations for this film have changed from very high to dubious. Well, after seeing this, I again agree with Aerrow (and it turned out that the quote from the review was the only positive thing he said about it!) Wow, did this film stink or how? Where to start, why so? Well, the film was so boring in my opinion. Even the cool bloody bits did not excite me, and when beheading does not bother you in the film, it is bad! Characters I hated, and from the very beginning I could tell who would die and who wouldn't. In fact, the film proved that I was wrong on some points, but the worst thing is that one particular character I wanted to die did not do this! What the heck? And the chemistry between the main girl and the guy she met? Did not feel it. He was obviously just a curious eye and gave her a love interest, otherwise I thought he was a waste of time! And, as a horror fan, I need to know that creating a “stupid horror movie” sometimes has to happen, otherwise there won't be a lot of film, but those that are present here annoy me! Hello? Why do you understand the room of a murderous nun when you should be on your guard from her? And it was made supposedly smarter than the characters, no less. Turn ... ah, it would be nice if it hadn’t been done a billion times, and I didn’t have to sit down this piece of the film to reach this point! My main idea: a stupid film that sucked the words of my favorite (actually, my only favorite) film critic to me. Shocks!
