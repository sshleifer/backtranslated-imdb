By the mid-1990s, the career of animation director Don Blout seemed to have dropped to a record low. Earlier, Blyut made a series of popular animated films, many of which are still loved, such as “Earth to Time” (1988), “The Secret of NIMH” (1982) and “American Tail” (1986). But since "Thumbelina" in 1994, his films seemed to be falling more and more in quality and popularity, and one of the many unsuccessful recordings is the 1995 box-office bomb Pebble and Penguin, a film that did not appeal to viewers. outside of parents and children under the age of seven. Honestly, the latter are the only members of the audience that I can understand, enjoying this rather soft animation function. <br /> <br /> History is absurd. The film stars a poorly drawn, stammering and plump penguin named Huby (voiced by Martin Short) who falls in love with a penguin woman with an amazingly healthy flower on her head (Annie Golden's voice). It seems like in real life, penguins give their brides a pebble instead of a ring. But when Hubi sweeps the stream, he teams up with the lonely rock hopper (James Belushi) with a dream of flying, and they rush over time to return to Antarctica before it is too late. The reasons they might be late are one of the many undeveloped elements of this weak story that would still be weak even if they were there. <br /> <br /> It becomes very early to see why this animated children's musical does not and will not work for those who are older, say, six or seven years old. He simply does not have the qualities necessary for good animation. First, the film looks bad because of a very bad drawing style. The animation in this film is very cartoony (even in animated films); it is dark, gloomy, there is no vibration in colors, and, moreover, the design of the film and the elements in it are universal and ridiculous. Take, for example, penguins, which are shot in the film. With only a few exceptions, each penguin is completely unlike a bird. For example, Hubi looks absurdly ridiculous with wide cheeks, a short beak, big eyes and a ridiculous hat that he wears everywhere he goes. In combination with his "flippers", like hands, he looks like Chris Farley in a penguin costume. Result: he is an ugly, poorly drawn cartoon character. But the most ridiculous looking and absurdly designed character is the evil Penguin Drake, who frankly does not look quite like a penguin. He is a muscular man in a penguin mask. His chest is wider than that of Arnold Schwarzenegger, and his teeth are larger than the teeth of leopard seals and killer whales, which serve as predators of the film. In fact, he is a two-dimensional, reworked villain. He lives in a cave in the shape of a skull, wears a raincoat, he laughs a lot and gets angry when people laugh at him. Result: who cares? And what else is bad, and maybe even worse, is that this is an animated musical, and there is not a single worthy mentioning or memorable song that can be found anywhere during its work. The opening anthem was harmless, not memorable, but harmless. But after that, the songs became duller and duller, and there was one that made me constantly frown. This is the moment when viewers press the fast forward button when it appears. <br /> <br /> I felt that “Pebble and Penguin” were reckless, except for those few moments when Huby and Penguin-Rockhopper Roco are threatened in the mouth of leopard seals and killer whales, which, fortunately, had dialogue and viewed as animals instead of cartoon characters. But in a sense for this reason I cannot sincerely recommend this film to children. This is the reason. The film shows killer whales, which are a natural predator of penguins. What worries me is that children familiar with Free Willie (1993) may be offended or upset upon seeing their favorite sea dweller, depicted as a bloodthirsty predator. The leopard seal was the best antagonist, and it was more fun to watch his jaws open wider than that of a rattlesnake, and how he seemed to be smiling, growling. But the fact is that these moments with predators, and there are only a few of them, are the only interesting moments. And they are not very interesting, mind you. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, I can't recommend this to anyone under seven years old. My advice: if you have children on this page, rent them for them. They may like it.
