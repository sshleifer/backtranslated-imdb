As a writing teacher, there are two ends that I will never allow my students to use: "Then I woke up" and "Then a truck moved me." Now I'm going to add: "Then I got a blow to the head." I feel that itâ€™s totally unfair to use these tricks to hide a lack of imagination. The whole question of relocation could be solved with the help of some intelligence and skill, but in this film they either could not or did not want to do it. I do not say that it is absolutely useless, but it is so predictable in its progress, with the exception of a silly end. There are even gangsters who go to the police to get help from this guy. They should have done it immediately. This is just a forgotten border sci-fi horror film, in which there is nothing new.
