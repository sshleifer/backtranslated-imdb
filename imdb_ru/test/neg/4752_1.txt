The production value of AvP2 can be described by one adjective: HORRIBLE <br /> <br /> The scenario is ridiculous, even in the fictional AvP field: why do you need facegers on the Predator ship? Why does the Predator remove all signs of its influence and waste precious time, wasting and even presenting the body of an insignificant human police officer? Why is the Predator alone? Why is the Predator arming only on the ground, but on its home planet? Why does the Predator make its work so uncomfortable for itself, tracking down the aliens, and not bombing the whole village, as people eventually do? Why the Predator throws more and more of its few weapons instead of collecting it in order to save it after using one. In the end, he even sheds his armor before fighting Predalien in hand-to-hand combat: what kind of plagiarism is the first predator in the final battle between Arnie and Predator. Predator's gestures are so exaggerated that he moves more like a Japanese sumo than like a highly skilled alien hunter. As you can see, the whole story is in disarray. But it gets worse because this spoiled work is filled with a dull patchwork of meaningless interruptions, such as a lengthy episode of ordering pizza or some detailed information about the criminal past of two brothers (Dallas and Ricky). The sheriff is, of course, a friend of these two criminals, whom he regularly puts behind bars. (not convincing and absolutely superfluous for the plot). <br /> <br /> Also, the cast is terrible. Compared to the high-class directors and actors of the former films “Aliens” or “Predator”, AvP2 is a terribly bad piece of crap. <br /> <br /> Finally the movie is really bad. There is no battle scene in which viewers can see the whole complex. Each battle is filmed in short and shaky bursts with close-ups in near total darkness. This leads to terrible impressions for the audience, because basically nothing is visible, except for a dark, quivering screen. <br /> <br /> I propose that two brothers-directors Strauss buy a stable camera and get a lesson in modern computer graphics so that the next film contains some visible actions of visible figures and may not need to disguise their bad directorial skills in this way. <br /> <br /> I wouldn’t advise anyone (even to dying AvP fans) to watch this movie: I prefer the first or original film “Aliens” or the original film “Predator”, but avoid disappointing yourself by spending your precious time on this fail
