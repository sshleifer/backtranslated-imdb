I could not believe how horrible and boring this Hollywood remake was. It's so awful. He easily falls into the list of my 10 best worst films of 1998. The only thing he did was Bruce Willis, who should stick to the militants, like an absolutely unfeeling killer who would kill his own mother for the right price. But I'd rather listen to Robbie Coltrane speak American a whole week than listens to Richard Gere's sickening Irish accent. But this film is also implausible, unconvincing, uneven, uninteresting, unimpressive and puts Sidney Poiter in the trash role to make a possible career return. One for film-footie purposes completely.
