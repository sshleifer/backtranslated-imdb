Aliens will lose a giant monster named Zarcorr, and then send a hologram, which looks like an ordinary stupid teenage girl, to tell postman Tommy Ward (Rice Pugh, in the only movie you saw him) that was chosen for the fight. In addition, if he loses the plant, he is doomed, and he will go to battle with Zarcorr the Invader! This film is bad, very bad. So bad you need negative numbers just to give it a rattan. Badly written, bad direction, much lower than the Power Rangers because of the incredible wooden game that you simply crave for the hordes of lumberjacks to come out of nowhere and cut them down! And don't make me start the theme of the song at the end. People who made this markup for S $ @ # should not be loud next to the camera or something related to movies. Zarkorr is a cool looking monster who should have been a million times better in this movie than this one. Do yourself a favor and donâ€™t watch this movie, it's 80 or so a minute of life. Actors who have never worked in this, by the way. <br /> <br /> 3/10
