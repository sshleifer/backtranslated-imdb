I bought this movie on sale in the garage when I was about 15 years old. I hated him then, and watched him again, damn it, now it’s even worse. You can hear the director and background camera scream out commands such as "Zoom, zoom, zoom !!!". No special effects, just a piece of meat, which should be the brain. This is complete nonsense, and I initially thought it was a one-of-a-kind home movie or something I bought. But it was spread elsewhere, and it’s just strange to know that other people saw it. Unfortunately, I need 10 lines ... well ... it may be interesting to see to see how low-cost films were made before the invention of digital cameras. It sucks. In fact, yes, look it just to see if you can survive the worst. If you can do it through this, you can do it through something.
