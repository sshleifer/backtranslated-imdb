A funny thriller in which a group of students kidnapped their bad and neurotic teacher (Mirren) just to prevent her from acting against them. An interesting premise could make a good movie, but this one just sucks and contrived. Bored with ending awkwardly, at least. Mrs. Mirren is trying to give some kind of dignity to this gap, but even she, a good actress, can no doubt save this garbage. I give it 4 (four).
