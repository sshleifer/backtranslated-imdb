I have to say this, this is the first film that I am reviewing here, I have not finished watching. I mean ... I CAN'T CONTINUE! Regardless of how adamant I am that I watch things until the very end, “The Ballad of a Sad Cafe” will not suit this viewer. Vanessa Redgrave stars as the Strange Woman in the City, which it does things like a walk on the river with a full set of clothes. In any case, a long-time relative came to visit, he is a dwarf and ... well, this is as far as I understood. What the hell was the point of all this “I didn’t even bother to wait for Michael Carradine to appear, since I was already reckless because of the combination of a slow script And the need to deal with a dwarf in a dramatic role. I call this coffee table a movie. a movie that appeals to only a few of you, and the rest just stand aside.
