When I write this in November 2005, I realize that the great British cinema boom has come to an end, and although people will argue that much of this depends on the fact that the British government does not give tax breaks for filmmakers, I think the reason this is very big. Easier - the lack of diversity on the part of manufacturers over the past few years. Let's see what the British produced in 1995-2005: <br /> <br /> Cool gangster thrillers. “LOCK STOCK” and “TWO SMOKING BARRALS” were a truly great and exciting film, and people tried their best to imitate Guy Ritchie’s style with usually disappointing results. <br /> <br /> Romantic comedies. Yes, well, I understand that FOUR WEDDINGS, NOTTING HILL, etc. Were produced by American studios, but they still vaguely "British films." Unfortunately, because they are guaranteed to make a profit for the studios, they have to follow the winning formula, which usually involved Hugh Grant, who plays Hugh Grant for the hundredth time <br /> <br /> Black Comedies. Can anyone explain what a black comedy is? In the British context, this is usually a disjointed film, in which modern political statements are often made, and which often resembles “OBSESSED” by Mike Lee “Beautiful People” by Jasmin Disdard. This is a good example of the third type of British film. Filmed in 1999, but set in 1993, it starts with two men who quarrel on the bus, and later it turns out that one is a Serb and the other is a Croat, so we get a brief summary of what was happening in the Balkans at that time , although the chances of two former enemies in the Balkans crashing into each other on a London bus? This sums up one of the main shortcomings of the film - Irony takes precedence over likely situations, you can appreciate the final irony of the plots, but is the result likely? Perhaps the greatest irony is the name of the film. This is called BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, but, of course, this viewer considered them ordinary stereotypical people whom I could not believe as three-dimensional characters.
