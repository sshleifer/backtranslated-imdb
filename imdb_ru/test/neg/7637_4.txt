This could be a breakthrough role for Valeria Golino, but instead the film decided to shift its focus to another area. The film is about a woman named Grace (Golino), who is married to a fisherman and a mother of three children. She is free-spirited and prone to outbreaks, so the rest of the village and her family decide that she should be sent to Milan and see a doctor. The story takes place on the island of Lampedusa in Sicily and shows everyday life where teenage boys compete in gangs and are just trying to find something that can be done on a sun-baked rock. The eldest son of Gracia Pasquale (Francesco Casis) loves her and always tries to protect her during bouts of depression. The daughter of Marinella (Veronica D'Agostino) is a blooming young girl who falls in love with the local policeman, and the younger son Filippo (Filippo Puchillo) is very sassy and mocks the police accent. Upon learning that she will be sent to Milan, Gracia runs away, and Pasquale helps her, hiding her in a cave while everyone is looking for her. This film could really have a bigger impact if it focused on Grace. We see some flashes and irrational behavior on her part, but they do not follow these scenes. None of this works. The film looks great and beautifully photographed, so pay tribute to director Emanuele Crialese, but the story should have focused on something more substantial. The film shows us well what life is like on this island and what happens in the lives of three children when they grow up. There are some suggestions that the character Golino gives a hint at being a creature that looks like a mermaid, and therefore it is difficult for her to exist on land. I also feel that the island itself expects its inhabitants to behave in a certain way, and if you donâ€™t, you can be subject to the harsh realities of its rules. All assumptions, but I think that the attention of the films could remain for the character of Gracia. After she hides in a cave, she really has nothing to do. In a sense, the character becomes stagnant. I would like Golino to have more business, because I always liked her, and when she is on the screen, you just can't take your eyes off her. She is a bunch of rage, passion and raw energy! What a shame that Crialese did not write a more complete role for her to play the role. When the movie ends, you feel empty of the unfinished story.
