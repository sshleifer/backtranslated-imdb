I was surprised by the enthusiastic response to this film. It seemed to me boring, as if I did not like to look at Penelope Cruz, and the plot details are often poorly worked out. It also looked like a strongly sexist film: if the gender roles were reversed, almost everyone who had some meaning would be outraged when they complained that the film was a strong woman hater. It’s not only that both top men are portrayed as complete assholes and sexual predators, but also that women are portrayed as almost flawless, forming a utopian community that lacks conflict of any kind and which is based on unflagging generosity and good humor. . Utopias, as we know, are boring, and this, it turns out, is no exception. But it is also interesting to notice what is happening (and here the plot is being distributed, although this refers to a very early scene) when a teenage daughter kills her father. (1) her mother is in a hurry to take responsibility for this, and (2) her daughter seems to have little remorse (and in fact her emotional life then disappears from the film). This is not exactly a glorified murder, although Aldomovar's camera is bloodthirsty lingering on blood, as if she is making an attractive picture, and then she is soaked and hidden from sight, not bloody, nor daughter, nor mother, either materially or emotionally. Later in the film it is about a new murder, again a woman of a man, and again this is a murder, which the film indirectly confirms. In short, Volver is an ideologically motivated film with an unpleasant and in fact disgusting ideology, and therefore I am writing ideological criticism. But other than that, it's just not very interesting. There is not a single depth in it, say, Aldomovar “Talk to her”, which I loved.
