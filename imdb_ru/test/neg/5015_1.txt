If someone wants a character in a movie to have a disturbing sexual encounter that would disgrace that character in later life, the only thing left that the public would consider shameful is this atrocity, and now it has been done. Judging by some other comments, even this did not succeed. I can't remember one funny scene, although I have to admit, I had to turn it off before it was finished. I looked at the directorâ€™s commentary part, and he seemed surprised just like everyone else, that the film was going well. If you want to feel the same thing as in this film, but only cheaper, stick your head in a pile of manure and breathe deeply.
