I can not believe that there are people who voted for 10 for this garbage! Have any of you got access to a computer in a lunatic asylum, where you undoubtedly were kept, or is there a special colony, where particularly stupid people are secretly confined that I don't know about? <br /> <br /> If I were to say that I was really thinking about this film, none of them would be published. <br /> <br /> To begin with, his “star” is an idiot without talent, who acts as a bad imitator of Jim Carrey, who has worn his nose enough to recall the Sahara desert. His name will be a full guarantee that I will not watch the film of the future with him, even if he plays rock, hidden by the crowd. <br /> <br /> As for the “plot”. Another crime that we can attribute to the Nazis is that they were so terrible that they can be considered fair game as “villains” in such a joke; ordinary criminals and murderers will have an audience on their side in a jiffy. <br /> <br /> To the people who made this film - stop making films, and if not, limit yourself to advertising, where your efforts will be at least because you are fleeting in time. <br /> <br /> Finally, IMDB criticism - Why do you not have the opportunity to vote for the film "Zero"? Or perhaps not. To express my contempt for this prank, I would have to vote for double zero or something like that.
