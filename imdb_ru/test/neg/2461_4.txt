I think this is the same pretentious film that a shallow director could have made, like Joel Schumacher. A group of medical students takes turns dying for a few minutes; upon awakening, they discover that their sins somehow manifested themselves. Since some characters are visited by dead people, and some are guilty of their guilty conscience, itâ€™s not entirely clear what the connection is, but the visions do seem like sixth-grade feature films. Why students perceive their experiment as some kind of a great journey that will make them famous is a bit mysterious, because the results are completely unprovable and, as mentioned in the film several times, have been documented many times before. Nevertheless, it's nice to see Schumacher training on his Batman wrecks with a bit of old neon paint and colored light bulbs. And William Baldwin is a blackboard.
