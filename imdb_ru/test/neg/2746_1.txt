I love basketball, and it seemed like an intriguing movie. However, in the first ten minutes of the movie, I knew it would be lousy. It was bad and too slow. In addition, he was very, very racist, sexist, anti-Semitic and homophobic. Sometimes insertion into racial, ethnic, and other types of unsharpness makes sense, illustrating existing fanaticism. In this film, there was no point in terrible fanaticism, and no one learned from what was said. Part of the problem is that it was an adaptation of the 1982 play and a remake of the 1950s basketball team. If this film had gone before, it would have made a little more sense. It was poorly translated into the modern era, and the letter was terrible. I do not know how the play was originally written, but I cannot believe that any film, as bad and hateful as this one, got on television and video in 1999. It was disgusting. Do not waste your precious time on this.
