This is just another bad movie of Chuck Norris. Norris plays a policeman on the trail of a tangled female serial killer. He removed the guy three years ago, but he somehow sneaks through the grating in the nuthouse where he is, using what looks like dental floss. Then the killer runs away in a cleaning van and drives through a 400-foot cliff and survives to spend time in a theater undergoing renovation. Irish Jack O'Halloran is the best thing in this film, but, as in Superman II, he doesn't say a word. Somehow this should make it more threatening. Ron O'Neill of Super Fly fame and Steve James wasted playing mayor of the city and assistant Norris respectively. The film also contains the idiotic storyline of Norris and his girlfriend, who has an illegitimate child; this is so 1980s. Combining Norris's "serious" actor's turn with incredible musical cues, foreshadowing each upcoming scene in a predictable way, the film becomes a chore to survive. The build-up during the search for the killer in the theater is interesting enough, as Norris crawls across the shadows to find cover, but the end of the fight is disappointing, starting in such a promising way. This is another disappointment from Cannon Films, and it plays like a film made for television. * of 4 stars.
