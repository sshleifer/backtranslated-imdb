This film, of course, strange, if not more. The main plot - 3 old business partners invite 2 strangers to their home in order to return a lost wallet with 10 dollars in it. The two who appear fall in love. 3 older business people die and return as ghosts to try and help the two younger guests. Well, that might make sense, but then we have 3 old guys who apparently have some bread living together ... a little weird here ... Harry Carey plays a role far from the base, you can't say whether he is a good guy or really prick. I mean, really decide, I can handle this. Then there is Richard Carlson, who plays James Houston from Texas ... hmmm, he sounds more like a southern gentleman from Kentucky than a man from Texas. It's not even close ... Then we will take 3 ghosts who will have more chances to help the New Orleans win the game in the playoffs than to really help ... In fact, they donâ€™t help at all and why they even go beyond the film framework of any knowledge .. Stupid film, in which the cast of characters acts completely out of character .. This can be avoided ..
