I had to watch this movie in a movie lesson, I suffered all the time. I am not Asian, but still very offended by this film. The basis of the film is racism, all minorities (Rex Harrison is not even Asian!) Are depicted in a limited way. Banning the film in Thailand illustrates the degree of inaccuracy and subjective image of Asians. In addition, critical attention was paid to the biography of Anna. Many critics say that Anna has added many fictional events to her story in order to project herself well. Some critics of the film and biographies even stated that Anna made up the whole story. A terrible film, but good for discussing BioPics as a form of meta-narrative fiction, not a science fiction work.
