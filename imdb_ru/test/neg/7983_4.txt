In "Recklessness" there is not so much that seems right, starting with the repulsive title (thanks to screenwriter Craig Lucas, who adapted his play, taking the title with him) and continuing the casting (Mia Farrow plays wife Tony Goldwin, who is young enough to be her son). The couple lives in an idyllic winter world that seems to be inside a snow globe, but Farrow gets a startling dose of reality after he admits that he hired a man to kill her. She runs into the night, taking refuge with a very strange couple who wants to help her restore her life. The artistic design and artistic guidance of the "Reckless" are good, but these are services provided for a completely meaningless, often repulsive script. It is assumed that this is a dark holiday comedy, although the actors are at a loss with this unfunny, sometimes offensive material. * 1/2 of ****
