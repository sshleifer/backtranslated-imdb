The plot of this comes down to the fact that A-nuold is against Satan, and what I remember most about the film is a multitude of explosions, shooting, blood, noise, and let's not forget this flammable satanic urine. This story is meaningless, completely predictable and so full of holes that I could not take it seriously. Stick to Rosemary Babe or Exorcist if you want to watch a really good movie with the devil and ... well, well, at the moment I can't remember a single good action movie (probably because they are so far away and so little) so you yourself are in this category. This film receives a rating of 3 out of 10 from me for its value to the camp and for the rather good performance of Gabriel Byrne in the role of the old debilbate of Satan!
