Since then, two things have changed. Firstly, I am no longer a child, and secondly, most of the new Seagal films are just awful. In my opinion, this is the worst film ever made with “Releases”, in which Jean-Claude Van Damme starred. the plot in this film, the plot is just a reason to shoot horrible action films that look painful. I love action movies, but this is not an action movie .... This is not a movie ... this is a group of annoying scenes that are connected in an annoying way to kill the viewers love for action movies. Sorry, but I have no respect for anyone who liked this movie. He has serious intellectual problems. I hope that in the future, Seagal will make some new good films. Good luck to him!
