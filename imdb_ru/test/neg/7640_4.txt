The synopsis of this film made me believe that it would be a story about an unconventional woman who challenges the customs of the society with which she lives. I like strong female characters, and I expected the movie to be similar to “Chocolat,” with fewer tales and more bites. I got a bunch of nasty characters. <br /> <br /> For a movie based on characters to be effective, I need to feel connected or compassionate towards people. There was no one in the film with whom I could communicate. Grace (Golino, whose work I admired in The Rain Man) portrays a mentally ill, probably bipolar woman, who is often rude, aggressive, and cruel. The husband quarrels and screams when he does not hit anyone and does not hit him. Kids are rude kids. They shout at each other and the women in the film. They attack other children without provocation. Violence begets violence. It seems to be an island of insensitive, aggressive, cruel and rude people. <br /> <br /> The direction is not convincing. There are mixed scenes that try to be art, but instead bore the viewer. The place is exceptionally gorgeous, but even this cannot be captured to such an extent that it can be on film. <br /> <br /> I would recommend you stay away from this failure of the film.
