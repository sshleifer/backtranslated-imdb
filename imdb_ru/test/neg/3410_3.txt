Being a fan of science fiction from early childhood (long ago), I always hated improbable plots. It is a pity that most of the authors of science fiction stories for children do not show this kind of respect for their audience. I always suspected that they think: “children should strive for awareness, therefore we do not need to strive”. The author of "Science Fiction (2002)" is no exception. The story of a boy whom his new friends incite to spy on their parents, because they think that parents are aliens. As an intriguing idea sounded for me, so I was bored with its implementation. It seemed to me that the filmmakers had this very idea and tried to stretch it for ninety minutes, immersing it in a dark, stylish and painstakingly slow atmosphere. The only thing that kept me in its place was the question: “How do they manage to get out of this improbable garbage”? And then - bang - they did not even try. Therefore, if you are looking for good entertainment for both children and parents, take a look at Klatretøsen (2002) instead.
