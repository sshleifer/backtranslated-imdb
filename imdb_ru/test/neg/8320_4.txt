Brave seems to indicate that the main character is brave, of course. I would not agree. A more daring thing that can be done in a situation like the one that happens to her - a brutal beating with her bride, who does not live a single day from her, is to pursue criminals without resorting to a full distorted view of society. Jodie Foster's character, Erika, is a radio face who walks the streets and records what is happening. We are not given any real depth, except that “she had someone she loved, he died, the police did not pursue him, she had a pistol, poison-poison-poison, she was little, but not really connected with the lead detective in the character, and so left with something that remains of past films: a vigilant code of justice where taking power into your own hands is all there is. But we can never be sure that Erika is normal or not, if filmmakers somehow take the position (that is, to the end, what a stupid message is, in any case, with a dog, considered an authoritative metaphor), making Today's New York, which became much safer than, say, twenty years ago, it looks as if you will be cut with a knife or beaten if you go down the right lane or just sit in the subway car. <br /> <br /> Amidst all this, there may even be a slightly better film - perhaps only in a disgruntled plot with detective Terence Howard, who is involved in some kind of guardianship battle with the child, not him, and the woman he does not have with my stepfather, who, I don't know, except owning parking lots and a bad dude, but we leave behind us a script that is clumsy and unrelated to logic. For example, it becomes ridiculous to see that the logical side at first is that Erika is not able to really shoot properly, as can be seen from her first shooting in a store at a convenient moment when her husband robbed her wife, and then yielding to her nonsensical shooting at a pimp. which crashed into her head, killed him and dived just in time to not move. It does not help that Jordon’s style with a camera becomes a little more than unbearable: it is called a speed camera for * reason *, and not because it can weave in and out. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the script and the direction become very good, or rather, work best under the desired circumstances: when looking at the real scene of beatings under the bridge caught between a videotape by one of the criminals with an ordinary movie camera in tempo, which is completely disorienting. And when Erica first returns to the radio on her radio show, and she freezes, trying to make her old joke, and speaks "heartily" about how she fears this scene, from Foster's speech, to a clear direction and script, the best scene in film. But, besides this, in psychological psychology there is a lot of posturing: is she De Niro in Taxi Driver or Bronson in Deadly Desire? We have her storytelling about the scenes, some of them have nothing to do with her radio show, watching how disgusting she is to walk at night, doing nothing but her voluntary work of cleaning the streets. But unlike Death Wish, a film that was more ambiguous and never gave an answer at the end of the revenge scenario, the path of endless violence just listens to the message, which will not be news to those who have seen the second Lifetime melodrama of the film of the week. <br /> <br /> Actors cope with what is given, and in the end it becomes much more unpleasant, trying to stay with the expected, the beaten plot unfolds, and the good old inexplicable (plus unintentionally hilarious, like a few curses, shouted Howard after being shot in one scene), and the temptation to leave is getting stronger and stronger. This is a very problematic picture, with several moments of genuine interest and a clear bend of the convention.
