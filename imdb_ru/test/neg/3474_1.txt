Perhaps we are too attached to the great spectacles when we hear about antiquity presented on the screen. Perhaps we expect too much from these films. However, if we, the viewers, are offered too little, what will happen? <br /> <br /> I thought about this when I saw the EMPIRE - Nero Paul Marcus, part of the production series about the Roman Empire. In the film “Augustus” by Roger Young, the first film “IMPERIUM”, at least Peter O'Toole appears, but what of this film? <br /> <br /> Hardly accurate. Historical errors are so serious that the film changes the facts and represents a rather distorted image of the Roman Empire than the true story. Throughout the film, we see Nero young: a young man during the supposedly long reign of Caligula, a young man during the reign of Claudius and, finally, during his own (historically 14-year-old) reign. And ... he dies the same way. According to the film, Nero, who was born during the reign of Tiberius, has been living for more than 40 years, but it seems that he is already over twenty when he dies ... Continuity combined with a made-up story is the biggest problem of the film, which makes it hardly logical. if not to say reliably. Nero loses his father, brought up by slaves. At that time, his mother, Agrippina, was expelled by Caligula. Later, however, she unexpectedly marries Emperor Claudius, who already has big children with Messalina, who recently married him. In these moments of the film we see Akta (Rike Schmid), Nero's mistress. Well, it is historically "accurate"; nevertheless, not a single source proves that it played such a decisive role in the formation of Christianity in Rome. In the film, she is not only a devoted Christian, but even a witness to the miracle of St. Paul (he brings back the young girl Marcia to life). In addition, historically nothing like Nero could be seen in the courtyard of Caligula, since Nero was born in the 4-year reign of Caligula (AD 37-41). I understand that movies can change something, but such an error makes the script absolutely unreliable! And many, many other drawbacks regarding content that is difficult to list, but after 30 minutes of watching this film, I doubted whether I was watching a historical film or a complete fantasy. <br /> <br /> As for his artistic features that provide us with entertainment, they are as lame as the story here. The performances are artificial, the actors have just beautiful faces, but weak acting skills. Perhaps I am too attached to Peter Ustinov or Charles Lawton at the head, but Hans Matheson does not fit the role of Nero at all. He might have some good moments as an actor, but never as a shameful Roman emperor. Is he an artist who burns Rome for a song? Is he a cynic who disguises the love of his relatives? Is he a cruel ruler who sacrifices the lives of thousands of innocent people for the sake of "supposed justice"? None of them. He is just a young man who does not know how to rule, and, eventually, begins to let out a fire that burns inside himself ... John Simm is out of place in this film, like Caligula, and absolutely inferior to other characters. Eliza Tovati is sexy only as Poppay; yet she could have been much better. The suits are inaccurate, and the sets are not surprising. Low budget leads to low effects and, consequently, low entertainment. <br /> <br /> But the thing that made me the most angry in this film, and as a result, I give him 1/10, these are some moments that are absolutely unacceptable: <br /> <br /> - death Poppie and St. Paul’s talk with Nero on her body; <br /> <br /> - Claudius’s mention of the current conquest of Britain at the feast and soon of his death (he conquered Britain while Messalina was his wife long before his death) <br /> <br /> Tigellin killed Agrippina (Laura Morante), mother of Nero, <br /> <br /> - arguments of Nero in a speech before the senators, <br /> <br /> - finally, the death of Nero - a calm day on the lake and indifferent suicide, which leads to morality Act said: "Let's forgive him" <br /> <br /> All in All. In general, this film is a waste of time, and it is absolutely not needed as a regular production about Rome and mperia. It is better to make one good film in 30 years than ten small ones in 5 years. 1/10 - should not have been done at all.
