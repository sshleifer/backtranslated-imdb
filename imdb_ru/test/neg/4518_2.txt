Why does this piece of film have so many rave reviews? <br /> <br /> This is amateur, unfunny and annoying. <br /> <br /> The only memorable thing is a trite title song. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are low, and “comedy” (if you want to call them so) ideas are weak, they seem to be remnants of SNL residues that even they would not dare to put on the Screen. <br /> <br /> I'm starting to not trust the IMDb rating. <br /> <br /> These are light years from the Kentucky Fried film - even in the same galaxy. <br /> <br /> Even 10 lines cannot be written about this. <br /> <br /> Well, another good thing: ugly street scenes and ugly people is something that no one can see a lot in today's television and movies.
