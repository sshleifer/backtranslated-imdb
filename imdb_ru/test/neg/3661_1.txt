My girlfriend and I are really in silly horror movies. Especially those with a lot of unnecessary nudity. When we saw the cover of this film on a blockbuster, we thought it would be a perfect movie for the night. We started to watch it, not expecting anymore that it would be BIG, but we thought that it would at least attract our interest. After 20 minutes of the movie, we realized that the tempo, after all, would not accelerate, and it was an incredibly boring movie. We tried to figure it out, but the plot didn't make much sense even after repeatedly reading the back of the DVD box. The film was shot very darkly, and it was rather unpleasant to try to understand what was going on in each frame. Every scene of violence was very difficult to see, and you can never really watch the violence you expect. This is definitely a movie without motives, which was shot poorly and very stretched. In each scene there was about 20 minutes of the same thing, and I felt that I got a sense after the first 5. Skip this movie and re-watch another Freddie or Jason movie, and you will be much more pleased.
