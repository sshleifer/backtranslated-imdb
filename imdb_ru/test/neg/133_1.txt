Nowadays, screenwriters, directors and producers increasingly rely on the "unexpected" finale. The old art of closing a film, extracting all the information we learned from the film, and bringing it to a pleasant complete conclusion, has been lost. Now we have a film that, no matter how complex, detailed or frivolous, can be made in 5 minutes. It was all in his / her head. This explanation is the protective net of the director. If nothing helps, or if the letter was not so good, or if we ran out of money to finish the film, we can always say “everything was in his head” and finish the film in this way. The audience will buy it, because, well, none of us are psychologists, and none of us suffer from schizophrenia (not what we know about), so we take history and believe it. After all, the mind is a powerful thing. Some films have done this. But these films are the reason why we get more and more of these crappy endings. Every director / screenwriter now thinks he can handle it, because Fight Club has done it and earned a lot of money. Thus, we get films such as “The Machinist”, “Secret Window”, “Identity” and this film (and these are just some of them).
