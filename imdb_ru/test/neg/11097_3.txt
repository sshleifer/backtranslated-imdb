Confused, meaningless scenario with holes in the plot the size of the Eiffel Tower. The terrible game of all the participants is no exception! Ludicrous and gentle dialogue. Lame attempts at humor and romance. Extremely cheap special effects. All this leads to a huge confusion of the film, which you should avoid.
