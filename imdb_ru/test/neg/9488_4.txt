One of the most notable / popular episodes, but clearly one of the worst. The woman in the red shirt falls in love with Hana (instead of falling dead - for the sake of diversity), and then continues to betray Kirk and the Enterprise, as if loyalty were a non-existent trait of character on the ship. Makes you wonder what psychological tests this supposedly brilliant Starfleet uses to test people for hiring. We have the same absurd lack of loyalty in "Wink Of An Eye", when a man in a red shirt takes the side of the enemy just because he falls in love! Just as in the SS. (However, in this episode, betrayal plays a minor role in the overall plot.) This is very stupid, because it again makes Kirk's team look like a group of stupid, easily impressive idiots who ... as soon as they fall in love with the enemy - able to do almost anything. The fact that McGivers swoops back to Kirk’s side doesn’t improve the irrationality. Lord McGivet and Lord McTacket ... <br /> <br /> Why is Khan being kept behind the regular door when they know he has superior strength? This is one of several ST plot devices that undermine Kirk's intelligence. Why does Han hold a knife against McCoy's throat? If Khan has such excellent intelligence, then you can expect him to be more cunning with how he behaves. And what about Sikhs playing with a Latin American accent? Montalban was to be provided with a vocal trainer. I hardly expected to hear "Plaaain! Plaaaain!" in the background at any time. Why the hell did Kirk (or any captain of the ship) give ANY unlimited use of the ship’s library for the most internal technical parts of the Enterprise? Is Starfleet an institution composed entirely of idiots? <br /> <br /> SS is a very caricature, silly episode, so it's no wonder Trekkies adore him. There are not so many sci-fi elements in it, and that is what Trekkies hates the most. It also shows that the ST franchise decided to revive this dreary character for the second movie, thus rejoicing the rabid Trekki, who were very disappointed with the first movie, in which - you guessed it - there was too much science fiction for average tiny Trekki brains.
