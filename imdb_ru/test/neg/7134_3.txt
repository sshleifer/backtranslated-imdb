I liked the first The Grudge. It really scared me, and there was something in it that made me want to see it twice. Something was missing in this sequel. There was nothing creative, nothing new or original, nothing that really came to mind. People die because a terrible ghost emerges from the shadows and says: “Boo”. And in most cases it was not so scary. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is a dead end. Amber Tamblyn is a good actress, but she had nothing to do, and Karen's death seemed really unsatisfactory because she came so quickly. I was also disappointed in the story of Mother Kayako. I thought that she could provide some way to fight resentment, but she dies in her arms - hair? - Kayako. It was such a stupid turn. In general, it is difficult to feel that the characters you know from the first minute will die. All the same. And they can do nothing. It does not seem like a cruel fate awaiting them. It's just boring, because you know what will happen. If they had something to fight, it would add concern, even if they failed. If there was any hope, it would make fears more justified. Now you are just waiting for their death. <br /> <br /> Kayako was really scary in the first movie, but this time we saw her too many times, and that took part of that. During some of the scenes, I was still scared, but in fact I was used to a huge eye and a blue face. The creators obviously realized that this would happen by adding other scary ghosts. Yes, I was scared on the stage of a school psychologist - even if I knew where she was going, as soon as she said: "I was in the house." Nice touch. However, in this film Toshio was not at all scary. I was much more frightened by dark-skinned Toshio with black eyes and empty eyes, which sometimes appeared in the first film. A blue boy sitting in a corner does nothing for me. <br /> <br /> Some characters seemed really unnecessary - a notorious scene involving a girl whose name I don’t even remember comes to mind. I was not scared, it was just "eh?" I'm not sure if schoolgirls were really needed at all. Karen could have hurt the United States with her. It could kill people associated with her life, everyone at the funeral or something like that. Despite this, it would be boring to watch them all die, but getting to know so many unrelated people was really annoying. Hated the scene "I will not call you mom." Aubrey's mother problems were equally boring. However, the little boy was a touching character. <br /> <br /> Sequel Ju-On was much worse than that. He had some new twists - for example, dreams and reality blurred much more - and even if it made me feel depressed, I was also somehow satisfied. I have to think a little and stay surprised. This film provided only cheap panic.
