Do not get me wrong. I really love the “martial arts genre in the arena”, and I am more and more surprised at how many such films exist. This is one of them, and not even close to be one of the best. With Mathias Hughes, I thought it would be good. Although he can not save this film, and, frankly, he was also not very good. Just ignore what other people are saying; The fighting scenes in this movie are NOT good at all. I really know what I'm talking about, since I have seen so many such films. There are also many scenes that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot. I think they added them just to make the film last a little longer, in addition to the bad guy showing himself as ... oooooooooo ....... bad (as we didn’t know)
