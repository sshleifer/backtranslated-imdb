Will Spanner (David Byrnes, the fifth actor who played the role in the series) runs into another bizarre case, this time involving vampires rather than the usual witches, witches and demons (he is in the hospital to check the son of his friend, who was wounded in hitting and running when they roll a girl who was attacked by a vamp). He attracts Detect Lutz to help with a case that revolves around an underground organization of vampires trying to merge a business to allow them to legally own all the blood banks in the world or some such nonsense. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film largely overshadows the scenes of nudity and sex imitation. (As expected from this series, I think). So to complain about the lack of a good acting game, inconclusive storylines or even convincing characters, I suspect, will not work. If you watch this movie, you donâ€™t care about such "frivolity" and just want a little bit of "action." Unfortunately on this front the film fails as well. All women are attractive enough, but the way the scenes are shot is just awful. To do this is more or less useless exercise in all possible ways. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kimberly Blair and April Breeneman show everything; Ashley Rye shows a full front; Aline Kassman & Mai-Lis Holmes shows only his chest <br /> <br /> My rating is: D
