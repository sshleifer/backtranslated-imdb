Once again, Bronson’s talent is largely wasted on this shocking 1984 thriller, which (uncut) is far more troubling than most of what is missing even today. The fact that the “Evil that people do” is very disturbing (in his verbal and visual images of torture) is not a problem. This is a shameless reward in which it is presented. Interestingly, this film seems to symbolize that last part of Bronson’s career in which he tortured many of his fans with the same blatantly predictable and uncreative scenes. Hopefully this wonderful actor will rise again.
