Hooray for the title spelling errors! After reading the reviews and reflections, my girlfriend and I confirmed that this film is complete nonsense. This film has lost her as one of those rare Tarantino fans. I wish it was made on a nitrate film, and all copies are neatly folded under a smoking fan Tarantino. Literally unnecessary violence, gaps in the plot, “without any drama” by Tarantino and the lack of character development made this script an extremely painful, illustrious installation. <br /> <br /> What was the action there? And how much of it was just because I was too busy reading the subtitles? I watch my share in animated fans and thanks for trying authenticity, but this was exaggerated for an English-language film. Due to obvious historical shortcomings, constant reading killed what was happening there. <br /> <br /> Why pay money for a narrator who will not be absolutely tied to any of the characters, plot, themes, setting, or anything else in the movie? When a film needs this kind of explanation by hand, it foreshadows the full mud that follows it. <br /> <br /> Historical research - while it was littered with interesting people, used suitable costumes and details for the soldiers, this film stretched the truth beyond the confines of faith, even for historical fiction. The prestige of mentioning Mata Hari, although there was little use of it as an omen. Mata Hari was executed by the executed squad, and not suppressed in an isolated room. This ruined every sensation the link could have. <br /> <br /> Other reviews mention more than half a dozen bows to other artists in the first 15 minutes. Given the audience, all of these and other links were completely lost to many who would like to watch this film, and to all who would have liked it. <br /> <br /> I am embarrassed by his choice when to begin the scene. The end is, and what should be included. Why did it take about 20 minutes in a film advertised as an action film to create any testosterone? <br /> <br /> What I considered a message was commonplace. The idea of ​​rats and how we act against them in its original nature and "who is this rat?" at best they were clichéed, but at worst they were not implemented. The mention of American camps for Japanese and German Americans would add legitimacy to this issue to moral superiority. Literally, every character in the film who gets the role of the speaker, fell into his own legend. Is this the world Tarantino lives in? <br /> <br /> I'm glad I didn't pay to see this one. I am sorry that I didn’t want to view it at all, even with friendly owners. There was an extensive base of ideas for development, but none of them was implemented.
