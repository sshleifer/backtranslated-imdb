Oh my God. I want to go back to Monogram Studios in time and strangle someone in their 2-room office for this careless musical. He is one watt above the flat line for 60 of 61 minutes, and then actually shows (for one thin minute spreading by millisecond flashes for an hour) that real talent is badly photographed. I just don’t Think about getting into some kind of trouble to really make this film that could easily become energetic and really funny and allow lethargy to be the main thing in sight. A strange story line shows the capricious Vaudeville Grace Street Grace Hayes, breastfeeding his way to college, where her son-rat son is a rich clown from college. She will fix his playboy ways, no matter what. Her real son (strange looking) Peter Hayes plays her screen son. His real wife plays her secretary. Talk about nepotism. I suspect that this talent pack was almost the point for the Monogram sponsoring this backing musical, created by the extraordinary resident of schlockmeister Sam Katsman. As is the case with other Monogram musicals, it’s more like a reason to withdraw recent purchases of new furniture and lighting to show other studios that Monogram Pictures are “generous” in their B class classes. Take a look at the 1946 Swing Parade to see this: they simply constructed this giant nightclub, and then found a reason for actors and musicians running along it. Story? No one. In any case, ZIS BOOM BAH is more BAH than BOOM. Where were Gail Storm and Mantan Murlandi when the Monogram really needed them? The PRC Pictures boom is probably standing at the gate, wondering if it looks safe to enter. The young hipster Roland Dupri wakes up to brag about how his teenage legs wrap around two wobbly dance numbers, especially in the finale of the “big show” in the new expanded malt store. Ordinary crumpled curtains hang loosely on the back wall, and on the stage set of improperly selected draperies there is even one dark basic rag that is pulled back and forth, when each amateur sequence draws its elbows past the previous one. The girls from the choir and their very simple partners in this finale look like Monogram office workers, borrowed (from typing and joinery) for the morning of filming. They have absolutely no dancing talent and they are so ordinary on the screen ... ALL the girls look as if they are all called Joyce. There is even a suit disaster, where they wear tight shorts ... on just one leg. This is all so terrible and unpleasant ... and in fact annoying when another adjustment by all interested parties makes ZIS really fun. One oddly interesting thing is the dialogue between Grace and her son-in-law / daughter-in-law: he is so careless that he actually works, despite the script and logic. She has a very life-like presence, and this is the only thing that allows an absurd story to be a little convincing. Baby Dupre is a real star. He really can do something ... despite the fact that he looks like a plump teen Liberacea, dancing tap dance ... You read it right.
