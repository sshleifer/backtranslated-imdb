First let me say that I am an amateur Laurel and Hardy. I read every book printed about them, and saw all their available films more than once. I even once took a chance and called Stan on the phone. He was very kind and talked to me for more than ten minutes. I followed with a letter, and he wrote me a letter back. I still have this letter. <br /> <br /> There are some great comedic moments in this movie, but Stan and Ollie are not in their usual form. Stan was seriously ill during the production and looked worse than ten years later. In my opinion, any film by Laurel and Hardy is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> But the final opinion on this film comes from the greatest Wall Laurel. Quoting him: "This film should never have been made."
