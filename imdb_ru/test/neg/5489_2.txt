Illuminati expanded the limits of mediocrity John Turturro from the second actor to the third director, writer and producer. This movie was terrible. It is not connected and moves from scene to scene with a small stream or value relating to the main storyline. <br /> <br /> We are served a buffet of fragmented scenes, each of which is not sequential for all the others. The only thread that passes through them is that they occur in the lives of members of the same theatrical repertory company. The few scenes that are relevant to the plot are so confusing that you often cannot understand whether the dialogue is from the story or whether the actors are plotting for a play in the story. <br /> <br /> If this story were a man, it would be a schizophrenic with multiple personality disorders. He could not decide whether it was drama, romance, comedy, tragedy, sexual farce or theatrical parody. It was closest to being tolerant as a sexual farce. <br /> <br /> Turturro was as lifeless and passionless as Tuchchio, a supposedly complex and passionate writer whose play has a great chance when the current show needs to be canceled due to illness of the main actor. Susan Sarandon played the role of an aging actress, trying to seduce Tuccio for the role. Unfortunately, she considered it necessary to go topless, which only illustrates that the hardware for aging sexual symbols is much better left to the imagination. Christopher Walkin delivered a delightful performance as a critic of theatrical luxury, which makes passionate overtures to a member of the cast. Beverly D'Angelo and Ben Gazzar also had secondary roles. <br /> <br /> I gave this film 2. Besides Walken’s vignette, there’s really nothing to recommend it, except that the puppets were used when opening and closing. loans were phenomenally alive and beautiful. Avoid this movie like the plague, what it is. <br /> <br />
