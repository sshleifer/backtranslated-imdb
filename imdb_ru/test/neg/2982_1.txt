People in ABC forgot to do their biographical research ... so many scenes were just wrong! The actor playing JPII was very tough, there was no individuality there. It is very, very obvious that this film was at the bottom of the totem programming survey, the movement is so low on budget. The script is terrible. Talk like: "You must follow the rules," "No, people are starving." Lame. Plus, the film jumped like crazy from time to time to fit his two hours. Awful The best use of your time would be to watch a PBS documentary on JPII. In addition, CBS has released a mini-series on JPII, which is much better than ABC. JPII was a wonderful person, and Iâ€™m worried that my grandchildren could get hold of this ABC film and think that this is what it really looks like!
