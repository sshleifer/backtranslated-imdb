What a really moronic film, all I can say is that the author must be very fond of magic mushrooms and LSD, because this must be the result of one of his “trips”. <br /> <br /> You follow the whole film, thinking Okay, this is very strange, but, hey, I’m sure that at the end there will be a perfectly good explanation for all this ... Only for disappointment, because there is no explanation at all and turning at the end makes it even more confusing. At the end of the film, you will probably have the same facial expression as if you were standing in Que, paying for groceries, and the seller told you that it would be 11.95, please, and continued to push you in the eggs for no apparent reason. . There are so many factors in this film that remain unexplained, and I think that it remains absolutely incredible for the viewer's imagination. Do not misunderstand me. I like weird movies. The “cage” can be easily described as strange and perverted, but in my opinion, this is a brilliant film (despite the fact that I play J-Lo, which I don’t like to my maximum, even if it failed to influence my opinion). This is not one of those films, and I think you should take into account the characters of those who praise this film. I can tell you that they are probably one of those people who will go to an art exhibition, see splashes of pigeon excrement on a white board and say: “Ohhh, what a masterpiece, the artist really found a unique way to portray eternity”, when that is, it's bird excrement on the board. <br /> <br /> Don't forget about this when watching this movie, <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading!
