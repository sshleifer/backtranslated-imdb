The game made you feel that you were watching a play in kindergarten. The story is full of holes, gaps and gaps, so you don't know what just happened. Half of the scenes are meaningless. There is not the slightest clue about character development. The score / soundtrack consists of approximately three songs, one of which, in particular, is performed in 70% of the scenes. I'm glad I shot only the film, but I feel cheated. Avoid this movie at all costs if you do not want some decent actors to give terrible performances. It seems that the bulk of the budget was spent on incorporating more than just a bad movie into this film. This film is tantamount to visiting a strip club, it tries to interest and interest you, but when you think something happens, you will be thrown into some unrelated scene and left to try to figure out how you got there.
