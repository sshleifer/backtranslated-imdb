I don’t know what today's moviegoers expect, but after 68 years of watching movies ... (well, maybe I didn’t watch many movies in the first 9 - 10 years, so make those 58 years of watching movies) I expect to be entertained, did not get bored to tears, attacked the continuous profanity (every other word) and idiotic scenes of violence, which are presented not for a different purpose, but in order to show blood spatter and crippled parts of the body. “Observation” is one of those films made by people who have no imagination, practically no talent, a complete inability to tie the scenes together and an unjustified trait to allow the scene to go on and on, long after the goal has expired. So that someone could think that this is a worthy film, when there is nothing more than Hollywood trash behind me. As a war veteran, I have seen violence, blood and blood in many forms, and films like “We were Soldiers” are about as cruel as possible in movies, but they have an expiatory value. The observation was to be invented by people in a stupor caused by drugs, without writing skills, no director's training, no film editing experience, and no contact with reality. Just a stupid film about two serial killers posing as FBI agents creating a script to kill some stupid cops from dirty mouths, etc. A high-quality piece of garbage that only an idiot can like ...
