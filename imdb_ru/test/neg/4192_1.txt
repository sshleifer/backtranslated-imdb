This is the worst movie I've ever seen, as well as the worst movie I've ever seen. I do not see the need to rephrase what everyone else said before, just be warned ... <br /> <br /> This is NOT one of those bad films that you think you want to watch because you want to be able to remove the most interesting, it's just a BAD BAD BAD BAD. <br /> <br /> This film is tantamount to having a "favorite rock" as a friend. You wait and you wait and you wait and you wait and you wait and you wait and you wait and you wait and you wait for something to happen. Unfortunately, this never happens. At least with a pet, you knew what you got into. The Lion Gate completely cheats on this bomb ... No ... it's a disaster. After watching this movie, you would swear that George Bush did his best to make this movie ... yes, this is idiocy. <br /> <br /> Stay away, unless, of course, you just want to watch the worst movie of all time. Probably, that was exactly what the Lion Gate meant to make some money on this piece of scar.
