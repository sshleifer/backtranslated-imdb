I just finished watching this movie on TV and I had nothing else. Went right here so that IMDb also looked at the trivia page and accidentally looked into user comments. And what do I find? Every stupid idiot raises this movie to the skies! I wouldn't even have written anything, but when no one else took the time to spread the word about this movie with a crap ass, I thought I could. <br /> <br /> The act of acting sucked almost everyone in the cast, Worst of all was that the guy was playing Brian Wilson (I think I understood the name correctly) because he replayed, especially when he was tall. The rest was not as bad as his, but no one was good. I'm not an expert on beach guys, though, so I can't complain about this story so much ... except that it sucks. In most cases, there is no motivation for any decisions of the characters, but maybe they are idiots in real life. And what seemed the worst to me was that I thought it would be a film about beach guys, but you really only captured some of the characters. I hate it when they do it in a movie, the same thing in the doorway, although I like this movie more. I have no strength left to write more ... it sucks! Do not buy and do not look!
