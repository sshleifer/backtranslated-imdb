This film is a jumble of various idiotic cliches. For example, a boy meets a spoiled rich girl and makes her fall in love with him, harassing her in college (a frequently used backdrop in recent Indian commercial films). Male chauvinistic glorification of sexual conquest. The climax is predictable (used to nausea in several other films). As with many other recent commercial Hindi films, the film is replete with inappropriate inserts of songs, which probably contributed to the success of the film more than anything else.
