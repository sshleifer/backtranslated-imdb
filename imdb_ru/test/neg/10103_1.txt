Awful game with the worst special effect I've ever seen. It's bad enough that I spent $ 3 to watch this smelly pile of crap, but I lost an hour and a half that I could do something else, like getting a root canal or volunteering for jury duties. Getting drunk could not even help this video. <br /> <br /> To put it bluntly, I sincerely believe that I actually lost a few IQ points while watching this stupid piece of stunning “work”! Perhaps I should have followed my own advice this time. Never expect a decent film if it was written, filmed and filmed by the same person, and never NEVER expect anything of value from Jeff Fahey.
