Now, any Blaxploiation fan will recognize the ingredients: big afro, topless babes, unusually bad fashion and some talk about jive. In this case, add a lead who cannot act, a plot that does not make much sense, editing someone without hands, blindfolded and the most terrible battle scenes, and you have TNT Jackson. Not bad enough to be good, but not good enough to be bad, it's a great mess from start to finish. I especially liked the endless mistakes in continuity and the double trick of the leader. <br /> <br /> Itâ€™s so that the bad Far Eastern martial arts of the 70s meet the black force, that it hurts, but, oh, it hurts, well! I am ashamed to admit that I almost liked it.
