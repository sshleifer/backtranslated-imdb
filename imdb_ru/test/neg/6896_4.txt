I took my family to see Barnyard last weekend. We were waiting for this, but if my children weren't there, my husband and I would have left. Coming from the farming community, we discovered the fact that all the bull males in the film on which the udder was drawn were a bit disturbing. We felt that we were watching cow dressing or something like that. It was just strange to hear a male voice coming from the female body. After checking out some of the notes on another website, I felt that the animators might not have noticed this fact. I know that this is just an animated, humorous show, but, putting the female parts of the body on a man, I had to so suspend my disbelief that I simply could not enjoy the film as I could. I know that the udder can be funny, but it was definitely used. None of the animals in the film seemed to have sex-specific parts of the body, and I would prefer that the bulls in this show have at least the correct ones, if they were to be painted at all. The children, however, still enjoyed the film, although we took the time to make sure they knew the difference between the bulls and the cows.
