(The beginning can be a spoiler ...) <br /> <br /> “Eye 2” is a continuation of “Eye”. We are talking about a pregnant woman who can see ghosts and spirits after the incident with her. <br /> <br /> The sound effects scared the hell out of me, although for a moment, but this is the only scary thing. Some scenes from the prequel are comparatively similar and repeat, therefore the cooling effect has certainly cooled down. <br /> <br /> “The Eye” makes a rather frightening and indelible impression, whereas “Eye 2” is an unforgettable horror film and drama. Skip watching this Watch “Eye” is good enough.
