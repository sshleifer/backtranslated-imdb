Oh my god, it doesn't get worse than this !!! I always love little stupid sci-fi B-movies that are so stupid that they are funny, and I thought it would be one of them, but it was so stupid that I found it absolutely deplorable that it was released. What were these people thinking? They are obviously not real directors, and I really hope that they returned to their daily work, realizing that this is the best thing they could do! Actor and not-so-special effects were far from being the same as those of even the cheapest B-films. And with men dressed like women, they could not find women who would like to appear in this shit. No, probably not. <br /> <br /> I would give this a “0”, if it is possible, it doesn’t even deserve a “1” for terrible. Do not waste your time (and especially not your money) on this terrible loser without a movie!
