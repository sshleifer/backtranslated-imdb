This film was terribly awful. The sound was terrible, the action was ridiculous, and the effects were nauseous. If you have a life, do not watch this film, because you want to kill yourself. This film is completely detached from Blade (this is undoubtedly a really good film ... or a trilogy, I have to say). <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t care who the actors are, this movie is just awful. I watched it for 10 minutes and had to come to my computer and comment on how badly this movie was. I really don't know why my family is still watching this ... oh wait, yes I know. They almost non-stop laughing at silly actions, dialogues and acting games.
