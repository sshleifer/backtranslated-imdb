My spoiler is in my pants, because thinking about this film made me so angry that I cheated myself. <br /> <br /> As soon as you finish watching, you look at the TV in confusion and horror. Then on your shoulder there is a low knock and a hissing voice: "You will die in seven days." You turn around, and one of your best friends stands there with an expression of absolute hatred towards the one who offered this film when you were on a blockbuster. <br /> <br /> I will not lie: this is the worst film on Earth's face. I saw it with 5 of my friends, all 18-year-old guys, and these were our reactions: - One person really started crying and punching himself - One person screamed and lost consciousness - One person got up and swayed from the front door to appear again more hours later - one person just lost consciousness (it was me) - one person began to talk incoherently, as if he had both cerebral palsy and Tourette syndrome - one person fell into a kind of catatonic trance and did not answer our voices for more than twenty minutes <br /> <br /> Movie Act about the bad. There is one part where the backward operator actually stumbles (holding the camera), but the producers decided to leave it alone. Seriously, you can hear his grunt and swear when he falls to the ground. There is only one special effect, and it is special just like a retarded child trying to solve a Rubiks cube, special: the camera rotates so that the action on the screen (action, item. A little dumb thing is lost in the corn field for 80 insane minutes) throws a barrel. <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances can you watch it, and the film itself even warns you about it. Do you know what a slogan is on the back? "Some warnings should not be ignored." To be honest, I think that the release of this film to the public is a sore practical joke on the part of the producers. This does not mean, however, that you must pass by, if you see him in the movie store - then he will sit on the shelf so that some other poor fellow can see him. Rather, buy every copy you can get, and mail it to the people you hate.
