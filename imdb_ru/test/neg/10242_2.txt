The strange thing about Galaxine is not that it is extremely bad, although it is. The strange thing is that, despite the fact that it is very bad, it is not funny. Extremely bad films have their own brand of unintentional humor - the secret of their success, one might say. But Galaksina is completely unique - MST3K’s worst nightmare, a bad movie in which intentional * and * unintentional humor go to naught. <br /> <br /> It is fairly easy to understand why deliberate jokes fail — and the reasons are quite varied. Sometimes it is a matter of time; sometimes it’s a good idea, poorly designed (a human restaurant * might * be fun, but it’s not); sometimes it seems that there was some confusion in the cutting room, and the highlight was on the floor; and sometimes jokes are just bad jokes. Bad movies make them laugh at such an unintended insult. It is more difficult to understand why Galaksina does not laugh at this. Something is wrong with the unintentional humor in this film, just as something is wrong (not quite subtle) with intentional humor. This is a very bad film, whose badness is not in that quality, which is usually redemptive. It is absolutely unique in my experience.
