As bad as they get. This film makes a fatal mistake, forcing the viewer not to care about what happens to the characters. The two women in this movie are so stupid that you start to root for the bad guys, so that's it. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the few that was so bad that I had to turn to another channel. <br /> <br /> There is no likelihood in this movie. People, not even people from Ohio, just don't act like that. Well, maybe the writers are doing fine. <br /> <br /> There is not enough beer in the world to make this film tolerable. <br /> <br /> F903
