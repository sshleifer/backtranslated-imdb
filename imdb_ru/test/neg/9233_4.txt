I understand the director's goal - to tell stories that are not stories, but how he tried to show the passing time (a couple of runners who start to run for the first time than run with a sidecar (sic!) Than one person ...) and tie The “adventures” of the characters (the final scene where the maid climbs a mountain, sees a big black guy on another cliff, and then sees a boat with her former employer and says: “Oh, Boat!”) Were terrible. At the same time, I liked the way he portrayed the middle class, even excessively. I think this is a lousy movie. If you want to watch it, do it as a film school student, trying to see the technical aspects and problems. This will help a lot.
