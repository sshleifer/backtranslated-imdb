A wonderful set of actors and a seemingly good plot - although not an original one - promised me a good evening in front of the TV. I was disappointed. The actors performed at the right level (Juliette Lewis, as always, is cute; William Hurt is solid, but in the background; Shelley Duval, as always, is convincing), but the story was too thin to keep me informed, and the turn to the final was too obvious too late; there was only one character who was cute with a girl, so guess what ?! Then the final after-twist ?? I do not know what to think about it. The guy and the neighbor? Agree with the devil or just make her move? What kind! The film had a good idea, but the idea was not elaborated. It might be good, but it is not. Colombo said that there are too many loose ends to tie them.
