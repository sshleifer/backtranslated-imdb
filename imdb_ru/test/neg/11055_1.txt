“Screams” is a very budget horror film, filmed on video. It shows a decent game, poor lighting, a weak story and some of the worst monster effects I've ever seen. The plot forces a college student to force him to join the cult from his attractive host. A cult is a parody of Scientology with a book similar to Dianetics. That would be a funny shot for this group if it were not for the blunt scenario and the low cost of production. The effects of the monster look awful, and the image quality creates the feeling that you are watching a home video or public service announcement. I think that anyone who sees this will agree that films should be filmed.
