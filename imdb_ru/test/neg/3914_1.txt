Well, <br /> <br /> I understand that there are some doubting Thomas there ... I was one of them ... but then I saw this celluloid masterpiece. <br /> <br /> All that I can say that the scene in which George Wendt is being sucked out of HIS ** spacecraft made me shiver. Sometimes I sit right in my bed, screaming like an old man on a proctologist's table, thinking about it. If the director reads this ... I would pay for the sequel.
