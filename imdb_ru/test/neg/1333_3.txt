I rented a DVD yesterday, and, first of all, it started badly, this is a 4: 3 movie, and it only gets worse, the acting is so bad, and the movie itself is predictable, I was like watching a movie about myself: it will happen next and guess what happened? that's right ... <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good action movie, don’t watch this movie and you’ve been disappointed in this low-budget movie like me. go and see Ali his way better!
