Trite and unoriginal. This is similar to how someone watched “Immortal Lovers” and “Amadeus” and decided to mix them together and, in the process, steal other plot fragments from other films to make another one. As with most historical films these days, there are some inaccuracies, as the story is manipulated to better fit the story, which is mostly understandable. For example, in the remaining days of Beethoven’s life, other people needed to write down what they needed to say in order for them to understand them. This, of course, would be unpleasant to screen. The script, although filled with some quotations, does not quite reflect the feeling of that period of time and, in combination with some bad actions, seems rather modern. Diane Kruger is good enough to look at her, but she still has a lot to improve in her craft. Ed Harris doesn't work for me as Beethoven, and I mostly blame Gary Oldman for this. In general, not a very good interpretation of the life of the musical maestro. Better to just find yourself a copy of "Immortal Lover." <br /> <br /> http://iwascalledclementine.multiply.com/reviews
