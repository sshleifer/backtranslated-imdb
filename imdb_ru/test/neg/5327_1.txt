I thought I had seen this movie before, because the plot summary sounded familiar. However, when I watched it once in the afternoon (in need of some meaningless but amusing entertainment), I wouldn’t know anything — if I had seen it before, I must have blocked the horror of it from my memory. <Br /> <br /> This film is terrible and shows its age. In fact, it looks older than it is now: more like a retarded comedy of the mid-80s. While I'm a fan of toilet humor and can see the funny side of many things, this is a “comedy” in its most childish and homophobic form. The plot is as thin as that of a supermodel, and it wouldn’t bother me if the movie were funny. <br /> <br /> In the entire film, there is only one funny line told by the character Louis: “It looks like someone threw out a perfectly good white boy! In fact, Louis is the only nice character (and this says little). James and Carl are a type of annoying, immature men from whom a sensible woman will run a mile away, their practical jokes as funny as the war in Iraq; Susan Wilkins's character is colorless (looks like Julia Roberts, but she lacks charisma), and there is no chemistry between her and Karl - although it may be unfair to blame the actress, because I don't know what she could do with such a poorly written piece; and the villain is not funny, not scary and not memorable. <br /> <br /> Good and bad trash. This is garbage, which definitely should not be recycled.
