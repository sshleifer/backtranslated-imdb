If this is classified as the “real life” of London, then the producers must be on a different planet. <br /> <br /> This is the most depressing, suicidal, dark, dirty, dirty film on television. <br /> Everyone fights, everything is riddled with filth, nothing is done for genuine reasons. <br /> <br /> If you want to get a real picture of people in London or the UK, then this program is from reality. <br /> <br /> I can’t say a word about this program. The only certainty is that this will be a big fight for the Christmas dinner. <br /> <br /> Even the characters are absolutely incredible!
