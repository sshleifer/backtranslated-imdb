It seems that the people involved in this film fill in the ballot box to increase its rating. The good news is that apparently only 18 people have seen it. I guess that makes me the 19th. I have nothing to do with the film and I don’t know anyone who would do it, and I’m a long-time IMDb user (I’ve been checking my voting results and reviews over the past seven years), so I promise to give an honest and impartial opinion. He comes to you from a 30-year-old horror fan who also himself participated in several low-budget films. <br /> <br /> In addition to a couple of interesting video effects, "Frankensteins Bloody Nightmare" is incoherent, boring and technically flawed for no reason. It was apparently filmed on a quiet stock, and the audio was then dubbed into; in any case, most of them sound as if they were recorded with a tin can and a piece of string. More than three quarters of the dialogue can not be heard. <br /> <br /> I watched it from beginning to end, and I have no idea what the story was or even if it was. It seems that the director basically impresses himself with the long panning corners of the table and the dead black spaces that do nothing but complement the film. This would be a problem if someone actually developed the plot and made a film that had a certain sense of rhythm. In this case, however, the rule does not apply. It doesn't matter how the scenes are shot, because they don't make up the story. <br /> <br /> Watching this video is a useless exercise at all levels. Regardless of the fact that the people who worked on this write, and no matter how they try to influence the rating here on IMDb, this is just bad, tedious material. <br /> <br /> This is true. If you think you spend your money or time on it, think again. It is easier to find something better, because you will not find worse. <br /> <br /> And this is an impartial, not embellished truth.
