This is one entertaining movie. I suggest you rent it, buy a couple of quarts of rum and invite the whole team for this. My favorite parts were. gunfights that were so well delivered that John Wu himself envied, .2. Fine special effects .3. acting skills and .4. The fact that every gangsta in the film seemed to make a bad impersonation of "Scarface". I mean, Master P is like a Cuban godfather! This is a revolutionary territory. And with a well-written dialogue that includes such lines as “the only difference between you and me, Rico, I'm alive and yours is dead,” this film is truly a masterpiece. Yes, that's right.
