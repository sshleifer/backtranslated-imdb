very disappointing and inconsistent - from time to time the germ of the idea developed and was discarded in the next line - it was like a movie that was cut and cut to try to make it work - I was bored and distracted all the time, and I speak like a huge fan of the series . Many jokes were unoriginal and weary. The medieval section lasted too long, and the quality of the game was very poor â€” some in tiny guest places, such as Simon Peg and Liam Cunningham, did more than their main cast in their 30 seconds. did in 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Very sorry, really. <br /> <br /> The only really interesting thing was to look inside a small barn on SoHo Square - something that anyone who is ever surprised in this part of London is surprised at.
