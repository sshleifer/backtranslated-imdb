SPOILER. A WARNING. <br /> <br /> This movie will ruin your daily or “tiny morning hours” viewing. <br /> <br /> I like Mark Singer. He portrayed good characters in the roles that I saw. Before this movie. <br /> <br /> What begins with a promising film soon disappears by itself with a terrible cgi'd background and an extreme close-up on a person who will soon die ... <br /> <br /> Then it becomes even worse. <br /> <br /> Much worse. <br /> <br /> To describe it as if playing Hammi would insult pigs. This film goes to the bottom of the barrel with ham and scratches the acting skills. <br /> <br /> In addition to Mark Singer's overcooking and beating, Mike Dopud stomps and wanders around, looking as if he is afraid that he might fall on the rocks, and his “manic” bad guy with wide eyes just makes him look like on an idiot. He is not at all terrible. <br /> <br /> George Stults looks like a deer caught in headlights. He claims that he was threatened by the other two, but his hero would have been threatened by a ticket office offering him "paper or plastic." <br /> <br /> This is really a remedy for Nicole Eggert as an independent woman who gets her. life back, despite attracting the wrong type of people ... She was unremarkable. <br /> <br /> This is not a remake, but it is very similar to "Hardening" - an experienced guide, loses someone in the fall, a prick of conscience to help someone else, a lost treasure, which cost a lot of money and a gang of idlers, who use the manual. Besides Cliffhanger was an excellent vehicle for Stallone and Lithgow. I have to admit, Lithgow stole the show. <br /> <br /> Even the unintended comedy was bad. There were times when I was not sure whether they used a rubber face model as a substitute for Singer, when he tried in vain to storm a weather station (there was no pun intended). Pressing his face to the pillar of the door and his clumsy manner in general did not help his character. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br /> No, seriously, avoid it. Save 96 minutes of your life and do something more constructive, for example, watch the paint dry or the grass grow. Or just close your eyes and look at the back of the eyelids for 90 minutes ...
