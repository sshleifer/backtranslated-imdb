When I heard that they were doing this, I was very happy, considering that the first film was pretty good, albeit from the short side. <br /> <br /> But then I remembered some of the disasters with the continuation of Disney, which I had previously watched I was looking at you, mermaid 2). <br /> <br /> Anyway, I watched it, and unfortunately, I was very disappointed. The best thing about this is that the animation is great. He really possesses that particular polish that “real” Disney films have. <br /> <br /> Other than that ... everything else is disappointing. The storyline is seriously everywhere. One moment about something, then completely changed to another storyline, and then changed to another completely different storyline. It reminded me of how the Family Guy movie looked like 3 separate episodes turned into a movie. <br /> <br /> I laughed, perhaps, once. In the original film, Kronk was very funny, but in this he is not at all funny. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie unless someone lends it to you for free. <br /> <br /> 4/10
