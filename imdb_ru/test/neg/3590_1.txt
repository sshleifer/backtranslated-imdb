I appreciated this 1/10 film and did it in good nature. This film is not as it seems, and I do not understand its meaning. Take the first joke, for example. This is the sign at the beginning to start. it's good that everything was fine, but then some guy starts talking about the hood, and then he dies, while the other guys talk, then he dies after the other guy says that people do not come on your birthday without dying. and he gets the cake now. then he dies. <br /> <br /> These jokes are just stupid, they are so smart, and I would think that they would be better from someone like a scary movie director: <br /> <br /> Sean Wayans (written) & Marlon Wayans (written) and Phil Beauman (written) <br /> <br /> but it sucks, and I hope that the next time they want to do another comedy, they will make some good jokes, not stupid ones.
