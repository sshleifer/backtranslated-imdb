I watched TV for many years. So much so that when I start to see new shows, which mostly seem to be repetitions of old shows, they insult me. Fortunately, Iâ€™m not very sensitive, because all the Hot Properties do is update the cast (i.e. make them more sexy) from Designing Women and remove them in New York instead of Georgia. <br /> <br /> more TV-14, but that does not make the show better. The only thing that proved this series is that Nicole Sullivan is so good that she could make the series, like My Mother the Car, classic. Her comic talents are reminiscent of modern Lucille Ball - only funnier. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast is sexy and sexy, which could be useful for some brainless soap, but they are just not funny. <br /> <br /> Fred
