In addition, he collected the characters from the first film and gave them more background. In fact, Lucian Lycan (a werewolf) fell in love with Vampire Sonya, the script for Romeo and Juliet, which, as you know, will end badly if you watched the first film. Thus, without waiting, we missed two hours of unrelenting CGI and actors with little or no presence on the screen. Everything is filmed in the monotonous color that was in the first film, because nothing was filmed in daylight. <br /> <br /> Worth the time ... probably not. In fact, the quality has deteriorated, even CGI looks as if it was done on the cheap, you do not buy a minute, that these are real werewolves.
