A good example of a reverse, politically correct racism, where white people seem senseless cattle, which only to be killed, and their indigenous enemies - noble heroes, superior in appearance and ability. Besides the fact that the story becomes too boring, it also does not allow a neutral viewer to identify with one side or the other — this simplifies too much.
