A big (and we mean a big plus) villain Sebastian Cabot is trying to ward off the salt of the farmers from their land in order to get the rights to oil. When the sea of ​​Sterling Hayden’s pop music dies, how does Haden put an end to TERROR IN A Texas TOWN, armed only with a harpoon? <br /> <br /> First, this is not a B-Western. There are no singing cowboys, reckless stunts, no interesting sequences of actions. It's just an independent film - you know, those who use unimportant actors to say "important things" and cover the overall low budget void of what is happening with interesting camera angles. <br /> <br /> Secondly, this film To avoid compromises (one can expect), which could lead to the cancellation of Trumbo's Important Statements about Justice in America and the rather painful relationship between the main minion and his girlfriend, this is really low budget. The main problem that causes this is that acting is really very bad. Sterling Hayden is quite decent in heavy roles, but he is the last guy you want to play a sensitive Swedish sailor who went to look for his fortune in the West. Sebastian Cabot is trying to make Sydney Greenstreet as a (very) bloated plutokrat. This is a good idea, but Cabot doesn't have an actor role for this. The guy who plays the hired gun with the missing hand and soul (Johnny Craile) plays the best part in the film. He doesn't do anything about it. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the scenario is not exactly the same. Trumbo argues that an immigrant will not be able to shake things up from the sheriff in a corrupt city and from people who, against real oppression, tend to retreat. This is a rather stale message for the 1958 film - “Noon”, “Bad Day on Black Rock”, “The Devil's Door” - all are Westerns that deal with the evils of Western society with an eye to the vices of America in the 50s. Trumbo in the 59th, of course, had all the personal reasons to agree with these feelings, but he doesn’t do anything new or interesting with them. <br /> <br /> So, considering all the negatives, why does this movie get 4? Mainly because there are some interesting quirks in the film. (The relationship between Krael and his girlfriend is very interesting.) And Trumbo, being a mediocre writer who pursues his political affectation, is very good at creating both interesting characters and intellectual interactions between them. As soon as someone is ready to lose consciousness from the boredom from the Indy movie, there will be an exchange of dialogues or just cunning, which will make you realize that the scriptwriting guy was not just a hack. <br /> <br /> If you don’t do it like Trumbo or Westerns, skip this one. Otherwise, try. You might like it more than me.
