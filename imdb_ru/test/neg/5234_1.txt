** May contain spoilers ** Awful. Just awful. I liked Stephen King's novel, and it's just a terrible adaptation. They change the ending. They change the plot. They changed the character of Alan Pangborn from a grieving husband to a happy groom. If you're a fan of Stephen King's novel, stay away. Even if it is not, stay away. <br /> <br /> The book was very dark even for Steve King. The 11-year-old kills himself in the novel. The middle of the school meets with child pornography in the novel. This is not nearly as good as a novel. <br /> <br /> This movie is my least favorite movie of all time. I hate this movie with revenge.
