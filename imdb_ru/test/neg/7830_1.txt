Asia Argento never starred in the film (as far as I know, including films shot by her own father, Dario), where she doesn’t show all her anatomy at some point. Of course, in the most boring opening scene of the dialogue ever, poor Madsen makes her come to her office and immediately remind us that, although she has raised hair, she can still stick her fingers at the crotch (which she does, but in such a random "what? I really see it?" in some way). A DVD box packed makes this film look like a fatal film, so you wait for it to turn into a sleek and minimalist killer ... no luck. She is verbose, obsessed with aging, and, even worse, does not have credible skills in the field of dexterity, except (surprise!), Taking off ALL clothes, when any scene allows. Her accented English would be cool if only she hadn't tried to portray it so much and try to speak like a 12-year-old. How about this plot? Weak-minded, but at the same time a nympho woman is suddenly forced to kill, while she already has another affair on the go and she is selling some cheap drug deal ... what? Does anyone have any motivation in this film to do something other than buying a hamster? The script seems to be oriented so that everyone can talk a lot about the same things over and over (I expected the worst action to look like a producer who invests money in him just to have a little time on the screen) - nothing happens Continuing to talk about the obvious shortcomings of the character of Asia, which at any moment of the film give what the DVD cover promises. She is weak ... but she knows how to kill. she waves a lot. She claps naked, she claps half-dressed, she even claps in the clothes of a dead woman ... she is very flexible and unmotivated. In fact, "Floppy" would be a great title for this film ... and a picture of Asia looking angry on the cover would be the best presentation ... actually there are shots of her food on the plane !!! What is it about? <br /> <br /> The end has 0 meaning - everyone just annoyingly talkative in their intentions and in achieving all goals. Lester's wife doesn’t deliver REAL revenge (taking someone in a bad caroe is life threatening, but not really possible), and Leicester is just floating around, not really proclaiming anything. Absolutely misleading key art ... yes, we know that Asia lost a baby fat girl from its first child, but in fact, the whole film is trying to pretend to be so interesting that making a film about a passive-aggressive chick is not worth your time. See Point of No Return instead.
