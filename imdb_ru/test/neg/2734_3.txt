The script seems to have been completely borrowed from some other film related to the use of a self-propelled manned boring machine. Behind the scenes, the two films were almost identical. The number of serial numbers indicated in this is enough to prevent a copyright infringement trial. <br /> <br /> But besides this, I have to say that I found it somewhat interesting, because I like the cinema genre deep underground. It's a little silly with regard to science, but if someone wants to really squint and pretend not to notice that a scientific slip here and there, and in everything, this film is almost tolerable. Much better than Supernova, which was another film in which Luke Perry played a leading role, he was so stupid, stupid, stupid that nothing could save him. Note to filmmakers: hire someone who knows something about the subject with which the film deals. It will be a very small part of the film’s budget, but on the whole it will have a big impact on your audience not sticking out of stupid science. <br /> <br /> Production values: almost acceptable. I have seen much worse in my time. <br /> <br /> New thought about disaster films: instead of always having a happy ending when the world is saved once again, how about where something is a little bit more realistic, where sometimes even the best the effort ends in failure. Especially when the problem to be solved was caused, first of all, by sheer stupidity. Films about catastrophes caused by stupidity, with luminous, heartbreaking endings, something backwards justify stupidity, saying: "Regardless of how terrible the problem caused by brain stupidity is, it can be fixed. Which is definitely not the case. A film about accidents caused by oneself, with an unfortunate ending, would serve as a warning fairy tale “First, don't be so damn stupid.” Is it worth watching this movie? If you are bored and you have seen everything else in the fiction section of your local video rental store, of course, why not. But avoid "Supernova", as I can assure you that you are not bored. It was definitely not one of the best Luke Perry films. This one is better. It does not say much, but it is better. <br /> <br /> One dead hoof for being a genre of a deep-underground genre. One dead hoof for abruptly tearing it from the script of another film of the same genre.
