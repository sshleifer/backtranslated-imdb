I would like to begin by saying that I would no longer go to watch this movie if they were distributing popcorn of pure gold and the ticket gave me eternal life. This movie was terrible. I can not give this really honest rating, because there are no negative stars. The game is absolutely terrible. This film is a parody based on the classic “The Most Dangerous Game”. If you really want to torture yourself for 90 minutes, rent something like Gigli. At the very least, J-Lo provides the best landscape Ben has to reassure the women who view him. I'm not upset about the 7 dollars I paid to see the move, I just would like 90 minutes of my life to come back. <br /> <br /> “Can you give me back my time!?!” Samuel L. Jackson, Changing Lanes
