I was very disappointed with the quality of this documentary. The content is poorly produced, the video is of very poor quality and, especially, the terrible sound. There is very little about how Bruce Haack created his music, and there are almost no examples of a direct connection with later and modern electronic music. Interviews of people familiar with Bruce Haack are mostly inarticulate. Too many yaks and little haak. Although I have a serious personal interest in electronic music, and my level of attention is above average, even for a slow and / or difficult topic, I fell asleep while watching this documentary and had to watch it in order to see the parts I slept. If you watch this, make sure you are tuned before watching, like Alex in A Clockwork Orange. Bruce Haack deserves much better than this. Shame on the producer and director.
