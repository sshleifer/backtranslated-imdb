I had no idea what this film was about, it moves from the storyline to the storyline, mistakenly linking incoherent ideas to each other. it just doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> The sliced ​​timeline does not help either. we begin nowadays to return to the past, and then return to the future only to return to the past. <br /> <br /> This film is also filled with terrible juicy lines and cliche themes, such as the princess and the poor, "you can't even have me in my death," the lines, "you don't even love me enough." Cliché to the maximum! <br /> <br /> The fight scene was terribly banal, the lighting was constantly inappropriate, which compensated for CG with the actors (that is, you could say that some backgrounds were clearly CG). <br /> <br /> Although the society in the di-moon was quite interesting. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to anyone, if possible avoid it. <br /> <br /> if you had trouble with this comment, the film would be just as bad.
