Let's start by recognizing that there are three types of horror films: good, bad and completely awkward videos that make the whole genre suffer in all respects. Dark Harvest promises great artisan DVD cover, but be sure that this show ends. After exhausting editing, we soon discover that the film consists of a very poorly written script, an extremely insufficiently qualified (even for a beginner film) acting, catastrophic lighting and even worse special effects. Seriously, no one could afford anything but a mask for a villain, or did they just think that it was good enough for Jason Vourhis and Michael Myers, so what is good enough for us? Well, it didn't work out to create a scary villain. In any case, this is one of the movies that makes you check your watch, sigh and curse your credulity. Time in each scene is painful, and the whole performance has a feeling of high school (if you think about it, I saw the best performances in high school, right up to the special effects). I'm trying to think of a way to end this review on a positive note, so let me offer to donate all copies of this train wreck as coasters for drinks, frisbees, bells ....... I would say “go by myself”, but that would be just cruel. <br /> <br /> Check out the other reviews of this production company and you will find the same for each of their films. They claim that they are complying with the contract between the cinema and the audience (that is, please, the fans), but all they did was laugh and threw money on our heads (which I am sure they saw very little for this) . <br /> <br /> Sorry, high marks and positive reviews are obviously published by those who are directly or indirectly associated with this parody. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10, because this is the lowest rating. If I do this, I'll get mad.
