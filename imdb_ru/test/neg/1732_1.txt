It was funny because it was all so unreal, I mean, come on, how did the pop star just appear in public school and fall in love with the girl who was obsessed with him? Come on, people! <br /> <br /> Everyone except the lead girl was absolutely terrible in acting. The dialogue was stupid, the premise was stupid, and the camera work was poorly done. I felt like I was watching a badly made home video. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that I have spent almost 2 hours of my life, that I will never return. <br /> <br /> I have nothing more to say, except that I would rather hit myself in the face several times than watch this movie again.
