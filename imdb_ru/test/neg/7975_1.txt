Please give this a miss. <br /> <br /> Kristi Swanson and the rest of the cast played a terrible role. The show is flat, flat, flat. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t know how Michael Madison could put this on his plate. He almost seemed to know that it would not work, and his performance was rather dim, so all of you Madison fans are missing out on that.
