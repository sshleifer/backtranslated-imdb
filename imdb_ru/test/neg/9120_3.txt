I suggest, if you have already seen the original American graffiti, do not watch this film. If you have not yet seen the original, I still do not recommend it, but it will be much less painful to watch. The characters from the first movie are great, and in the end you have a connection with them. This film shows how bad their life has become. Look at it is not easy! <br /> <br /> On New Year's Eve in 1964, 65, 66 and 67, we have four stories about the heroes of the first film. In the 64th we got John Milner (Paul Le Mat), who is now a professional drag racer. He meets a foreign girl, Eve, and although his plot really does not go anywhere, he is the best of the four. In 1965, we have Toad (Charles Martin Smith), who is stuck in Vietnam, and more than anything else, he wants. He is trying to find ways to hurt himself or do stupid things to get out. In the 66th we had Debbie (Candy Clark), a girl whom Toad shot in the first film. Now she is a hippie who smokes marijuana, and in fact I don’t know what her story is about. She went to a concert ... nothing much happened. Finally, in 1967, Steve Bolander (Ron Howard) and Lori Bolander (Cindy Williams) had problems in marriage, which ended with an anti-war rally and police actions. <br /> <br /> None of these stories are very good. The script in some parts contains a very, very bad dialogue. These poor characters that I liked so much in the first movie, turned out to be where they are ... why? Why was this sequel made? I believe that if a sequel was made, it should have included the Vietnam War, hippies and police actions, but in fact this film should not have been made. <br /> <br /> The direction was stylish, but it’s just a huge headache. Each story has its own style. “Milner” is the usual (depending on how you watch it) widescreen screen, and it is shot the way the rest of the movie should look. The plot of "Toad" was shot at 16 mm, and it looks bad, the size of a small box in the middle of the screen. The plot Debbie shot in a multi-screen. At some point, there may have been one screen, but for most it could be from two to twenty screens at a time. Do not try to follow the screens, as in any case nothing happens. The plot of Steve and Laurie has the strangest style of filming. This style really does not mean anything, it is stupid and meaningless. Instead of a full-screen widescreen image, this is a compressed widescreen screen that looks like a full-screen widescreen option. Although I do not like others, at least I understand what they were striving for, this one simply does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Music is the saving grace of this film, not that it can save it! Bob Dylan, Simon and Grafankel, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gay and dozens of others have beautiful songs shown here. They do not preserve the function, they just make it a little better than it is. This is still bad! <br /> <br /> In general, this is a meaningless continuation. Any fan of the original should avoid this dim continuation! <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 of ****. 110 minutes PG for language, drug use and violence
