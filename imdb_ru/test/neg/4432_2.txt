Ramsey ?? comedy kings (or it was horror, whatever) wake up after many years of hibernation. And yes, I was scared. No, not because of the element of horror (of course, I am not so squeamish), but because the rats constantly danced on my feet in the Hatmal-Chap theater (where else such films run around). <br /> <br /> So check the plot. A person is repeatedly stabbed, he is stifled to death, stuffed with plastic and thrown into the pool. But he is still returning to take revenge. Was the movie a thriller or horror? This is a wait for you. And the end turns out to be another mystery of the mask. Remember those Ramsay trademarks of undercover agents? men in wacky horror masks. Only here is a mask from a person. I guess you no longer need to detail to skip this movie. <br /> <br /> Amarr Upadhyay becomes overly dramatic and theatrical, forgetting about the difference between the soap of cinema and television. Cheap and modestly dressed Aditi Gowitrikar in its typical pink lipstick looks like ?? .. (Uh! You know that). <br /> <br /> Background score is a straight line from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. No department of the film, whether technical or creative, is worth commenting on. The novelty lacks both history and performance. <br /> <br /> Dhund definitely darkens your feelings.
