Let me tell you something ... this film surpasses all the films about laughter and bloodshed made in the movie "Troma", because in reality he is trying to get to the series as a serious movie. From the terrible game ... "I knew it, I knew that she was obsessed!" ... a priest taking sex and taking a shower with naked teens ... this piece of dung takes the cake. I find it difficult to compare it with another film, just as bad. It may just be in class in its own way. Kicker is that supposedly some kind of cardinal was watching the production to make sure that it was true. I did not know that the people of the United States of Backwoods behave like madmen. I'm not sure if I'm upset about shooting it or stumbled upon the pearl of comedy. It was a very guilty pleasure ... so terrible that I watched half my time with my eyes closed (until I laughed so hard that I cried). The ending simply had no meaning, ideally combining all of this. If you want to watch something awful, funny, here is your movie. If you want a scary movie about exorcism ... move on.
