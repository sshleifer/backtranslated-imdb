In the near future, a dark stranger enters a South American city, an exhausted zombie. Living with a group of friendly people, our stranger recognizes the harsh realities of city life. There are two groups of people; the upper classes, who live safely behind the concrete walls of the city, are provided at a reasonable price by the state police. Then there are our friendly faces of the inhabitants. These lower class people live near zombies. The only way to survive is to exchange the goods they mine during the day for the police in exchange for food banks. Our stranger will find out why his world is a zombie plague. A new diet pill that suppressed carbohydrate cravings was the basis. The desire of mankind to lose fat caused the collapse of society, as we know it. These pills increased the need for protein, that is, meat, even a homemade poodle. However, there was another serious side effect: after death, people became reanimated by an even stronger protein strain, namely, human flesh. <br /> <br /> With the help of what I feel as a figurative introduction, I felt that this film was widely recognized by the inventive material. What better way to explain the reason for the zombie race than the modern idea of ​​wanting people to make any sacrifice to change their body without hard work in the gym? However, the fantasy of this film soon ceased after this exposure. This film falls into the old trap "I can not imagine what the world will be like when society collapses." When you watch this movie, you don't run away to another world, like when you watch “Planet of the Apes” (original), “Alien”, “Mad Max” or “Texas Chainsaw” (original). In this film, an alternative society is defined by people with orange and green colored hair. Face painting and charity store of leather jackets. In this alternative society there is no harshness in life, only healthy faces and flimsy zombies. The films should allow you to run away, but not remind you that you need to clean your wardrobe and take old clothes to a charity shop. <br /> <br /> Forget about some pitiful actions or flimsy zombies. This film fails because it is too polished, too auspicious and too predictable. I have been watching similar films since the early eighties. If you are going to make a film of this kind, I suggest you watch films like Dawn of the Dead (original and remake), Thread or Zombie Fulci again to see and experience this feeling of despair in a devastated society.
