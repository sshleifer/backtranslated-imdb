I wanted this film to be liked, and, of course, there is a place for a psychological film that does not depend on cheap thrills. However, to enjoy the movie requires a believable plot, some rhythmization and editing, as well as a sense of belonging. In The Purification, what begins with an intriguing mystery with abduction and unknown motives turns into a slow, useless, meaningless exercise. Nothing special really happens, and the so-called character-oriented angles (as the director put it in his comments) actually give little. <br /> <br /> Good actors are in vain. Robert Redford is doing his best to attract and outsmart Willem Defoe. Dafoe introduces a few nuances into his character, since some sympathy can be felt for him. It is a pity that Defoe was in the role of a villain, he entered the Hall of Fame typographical works of Christopher Walken. <br /> <br /> Wendy Crewson is usually good, but her role in the film was short and contrived, and I was wondering why they even bothered to imagine her character. By far the biggest waste of talent was Helen Mirren. In the director's comments, all I heard was about her talent. I agree, she is a great actress. Then why wasnâ€™t it used properly? Only at the climax of this film can she show herself, but by then the viewer has stopped caring. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I liked parts of this film, but as another reviewer wrote, as soon as you Halfway through you know that the film will not be much better.
