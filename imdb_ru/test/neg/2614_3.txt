The last attempt to revive the series is actually based on a pretty good idea, but without the required bloodshed / violence for this type of thriller - and thus ... boring! Good special effects, scenery, costumes, etc. But the film turned out just silly and almost a waste of time ... I hope the next release will solve this problem.
