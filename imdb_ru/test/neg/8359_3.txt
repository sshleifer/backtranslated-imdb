There should be a lot of background information that was excluded from the film. In fact, in the film, Lizzy's girlfriend did not even look depressed. She just seemed like a girl who got out of control when she finally got to college, mostly because of drugs and alcohol. This seemed to be her problem, not a mental illness. Of course, she had emotional problems because her father left, and she barely saw him as a child, and her mother seemed a bit there. But the way she treated Noah and Ruby was just plain mean, and I don't think this is caused by depression. She was very much needed, which made Rafe leave, but she was such because of her father. <br /> <br /> But I think that the main reason why this film never came out in theaters is that the plot is not enough and the story is not written very well. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: In truth, I would recommend it only if you are interested in seeing Ricci's first nude scene. Otherwise, it is not very interesting.
