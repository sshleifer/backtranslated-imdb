I rented this one by accident. I picked up the video and looked at my back and thought, "Blair the Shameless Witch." Then, at the moment of negligence, I grabbed the "Francisville Experiment", thinking that it was something else. My horror upon arriving home and the awareness of my mistake was much worse than anything that this film could offer. The boring characters, the bad game and the feeling "we saw the Blair Witch Project and could have done the same thing" get into action to such an extent that watching fast forward will lead you straight to the credits. Iâ€™m not to blame the filmmakers for being lazy or desperate, but after that, I felt the need to warn everyone with a sop: do not waste your time, you have a life.
