What a pity, but also successfully, that two films about throwing pots - Cave and Descent - should arrive at the same time. Unfortunately for The Descent, its exit in the UK on July 7 coincided with the very day of the atrocity in the London Underground / Terror Terror, which killed almost 60 people and hundreds were injured - not particularly good nights / weekends to jump in cinema, especially to see a scary film about pretty women who fall into the trap of a deep, dark, claustrophobic underground cave system. Two films have almost the same elements - about half a dozen or so characters lost in a previously unexplored cave system, and no one outside knows that they were trapped there. Lots of water, caves, dangers ... and, in the end, some evil creatures that look like humans or human beings who decide to hunt them. Where they are so different, this is what the Cave is unreal, absolutely incredible, rather a sci-fi adventure alien adventure than horror or drama. A British film with a relatively small budget (filmed in southern England, albeit filmed in Appalachia) terrifies five pairs of pants, a heartbreaking shock that makes people think that people are leaving the screens early in shock. It confuses the girls in any old order - you really have no idea what to expect next - of course, not she! The descent is also illuminated in a naturalistic manner, which makes it even more scary, unlike the ridiculously lit cave, which resembles Santa's giant magic Christmas cave, the size of the cathedral room behind the room, with a dazzling blue light from ... who knows where while cavers' torches are used exclusively for the artistic lighting of heroes with a granite jaw (each more puppet-like than any Team America / Gerry Anderson / Thunderbirds creation). They carry with them a fantastic amount of equipment, but despite this, the actors with an incredible voice obviously forgot to capture the feeling of impending danger, drama, or anything worthy of a horror movie - this is strictly according to the PG rating. And in this case, the actors act out in the order in which they all expect - I quickly wrote the list after I met each character, only by pulling Piper Perabo out of the sequence. The Cave scenario is only numbers, unlike Shakespeare, a room full of chimpanzees will eventually write it in less than a week ... Take a typical exchange between “good friends,” which goes white and black; "How many times have we been in this situation before being born?" - “too much” (replies Morris Chesnut). I swear, you heard my suburban London audience gasping at the obvious. The worst thing about The Cave is that at the end there is a clear opening for the sequel - The Cave 2: Overground or something else. To be afraid, to be very afraid ... Or instead to catch the Descent and really be afraid, very, very, very afraid. RR
