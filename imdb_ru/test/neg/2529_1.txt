I can not believe this! Were they crazy about making a Connecticut movie in southern California? For God's sake, there is a palm tree everywhere. In one of the opening scenes, the guy says "Welcome to Connecticut" and throws the newspaper, the newspaper says something like "Greenwich Gazette." Greenwich Connecticut does not have a "Bulletin", it has a "Times", as in the "Stamford lawyer and GMT". (Referring to Stamford, Connecticut Newspaper). Maybe the filmmakers should have done a little research, I mean, my god, at least correctly to name the newspaper or film in places that even remotely look like Connecticut.
