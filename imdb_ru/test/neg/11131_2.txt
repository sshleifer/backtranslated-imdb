This film was just not very funny. There is nothing more to say, except that it was a bit awkward for Lawrence Fishburne and David Hyde Pierce, both of which deserve much more than this. In addition, I do not understand why, after this film was fully and fully bombed out, WB insisted on turning it into a television show.
