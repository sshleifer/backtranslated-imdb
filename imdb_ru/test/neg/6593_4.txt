This is based on the life of Michael from 1983/4 to 2004. Flex Alexander performed well, but did not look like Michael. I feel that Michael was portrayed as a stupid man whom I do not believe (although he sometimes trusted the wrong people). I thought that Flex Alexander looked Chinese when they made Michael look white. I think Latoya should have been portrayed in this, she was always portrayed with her brother in the 80s. I never thought that any of the auxiliary actors looked like their colleagues. There were some things that were inaccurate, the son of Lisa-Marie Presley looked about 4 years old at the wedding scene, although he was not yet 2 when Lisa and Michael got married. Also, when Michael tells his mother Catherine that he thinks that they and Debbie should get married, if she gives birth to his child, it was Catherineâ€™s idea that they get married.
