... So some people may argue that this cannot be the worst movie ever made, and no, it is not. I have seen films with weaker plots, worse acting games, etc. <br /> <br /> So why do I hate this film über alles? Well, basically it’s about a man who has been kidnapped for many years, and when he comes out, he tries to find out who did it and why to get revenge. The problem I encountered in this film has nothing to do with blood and horror, but <br /> <br /> *** BASIC SPOILERS STOP READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW *** <br /> <br /> Our main character is basically deceived into having sex with his daughter, and he wants to cut out his own language so that his enemy will not tell her because she did not know. It is so humiliating when he crawls on his knees, like a dog in complete submission. And why did he deserve it? Because many years ago he saw how a brother and sister had a tender moment - wrong. He continued and told some people, and as a result she commits suicide. And viola, this is the brother who made our main character go through all this just for the sake of it. I wondered: maybe I hate this film so much, because I think its punishment is too harsh. Perhaps because I feel that this film does not condemn incest, but somehow mixes it with love. Maybe it's because I was expecting something else. <br /> <br /> *** THE END OF SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Believe me, no one deserves what eventually happens to our main character, and I'm very serious; Do you know how some films just go under your skin and stay there? Well, I felt so damn dirty after watching this movie, and I REALLY wish I had ever seen it. He stayed with me for several days, and some may ask: well, isn't that the goal of a good movie? The ability to influence us in such ways? Yes, it can be, but this film not only made me sick, it made me feel disturbed.
