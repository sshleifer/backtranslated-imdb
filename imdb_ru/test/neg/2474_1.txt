No, * Hitch * is definitely NOT a romantic comedy about the ridiculous (and incredible) former left-wise man — who became the reactionary sage Christopher Hitchens, although that would surely make for a more funny movie. Little dull Englishman with black spots from cigarettes and Guinness, barking advice - and a sharp political comment - to men in love: “Look in her EYES when you talk to her, you are crazy! Conservative "makes you de facto anti-Semitic! Can't you get something straight, liberal little panties?" <br /> <br /> Well, good. Instead, we get Will Smith, whose ongoing success remains, at least, a mystery to me. I, apparently, alone in this regard. At the time of this writing, Smith was the most influential person in Hollywood: Americans simply cannot help but throw their money at him. I, on the other hand, find his complacency intolerable, indifferent to this scene (spoiled by the trailer), where he experiences a strong allergic reaction to seafood. We know that Smith will bounce back to his soft muscular appearance, because at hand is a fat comedian (Kevin James) who makes himself a fool. We have to laugh hysterically every time a slut starts dancing like a donkey (a replica “Everybody is dancing now!” From CC Music Factory), but why does an accountant working with straight arrows behave this way? I’ve worked with several direct accountants for years, and I can tell you that if the cool words of Norman Mailer are “tough guys don't dance,” then there’s an accountant with straight arrows. Do I take all this too seriously? Or - and here's a bold idea - perhaps the writers could not come up with a logically drawn character to save their lives? <br /> <br /> Speaking of writers, they came up with the lousy idea of ​​Smith's love. Interest: a writer for the tabloid (Eva Mendez). Since when do tabloid creeps deserve love? Anyway, what universe am I in? - everyone here, in IMDb, really whips this prank. Either you all need to raise the bar in terms of entertainment value for your dollar, or I am just a skunk at a garden party. (I and about 150 million other long-suffering guys and husbands.) In any case, if I can imitate the Smith Car Show and give my male readers a few simple tips: when you're pulling to see * Autostop *, tell your Best Half "Hey , it was pretty good "after the movie ended. Do not be too enthusiastic; Do not rave about it - she will know that you are lying to her. Praise him in a slightly surprised way, as if the film was better than you expected, and not a painful waste of time, as it really was. But what am I saying, guys? - we guys know all the moves. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10.
