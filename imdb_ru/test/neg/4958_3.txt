I saw a lot of horror films, splashes, monsters in my life. And, of course, a lot of movies about the monsters of the 50s and 60s. When I first stumbled upon this, I thought it was from the 60s, until I found out that it is from 2007. <br /> <br /> In fact, Jack Brooke's character is interesting, and in general the acting game for the movie-splash is pretty good, but .... I expected to splash the film, not a dramatic story about aggressive immersion. The film goes 80 minutes, and I think the first kill happens in 65 minutes. Although it takes hours to explain the story, and the reason for the appearance of monsters is at least 3 minutes ... we have another 20 minutes of boring dialogue and, finally, in my opinion, a not very successful spray sequence. Although we are starring Robert Englund, I recommend it only to real horror fans.
