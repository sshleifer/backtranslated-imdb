Spike Milligan was one of the funniest men I've ever seen, and had a huge impact on my life. <br /> <br /> This film is limp and terrible, and its memory does not deserve respect. The script is cluttered and keeps too many lines from the book intact (the pranks of the legs are incomprehensible here). The performances of the actors are equally ineffective, the magnificent cast is wasted, and the host, Sean Hughes, performs Milligan’s militant hostilities in a mournful cheekbone that is completely overlooked. <br /> <br /> Gentle pace - the killer as well. The farce should accelerate towards the end. The Goon show was often shown, the novel “Puckoon” definitely did, but this film, in any case, only slows down when you want the various elements to come together in the final climax. <br /> <br /> Milligan narrated the abbreviated text of the 1980 "Puckoon" audio recording, with TP McKenna, Dermot Kelly, Norma Ronald and Jack Hobbs. Now it's funny. Ten minutes from this funnier of this entire film. I think that the record was transferred to CD, but I don’t know if it is still printed. <br /> <br /> There is the film “Adolf Hitler: My Role in His Fall” with Jim Dale and Arthur Low. This is also a terrible mess, but it is funnier than this thing. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the spirit of the Milligan is too harsh for the screen. Other reviewers here indulge in politeness and desired thoughts. This film takes advantage of every opportunity and never misses an opportunity to disappoint.
