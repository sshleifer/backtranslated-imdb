I agreed to watch this film with a group of friends, despite my extreme dislike for horror films. However, it was not a shock from the monster that distracted me from this film, but a terrible acting game and an absolutely disgusting finale. Inside or in the Cave there are no redemptive qualities - it is poorly made, ridiculously written, disgustingly bloody, and the inclusion of the last scene repels me. No, this is not my dislike of horror films, which makes me hate this film - I have seen such wonderful teenage horrors as House of Wax, because the film leaves you with a terrible understanding that when you shoot a video you support the creators
