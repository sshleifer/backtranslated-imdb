I liked the whole situation with the Caesar Palace, the Roman Guards and the speakers in togas. This event also marked the passing of the torch, as far as WWF’s voice goes. Gorilla Monsoon, who until this moment played a play for each WWF PPV, opens and gives a typical introduction, suggesting that he is here to announce another PPV. But then he introduces Jim Ross, who makes his WWF debut, and JR continues to make WWF comments to this day. But beyond that, this event is pure garbage. A good ol scientific struggle was thrown out the window and enter the birth of tricks. For me, this was a case when WWF began to go down the toilet and did not recover to the era of relations in the late 1990s. Here is an overview of the event. <br /> <br /> Match for the title of IC: Tatanka (Challenger) vs. Sean Michaels (champion): Good newcomer, but considering what Sean is capable of, it was very disappointing. I have no idea why the World Wildlife Fund was obsessed with putting an end to Tatanka. They should understand that Sean is the future, and Tatanka is just some kind of hyper-wrestler in the Indian trick. The ending of the match itself was very lame. Sean takes the referee and pulls him out and then calls him. While it was fun to watch Sherry being beaten with afterwords, this match was simply forgotten. Sean had to carry this match, and he had problems with its implementation. <br /> <br /> “Brothers Stenie” against “Kill the head”: Steiners won thanks to Franknsteiner. This match had its moments, but the crowd just did not seem to be in it. There was no heat behind it, I think it was a match just to throw two teams. <br /> <br /> Crush vs. Doink the Clown: HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! This match completely sucks. Two very weak tricks. Clown and Hawaiian, dressed in fancy colors. The finale took everyone by surprise. In the following months, Crush turned his heel, and Doink turned his face, but none of the fans seemed to care. Unfortunately, it was not the worst match on the map. <br /> <br /> Ramon razor against Bob Backland: you have a completely new heel that fits very well against a wrestler that you forgot about 10 years ago. Fans laugh and laugh when Backlund comes out. And like Hogan / Rock in WM18 and HHH / Owen in WM14, the heel-fighter gets a louder greeting on his face. Fortunately, this match was short. The right guy won, but I would like to see Razor completely unsettled and crushed by Backlund, and not won in a small package out of nowhere. <br /> <br /> Tag Team Champion Match: Ted Dibiase and IRS (Champs) vs. Hulk Hogan and Brutus Bifcake with Jimmy Hart I still would like to know the full story about what happened to Hogan's eyes. Well. The crowd was really in this match, but it was not a flood to this as ever. Hogan and Bifcake apparently suffered from ring rust, given that both fighters were on the shelf for at least a year. Dibias, being a great technical fighter who he was, helped carry the match out of a waste. The ending was a surprise when Dibiase and the IRS got the win through DQ. But in order to please the crowd, Hogan and Beefcake at the end played with the crowd as usual, as if they had won the match. <br /> <br /> Lex Luger vs. Mr. Perfect: The best part of this match was four hot chicks who accompanied Lex Luger to the ring. Besides this, it was completely forgotten. Mr. Perfect Gimmik was born for the role of the heel, and he simply did not have enough heat as a person. And the Luger is just a waste of time, no matter what trick it is. Luger wins with retreat, despite the fact that the Feet of Perfection were in the ropes. Then Perfect conducts postmatch, having received a kick. First, the Luger knocks him with a running elbow. Then, when the Perfecting One regains consciousness, he returns to the dressing room to find Luger only so that Sean Michaels knocks the crap out of him, making HBK / Perfect feud, which could potentially become a classic, but WWF was used inappropriately. Undertaker vs. Giant Gonzalez: ABSOLUTE CREW !! What did WWF have in mind, attracting such a terrible fighter as Giant Gonzalez. Of course, he had a size, but I would prefer to watch the Brooklyn fighter in a match than behind him. This is not even worth commenting on. <br /> <br /> WWF MATCH CHAMPIONSHIP: Bret Hart (champion) against Yokodzuna (rival) You have one of the greatest technical fighters of all time, opposing the guy who has the only advantage that he has a giant fat Bret able to carry the match, but a rather predictable ending with the fact that Mr. Fuji threw salt in Bret's face. <br /> <br /> POSTAL MATCH: Yokozuna vs Hulk Hogan Pure shit right here. Hogan descends to the ring for no apparent reason, and Mr. Fuji challenges him to the match after Yoko has just won the title. Even die-hard Hulkamanyaki find it to be a complete BS.
