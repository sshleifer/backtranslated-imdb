What can you say about the film in which The Erotic Witch Project looks like an English Patient. Again, the plot and characters are secondary, but the plot is almost an exact replica of TEWP. <br /> <br /> Four attractive female sisters and a stupid guide enter the forest in search of a naked girl, and women become sexually charged. The naked girl leaves the porn device and puff up the doll, just like in “TEWP.” They get lost, the dumb person gets lost, and the girls return to their hotel. There, they recreate the end of the “Blair Witch Project” when the cameras fall, and you can see how the guide plays the classics, a game that is an integral part of the subtle plot. <br /> <br /> At least three of the sisters of the female community here have unnaturally large breasts, full of dimples and stretch marks, along with rather obvious surgical scars. The only "natural" girl here is humiliated by the director. In the very unfunny and too long segment of the final loan, the cast scenes, where she could not get the right line, are played again and again to nausea. <br /> <br /> Julie Strain appears in a terrible wig to play naked girl This one scene seems to be added later, since no one could be enlisted in the cast of the cast. In the background, as women jump and stroke, you can see someone's fence. This may be the backyard of director Jim Winsky. <br /> <br /> These are just bad things. Lesbian love scenes on kelvin degree, than in the "Project of erotic witches." Most of the love consists of four women who squeeze their eight collective breasts together. I think they are trying to form a silicone life form that would save them from this bad career decision. There is no such luck. If imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, then the creators of "The Blair Witch Project" must be truly crazy. <br /> <br /> This is unrated and contains mild physical abuse, profanity, nudity of women, sexual content and sexual references. <br /> <br />
