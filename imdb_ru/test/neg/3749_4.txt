According to most of the people I know, who watched this film, and to the reviews that I read, it should have become a very interesting thriller that should be watched by a large number of people. I did not expect that this film would hit me, but I certainly did not expect that this film would be mediocre at best, which is. <br /> <br /> French films are not alien to me, because they are both French and having studied them as a student, I know about clichés and banal plot twists that may go unnoticed by an English / American audience. There are some great French films that should have received a widespread international release, but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the plot is both contrived, too complex and too clever to be interesting. so you really feel every minute of its 2-hour and 5-minute run, and by the time everything finally shows up, you no longer care. The main character lacks any real charisma or even acting talent to focus mainly on him and his journey at any time near the end of shit, so by the time you even thought to swallow the main plot twists, he began to dawn on you that you wasted your time! I actually remember how I disconnected before the credits began to roll after the film was reunited — it was at that moment that I was sure that I was almost wasting my time. <br /> <br /> The film is not the worst I've seen, but it seems overvalued. For example, I read somewhere that he surpasses all Bourne Identity films in terms of uncertainty or even that he has “wall-to-wall voltage.” I can say with confidence that some people are promoting this frankly boring movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10 is a generous and attentive rating for this film, which I feel, and since I saw several full and complete stinkers, I will therefore save 1, 2 and 3 for them.
