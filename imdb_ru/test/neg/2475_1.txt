What is wrong with American films these days? Hollyweird continues to make films in which men behave like women, and women behave like men. Idiot man, director and screenwriter of this film, you need to check your head. The main problems of this film are his frank feminist images of the sexes. <br /> <br /> In scenes of the bar, Eva Mendez and her friend jump out of beer bottles, like sailors in oil. the tanker does it in a bar in Iceland. Mendez constantly kisses every girl she sees after that. She also dresses defiantly in every scene, but still swears like a guy. She becomes very emotional when she fights with Smith for a while, trying to “protect” all women from the bad guys everywhere. <br /> <br /> In this film, men are no better. What we see is a group of idiots trying to do everything possible to win a date. The men in this film are concerned to get either sexual services or the inability to speak clearly when faced with a woman. Men in real life behave differently. <br /> <br /> What we see in this film is the product of a culture that has become erroneous. Everything plops. Guys act like girls, girls behave like guys. All this is done while preserving the extreme attachments of the sexes for the most part in history. Men are shown as soft and stupid, but most of the time they are only interested in sex, while women are shown as macho and domineering, but only as a manifestation of their emotional insecurity. <br /> <br /> This film would be good if it were not contemptuously presented to the audience. Content is not the culprit. This is a way of presenting content.
