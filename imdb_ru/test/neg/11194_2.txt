(This review will have some very obvious spoilers, so be careful.) One of the friends brought it, and we did it in 45 minutes of the film before we decided that Fast Forward 8x Speed - the only way. that this film should be watched. There were moments when we watched the movie at a normal speed, when I left, cooked part of the dinner and came back to find out that literally nothing had happened. 2 lines of meaningless dialogue were exchanged. Nothing happened in the background, no important facial gestures were made, nothing but awkward, awkward silence. <br /> <br /> This is NOT how to make a thoughtful film, especially when the plot of the film repeats the same basic Hollywood film trails. If I told you that Disney is making a film about 4 girls starting a band, and the singer was a French exchange student, what do you expect from the emerging “conflicts”? <br /> <br /> Should the soloist overcome the stage fright? Does someone have unspoken love? The group is late for the performance, and the minor character has to buy time? <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * <br /> <br /> All this happens in this movie. <Br /> <br /> In this film there is not the slightest concern that these girls will not be able to achieve their goal. <br /> <br /> * THIS COMPLETES SPOILERS OFFICE * <br /> <br /> I like Japanese movies. I spent a lot of time in Japan. I work in a Japanese company. Hell, I even know all the bands that are referenced in the collections of records and MD through which they pass, and I sang karaoke with my friends on the title song. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst movie from Japan I have ever seen. Do not be confused. Although the characters in the movie will have moments when they do typical Japanese school things, this is not a “typical day in the life” of the movie. This is "a day in the life of four extremely random, highly conflicting, awkward Japanese students." <br /> <br /> There are also noticeable problems with the DVD. Wiz decided that a great producer would be reading aloud the Wikipedia article on Blue Hearts. What a value! In addition, they care so little about subtitles that the name of the group in the subtitles “Paran Maum” differs from the name in the menu for selecting the chapter “Paran Marum”. In the final scene of the auditorium there is a VERY visible reflection / glittering effect on everything, but this seems to be a mistake of the original film. <br /> <br /> 2/10, do NOT browse unless you absolutely love an awkward silence.
