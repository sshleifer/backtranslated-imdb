It would be wrong and reprehensible of me to advise you to see Killjoy 2, you should have the best things to do: wash the car, throw stones at the stream, but at the same time it is not as bad as you probably think it is. almost a full-fledged movie that can handle much more than most DVD movies. Killjoy 2 really helps Trent Haag's manic move as a clown of the same name, he throws himself into the role with such a feverish refusal that he almost tilts the scale in favor of the film, but, of course, this requires more than one person big shoes. Tammy Sutton gives the most interesting directorial cameo from the time of Roger Corman in the movie “The Creature from the Ghost Sea”, and all this is almost destroyed by a hasty, sweet ending. Everywhere and almost fun.
