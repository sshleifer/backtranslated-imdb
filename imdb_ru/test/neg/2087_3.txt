I have to say that “Desserts” was one of the worst films I've ever seen. The game was terrible, and even the storyline was funny. I gave him 3 out of 10 instead of 1 because I like to laugh at painfully banal films. My expectations were not high from the very beginning, but they turned out to be more difficult than I expected. I thought that everything was not so bad when it started, but as soon as the name of the competition appeared - “Golden Halo”, I began to change my mind. Everything went down from there. The only thing I liked about this movie, apart from the ridicule of its ridiculous plot and dialogue, is to watch how they cook. However, being a film about pastry chefs, there were minimal scenes in which they actually baked something. I would recommend watching the cooking channel instead of this movie. You see more food being cooked, and shy away from pathetic lines. However, if you like banal love stories that are sometimes funny, keep looking.
