Of course, I disappeared into the cinema. Neil Young's concert film The Heart of Gold. <br /> <br /> Over the years there have been many great concert films. The best of them was Martin Scorsese's Last Waltz, who filmed the band’s last concert at Filmore West. Phenomenal concert and phenomenal film, that is, if you love rock and roll and you feel as if you were born in it and were part of the music, and you could be in a band, if you had the best guitar and someone would show you chords and that with a few chords and lyrics or two you could change the world ... as you can guess, I felt all five to the base of my twenty four year old soul. <br /> <br /> Neil Young was in The Last Waltz. They had to be in digital form, before they were actually digital, they had to manually scrape off the large hanging cocaine rock that had been squeezed out of his nose, so there is a bright light in the film that is not a Bethlehem star hanging above his lip and below his nostrils ... This is the famous story of rock and roll. <br /> <br /> But the Last Waltz was created when the group and Nil and everyone else were over thirty, and the Heart of Gold was taken off last year, when Neil is over sixty, and his group looks like they were in their late nineties, and the entire film could be visually used by Christian Rights and the DEA just like those Ohio State Patrol films about the dangers of drunk driving were used when I was in high school, showing dead teens hanging through front windows or hanging from a tree or bloodied in a ditch. <br /> <br /> Close your eyes, and this is a stunning concert, open them and look at the hidden portrait of Dorian Gray. An example of this is the once beautiful Emmilou Harris, literally coming out of the darkness to sing with Neil and out of the darkness into the light, like a ghostly ghost who jumped out of the river in front of Rivendale. Awful, ghostly, nose that does not appear in nature and is not an advertisement for plastic surgery, eyes that make buttons on dolls look lively, and the ability to express any emotions, human or not, limited by rampant botox indulgence, My mind went berserk ... porcupine ... Peru ... Jack Daniels ... lived hard for decades ... Oh my God ... sweet Emmylou Harris, whom I saw, sings for free from Fred in Boulder, the face of the year 2000 Faroa will not accept. But the voice, clean, like a thick Boulder beer bottle brewed out of the water of Boulder Creek, closed his eyes and smelled ammmmmbbbererrrrrrrrgerrrrrrrrssss (a tribute ... Boulder Mall and in Steve Martin’s Pink Panther movie). <br /> <br /> This would be a terrific concert, sitting in the dark at the Ryman Auditorium, maybe twenty rows back. But in close-up, in close-up, it was a medieval play about morality, depicting the horrors of self-indulgence and the consequences of sinful life. <br /> <br /> The theme of the concert, decorated with scenery, “Wind of the Prairies” ... the last song, massive guitars (I counted eight), and I wondered if the irony was played. I do not think so. Native American bassist, lead guitarist who looked and dressed like Buffalo Bill, a pianist whose face resembled a screamer’s “Scream” by Munch’s singers (in fact, vocalists, mostly resembling the lost senior United) youth flight attendants they are still plying over the friendly sky) they are dressed in appropriate long denim dresses in full height ... no, they played it straight. <br /> <br /> None of them saw, I bet, Mighty Wind. <br /> <br /> This would be a great CD, and he would be happy to tell stories about the hippie dippy Boulder, when Neal was a long-haired Canadian singer, whose indistinct lyrics seemed to reflect emotional pain and loss, while feelings universal, as it is now, <br /> <br /> But only in the dark bar.
