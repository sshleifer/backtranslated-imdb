My God, WHY did I spend precious time on this film? It is pathetic, sooooo OTT and unreal, and one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. Yes, MY LIFE. I’m ashamed of the Yash Raj films, the poor fellows are forced to live with the terrible news that yes, they shot this horrible movie. <br /> <br /> This is by far the most disgusting, sexy, eyebrowning film I've ever seen in Yasha Raj. I cringe for them, I really do. Along with the terrible game (or NO, for that matter) Hud Chopra, combined with Tanisha’s lack of talent “Look at my boobs”, Neal and Nikki have nothing good in this. Even the music does not conform to the standard left by YRF. Directed by Arjun Sablok did an incredibly bad job here. Honestly, I expected more. Much, much more
