EVAN ALMIGHTY (2007) ** Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Lauren Graham, Johnny Simmons, Graham Phillips, Jimmy Bennett, John Goodman, Wanda Sykes, John Michael Higgins, John Hill, Molly Shannon, Ed Helms, (cameo: John Stewart in He himself continued the “continuation” of “Bruce Almighty” with leading Curl Evan Baxter, leaving television to begin his work as a novice. A congressional representative is fully occupied when God (Freeman repeats his holy role; Jim Carrey wisely avoided “calling”) demands that he build an ark like Noah, and fun comes (or should have happened). The Godforsaken comic book script by Steve Oedekerk, Joel Cohen and Alek Sokolov is absolutely unconvincing, and only the kind person Karella surpasses his conceited Evan in something resembling a man. The end result is a large amount of bird crust jokes and total bloating (CGI F / X is reportedly worth $ 175 million). Sykes steals the show as Evan’s sarcastic assistant. Blasphemous unfunny. (Dir. Tom Shadyak)
