First I have to say that I liked the first movie about the underworld. I was intrigued and curious about vampires and lycanes and so on. In this last part (hopefully) of the series, I just feel sorry for how miserable the vampires are. At least in the first part you had tight leather clothes ... now vampires seem to be besieged victims of poor pest control. They look and behave like arrogant white people. <br /> <br /> Some ideas were neat ... it was all interesting to people. It is a pity that the game was terrible. Slave, too, was doable. <br /> <br /> Other things just startled me. Spoilers now. Castle walls that you can jump in a few steps? Enemies who do not attack during the day? Big bad ancient vampires who have been fighting for ages and running away from the young leader Lycan in a minute? Werewolves, that the lair is close to their enemies? Lycans who raid weapons depots ... for what? They do not use axes and swords or armor! A vampire leader so unskillful that he manages to withstand almost everything? The novel is so unconvincing that sad. <br /> <br /> So I do not recommend this film unless you get it online or buy a very cheap movie ticket. Some actions are good for OK. Of course, vampire armor and weapons are interesting. Otherwise, a very weak script, which was poorly compiled and uses all sorts of silly plot twists.
