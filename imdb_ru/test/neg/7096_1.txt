When I watched this movie, I thought that I was a freshman in high school, and I still feel that I’m charging Master P for an hour and about 20 minutes so that he can take away from my life that I will never return. /> The guy who already wrote is absolutely right. Master P is an imitator gangster. He, like all other rappers in this country, earned millions by selling rap discs to young impressionable white children in this country. It is widely known that the crowd was not black, and black was forbidden to participate in it. It is unfair that this can be rappers can not handle. This film draws Master P like a gangster named Nino? The script is terrible with acting. Absolutely incredible. While searching, I found a link or something that said that he plans to make another film called “Black Soprano” !!!! <br /> <br /> Please save us from this and stick to Nickalodeon. You are not a white thug, you are not even a good actor Master P, please stick to your music for the sake of someone who listens to it these days ...
