Animated special effects, terrible game and dialogue, and a dry plot! This film has it all! My friend and I went to the blockbuster to find a terrible film that we could laugh at, but it was too much. The film begins with a woman and her son, resting on a fictional island in the Bahama region. Women who are simply doctors / virologists are in the zone when a man falls. He has a strange wound on his arm, and she immediately realizes that this is a contagious virus. The following describes the strikingly quick romance between two teenagers (this is justified by the fact that the girl says: “I know that this is fast, but this is just nice.” ????) In any case, the whole island is infected with this CDC virus introduced. We are told that within three months, if the virus is not cured and contained, it will spread to the United States and kill millions of people. This information does not prevent the CDC from leaving the island to save itself. Fortunately, a cure for this terrible virus was found on time, and the whole island was saved. To celebrate the death of their loved ones, the inhabitants of the island organize a grand party, in which everyone dancing, having fun and forget about the terrible epidemic that has just occurred.
