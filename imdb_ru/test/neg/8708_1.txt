This film deviated from the Bible and fell below the level of the 1956 film. I hate that they replaced the 2006 film with more than 10 commandments. In this film, Moses looked like a criminal, and not like the kind man of Charleston Heston in the 1956 film. I will not waste my time watching this movie again. They tried so hard to modernize this film to keep you on the edge that it was more like a soap opera (and this is not very good). I am almost sure that the young, who have never paid attention to the initial 10 commandments, may not agree with me, but with each of his. In addition, it took them 10 years to complete the first 10 commandments, and it probably took them 2 months to do this. The special effects were not as amazing as the first, and after all these years with so much technology, you might think that now they will be better.
