The saboteur was one of the few hitchcocks I still had to find, and I was half overwhelmed. The French name “La Cinquième colonne” (i.e. “The Fifth Column”, a very catchy phrase for underground spy and sabotage organizations) set my expectations quite high, as was the image of the final on the top of the Statue of Liberty. <br /> <Basically, Saboteur is as carefree as the 39 steps (note that this is another evocative phrase, even McGuffin as the title), but it lacks much of the humor (so the characters are quite mundane), and this is definitely not such a fast pace. As a film chase across the United States from Los Angeles to New York, Saboteur drags from sequence to sequence. Consistency on a villain's beautiful ranch? A beautiful ranch, a beautiful villain, but on the whole rather tame, in fact it means nothing. Meeting with the blind, mixing with people from the Circus, the sequence of Soda City, the sequence of balls in New York? They fail, bringing in more characters with very little added value. <br /> <br /> One big problem I can pay attention to is the relationship between leaders Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane, who don’t add up like Robert Donat. and Madeleine Carroll in 39 steps. Consequently, the entire narrative structure is floating, depending on the addition of new scenes. And the new scenes only bring us closer to the end, since it is unclear whether the lead is the hero’s salvation from the police, from the villains or from his actions aimed at curbing planned sabotage. In the "39 steps" it was clearly spelled out as 1 / escaped from the police (so you know that the hero cannot just go to the police), then 2 / running for his life and after the villains, to prove his innocence. <br /> <br /> If you want the best Hitchcock from the propaganda of the 40s, I would advise you to choose a Foreign Correspondent instead of Diversant. Both films - chase with a catchy finale, really exciting, not only acquaintance with the "Foreign Correspondent", but also beautiful spectacular scenes (umbrella crowd, fields of tulips, strange mills ...).
