I recently went to a free screening of a soapy girl where the filmmakers attended. before the film, they walked around, laughed, took pictures. I was excited to see them dressed in real life, and could not wait to see the movie on the big screen. <br /> <br /> During the film, viewers burst into laughter. then it was clear to me that they were not laughing at the picture, but at the picture. it is pure class B film without any logic. add nudity, blood and whales! you have a movie! <br /> <br /> After the film, I approached a group of directors and asked them why they wanted to make this film. they all acted as seriously as if they were serious directors. each of them told me something different: to make a scandalous film, a funny film, a film of encouragement, a socially responsible film. everyone mentioned something of their own. It was clear to me that none of the directors knew what film they were making, and now they were trying to get their money back by publishing this film in any way that people could see it. <br /> <br /> Let me warn you: do not buy into advertising! if you seriously have nothing else, it may be worth your while for a student of a film to learn how not to shoot a movie. otherwise, you better save two hours of your life.
