A few weeks ago in the cinema I saw a poster of the film “El Padrino” (2004) with the inscription “Latin godfather”. How did I get limp, I thought, Hispanic just because he is Mexican? Let me remind you that ANYTHING Latin comes from or is related to Latium, Italy, so the original guy in the movie “The Godfather” is more Latin than the Mexican Godfather, and here's why: we are called Latin American people because we speak Spanish, a language based on Latin, which originated in Rome, is now Italy. Therefore, placing a tag on a movie poster, for example, “The Latin Godfather”, is not just ignorant, of course, if we try to link this film with the original godfather, but a desperate and uncreative attempt to get some credit by copying the title of a classic movie. Now about the film, I just hate to replay, so from 1 to 10 I think it’s the 3 most.
