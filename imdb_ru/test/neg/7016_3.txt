Who the hell had a bright (?) Idea to play Lucille Ball in this movie ??? It was supposed to be Angela Lansbury's baby. At the very least, Lucy should duplicate her singing. <br /> <br /> There is some compensation in the fact that Jerry Herman's score is fairly well preserved, except for “This is how I feel,” and we do play the original Broadway actors Jane Connell and Bea Arthur, <br /> <br /> I guess Robert Preston needed to give a song, hence the inferior “Loving You”. <br /> <br /> In general, I think that the wrong redhead was thrown in this film.
