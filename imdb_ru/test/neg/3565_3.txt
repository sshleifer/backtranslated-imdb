This is a painfully boring, slow movie. We may feel some sympathy for the socially and sexually inexperienced Tomek, but Magda’s motives are rather difficult to see, and the ending, at least for me, was incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> It may be that we all need love, but I would get more value from a good Busby Berkeley. <br /> <br /> I was told that there should be no less than ten lines of comments, so I’ll add that in the background are some interesting snapshots of relations between Polish citizens and government officials and institutions. I wonder if this should depict it before or after the fall of the communist government? <br /> <br /> Finally, watch out for the clever way that people at a gas company investigate if there is a gas leak in Magda. plate.
