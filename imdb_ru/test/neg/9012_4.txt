What a parody of the unfairness of movie ratings is 2.1 on the IMDb scale when I write this. Guys, this is much closer to 3.0, I will even go out on a limb and say 4.0, where I put it. Come on - how can you make a film about a network of static electricity surrounding the earth and alien amorphous cell structures, and not give it at least 4.0 for creativity? Then you have all that great dialogue, like - "Dave, look at the composition of this dirt." You know, I don't think they ever returned to this mud. No matter, this is the film for which the fans of the film “Z” live, and now I can rest easy. In fact, I saw it quite a few years ago without a proper assessment, along with the names of Corman, such as “Attack of giant leeches” and “Woman wasp.” I don’t know what a passion can be, but quoting a character from the film - “Whatever it is, it works fast!” <br /> <br /> Returning to this alien amorphous cellular structure - I liked the idea of ​​the third element competing with your standard red and white blood cells. When astronaut John Corcoran (Michael Emmett) returned from the dead, I had visions of a scene that could have been the forerunner of the “Alien” of 1979, but this did not happen. Instead, budgetary restrictions reduce the picture to a reckless "big bird", despite the fact that this concept is almost a decade away. Who knows where one idea ends, and which one is another? <br /> <br /> Listen, this is not so bad. Not so good, but not so bad. At any time, when you can associate astronauts who have made an emergency landing, with alien creatures that are ready to seize the Earth, you will get a winning combination. Add a cheese monster factor and you're on your way. Just remember: "A wounded animal of such a large size is not good."
