The alleged “scream queen” Debbie Rochon and her group of border prostitutes are traveling west to the named place and face horrific murders that are the result of the cult of former confederate psychopaths trying to resurrect the south through senseless reprisals. <Br /> <br /> Action and anticipation push into the background a lot of boring dialogues and uninteresting character development. <br /> <br /> Billy Drago is good at the ungrateful (not to mention senseless) role of a city suicide bomber, but everything else. There is very little about this western scum, including the city and the fort, which look like western western tourist traps and Costumes similar to those bought in Party City. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a big favor and watch Ravenous instead.
