This film is not at all like “City of God”, you may have the same feeling, but this is not the case, there is neither intensive filming, nor intense scenes with drugs, you understand. If you ask me, I think that this film was a waste of time, there are many other films that give 100 times better value and training than The Wooden Camera. Yes, I may be the only one who gave a negative comment on this film, but this is only in my opinion. This is one of those films where I may get the impression that I'm shocked, but when the roles start playing a role, my friends and I all looked at each other, and we all laughed at how funny this movie was. Therefore, to complete this question, I advise you not to watch it. <br /> <br /> Personal note: it was a big mistake for Africans to speak English. In the City of God, they used their native language, which gave the film much more strength and reality.
