I saw this film once in a children's party at the North Park Theater in San Diego in 1959, when it was released, and I was 11 years old. It was one of the three functions that were shown that day. <br /> <br /> I haven’t seen it since then, but I would like to, because I am a movie buff and appreciate horrible, as well as great, good and average movies. <br /> <br /> What I remember most vividly is that the more sophisticated audience, consisting of children aged 8 to 15 years old, howling with a laugh at the monster of the tree. <br /> <br /> A triple theater bill featuring 3 adventure films is something that the 11-year-old does not forget, but I can't remember the names of the other 2 films. (One of them was filmed in the George Montgomery and David Farrar film.) UPDATE: The other two films on this triple bill were much better. It was “Watusi”, 1959, with George Montgomery and David Farrar in the lead role, and “The Angry Red Planet”, 1959, with Gerald Moore and Naura Hayden. Ms. Hayden also wrote a couple of books on health and fitness.
