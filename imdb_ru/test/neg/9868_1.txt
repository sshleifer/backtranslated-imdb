Without a doubt, this is a movie about comics WELL. TERM !! Yes, it is worse than Dolph Lundgren’s The Punisher (1989). Yes ... worse than in the films "Captain America" ​​of 1979 and 1991. Oh yes, it's even worse than when Christopher Reed wrote the script for Superman IV: In Search of the World. Damn ... this film was so bad that the guy who played "Nuclear Guy" only acted in one other film, and he was only on T.V. = oP <br /> <br /> This film has the quality "D". I had the opportunity to watch it on SciFi channel back in 1997. I heard that it was pretty bad, but I had nothing else to do that night, so I decided to check it out. What a waste of an hour and a half. It would be better for me to watch replays of Different moves. In addition to the brightest special effects and the worst acting skills I've ever seen, the whole script was just awful and not directed at all. Fortunately, a new film “Fantastic Four” is being prepared, and, I hope, this version will make the heroes fair. I was hoping for a new SPAWN film in the future, but it has not materialized yet. <br /> <br /> Do not shoot this movie. If you happen to see it by cable, check it out. However, be careful, you will most like to switch the channel after the first 15 minutes.
