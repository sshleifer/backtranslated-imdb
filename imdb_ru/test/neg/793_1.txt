For the first time I felt that I needed to write a review. <br /> <br /> I have seen thousands of films in my life, and I like the wide selection of films. I am reasonably open, and I can easily say that I liked the film, although I still say: “Yes, it was not good, but I liked it.” I can appreciate the mastery of such wonderful films as “Reward Show”, “The Godfather And American History X. I may like good movies in the genre of horror or comedy, even if the film is not so great. I can even enjoy a bad movie that just entertains me (Bloodsport). I will also try to evaluate the film fairly, even if I did not like it. Charlie Chapen's city lights were not a film I liked, but I can appreciate the game and the plot lines of the time. <br /> <br /> I think some people, when they visit this site, instead of accidentally clicking a rating, should take into account a few ideas. Try to rate a movie based on how good it is. Do not let your personal bias affect the rating. Also look at the other moves that you rated and compare the movie you are going to evaluate. <br /> <br /> This “movie” was the worst rubbish I've ever seen. 2 hours of my life where they just stole. The game was terrible, in all directions. Scenes where at best changeable. However, the real shame was the story. For the first 20 minutes, we actually had a story that tried to find meaning and transfer the viewer from point A to B. However, after that it was a nightmare. They continued to try to add new elements, but did not explain anything. Nothing really ever made sense if the manager was dead, if he was alive, if he hit the light, if he was really lighting, if he was an alien, if he was an alien, etc. The only positive thing was that we did not care where we were just happy to leave the theater. <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 ??? What is wrong with some of you? I admit that 8 of us who were so crazy to see this, we thought: “What will make it better?” And we decided to tell some of our friends that this film is good, so they will have to suffer and watch this film. What can I say, misfortune loves company. This is the only reason why I see a rating of 6.5. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your life!
