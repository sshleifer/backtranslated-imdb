this film is so bad but it's so bad that I laughed at my ass. for people who love movies, don't watch it. For people who like good and bad movies, I recommend this one. plot lines are wobbly, the script is terrible, the action is terrible to mediocre the soundtrack throughout the movie was trite, but I liked it. cool phrases were a plus. ha ha "if it can bleed, it can die." fighting scenes hacked me. it seemed to me that they spend more time in these places than in any other, because the fighting scenes were for the most part fairly clean. I almost feel that this film could be good if it were not for the d / x .... no, it would still be a splinter. the eye was commonplace. and as the chickens were eating the guys' stomachs in the kitchen, they could have done something where she had to eat something, or at least put more fake blood on her face. and the explosion of the lighthouse disappointed me. I thought they could get real fire instead of crappy computer synthesized things. and the ending was so predictable that it surprised me when they actually did what I could do. so in general. I say this is a classic as far as shit movies go. it's in my bottom 5.
