For most people, RoboCop 3 is a movie that really is a big shame for the Robo series. He has few fans, and most people hate him for his shameless commercial approach to PG-13. Now I'm not going to say that RoboCop 3 is good. Honestly, it pretty much sucks. But, being properly filmed and performed by the film, it surpasses this piece of chaos. Yes, the truth is that RoboCop 2 is the worst of two bad and unnecessary sequels of almost a masterpiece. So, if RoboCop 3 turns Robo into a cartoon superhero in an ultra-mainstream production for children - at least he does it openly. I don’t know where RoboCop 2 begins and ends, I don’t know what or about whom I am talking about, I don’t understand what is going on in it, I don’t understand which jokes are intentional and which are not, I will go crazy, if I try to understand the characters, I don’t see anything of value in what someone is saying, I can’t believe that someone looked at the shooting script and thought it would work, and I can’t believe that Irwin Kirchner saw I finished the result and realized that he liked what he saw. He probably did not, neither Miller nor Weller nor Allen. It is not difficult to understand why. <br /> <br /> Now RoboCop 2 has fans, I know that. They mainly belong to this league of absolute anti-claims, dismissing anyone who expected any depth or subject from the first film, as students of academician Roger Ebert Sieve. It’s just fun, good action and great fun. Yes, I think, if you are just not listening to what the characters say, you can fool yourself that we could have Arnold in costume instead of Weller. Don't get me wrong, I like a good fighter, with pure entertainment value, because this is the only - the most pleasant - dignity. But RoboCop 2, sir, is not such a thing. <br /> <br /> Look at the first couple of scenes. This terrible actor Robo reiterates that he is just a machine, and then enters this operatic speech about how he could never be a man, when after Murphy's wife (who sues OCP for pursuing robots) enters flat place and has this sad little moment with him, and then never heard again! Of course, I would like to enter this scene of the film behind the scenes, because everyone has such an absurdity. As if a twelve-year fan boy made a script, the characters behave quite randomly and say it first, and then they say it. The OCP wants to stop the crime with the help of the new Robo, especially this drug called “nuclear weapon”, but then it seems that they really just want to become this big capitalist empire and control the entire city ?? the policy is abandoned, I think that is understandable, given the mayor of the comic relief, the villain (played by Tom Noonan, who did the best version of this in Last Action Hero and says a lot) is a drug addict, but is still used for this car. The woman behind it all has an agenda that cannot be understood. <br /> <br /> Speaking of twelve-year-olds, this film plays the notorious role of “The Hub”, this crazy guy who swears and kills people, played by a children's actor. I am not going to be morally motivated about this, this is a free world, and if you want some kind of psycho-child in your action movie, do it. I don’t know how much of Frank Miller’s original vision was invested in it, but credits at least recognize him as the creator of the “story”. And, if I scale down, I can see in this a rather cool character. It is dark, of course, to have a child-killer-maniac, but again, this is the world of RoboCop, and who will be surprised? This whole OCP business, trying to become a giant monopoly on everything, is truly anti-utopian and good. In addition, the idea of ​​RoboCop contacting his wife and child, somehow including them in history, would also be beautiful, and, as I understand it, a natural and logical step if they now had to make RoboCop. <br /> <br /> But of course, these are just ideas. As many people have said, the script is 100% messy. The child has one scene (the scene of torture) where they hint that he is in fact just a child spoiled by stereotype, and then we have this unimaginable scene where he dies and becomes soft and friendly towards his head. Why doesn't he just take his ultrasound and try to stop him with his last breath? Isn't that what his character would have done? Does he think about his life for a second in his deathbed? Not necessarily, given that his last words "sucks," so why? This is really meaningless, and it can be said about everyone, not about everything, in this film. Is there a strike at the police? DO YOU HAVE A RoboCop Machine Or A Man? What was Robo doing in 10 minutes? I mean, of course, it's pretty funny, I wouldn't deny it. But why create it and then discard it? And why the hell is Allen so criminally undervalued? and what it is, Weller has an obvious desire to express his character, and yes, well, in general, there are many flows, and the disorder is immense. <br /> <br /> This review is as confusing as the movie. The only reason I give another star is the actors from the first film, I'm sure they had good intentions. I mean, this is something stable, a kind of anchor in this sea of ​​bad movies.
