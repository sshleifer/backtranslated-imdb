Well, look, this show is the worst show on Nick @ Night I love so many shows on Nick @ Night, and I love them. When this show came to Nick @ Knight, I was so annoyed. This is such a boring show, and it is trite. Of all the times I watched, I found one episode a little ridiculous. In this show, some of the most ridiculous and stupid jokes in history. This show sums up terribly. Give props to Fresh Prince Bel-Air and George Lopez. This show is boring and no less clever. This show should have been canceled much earlier. I don't think it deserves to play Nick @ Night along with a few classic shows. This show lacks ingenuity, good jokes and style.
