First, I liked the book more than the more popular Da Vinci code, and although the DVC film was not well received, I liked it and I bought a DVD. However, there is no chance that I will ever again want to see "Angels and Demons." <br /> <br /> The film is almost not like a book, in fact there is only a general premise of the story. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning of the film I was disappointed; in the book, Robert Langdon receives a call and a fax from Maximilian Koler, director of CERN. Who finds the Father’s body (cannot remember the name), and then asks Langdon to come using a super fast plane ... In the book, the only people who knew about this technology created by the Father and Daughter team were themselves Camerings ... In the movie however, a huge team was involved ... so there was never any tension ... as they learned, etc. <br /> <br /> Leaving, or rather changing it, the whole story was a huge mistake, and I thought what made this film bad ... it changed everything that happened since then when Camerillingo collided in the Pope’s locked room , it was supposed to be Maximilian Kohler, who shot the video from his wheelchair, the commander rushed for Kamerlingo, but Olivetti was shot, in the film it was the commander in the room, and Olivetti was shot ... right, but I was bored and I can't remember the events in the film) ... <br /> <br /> There was no love and The idea was between Vittoria and Robert, and in the book she was not at CERN when he arrived, and was indeed involved in her research work. In the book, all four preferences were killed, but in the film the last of the four survived in the fountain. In the book, Vittoria was kidnapped, and Robert had to save her, and it was they who killed Assassin in the church of the Illuminati, and did not blow up, as he was in the film Cameringo. The block where Robert was imprisoned under a stone coffin was not there, saved by the alarm of his Mickey Mouse watch. Well, in the book we tend to believe that Langdon jumped out of a helicopter, fair enough to say that it stretched a bit, but it was important in the film because he had to run back with the film ... There was no mention of how Vittoria and her adoptive father were involved, it was also important to get to know Vittoria’s character. <br /> <br /> In all the worst films I have seen, I would have left early, but my brain was numb and I temporarily lost the use of my legs. A truly truly unsuccessful attempt, and none of Ron Howard's best actions, in fact, the way he gets work again, is beyond my power !!! I want my money back !!!
