Roller skating vampires ?! Sorry, but even for the 80s it's just too stupid to be frighteningly remote ... You can excuse the original with a strange moment of kitsch, because he parodying old movies and TV shows, but this was done once, so the sequel needs to be a little less lager , not even more outlandish! In addition, the first film was attended by Chris Sarandon - a man who could even make discos in everyday knitwear seem seductive! - this is very lacking, so there was no “danger” in what happened, it seemed silly. <br /> <br /> Admittedly, I only saw it once when I was 7 years old, but by that time I was already a huge fan of the original I remember how disgusting I am. For me, there is no continuation of Fright Night, only a sticky deception that does not deserve any assessment.
