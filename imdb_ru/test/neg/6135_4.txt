Ordinary Army Gene Kelly, who is also a talented trapezoid specialist, comes under fire for doing bold stunts without a net and pushing away his high-ranking cohorts; Meanwhile, there is a carefully thought-out “camp show” for soldiers and army personnel, and the entire M-G-M studio came together for fun. Mickey Rooney plays MS (unconsciously), presenting performances as Kay Kaiser and His Orchestra, Bob Crosby, Benny Carter and Dancing Girls M-G-M (who seem to be dressed like vegetables). Red Skelton plays great with Donna Reed and Margaret O'Brien, but the other comedic beats suffer from an obvious vacuum between the performers and the supposedly live audience (they are awfully silent until the editor cuts them for exaggerated reactions)). Judy Garland sings an out-of-place song about Carnegie Hall’s jumping night (incredibly accompanied by classical pianist Jose Iturbi, who Judy calls “hep”). The production is glossy, but the manic energy seems to be false, fabricated. ** from ****
