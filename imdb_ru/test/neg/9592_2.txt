This film has a rating of 7.0 on IMDb, so even in its brief review I felt something rotten and decided to try. What a waste of 100 minutes. First of all, the 80s were not a good decade for the genre of crime and thriller. Most of them in those days were badly made with a stupid conspiracy (if they were), so very few can stand out, and even if they were good, they are still not very good. Heath, however, suffers from everything that made stupid pictures of crime stupid. He has a bad development of character, an incredible plot, and he was not written or directed decently, and when you have such flaws, the acting does not help. Stephen Frears often tried to imitate the French new wave in making films in the English style, and the two do not coincide. <br /> <br /> First, Terence Stamp has been hiding for 10 years because he testified against some of his former partners in the crime. He hides in Spain from all places. He finally caught up and then was kidnapped by a group of stupid-looking Spanish goons, just drove up to two killers, who had to deal with him. These two are John Hurt, who is supposed to be a hard-boiled, cold stone assassin, and Tim Roth (in his first role) as the devil's disciple. They do not kill Stamp immediately, they first get rid of the "three Amigos", they should not have been hired in the first place, and then they bring the "Stump" to Paris, because one of the friends against whom he testified, wants to confront him . OK, this is possible. But even though Stamp was so dangerous a figure that they had to hire four guys to defeat him, they did not tie him up, did not disable him, and did not drive around with him, as if he was one of his friends. Mark does not mind and gladly goes to Paris to be shot, without using any of a half-dozen chances, these “professionals” offer him to escape. It seems that Tim Roth is just a bully schoolboy, which makes the idea that a big crime boss unites him with such a clever man as John Hurt, even more incredible, especially in such important work as this one. But than John Hart is not so strong, he spends twenty minutes of the film, killing or not killing completely extra Australian, played by Bill Hunter, whose only goal in this film is to present the beautiful Laura Del Sol, his mistress (he says , 15 years old, but she is more like 25), and whose role in the plot and acting ability suggests that she was offered this role solely on the basis that she was the mistress of the director or producer at that time. After much deliberation, Hurt kills an Australian, but takes his mistress for no apparent reason. Than he wants to kill her, but Roth, in his “subtle ways,” convinces him not to do it, so even if she kicks him, bites him and scratches him throughout the film, he remains true to this deeply buried human side of him. <Br /> <br /> How are your simple idiotic scenes, for example, when Hart and Roth lock the car outside, trying to prevent people inside from getting out?!?! In any case, the film is delayed. Tim Roth falls asleep, guarding Terence Stamp with a gun on his chest, and Stamp just waits there, watching the waterfall. Then the whole plot of the plot comes to the point that everything we have seen in the last hour and 20 minutes just flies out the window. Let's sum up. The point is not to kill Stamp immediately (except for the film) in order to take him to Paris, so his former partner must have the last word with him. And the whole point is that he did not run away, is that he is ready to die, saying: “This is just a moment. We are here. Then we are not here. We are somewhere else ... maybe. And it's as natural as breathing. Why should we be afraid? "But my friends, this is where the plot gets distorted when Hurt kills a person while he is still in Spain, and we ask why worry and drive for a few days, he could do it in the first 15 minutes, and, unlike his Philosophy, Stamp is very afraid of being killed, so we ask again why he didn’t run away, and he had many chances. solely for romantic (read sexual) reasons, so she remains alive again, even if attacked Hurt for the 15th time in the film. He killed everyone else, but not hers, she should have the maximum view of the screen. The film was shot on a “shoelace” budget, and it shows, but when you have no stories and the characteristics of the cardboard, it shows even more. And yes, Fernando Ray appears and passes through the film as a guest star, having the only audible line: dialogue.
