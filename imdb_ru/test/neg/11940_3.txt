When I saw the trailers for this film, it was like a good romantic comedy. I was expecting a bit of fluffy fun. Instead, I was bored and a bit depressed. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there was no chemistry between the characters at all, and there was little, if anything, funny in the film. The little girl was adorable - when she cried, I cried - but I thought that they could use someone a little younger in this role. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film was filled with long, boring silence or swollen opera music. I am not against the opera, but I would prefer them to spend this time to introduce us to heroes who were tough and underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed with this movie. All the while I watched it, I thought about how much better it could be.
