Of all the directors who ever sat behind the camera, Wellman could break your heart faster than anyone. Even Ford. But this is one of his worst. Even he seemed to know this, probably due to the fact that he treated the jejun, not much higher than Bonanza or the Great Valley. <br /> <br /> However, there is one moment, the typical Wellman, which appears out of nowhere to destroy you - the death of Indian wife Gable. She went to give her child some water, and WHAM was instantly killed by an arrow. No warning nada. <br /> <br /> One of the most shocking, unprepared for death in the whole cinema. Especially after a full hour of love for a lady in what looked like a juicy western. Of course, later her attitude to the film is associated with the complete indifference of Wellman. However, it is a reminder of the strength that he always had at his best.
