My original comment on this particular title was deleted by the IMDb user or staff just because I just didn’t like this film to such an extent that I had to sincerely write what I felt after watching this bad excuse for the film. Where is my freedom of speech? <br /> <br /> Obviously, this film was made by students because it was so lame and amateur. Of course, even they have to start from somewhere? The script was incoherent, as was the cast. What can you expect from low-budget and b-class actors? In some places, there is some kind of CGI, so bad that it looks like something on an old PC. Some may say that this is a kind of "alien" clone, only this time Dracula (in vintage costume) sucks the other one by one. The sets are inconclusive, cheap and small (boiler rooms), although the story unfolds on a large spacecraft. <br /> <br /> It would be interesting to know what the stars (Erika Eleniak, Casper Van Dean, Kulio and Udo Kierra) think about the film after it was released ... Kulio must have been the worst rapper ever to be an actor in history! <br /> <br /> It was a waste of my time and money, I don’t know why I even bothered to make this film. Honestly, I just hate this movie. With The House of the Dead, Uwe Boll Dracula 3000 shares the dubious honor of being the worst movie in history. (Well, I saw even worse than these two) <br /> <br /> Avoid! Any other movie would be better.
