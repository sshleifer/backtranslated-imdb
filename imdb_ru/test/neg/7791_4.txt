I like Noel Trus, wit. I like Noel Trus, the play is written. I like Noel Coward, a composer and singer, but I hate the actor Noel Labor. <br /> <br /> For me, this is a man who had to remain firmly behind the scenes, write his own plays, compose his music and make his deep and funny observations. He could never be allowed in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, he is one of the outstanding talents of the 20th century, but man simply could not act, and his voice .. ... with rolling R and an excessively rounded tonal quality ... well, on my mind, he can grate cheese very easily. <br /> <br /> This is one of my least favorite proposals from Trus, as he unconvincingly depicts a psychiatrist starting a love affair with a much younger woman, aggravated by the fact that a much younger woman is an old school friend of his much younger wives. <br /> <br /> Celia Johnson is the same joy, as before, to watch how cowards offended his wife. It is her performance that saves this film from dull stupidity. I believe that her own little affair in Trus's “Short Date” four years ago qualified her for this role, as she must have raised several eyebrows when playing such a messy woman, and this gave her a chance to win back some fans and earn some lost sympathy. <br /> <br /> She was such a wonderful actress, and you can understand why Noel Kaward used her so much in many of his productions. <br /> <br /> However, the rest of the film is boring, poorly played, predictable and generally boring to an almost constricting ass level. <br /> <br /> If you need Noel Trus, take a moment to see In what we serve, Blythe Ghost or This Happy Breed instead. Three Noel Trus treasures. With such great movies, I suppose we can forgive him for this turkey. <br /> <br /> I gave these four stars solely for the addition of Miss Johnson, but in general I would have avoided it like the plague. ,
