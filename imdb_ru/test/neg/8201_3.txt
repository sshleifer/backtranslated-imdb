This is a very budget film, shot in one place in a valley protected from radiation. The cast, an elderly man and daughter, a handsome visitor, a couple (hard shopping and a gallon), a tramp, a donkey and a person affected by radiation interact during the consequences of a nuclear explosion. To this is added the essence of observing women who take a bath. <br /> <br /> They all have weapons, some shoot, some say they have children, others kill, others just get carried away and this is a film. Harvey Korman's first film, it shows some simplicity in making a film. To avoid expensive filming, the actors go through the curtains to get in and out of the house (that is, in the studio). Snapshots taken on hills near Hollywood are the backdrop. <br /> <br /> I would not say that it is worth it to watch from the outside, but it is interesting to see how films with the participation of people were made in the 50s. ,
