This film is not among those films so bad that you get annoyed and angry, because it seems so idiotic, and yet not at all ridiculous. It's just that there is nothing interesting in this movie. There are no real jokes that surprise you, you just look for 80 minutes and then turn it off. I bought it on a very budget DVD, and I am glad because it does not cost much. This is not even one of those films that are so bad that you can watch it with your friends when you get drunk / high and laugh good. I don’t hate it, as I hate some movies, but it’s pretty boring and you don’t have to waste time on it. <br /> <br /> Only those people who voted for 10 votes for this film should be connected. one way or another, because I can't imagine that someone really loved this film, except for small children, passing the time
