It's a shame. There is an interesting idea here, but it is completely lost due to the confusion of computer effects in the style of Commodore 64 and the poor storytelling. The plot, as it is, concerns the bounty hunter shower. It should be a pretty straightforward hunter / hunter story, but the director and / or writer seems to have forgotten what the film should have been when they were shooting for about three days. The fact that the main villain looks as if he has a cheap Darth Maul mask, which they tried to disguise with the smooth colors of computer graphics, does not help anything. Not much to recommend here, even the title seems to promote it to obscurity.
