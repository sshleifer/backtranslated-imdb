This film had potential. If it were handled differently. He needed another director. That's for sure. And perhaps another leading lady. I just can not understand the character of Minnie Driver - or, at least, how she played it. She was absolutely incredible. I can't believe she would have liked her performance in this film. She was probably left by the director or unable to give what the director was trying to get her to do. I write this as I still watch it. I think I would not want to be in her place, trying to “act” on something I did not understand. Well, we just got down to the business that she starts with her son (I'm still watching). Now I begin to feel deeply embarrassed for everyone involved in this enterprise. If you like to watch movies that greatly miss the mark, watch this one.
