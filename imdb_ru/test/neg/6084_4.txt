It's a shame that such quality actors as Baldwin and Booth are forced to succumb to lousy stories and scenarios just for the sake of money. But hey, it's a cruel world ... <br /> <br /> It's just another one of a long series of thrillers, killers that use all the usual narrative twists to make it more attractive than it is. Of course, it has good locations, excellent production, good camera work and editing, and overall it's pretty good. <br /> <br /> So what's the problem? Simply put, the whole package is just incredible. However, instead of spoiling the rotten story for you, I will let you find out what the point is, that is, whether you can get through it. I managed, but only because I like Baldwin, and I continued to hope that it would be better. <br /> <br /> This is not the case. And it had one of the most anti-climatic endings that I have seen for a long time. In fact, maybe never ... <br /> <br /> But this is harmless fun, probably, if you have nothing better.
