Firstly, this film is not completed yet, I guess that someone really tried to steal all the other pages of the script. <br /> <br /> The film contains strange time travels without notice, inconsistent dialogues, inappropriate details; moreover, the music is not bad at all, except for inappropriate tracks, and, besides, the volume increases and decreases between different tracks. In fact, the cutting has done an excellent job, and it says a lot. Wrong sound effects destroy stress. <br /> <br /> Luke Perry does what he does best, just looks worried and sometimes coughs from hell. <br /> <br /> I seriously regard this film as the worst of 2007, and I have seen some bad ones. Do not spend money on it, it is not so bad, it is laughter, it is worse. Ratings above 1 star should put the blacklist on IMDb, because it is damn wrong.
