You can always tell if I enjoy the movie by how many times I cross my legs, change position, make small rustling sounds, etc. And so on. And so on. The less = the better. I went through so many times in this film that I managed to knock over my friends' giant popcorn bath and get a huge workout to strengthen the hips. <br /> <br /> Sobieski, a young actress who in some moments in the film “Soldier” “The daughter never cries” made some promise for her talents, played poorly in a poorly written role. The depressing fact number one. Number two: Chris Klein was at it. The dismal fact is number three: Chris Klein had lines. Number four: Chris Klein played goodbye. Wow. Mannequins from rich families unite! Worse, he is actually trying to act, but he manages to sound like a mentally retarded hyperactor in an increasingly juicy and independent version of the film “Cecil B. Demil.” Go back to your American pies. <br /> <br /> This film was terrible in almost every sense, with the exception of Josh Hartnett’s soft-hearted performance in the role of the stiffened Lealy guy, Jasper. Fortunately, he refrains from trying to have too many "moments", unlike all other characters. Of course, this is why he is much better than the others, and in fact he shows some courage here. If you like Josh or you are going to play a guy who knows a few things, he is your man. <br /> <br /> Hartnett is an insightful actor, but the rest do not need to be criticized anymore. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 (for poor Hartnett in this terrible movie) <br /> <br />
