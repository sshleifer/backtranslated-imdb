James Cagney plays Richard Gargan (nicknamed “Patsy”!), A Former gangster who now watches obscene guys as the new head of state reform. Genre recording in a warm theme, where Cagney is the whole performance; he dominates the picture, but only because there are not so many interesting things here. Jimmy gives only what is expected of his hard-boiled persona, which can be satisfactory if you want to quickly fix the situation. The direction (Archie Mayo, although Michael Curtis was said to have helped) is simple, not particularly exciting, although the narration slips in the second half, turning the film into a messy conclusion (even with Petsi Cagney lost in shuffle). Reworked in 1938 as the "School of Crime", and then in 1939 as the "Hell's Kitchen." ** from ****
