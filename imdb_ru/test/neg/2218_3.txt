"The core of the Earth" was on television yesterday. I was working at my computer and accidentally looked around and saw which must have been one of the worst sequences of actions. I was immediately fascinated by the crappy production value of the film, the terrible acting game (including everyone - even Peter Cushing) and the horrifying, unintentionally funny action movies and puppet monsters. <br /> <br /> A film about a Victorian scholar who takes the stereotypical American hero Buff on a boring journey in the Welsh countryside. Little did they know that in the center of the core of the earth lies a great evil .... Forget that the name does not make sense. (If they really were in the core of the earth, they would be about 2700 kg / m3 underground and burned alive in a sea of ​​iron or anywhere else.) , to be the most feigned of all time. No, the real genius “At the core of the Earth” is its naive nonsense - an insane action without real actions and without a real spectacle. In fact, this is just a fanatical film, and stupid. People who like things in the MST3K style will like it - it's terribly bad, but really so bad that it's almost weird.
