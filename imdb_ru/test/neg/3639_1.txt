Shopping, sunny skies, beaches, boarding school for rich teens and perfect happy endings. Welcome to the life of Zoe Brooks and her friends. Zoe Brooks is portrayed by Jamie Lynn Spears, a self-proclaimed actress who gained her fame thanks to her younger sister, international pop star Britney Spears. With her beautiful blonde wig in the first season and the attempt to hide her monotonous village accent, this confirms that Nickelodeon really went to the dogs with nepotism. When Christine Herrera, the actress who portrayed Dana Cruz in the first season, left the show, all hope vanished, since she was the only decent actress. Female casting is a complete shame, but male casting has the potential for teens. If they continue to pursue Jamie Lynn Spears as a picture of perfection, so many people will have to lower their standards. Hopefully, they will soon discover that you cannot make a career out of nothing. Jamie Lynn Spears is useless for acting, singing, and everything she tries to do for this downward spiral, which she calls a career. It is no wonder why she is a self-proclaimed actress. Critics will certainly declare it something else.
