For a film that I was really looking forward to, I was very disappointed. I did not expect this to be another Amadeus, but I expected a more significant image of Beethoven in recent years. <br /> <br /> Ed Harrisâ€™s performance was superb, but the storyline was so weak that the film simply moved. from one dreary scene to another without any continuity. <br /> <br /> The only pleasant part of the film for me is the performance of the 9th, and from that moment I could well have safely left without a finish. <br /> <br /> I have left a feeling of dissatisfaction and still feel that something important is missing.
