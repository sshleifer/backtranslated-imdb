There is only one reason you can watch this movie. Until Schweiger. He is such a good actor, the film is not really terrible. Uwe Boll, please take up another career. Special effects and actions are acceptable. All other aspects were very disappointing. All I can say is that Kevin Smith (Evening with ...) talked about Tim Burton, who never read Batman comics, and it showed. Uwe Boll never played video games, of which he continues to make films. If you ever want to know how this is done, visit Andrzej Bartkowiak. Doom was one of the best video games to adapt films. Some people may not agree, but if you watch the movie, you will see that the ID guys are directly related to Doom. It does not seem that someone in UBIsoft was even close to this production.
