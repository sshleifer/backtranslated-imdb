if I could rate it as zero, I would come from someone who loves films about the shock / exploitation of that time and Waters as a whole, I must say that it is useless. <br /> <br /> It does nothing, serves nothing, the idiot with the camera and the desire to prove their intelligence by rebelling against social standards - it all looks like. <br /> <br /> His completely amateurish, both in principle and in execution, it does not make sense, his zeal is for the sake of disgusting, obscene with the wit of a Neanderthal, its useless. <br /> <br /> Someone said that Waters probably “laughed” at all the bad press and disgust that others gave this film, but why? If I had shot a short film depicting a man in the bathroom who had tended shit for ten minutes, I would surely get the same conditions, but why would I be proud or “chuckle” at the same time? <br /> <br /> It may be because I am so unwise that I have to resort to this so that I can say: “HA! Take this censorship and mainstream! I am so rebellious that I do everything I want and take it off! ”<br /> <br /> Waters should not be proud of this mess, water lovers should not watch it, it is useless, that is, without any use. <br /> <br /> He does not even have to meet the criteria of art for art. <br /> <br /> To love or defend this film is to defend something that was intended as an anti-cultural tool that should be put forward for the mainstream audience in modern conditions. This film is a hot topic of films. <br /> <br /> Useless and outdated. The film Poser, which requires him to be recognized as a rebellion.
