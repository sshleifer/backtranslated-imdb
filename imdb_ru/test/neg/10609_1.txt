So, this is Friday night, and you want to watch a movie ... all you need is something interesting, not too elaborate, or something that may require a long night of philosophical discussion. So, you pay 10 dollars for viewing Mod Squad. The trailer for this film was supposed to notify me, but come on ... these are three of the most beautiful people in Hollywood - the sweet tooth. But this is all ... a series of Prada advertisements. And what have Hollywood producers forgotten? Plot. Why do these children run through the streets after some unknown enemy? Where are they? But don't worry, after a while you just stop caring. I was on the verge of leaving this film because I thought that sitting in my room and looking at the wall might have been more productive (and free), but by that time it was already behind (90 minutes is only saving Grace ). So are you still willing to spend 10 dollars? Go get yourself a nice hot meal.
