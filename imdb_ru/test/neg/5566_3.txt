The actresses are cute, and the scenery is simple, quite ok. In addition, nothing will save from this film. Incredibly bad game, stupid to tears dialogue, too much of the expected plot, a lot of nonsense and inconsistencies (for example, a pretty young girl gets hit on the head from the morning star, and not only does she survive, but barely scratches!) ... In short, because it's not worth it anymore, even fans of the genre can avoid it.
