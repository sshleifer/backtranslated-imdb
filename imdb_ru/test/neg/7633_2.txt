Rebecca De Mornay can be a charming beautiful actress, but as for the roles she played, if you can't say something pleasant ... <br /> <br /> De Mornay portrays a woman who had terrible injuries as a child with the Father, she can hardly stand now, when she has matured and has become, of course, brilliantly shrinking. She has an affair with Banderas, whom we suspect of (oh! How original!) Serial killer. Sometimes she remembers the mother of Banderas. Tippi Hedren's hero in Marnie. But I would not count on it: Hitchcock died twenty-four years ago, and many regents are desperately trying to replace him. Here the director is doing everything possible to make the thriller with an unexpected end, but this final is so contrived that it is absolutely impossible to buy it. The film includes the obligatory “talk with a serial killer” in the tradition of “silence of the lamb”, murder (human beings and cats), a split personality and an open final in case the crowd demands more. no, and they were right.
