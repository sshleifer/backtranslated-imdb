Isn't it depressing how the most brutal cartoon in the Cartoon Network is aimed at girls? Although I don’t watch the soldiers shoot and blow up on "Saving Private Ryan" or "Brothers to Brother," it would be nice if there was a cartoon on TV or anything that I could watch to satisfy my cruel motives . And something that I won't laugh at watching. I saw some episodes (I really need to shoot for this), and I had to watch a movie (now, where can I find a gun?), And it’s quite clear that after the first few episodes he lost his spark. If you like to see 500-foot monsters that can in a few seconds destroy huge cities that kids kill about one foot tall, this is a must-see. But over time, it becomes very boring, and with such a show, even original ideas become mostly boring. The film just looked like one long episode (I can't remember any of this), and the villain should have been much more intimidating than the green monkey. This show is ridiculous. He releases the same basic episode after episode after episode, and although from time to time he may try to guess and intrigue, the ending will always be the same - “The cool girls will save the day!” Everything is good and good, but everything is very, very repetitive .. I give him 3 out of 10 for the fact that this is the only dangerous cartoon on CN that revolves around violence, although it targets girls, so I will not tune in for it ever. I have established myself as a fan of war and violence films, and this reputation will not be destroyed ... 3/10
