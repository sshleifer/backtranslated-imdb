The actors and actresses in this series are fine, but the scripts were absolutely terrible. This family is so dysfunctional that they are not even funny. In fact, scripts very often illustrate how not to be a parent. The scenarios are so bad that they make Homer Simpson look like a better father than this one. <br /> <br /> Anyone who becomes a parent, if you want to see what not to do with your children, this show is the perfect guide. I think the rubbish that feeds us is beyond words. <br /> <br /> Michael Rapaport has seen much better material in his career (including his role in HITCH). They need strong leadership in the best and much better scenarios than what I have seen up to this point. <br /> <br /> If you think this is a generation, my teenager even turned off one show of this because they thought it was so terrible.
