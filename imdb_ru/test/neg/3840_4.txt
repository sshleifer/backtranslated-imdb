Like most everyone who watches this movie, I did it for the stars Michael Madsen and Dennis Hopper. Two are extremely undervalued and, unfortunately, because of this, the headers have a lot of crap. In this film, Hopper plays a guy who accidentally kills a blackmailer and gets help from the mysterious Madsen. <br /> <br /> The film is actually not as terrible as it could be. I have seen both that and the other much worse, both independently and together (LAPD, terrible movie). The direction was rather bad, and the script took several rewrites, but both showed the best possible performance with the proposed material. Also, the final is pretty strong, so you can tell that the story had potential. But when a glowing film review sounds like this: “It could have been much worse,” it says nothing about the movie itself. <br /> <br /> In general, this is one that can be easily missed if none of these actors attract you. But if you're a fan of one or both, give him a watch. They both give strong performances that overshadow the film’s apparent flaws. Believe me, there are much worse options.
