Savage Guns (video title) is a very cheap, bottom barrel spaghetti western in which the survivor of the massacre hunts thugs who killed his brother and left him to die, catching up with them in a city controlled by their crooked boss. <br /> <br /> Despite the large number of cruelties, it manages to be both dull and colorless with poor characteristics and almost without imagination or humor. <br /> <br /> Main actor Robert Woods justifies his name a wooden and charismatic performance that is not able to cause any warmth or sympathy at all. In other words, the viewer never hurts for him, despite the fact that he is the main character. <br /> <br /> The worst scene (in my opinion) is an annoying scene in the dance hall, where a woman sings in a heavy and terribly non-sexual German accent. It was the worst scene in “Shining Saddles” and the worst one here!
