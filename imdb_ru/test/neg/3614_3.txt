A large variety of snakes puts a rebellion on tourists, "invading" their island because of damage to their captain's boat. Those few survivors who were not vulnerable to snakes will try to escape, their goal is to escape to the existing boats that can safely take them from the island. <br /> <br /> Presented directly with injectable doses Visual humor featuring the many snake snakes, SNAKE ISLAND Wayne Crawford, shows many different breeds of slippery predators in a striking position, ready to attack their prey. Star William Kutt, as the author exploring the serpent for the upcoming novel, has fun in his role along with writer / director / colleague Wayne Crawford (as the captain of a tourist boat) as worn heroes who look at the most serious crisis. Kate Connor is Crawford's attractive love interest, a lawyer on vacation. Other cast members serve either as tourists or as a film crew, mainly snake food. <br /> <br /> As in many other films of this type, the director Crawford shows live snakes with computer, and the violence is really tame. Crawford even uses a camera review technique like the eyes of a snake when she looks at a potential victim (... with an actor looking directly at the camera). Never to be taken seriously, the “mocking” approach was probably the best way to shoot SNAKE ISLAND, because the premise is too ridiculous to take it on your own. <br /> <br /> Effects and waiting scenes rarely work because Crawford is often unable to successfully create scenes where people encounter snakes. Snake attacks themselves also never occur on the screen (... one or two vertices), or are presented so weakly that they leave little impression. It's no no for a genre like this. Catt fans will probably want to check it out, because he does provide some facial comedy that sets the general tone for certain scenes where he has to defend himself from snakes. The CGI scenes, where we see a large number of snakes in the general area, are not very effective, which eliminates the realism that Crawford might have tried to establish. There are many better horror films in which snakes are the aggressors than SNAKE ISLAND. Amazing moments of nudity, relegated to the scene, where tourists and the team are resting after a long day with sparkling, not knowing what the danger ahead.
