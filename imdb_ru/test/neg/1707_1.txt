There was a time when Michael Jackson was honored as the king of pop. Then the time came when he attracted negative advertising as much as lemonade attracted wasps. Finally, now is the time when we really feel sorry for this person. <br /> <br /> This “film” is another reason. I promised a mad fan of Michael Jackson to watch him with her. You know the type of fan — someone who tells him — or she likes to love everything the object of affection has ever done. While watching this movie, which she had already seen twice, I realized how far this fandom goes. Probably far enough to rate this movie above 1/10, as some people have done in a miraculous way. <br /> <br /> The film is trying to be a parody of many other films and TV series, in particular Rejected, Lost and Jurassic Park. Unfortunately, it fails miserably at any level. The actor’s game doesn’t save an absolutely horrible story, the shooting has the quality of too often played videotapes, special effects were better done in Be Kind Rewind (for those who don’t make this film now: with aluminum foil) .. It would be funny if turned out, well, ridiculous. Unfortunately, this is not the case. It hurts to look at it. <br /> <br /> And then Michael Jacksons appears in this garbage. He appears on the projection screen to convey an important message, and he manages to meet with such a mobile as Jabba the Hutt, and as serious as the 4-year-old. Just when I thought: “Who is that horrible person who seduced this poor man to participate in this film and make a fool of himself again?”, I (finally) reached the final credits and found that the film was actually partially shot according to Jackson. Neverland Ranch. In other words: he. Like. It. <br /> <br /> This film and Jackson’s participation in it is really disturbing. Do not even look at the effect “haha, the film in IMDb Bottom 100”. Or be warned.
