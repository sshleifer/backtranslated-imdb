Frank Falenchik: Not that I regret killing them; I'm sorry I killed them badly. <br /> <br /> Wow! Talk about swings and misses. You have a great cast and a great storyline with endless possibilities ... how do you do it ?! Well, apparently, John Dahl found a way. With a terrible scenario involving jokes about such a funny, like malaria epidemic, and dialogue so painful that none of the characters becomes cute, “You Kill Me” can become the biggest cinematic failure of 2007 The good news is that Ben Kinglsie offers another great performance as an alcoholic assassin who is trying to clear himself, but the stuff he has to work with is shit. Leoni’s tea is as good as Luke Wilson, Dennis Farina, Bill Pullman, Philip Baker Hall and the rest of the cast. I think the best way to describe “You Kill Me” is a terrible movie with good features. Rating: D +
