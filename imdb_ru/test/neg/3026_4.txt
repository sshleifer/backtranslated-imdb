Directed by E. Elias Merhidzh "Born" - is an experiment with several interesting ideas that are not quite successful in what they tried to do. The film is a 76-minute ultra-slow, dubiously effective, annoying experience that attempts to present an intriguing philosophy about the creation of the Earth and human nature. <br /> <br /> It begins with the fact that God appears as a psychopathic chair in the chair. A man who breaks his stomach using a knife. From the guts out the blood and human waste. She continues to infiltrate herself with the sperm of a dead god. She later gives birth to the Son of the Earth. A delay that constantly insults a group of cannibals, which I consider to be the representative of humanity. <br /> <br /> “Born” looks at the origin of life distorted and anxious. Demonstrating self-destructive nature, violence, lust and greed that have become a trademark for humanity. The problem in the film stems from two points. Firstly, the film is too slow in its exhibition. What we get is a good thirty minutes, spent on showing how the Son of Earth is constantly shaking naked on the ground, while at the same time undergoing harassment and torture by humanity. Such a tasteless extension quickly becomes boring, and it lacks a blow to the sensations of the viewer. <br /> <br /> Another point is the look and sound of the Beggothena. Grainy, inverted black and white low-frame cinematography captivates the disturbing factor of the plot, but such novelties often work only for short periods of time. Then gradually begin to lose its effect, as the viewer gets used to the appearance. Audio suffers from the same problems. It is constantly repeated, and such sounds become so annoying that I had a desire to turn off the sound. The "born" loses its charm soon after it begins. He tries to be original and creative, but he fails to reveal ideas that are hinted at by a vague plot; instead, he repeats the same scene over and over again. <br /> <br /> The conclusion is: “Birth” was stuck at one moment, Despite the fact that the plot is trying to move forward, the visual effects and sound remain unchanged. Displaying the same action in a slightly different way with a slightly different sound. A trick can't make a movie alone. He also needs pace and variety, which Merhige seems to have forgotten about.
