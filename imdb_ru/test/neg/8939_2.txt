The most obvious flaw ... horrible, horrible script. This film had a potentially good story, but it was destroyed by poor dialogue, problems of continuity, things that were never explained, gaping plots, secondary plots that have not gone away, and just plain nonsense. Not to mention the terrible cliche directed by Sandra Locke. Even two great performances could not have saved this film. So it didn't matter that Devon Hammersall and Rosanna Arquette give awful ideas. The fact is that they are better actors than this film. The best of the Arquettes in Rosanna Arquette (Silverado, After Hours, Desperately Seeking Susan) have some wonderful moments - for example, a magnificent scene at the beginning, when she painfully removes her handcuffs - but gives a generally weak game by her standards. And Devon Hammersall (Dick, when the pipes disappear, and my brilliant so-called life) is much worse, acting without any convictions or emotions at all. But I will not blame actors who were good in other roles. The scenario is terrible, and bad direction doesn't help. Do me a favor ... avoid this movie.
