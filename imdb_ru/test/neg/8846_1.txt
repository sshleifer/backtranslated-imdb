Forget the lousy game you can forgive in this movie. Or even a terrible, unnatural dialogue and illogical events (if my subtitles really reflect what has been said). Much worse is the apparent lack of a skilled or experienced director who may have taken a vacation with the editor while making the film? Watching the film, it seems completely outdated, although it was “only” filmed 7 years ago. Computer virus as a portal to the afterlife? lol? Dial-up Internet access? Stupid ghost images photographed in photographs ("He! Look there ... this ... is this face?" - zoom in on face - - Oh, the sound is interrupted - "beat off" - the next scene -) edited and, as a result, do not work at all. You will observe how the girl discovers a corpse, still hanging from a knot in one scene, and then literally in 10 seconds she will see her again in some place that is clearly not touched, smiling, and walking. <br /> <br /> In addition to many others, I have problems with the film in terms of production value, it is also painfully long and repetitive and, therefore, extremely boring. <br /> <br /> I recommend Shutter instead, an oriental (Thai) horror film that was well made,
