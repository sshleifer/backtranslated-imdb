I am disgusted and shocked by the positive feedback this film receives. He is not only hockey, manipulative and melodramatic. It is also shamelessly offensive. The character of Radio "Gooding Jr." is shown off as a cute animal, like a puppy, so cute that you just want to take him home. This mentality is shameless; Radio is never perceived as a human being, but as a manipulative means of attracting sympathy from its audience. Even more terrible are the numerous moments of the film, in which “Radio” gets into the head / stumbles / falls / etc. At these moments of the farce comedy, the audience howls with laughter simply because "this is ridiculous, because the radio is lagging behind." It is shameless. Now I do not feel that the word “retarded” is generally suitable for describing mentally retarded people, but it seems to be the position of the film: “Radio is lagging behind, but that's okay, because it’s cute and we like it”. The image of Gooding seems to be better suited for a John Water film than an inspirational family drama. To add insult to injury, the film is incompetent at every level, Debra Winger is not inspired by the role of "stereotypical housewives," that the very reminder of her disgusting monologues makes everyone laugh while watching the film. The score of John Horner is pure juice, always covering his tears with some kind of musical score over tired cinematography. Ed Harris is decent in a role that he could sleep, but he manages to hold most of the audience’s attention throughout the film. In conclusion, if you consider yourself a decent person, ignore this parody of the film, read the book, but otherwise skip this horrible film about an interesting character from American history.
