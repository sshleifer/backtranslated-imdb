Good, so not every Australian film is so good. Yes, maybe, in fact, there was very little with much merit. Take Away is an absolute bomb that is considered one of the worst films I've ever seen. I wanted to like it. I thought I would do it honestly. I even met one of the screenwriters Dave O'Neill, so I feel like a traitor, giving a bad review of this film, but ... The plot is quite thin (I will not worry about it ... overview), which I can to forgive: there are a lot of movies that can cover it with a few decent jokes. Unfortunately, Take Away jokes cover her story as a prostitute skirt for $ 2. Probably the only laugh that came from 6 other people in the cinema was about bad play and dialogue. Take Away goes like a week-long dim sim ... You can understand this joke if you watch the movie, but it's not worth the joke.
