This film begins as if it were a comedy. It seems that the actors read the cues, especially in the airport sequence. William Smith plays the role of "Caribe," a hunter who is rather perverted and abnormal. Smith seems to always play villains, such as The Final Warrior (1975) and Little Frisco (1979), although the villainous role in this film seems ridiculous. This is one of those films where meaningless things happen only to fill the screen time, for example, the sequence of girls in the beginning and the long silly race on motorcycles. I give this movie 1/10. I would like to see this film at the Theater of Mystical Science, it would be fun.
