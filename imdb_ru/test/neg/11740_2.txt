* SPOILERS INCLUDED * <br /> <br /> The brilliant and innovative adaptation of the novel by Robert Bloch Alfred Hitchcock was an amazing film, unlike all the previous ones. Every shot, every corner of the camera, every nuance was perfect. He did not just break the rules, he created a whole set of new ones. <br /> <br /> Here is a spoiler: this film is nothing new, special or original. Gus Van Sant does not just pay homage to Hitch, he drops every idea and makes it less original, in a more traditional way. I had nothing against Gus Van Sant before I saw this movie. I liked the pharmacy cowboy, and I thought “My Personal Idaho State” is a very interesting film. When I recall the “Psycho” remake, I have a question: “Why did you do it, Gus?” <br /> <br /> In my opinion, there are only two reasons to do a remake: 1) The original was a good story, but the film sucks. 2) The original was a good film, but someone thought about a new, new approach to the material. None of these factors is generally present in the Psycho Gus Van Sant version. Besides the fact that it is colored, there is one scene in which there is a montage of disturbing images relating to the possible internal dialogue of the title character (which I considered unnecessary), there is nothing new here. <br /> <Also, I found that casting leaves much to be desired. Anne Heche was fine, like Marion, but she lacked a certain vulnerability, which Janet Lee portrayed in the original. I did not feel such sympathy for her character, because the choice she faced seemed much less limited than the woman in modern society, unlike the choice she would face as a single woman living in the early 1960s . Vince Vaughn was lucky to laugh at his incredibly naive Norman Bates, but I feel that the time and nervous, haunted look of Anthony Perkins was much more creepy. The only performance I liked more than the original was Lila Crane's character, played by Julianne Moore. She was excellent, as usual, and brought new strength and intelligence to the character. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there are some excellent camera work, especially during the famous "scene in the bathroom" in which Van Sant takes advantage of his use of color to show the murder in bright scarlet hues. And yet throughout the whole movie I had this annoying feeling of dej vu. Haven't I seen it somewhere before? Oh wait, I've seen it somewhere before! It seems that almost every scene was copied offscreen from the original. Almost there is a feeling that the director made this film as a school project. “See, I can also make a Hitchcock movie!” <br /> <br /> If you haven’t already done so, watch the original. He held on for many years, and wins it a little mediocrity, hands down. You will not be disappointed.
