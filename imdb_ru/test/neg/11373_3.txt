I gave him a rating of 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> And what is sad, I decided to see the schedule of films for this channel, so as not to miss it. I wanted to watch this movie because it is based on the book of one of my favorite authors, Barbara Wilson. As a lesbian, I expected me to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> I don’t know how Miss Wilson treated the film, but I found it a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> This was supposed to be intriguing - it was a mystery - it was happening in Spain, and the main character, Cassandra, is a translator of the language, which is associated with a mysterious, beautiful woman who offers Cassandra huge money to find her ex Ben's husband. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of secrets, but for some reason it didn’t matter. It was like, so what. I could not mess with these characters, not to care about them and not feel them. I could not even identify with these characters. <br /> <br /> I think most of the failure of the film was an actress playing a major role. She looked old, tired, exhausted and boring, like water. Her hair was erratic, her baggy clothes were boring, and she was simply not attractive or interesting. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is to hear Dean Martin's recording, but even she was spoiled. strange makeup that wore a man who danced and sang along with his lips to a song. Believe me, it was not at all like seeing how the crazy handsome Mr. Martin performs it. <br /> <br /> The ending is so thick that you want to eat pancakes with syrup. <br /> <br />
