Besides John Krasinski, this film was just awful. The love story of Lacey Schabert and Andrew Keegan was as mediocre as possible, full of incredibly bad statements about how her parents would never allow them to be together, and longing for Hammy. None of the “emotions” had any depth or reality. Two accented characters (Dean Edwards as Rupert and whoever played the weapon expert) .... As soon as they saw how bad the accents were, they could not just drop them and rewrite a couple of lines to avoid gives viewers headaches? Obviously not. I don’t even know where to start editing, especially sound editing. If you hate the obvious over-duplication as much, don't look at it. At the same time Krasinski was great. Beyond recognition, I'm a big fan of Office, which is why I rented it. But he is quite interesting as an "ordinary friend with crazy ideas." He has a cliché, but he still manages to make it as interesting as possible. The ending was terrible. Just awful. The idea that the robbery went awry had potential, but Keegan floundered after he was shot dead, right down to his workshop, to fall to the top of the picture of Schabert (which is not at all like her) - the worst scene.
