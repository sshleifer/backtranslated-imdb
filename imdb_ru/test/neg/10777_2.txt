The name, although the only one, will undoubtedly remind the true horror fans of the immortal classics of Tod Browning about the squad of circus monsters and how the outside world misunderstood them. However, I can assure you that this “thing” has absolutely nothing to do with “Freaks” or even the art of professional filmmaking in general. This film was recommended to me, presumably because it is raw, disturbing and thought-provoking, despite the low cost of producing the budget. Yes, right?? The person who recommended this to me can now consider himself my personal enemy! Low budgetary factor is correct, but it is about summation. "Freak" is terribly slow, poorly made, and every character that is represented is completely unbearable, and this includes a freak. On the way to a new life, two brothers and sisters encounter a deformed mentally ill, who escaped from a transport truck to another hospital and went to the house where he killed his mother at the age of 9. It could be an interesting slasher with good isolated filming locations, but instead Tyler Sharp decided to do a boring and meaningless family drama. Attempts by the leading actress to look emotionally devastated are rather ridiculous, and the complete lack of expectation and action can hardly be blamed for a limited budget. Complete failure!
