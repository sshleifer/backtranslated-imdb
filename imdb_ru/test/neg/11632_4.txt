Some changes for the better (special effects are more complex), some for the worse (Scott Grimes, a pretty child in the original, turned into a clumsy teenager), but in general this continuation is approximately equal to the original - which does not speak much. The PG-13 rating is uncertain; although the film is not at all scary, there is a bit of a short, but rather obvious smell and some nudity. (* 1/2)
