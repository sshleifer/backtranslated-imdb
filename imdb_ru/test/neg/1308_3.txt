I usually do not write reviews, but for this film I had to. I am shocked by the acting talent in this movement that will be wasted ... the script is terrible ... the editing is terrible ... and the plot is very thin. You spend the first half of the film, wondering who is talking to whom and what on earth they are doing. The second half of the film slows down a bit, but does not have depth or sensation. The only saving grace is a good, but still limited CGI, and location in London. I gave 3 stars for it, and the fact that the actors were still trying to do a good job with the shit they were given. If you want to lose a couple of hours of your life because of the mediocre entertainment program about popcorn-disaster, by all means, this film is for you. But I would recommend doing something else in my free time, for example, to see real material from the online archive! :) http://www.weatherpaparazzi.com/flooding.asp
