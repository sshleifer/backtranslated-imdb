I like CKY and Viva La Bam, so I couldn’t resist it when I saw in Gamestation for £ 1.99. This is the debut screenplay of Bama Magera, created by himself and Brandon Dichimaillo, which starred the entire CKY team (Ryan Dunn, Sam Raab, Rake John, Jenn Rivell, Don Vito, etc., etc.). Brandon is also in charge of the artistic direction - which is one of the greatest merits of the film - his pretty CKYish in his color style - but also demonstrates progress. <br /> <br /> Basically this follows (very weakly) the break between Ryan Dunn and girlfriend Gloren (played by Jenn). Vilo (played by Bam, accidentally named after Vilo Valo?) And Falcone (Bran) play their best friends, who smell like chaos, performing various stunts. <br /> <br /> This is a bit like CKY movies, but with a linear storyline (which is really very simple) and a bad game. Strange, but usually the supersarchic gang seems to suck the life out of them when they know what they want to say next. <br /> <br /> Acting and screenplay are pretty awful, but the second half of the movie is much better than the first (although 90 minutes is the tension for the movie), and there are a number of factors that can help, such as the Tony Hawk cameo, Dichimailo's plots, such as “Awards for futuristic inventions” and “The Diamond Bike ', the soundtrack is also very strong (this is not ALL cKy and HIM - in fact, Bomfunk MC steals the movie in terms of music usage). In the second half of the film, the sense of fun becomes much more real, especially because Don Vito plays a rather prominent role in the latter part, and he seems to be stealing every scene he is in. <br /> <br /> The film will appeal to those who love the CKY antics, but only because of the main material, and not because of the filler or storyline. Oh, and someone will tell Bam that ice skating, especially in movies, is sooo 1998. <br /> <br /> However, the best part of the movie on DVD is not the movie, but the 40-minute film “Like from 'doc. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of the documentary are devoted to the alholyism of Raab himself and the team’s real feelings towards each other, surprisingly frankly (as usual, Bam looks a bit like a member, especially to the Raab drink) problem, and Ryan Dunn looks like a very nice, mundane guy). The last ten minutes of a documentary film about how a friend (who is an infrequent member of CKY) tries to kick heroin while staying at Magera’s house with the team - and there really is a caring unitary side of the gang (especially Monkey and Ryan) - a terrific gem in another boring DVD . <br /> <br /> For £ 1.99, I am very pleased - although I hope that from now on Bam will remain an improvised and short parodist.
