I watched Gomedu in a cinema in my city. My friend picked me up and I was very curious about how it would look. Well, I have to say that this film was not a horror, maybe we can say that this is “Fantastic Experiments” ... Well, I will go anyway ... But there were a lot of problems with filming, acting, drama theatrical and telling stories I can understand, because the director is very young, and Homed is his first full-length film. Well, the direction of this film was not very bad, I see. Unfortunately, due to the limitations imposed on the film due to its extremely low budget, the visual effects are often as gloomy as the storyline. And there is no powerful gothic scenes. Like a horror movie, it really fails, not at all scary, and it is rather confusing and boring. Some people say that “Gomed” is a feature film, but I have not seen such a ridiculous, terrible and divorced feature film like this one. So, how can we say this is a feature film! That's just funny!
