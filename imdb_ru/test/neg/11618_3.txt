Oh! I just said that this “classic” film has a plot that is INSIDE! Well, it's true ... so come along! This film was a vanity project for Joseph P. Kennedy, in which his lover played a major role, and the money flowed to make her an even bigger star. Today there is only a fragmentary copy, which was restored several years ago. However, even if the film were in perfect shape, it would still stink for many reasons. And, without further ado, here are some of my reasons: <br /> <br /> First, Gloria Swanson, 31, plays a girl in a monastic school — perhaps at the age of 16 or 18! Come on, she looks old enough to be the mother of many children. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the film is based on the stupid “love at first sight” concept. Although some people believe in it, it is ridiculous to believe that the prince will throw ALL on the woman he did not even know! How much dick! <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the film is historical and the plot is crazy! After leaving school, Kelly goes to East Africa, and then becomes the “Queen of whores” - and later, after the evil queen in Europe dies (conveniently), the prince can get out of prison, actually finds Kelly and marries her, and then she becomes the queen of this honest country! Give me a break - it's funny, even in times of silent film this plot was groaning! <br /> <br /> So, in general, this is a bad film with great production values ​​(mistresses need to SEE well) which is shown off as a classic! There are so many of the BEST silent films — first watch them and avoid this hype.
