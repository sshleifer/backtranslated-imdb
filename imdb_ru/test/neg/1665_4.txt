Andre Russin was a specialist in what the French call the “Theater de Boulevard”: playing where you will find an eternal triangle: the lover man / wife / (man or woman). Many of his plays gave Elvira Popesco some of her best roles on stage. ... and the great actress was the main reason to watch them, because Russin is not Sasha Guitry, by and large. The French public remembers "Theater Se Suar." <br /> <br /> Still with me? Russin's plays were not made for filming. And this is quite mediocre material, even if the writers call Lewis Carroll for help. I like Stuart Granger and David Niven, and Ava Gardner likes sweet tooth. But it could be their worst movie. Being rude, predictable, even Aboriginal intervention (Bola-Bola) is absurd - a reckless farce around “Menage” on an uninhabited island where Granger will be Robinson, Niven, his Friday, and Gardner his girlfriend friday
