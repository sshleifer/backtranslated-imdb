My mother and I shot this movie. I mean, we like these fantastic films, whether they are big Hollywood or indie films. <br /> <br /> But we were deceived !! Two journalists investigating a UFO abduction in a small town in Texas. Halfway through, all unexpected things become crystal clear to us. My mother and I believe in God, Jesus and the Devil, but the way this film preached was annoying. All I really have to say is that we are Christians, but even we like to have fun. So don't blame Christians as a whole, just blame Christians who need to suck the pleasure out of this film. <br /> <br /> In fact, you can clearly understand the position of the directors regarding UFOs, and this is what everyone thinks is demonic. Now I could say a few words, but I will not. All Iâ€™ll say is that DON'T WATCH this film unless you want to preach. In fact, it is said many times that we must be perfect to go to heaven. Well, the last time I checked, the only perfect person died on the cross.
