At least for me. I followed the career of Mr. Almdovar from the very beginning, and I was not crazy about this film. I think Penelope Cruz was mistaken, the type of woman she portrays doesn't look so good, she makes the character incredible. In addition, the singing scene was just weird. I do not understand, and lip sync was terrible. <br /> <br /> As a Spaniard, another thing that drove me crazy is accents. Why do people coming from one place have such a different accent? The difference between the two sisters is noticeable and does not make sense. And the village? are we in 2007 or 1950? I tried to explain to my American husband that many things in the “old school” movie are something wrong. <br /> <br /> I was expecting more, but this time Mr. Almodovar did it. Do not deliver, at least for me. I'm not saying that Miss Cruise is doing a bad job, I am saying that she does not belong there, not portraying this character.
