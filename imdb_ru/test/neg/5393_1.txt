Like many, this pile of manure caught my eye while I was surfing. This is a horror film, filmed in the woods, it has a stupid name, but hey, “Michael Rucker” is in it, and he participated in some great horror films, I know that he will not deceive me ... Ugh! The most offensive part of it is that I really watched it. I see that director Johnny Martin is a stuntman, well, this trick just sucks, and how he made some actors do this watery bowel movement is the biggest mystery of all ... I can understand Casper Van Dyne, but shame on you, Mr. Grach Your good name in the horror community is forever tarnished, and your agent should be immediately dismissed. I'm sure this piece of feces is available on DVD, but if you like the menu for 0.99 cents at McDonalds, you will get more for your money there.
