I was expecting a pretty straightforward R-rated, sexy, rough youthful comedy when I sat down to see it ... turned out to be quite accurate ... it was only much more sick and disgusting than I thought, I don’t know if the director is sick / writer Gregory Poirier or deeply sexually spoiled, but I doubt a normal person could make such a film. I could probably accept it, if it were just like that, if the only thing that was wrong was that it required a hard stomach ... but it wasn’t. The film is also terribly sneaky and alarming ... every character who has more than one second on screen is an extreme ... sexually, mentally or physically. I don’t know if this is just a director’s sense of humor, but I just discovered that it’s ... wrong. Just wrong. Even in comedy there must be seriousness. The plot is stupid. The game is bad. The characters are contradictory and poorly written ... all of them. There is not a single character in the film. Humor is disgusting and goes too far. The film is so incredibly poorly made that I really don’t think it’s worth someone’s time. If you like R-ratings, rude comedies with lots of sexy hints and graphic stuff, check out “Groom”, or, better yet, “American Pie” or “Road Trip”, my personal favorite. But don't watch it. I can't describe to you how bad it is ... you will have to experience it for yourself. However, this is one of those times when I say that you better wonder. So you can just imagine that this film goes very close to the bottom ... without knowing that it goes through it, and much lower than that. This film is most similar to a group of excited teenagers who got together, put together a film crew, and every time one of them had an idea, they shot it and then put it all together. It lacks structure, consistency and taste. I recommend this only to excited teenagers who have seen all the other R-rated junior comedies and do not care about quality. All the others ... do a sensible thing; avoid it Do not even see the prey. Believe me. 1/10
