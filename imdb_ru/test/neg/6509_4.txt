Kennan Ivory Wayans was so funny in “Low Down Dirty Shame” that I had to see it, and it was one of the worst things he did, and Steven Seagal didn't help much. It starts with some strange religious murders that make little sense for Jim Campbell (Keenan). He is surprised to see a new partner expecting him to work with him to crack the case, but Jack Cole seems to be not the one everyone thinks until Jack’s ex-wife is killed in one of those ritual murders that the result is he is also a suspect. This is the same as all his other films: the past of smoke, CIA involvement, and now the attempt to become a normal policeman. Why does Stephen dress like he's from a western movie? And the prayer sounds make it a bit confusing.
