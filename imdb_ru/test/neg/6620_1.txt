There is a reason that the chairman of the board of directors received 2 (which is too high), this film is one of the worst films of all time, and I have seen my share of rotten films. The chairman of the star is two of the most annoying actors / people today, Carrot Top and Courtney Thorn Smith. The carrot top is simply not funny anymore and was not in this piece of garbage. Courtney Thorn Smith is no better, just look at “According to Jim,” and you will see a vivid example of what I'm talking about. The chairman of the board got me one, because it's low, how can you go, it's so bad. I'm a little shocked that this piece of junk is not somewhere on the bottom 100 IMdb, I would put it in the top 5 on this list, but it is slowly working there.
