This movie should be called an adventure in Cinemascope. This is similar to the screenwriter and director who sketched the Cliff Scrapbook plan on page 3 and decided that it would be an excellent medium for a film about the Italian Alps. Rock Hudson is pretty good here, but the dialogue is not at all like Hemingway. This is a fictional version of Hemingway. Hecht, screenwriter, hack. See the 1932 version with Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes. This is a great movie created by someone who understood Hemingway and the war in Northern Italy. Gary Cooper is very, very good compared to his performance in the film “For Whom the Bell Tolls”, where he is tough as a board and thinks he is Western-style. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you are a Hemingway fan, do yourself a favor and don’t watch this movie. It’s best to get a free CD and just listen to one of the greatest novels ever written.
