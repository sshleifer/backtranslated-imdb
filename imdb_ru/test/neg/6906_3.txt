I took my 4 year old twins to watch this movie today, and I would NOT recommend it to children of my own age. <br /> <br /> In this film there were many battle scenes that seemed too cruel to me, and my children were frightening. <br /> <br /> The plot was far behind the heads of my children, and the death scene was too scary for a cartoon focused on children. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed because we were all looking forward to seeing this, but it just did not cut it. If you have children under the age of 7, I would not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, this thing drove me crazy throughout the film.
