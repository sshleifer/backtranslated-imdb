Ok, here's the deal. I love the militants and, as a rule, I have no problems with the suspension of large disbelief due to holes in the plot or other improbable actions. However, this film went far beyond the small flaws and went straight to the absurdity. Let me get this straight. The police are sending the notorious gangster and police killer (along with several other prisoners) on a bus with a total of two guards. Then they are forced to stop at a station where exactly two police officers work, one of whom is at a distance of a day from retirement and the other burns out. Apparently, the building should have been closed, and the police somehow decided that everyone else in the whole district received a day off on New Year's Eve. Right. But wait, it gets better. Gabriel Byrne appears to kill Fishburn before he can catch him and other dirty cops. (although we will never know anything about their relationship or relationship). Interestingly, the police, who are starting the assault on the site, are fully equipped with special forces with night-vision goggles, assault rifles and nine yards. Later they even bring a helicopter with MORE people in full gear. I'm not a cop, but I'm sure you can't just leave the station with all the platoon gear without someone asking what you are doing. And a police helicopter ??? In the supposedly terrible winter storm ??? In addition, no one near the station had heard or seen how this major siege was going with grenades and rifle shooting? I mean seriously, come on. I know that this is happening in Detroit, but even there it will arouse suspicions about the supposedly top-secret mission. I also like the fact that they find Tommy's gun in the evidence room, and in some way the gun still works, and he has cartridges that are still undamaged and usable. <br /> <br /> I could deal with some of these problems if there were no other glaring problems. On the one hand, the first couple of minutes of the film are being shot very insanely and hyperactively, and I thought that we would set the tone for the rest of the film. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The rest of the film has no sense of tempo or tension or drama. "Characters" are in no way connected with each other, which is probably largely due to the fact that they are not particularly interesting. There are not enough interesting actions to make this good action movie, and not enough character development / storytelling to make this bearable thriller / drama. The “relationship” between Hawk and Fishburn is the only thing the director is trying to make interesting or intense. And, by the way, the final scene in the desert? I thought it was in the midst of the industrial part of Detroit, and suddenly we were in the forest? The acting in this film is not terrible, just the direction and the script are terrible. I really like some movies of Hawks, Fishburn, Byrne, Dennehy, but this one is terrible.
