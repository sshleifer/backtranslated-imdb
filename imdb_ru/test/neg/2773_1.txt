I have to go with my boy Allen (who also watched this movie) ... ZOMBIE GANGBANGERS (as my copy is called - I think they missed the Ninja part after they realized that there was not a single Ninja, nor a link to ninja anywhere in the whole movie f! cking ...) is a waste of time. Frankly, one of the most boring, backward "films" that I have ever experienced displeasure when watching. <br /> <br /> A prostitute is repeatedly (not graphically) raped by two zombies and then a police officer (again (not graphically) when the policeman does not believe her story. She meets a guy who has been beaten by the mentioned zombies and they are trying to find a way to the criminals from the undead ... <br /> <br /> Firstly, there is NO "group" (or indeed another) "to knock" in general), which will be available in ZOMBIE NINJA GANGBANGERS. I was hoping to at least get some kind of horror / porn hybrid a la PORN of the Dead, or RE-PENETRATOR, or maybe perverted STORIES - but no - there was absolutely no sex in this film. At least a little bit of the “old” exit could to some extent redeem this boring garbage, but without it we would get a bunch of badly shot scenes with complete boredom with zero impact. I am for the "trash" of films and most other hack-work, gore, porn, and use material, but this one honestly sucks in all possible ways. Save your time, pass it up ... 1/10 (and this is only for a few brief snapshots of some sub-party boobs ...)
