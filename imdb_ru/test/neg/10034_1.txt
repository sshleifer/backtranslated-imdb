I saw this movie with my girlfriend. It was a complete disaster. You can really see that it was cheaply made. Poorly written and with very bad acting. I read several versions of a book by different authors, and also listened to one version of an audiobook. We could not take the film seriously because of the lack of elements in it. Watching this was similar to the way Blair the Witch visits the Green Acres. Then there were the parts that were vulgar. They show this little boy using the bed pan, and they actually show the contents of it. The witch throws the contents of it at the boy, and the whole family laughs. I thought it was disgusting and very strange. I really can't understand why someone thought it would be interesting. It shows another scene when Dr. Meese arrives, and Betsy Bell pees in her dress on the steps of their house in front of her mother and brothers. Instead of being taken away by her mother, this is a brother. How sick? A little boy in the first scene from a variety of scenes telling how your body gets rid of waste, asks for toilet paper and goes outside and makes these hideous faces of joy sound effects. I think they should have left it all. Reverend James Johnston’s makeup, when he was older, did not make you think he was older. It made you think that he was immersed in fish dough. The blood on Joshua Gardner when he falls down the stairs is even worse. The scene of John Bell’s death looks like they’ve got the flour and tried to do something with it so that he looked like a serious sick person. For me, a nauseous comedy with problems in the bathroom and inexperienced people was the cause of this picture. These people would be better off if they made commercials for local TV stations for bathroom products. They chose a good item and could not properly present it. I rate this movie Capital F minus.
