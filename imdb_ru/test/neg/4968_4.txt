How could this get a score of 6.0? Are we, as horror fans, so accustomed to the horrific films of our day, that they are so bad that when someone comes along who has something and I repeat “only a few”, buying quality, we are excited and give a rating that is just tiny too high? The director has a certain visual talent. No doubt about it. But between decent shots he forgot a good story, a mood, or a fright. He had a very slow first act, lazy murder scenes, annoying and flat characters and a very stupid and very incredible turn. And what about the image of American teenagers in so many films of this type? Do they always have to be so stupid, annoying and so damn superficial. I don't remember teenagers being like this when they grew up here in Holland. Given all the circumstances, this film can not give anything more than a rating of 4 out of 10.
