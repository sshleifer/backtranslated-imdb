This director wanted to make a film without telling the story, and made it. A really awful confusion of unexpected / unexplained coincidences and an unidentifiable storyline, all with no character or no obvious motivation. <br /> <br /> We get clich√©s instead of symbols. One of them is, in particular, the tiny and beautiful crime boss who projects the excessive personality of the tough guy and casts a cartoon shadow of intimidation on the real tough guys who were brought to work for her. There is nothing special about the film, except for one shot when the boys hit the road, and one of them carries a tiny suitcase (like the smallest of the full American Tourister kit) in bright blue without an apology. Otherwise, this is standard visually - another exception - a convincing snapshot of a beautiful bridge in CT.
