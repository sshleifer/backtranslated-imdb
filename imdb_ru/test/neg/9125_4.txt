As with many sequels, it simply does not have the quality or impact of the original. The first belongs there with the rest of the great people. This one just does not cut. The first film had a magical “good time” feeling about it, which is completely absent from this film. We fell in love with all these characters (with the exception of Richard Dreyfus) in the era of innocence. Now, a few years later, they have changed so much that they have become in many ways different people. Although this is what happens in real life, we do not expect this to happen with our favorite characters in the film! The film does not have the humor that the original had, and we expected to laugh. What a little humor there, dark. The first film was also probably the best soundtrack, although this film is good, but not even close to the original. This film is so different from the original that it is not even a continuation. I gave him 4.
