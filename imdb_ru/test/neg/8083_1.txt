I thought it would be a good movie after watching an advertisement about it. It was funny in some places, and very unpleasant in some. The only person I felt sorry for was Horatio Sanz, who has a hot wife who cheats on him with other women. But he never had a chance to have a threesome, until it was good, but they had to do more through the film.
