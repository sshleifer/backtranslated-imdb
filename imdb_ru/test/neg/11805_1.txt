No one can say that I was not warned, since I read reviews (both users and external ones), but, like most of us, they are attracted to horror movies ... curiosity has acquired this cat. (C'mon, we all scream that people in the film don't go into the dark room, but you know that horror fans always die to know what is there, even if we know that it will be bad). <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this movie pissed me off. Not because he pretends to be real (who cares ... tricks are allowed), or because actors and dialogues are so unconvincing (is this an unusual event in horror films?) Or even because the film is very bad (and I’m being polite here ). What really pissed me off is the fact that the film is not only a breakdown of BWP, but also an indecisive lazy breakdown. <br /> <br /> I do not believe in sacred cows, and if they think they could surpass the BWP, and then glory to them, but they didn’t even try. The film was made without much effort and care, and this is the most unpardonable sin in a horror film (or in any other)!
