This film can not be serious, because it has a boring guy named Curtis, who kills people. The other two psycho kids are pretty cute, but this guy Curtis is just ugly because he wears these huge brown ugly glasses. The actor probably traveled in the wrong place, and he really had to go to Revenge of the Nerds. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I hate so much about this film is that Curtis loves to shoot people. I kept my finger on the fast forward button, because it took too long, and what happened to his voice? He seemed to be fourteen, not ten. I also hated that he continued to smile like an idiot, and there was no point in that. <br /> <br /> Then they put this annoying kid in the freezer, and he somehow found a flashlight there. It made no sense, as did the music. The music did not fit into any of the scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie is slow, boring and a waste of time. Watch another movie for your birthday.
