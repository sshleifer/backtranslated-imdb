* POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD * <br /> <br /> I will say only what has not been said here yet (and I will continue this until the end of my WWF / WWE comments) <br /> <br /> If you are going to hold a match for the title of champion among women, at least make it interesting, not just squash, to defeat the current champion. I think that Mula could not stand the tense match, but they wanted to have a legend in WrestleMania. <br /> <br /> I thought killer bees were wasted in WrestleManias, especially here. I became a fan in 1989, about a year after B. Brian Blair died, and Jim Brunzell became a canvas again. Therefore, for some time I did not realize that they were the best team, even the main rivals. <br /> <br /> But I liked to see Bill Frallich in the royal battle. He really came here as his, creating a daring character on the heel in the pre-match interview and even making an exception in the royal battle. Besides Steve McMichael and Kevin Green, he is the only professional athlete of my generation who respects wrestling (does anyone remember Dennis Rodman?). What happened to the Hart Foundation's funny green tights?
