The heart of darkness was terrible. The novel was quite difficult to understand, but when the production company decides to release a film based on it, then it just confuses everyone. Not only did the decision makers decide to change some of the characters and completely eliminate others, but the game was terrible, and the general impression I received from the film was that it was a complete fool. I watched the movie in the hope of understanding the novel a little better, but it just completely dropped me and my classmates. I think the film was a waste of time, and I was disappointed to see Tim Roth in such a disappointing film, especially when he has amazing films such as Pulp Fiction and Resivior Dogs under his belt. The same with very cool John Malkovich.
