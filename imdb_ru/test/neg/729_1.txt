Usually, when I do not see the show in the original run, I find it later on the cable and I understand that it is a gem. Gimore Girls is one of those rare exceptions. I'm glad I missed it. <br /> <br /> I really despise the show, which fills every minute of the actors' space with disjointed, silly, boring banter. This is one hour only of this. Mother, Lorelei, made me wonder if she is bipolar and does not use lithium. She never stopped talking; every minute, every second, talking to every person she communicated with. Worse, her speech is childish and soooo, like, for example, The Girl from the Valley. She talked about the guys, her hair, her mother, her clothes. Like, what a bitch ?? (for the situation). I watched this show three times and still do not understand the meaning of this series. This is not a comedy, this is not a drama, there is no point in it except how to make so that three generations of women in one family look like "Girls" from the planet Mars. Men are smart compared to this and make the show somewhat watchable. If Lorelei ever existed and tried to start a conversation with me, I would have to chain her to get rid of her. She obviously does not know how to take a subtle hint to stop talking and start listening to someone else. She also does not know how to truly notice the existence of others. <br /> <br /> In one show, Lorelei comes home from a date close to 10 pm. She got a date after chasing the guy she met at the auction. She goes to her daughter's room, where her daughter asks how it all went. She thinks about that boring guy. Her date somehow got a few words around the edges. Lorelei complained that the man did not stop talking (gasps). I hope the date found out how lucky he was. <br /> <br /> Another person here commented on how the mother behaves like a teenager and her daughter is an adult person. Lorelei even dresses up as her child. This, obviously, 40-year-old mother dresses and looks as if she came to the mall with her friends at school. <br /> <br /> I thought that this show was supposed to be followed by “Just shoot me”, because it was I who felt.
