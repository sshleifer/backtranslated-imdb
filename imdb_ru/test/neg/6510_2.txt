Typical fare for Steven Seagal: this is crap. The plot relies on a series of incredibly incredible coincidences; there is a huge dose of conspiracy theories, which would be much more acceptable if we didn’t know that Seagal takes it all literally; and once again, the multi-millionaire of Bad Cinema Seagal tells us all about the evils of the rich. <br /> <br /> Seagal survives, as usual, thanks to the fact that the bad guys never shoot a weapon with a weapon and reach out and always love to make a small speech “I will kill you” before tearing off a man’s head. <br /> <br /> Watch it right after the even worse “Fire Down” and notice how the carpet in the apartment Keenen Ivory Wayans is more flammable than a big puddle of gasoline. <br /> <br /> Oh, and look in the final battle scene for the incredible disappearing wound on the forehead, which is probably the most interesting thing in the movie.
