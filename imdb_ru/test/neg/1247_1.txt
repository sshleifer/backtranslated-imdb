I rented this film, hoping that it would provide good entertainment and some cool poker knowledge or stories. What I got was a documentary look at the ordinary life of the guys who turned out to be very good in the cards. Do I want to see an affair with his wife? NO Do I want to learn about everything that happened in the life of this guy, besides poker? NO. Well, that's what you get with this movie. The game is good for such a low-budget nonsense. The film never tries to break the template or do something original. It's just a dream going through the script. The end is frustrating and never looks into the Ungar thoughts. Instead, he focuses on what was already evident. He was an average life drug card player, not unlike any other average Joe in Vegas. The film is devoted to those aspects of his life that were extraordinary, and not unusual. Poker scenes throughout the film are about 4 minutes. Ungar's achievements in winning the WSOP 3 times seem to be life after thought. A 10-year-old could have better deal with this film ... or maybe the script from the very beginning was nonsense, doomed to this movie joke. <br /> <br /> If you want a movie about gambling Rounders. At least he has a style.
