If you feel that Reshammia is too much pain for a singer to watch on TV, try watching him in a movie for 2 hours in a row. Throughout the film, his face is soft, and it’s very funny to see him shoot complex and intense scenes. This is far from a true love story (“Proper Writing”, “Reshammia” is not love or riel), and it complements the way he performs the dance Mithun da runs out of prison, etc. If you want to laugh, there is nothing better than this, especially the scene where he howls in Mehuba. If you despise nasal bumps and want to learn out of curiosity what two hours of Reshammii can do for you, do not miss this movie. <br /> <br /> I could not stop laughing from the very beginning to the very end. The only grace of this film is cinematography, locations and a couple of songs. Even then, as long as you are not a reshammia fan, avoid this movie at all costs.
