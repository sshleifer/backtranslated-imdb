Considering the film’s reputation as the worst of the worst, I looked forward to watching Wood’s Krampus Opus (my word); he is not necessarily more inept than the other Woods that I looked at - however, being from the cinema school REEFER MADNESS (1938), GLEN OR GLENDA is not as "pleasant" as his genre efforts. br /> <br /> In addition, it undoubtedly appears as the nadir of the legend of Terror Bela Lugosi (his first of three “collaborations” with the director): I wonder if he really knew what the movie was (given the history of the actor? heavy drugs and the complete senselessness of his cameo). In addition, Lugosha’s idiosyncratic delivery is perhaps the most awkward ... although Wood’s scenario is mainly to blame for this - given the impossible dialogue (with repeated meaningless hints at “puppy tails” and “big fat snails”), he gave the sick star! By the way, Wood himself plays a central role (under the pseudonym Daniel Davies) - and, being equally useless in this area, it turns out to be a universal dog! Dolores Fuller - his wife and colleague in the film - was just as worthless (she also appears in JAIL BAIT [1954]) ... but at least the image where the latter finally allows Glen to wear an angora sweater This excites Tim Burton. Biographical film ED WOOD (1994), his famous poster! <br /> <br /> By the way, in the last film, the fictional meeting of Wood and Orson Wells seems to be - well, in all senses and purposes, GLEN OR GLENDA make up CIVIL KANE Ed Wood (1941), considering her joyful tendency to useless narration. methods: in fact, the shortest thread of the story is complemented by video materials in abundance (many of them do not matter, such as amazing instances of S & M) and meaningless sequences of dreams (underlined by the presence of a demon demon that carries outrageous thick eyebrows that could make Martin Scorsese is crying with envy)! However, the film’s sincere attempt to call for tolerance and the psychological study of the ailment / phenomenon of transvestism is sabotaged at every step by a clear amateur approach. <br /> <br /> For whatever reason, the edition I watched “The Extended Version of the Reissue”, which included six minutes of “spoiled” videos (directed by W. Merle Connell), censored in the original version! In addition, my copy periodically disappeared (which made me rewind it slightly to bring the sound back on track) - although, fortunately, it was a source conversion error in DivX, unlike the movie itself,
