I watched this movie for a hot guy - and even he sucked! He was the worst - well, okay, I have to give the requisites to this bizarre police rapist, he was even worse. The guy, after all, was not so cute, he had the most terrible accent, and he was the most definite definition of the idiot Hicksville, who cannot stand up to his mom for the one he "loves" he ever was. In general, and if it makes any sense to you when I go to pick up movies in the video store, I think to myself when I read the back of a movie that looks like this: “Well, at least it can't be worse than Carolina Moon. “The worst movie and the worst movie scenario, acting, plot — everything in it made my gag reflexes do back flips. It was the worst movie I've ever seen, with Gabriela there too. I hated it and believe me if there was any number below 1 IMDb for the rating, I would select it in an instant.
