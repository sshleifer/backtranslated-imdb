There is nothing to add to what others have already commented on, the film fails where it should not, has no depth in planning the robbery, and the characters are so incredible. <br /> <br /> One thing made me think about that, although the rest of the gang was trying hard to pull the pins out of the door of an armored truck, because it’s supposed there’s no other way to open it, the guy inside the truck, it is very easy to remove the floor of the truck, in which, as it turned out, there is a hole so that he could get out and then come back without being noticed by anyone, because no one else could think that he could get out of there or even better that they could get there. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, but not quite.
