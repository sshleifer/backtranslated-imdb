While I was watching this film, I never thought that I would protect it. Fair enough from the very beginning that you donâ€™t have that much plot. There are no real characters to capture, except the killer. Some acting games may be better, but most of them are capable. <br /> <br /> I know that three out of ten are not stellar, but there are reviews that he was shot badly and completely useless, etc. I think he intended to do what he had to pretty good. Coverage is sometimes minimal, more natural than most viewers are used to, but it should look like a snuff film on a video camera. In fact, sometimes the quality is probably still too high to be true, but no one could get through a few minutes of working with the camera, which is really so bad. <br /> <br /> This is not particularly scary, but it worries from time to time. There are one or two characters that do not seem so believable at all, and the soundtrack is sometimes tiring, but in general it was made cleaner than many movies with video cameras.
