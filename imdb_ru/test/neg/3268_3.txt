Caddyshack II NOTHING compared to the original Caddyshack. But there are legitimate reasons for this. (1) Rodney Dangerfield was supposed to be the ace of this film, BUT he didn’t like the script, he wanted to change it, his request was turned down, so he didn’t make a film. (2) It was a low budget, Bill Murray rose to superstar status. Ted Knight passed away in 1986, and Chevrolet Chase, the “so-called ace” of the first film (although it was Rodney's entire journey), could not play more than 5 minutes because it would be too expensive to pay. BUT you had Dan Aykroyd, Robert Stack, Randy Quaid and Jackie Mason, all serviceable substitutes that didn’t have their best performances.
