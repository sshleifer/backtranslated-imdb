2001 is one of those films where, if you don’t like it, you are told that you “don’t understand” and you need to look at deeper meaning and symbolism. You have been told that you obviously have a slow concentration of attention, and you just want to see sex, explosions and tell you the story on a dish. <br /> <br /> Let's disassemble the film, right? Three minutes of blackness, with something that sounds like a dying hippo in the background. Then we get the initial points. A minute of fascinating images of savanna. Then a group of monkeys finds a black rock and starts killing things with bones. Go to the first of many 20-minute snapshots of ships that do things, while the Blue Danube is playing in the background. A group of meaningless dialogues, and a group of moon scientists will find another monolith. <br /> <br /> On a spacecraft, there is too much time for the crew - three sleeping people, two named Dave and Frank, only a little more individuality than hibernating hibernations. And there is HAL, the “ideal” supercomputer that drives the ship. As expected, he clicks and begins to violate the First Law of Robotics. Now this is what has potential. An evil, cold, ruthless super-mind that controls the environment and can predict your every move. And what does he do? He lets one guy float in space and turns off the hibernation machines so that the three sleeping guys die, leaving Dave in the pod. He simply uses the gateway, puts on the spacesuit and turns off the HAL - painfully slowly. Then, apparently, some psychedelic "evolution" takes place on Jupiter. <br /> <br /> Here is a film with pauses taken out: monkeys see a monolith, kill things. Scientists find the lunar monolith. HAL kills people. HAL dies; Dave receives a pre-recorded message and evolves into Jupiter. <br /> <br /> This is not me, "I do not understand." This I miss the tears in long stretches absolutely nothing. Of course, this is realistic, but I see no reason for concern. No matter the message, no movie can be good without being entertaining. Honestly, each character can be replaced by Keanu Reeves, and nothing will change.
