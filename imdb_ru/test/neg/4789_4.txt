I agree with the comments on the downward rotation. The last presentation was a little better, but, of course, the writers need some other direction. I think the characters are still interesting, although sometimes they spin too much in the “white trash”. Subtlety and nuance are of great importance on such shows as "Office". I think that the target audience is somewhat similar, because they are both in one night and in composition. One would think that Karma and the whole Eastern religion is a big enough topic to show several different and interesting shows, but they only affect the surface of the subject. In my opinion, this demonstrates the contempt that many people have in Hollywood about the level of intelligence of the masses. We can handle more rash content. This has been proven earlier in many other shows.
