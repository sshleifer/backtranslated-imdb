My son-in-law and his wife brought the film overnight to watch the video. It should have given me the first clue that it would be terrible. It was. From the very first frame to the last, this film is terrible. It is not even recorded as the movie "B". Maybe N or P. One of the worst 5 films I've ever seen. This film, from the rubber “raptor on the stick” to the still breathing corpses in the car, to the terrible closing lines, is not worth watching if you got it for free. <br /> <br /> Skip it altogether - if you don’t want to play Mystery Science Theater with your friends, it will provide good ammo.
