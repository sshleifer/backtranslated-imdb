I think I have a decent sense of humor, but this “movie” left me stunned in my chair. <br /> <br /> This is so bad that it could be no worse. I have never laughed at the sad jokes in this film. I watched and enjoyed several parodies of big films, but unfortunately this one will always be the one I remember best of all - in my nightmares. <br /> <br /> The only reason someone should want to watch this is if you introduce someone in a short period of time. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie ever.
