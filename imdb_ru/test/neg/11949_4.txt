As much as I liked Catherine Zeta-Jones, I was surprised once again, why remake a good movie? This version lacked the tension and passion mainly Martha. It was a clear breakdown. Maxim Ferste was a more convincing child who was healed with love. I could not believe it, Abigail Breslin. Martina Godek owned this role. Unfortunately, Zeta-Jones had to find another one that could belong to her (she has other roles that she performs). Sergio Castellitto was good as a vulnerable but joyful Italian. Aaron Eckhart seemed impassive in comparison. This version was nice but soft. <br /> <br /> The love between Mario and Martha was perhaps predictable, but satisfying. The therapist added an interesting piece of color that did not seem important. I liked it when at the end he said he would return, but the film ended before he returned. I have mostly Martha at home. From time to time I return to him.
