How are so many talented or at least charismatic actors found themselves in this nonsense? Nothing is very good in this film, but probably the worst things are the script and the director. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this is the heart of director Damien Niemann, as he wrote and shot (and also played a role), He himself is a card magician and seems to have named the characters after other famous magicians. As far as I know, it was his first full-length film, and, most likely, he is his last. <br /> <br /> Is it hard to point out exactly what makes it so bad ?? but I would say that the story and character are not believable (the script), and the direction does not give any acceleration (the director). Plus, the poker scenes are bad in the worst Hollywood style (super hands, Hollywood rules)! The expected turns in the film are either completely predictable or completely unbelievable. They simply tie a knot in the story, which at best can be described as “some decent scenes”!
