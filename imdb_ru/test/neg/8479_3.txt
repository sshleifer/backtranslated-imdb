This movie should not be seen in cinemas, I liked it, and I did not like it. The effects in the film are really well done and you laugh here and there, but the story is really bad, it seemed that they ran out of ideas, and what kind of Loki and Odin get along? this completely destroys Norse mythology, and I think they forgot that Loki’s forces only worked during NIGHT !! If you really MUST see this movie when it comes out, don’t go to the movies for it! <br /> <br /> They could have done a lot more with it than they seemed, they just wanted to make a movie to show cool animations and effects.
