So this guy comes into the psychiatrist's office for his first visit. After the documents are done, the psychiatrist says: “I'll show you the ink stains. Tell me what you see in them. ”“ Well, ”says the patient,“ looking at the first, “I see a man and a woman having sex.” Seeing the second, he says: "I see two women having sex." Seeing the third, he says: "I see two men having sex." Seeing the next one, he says: "I see two men and two women having sex." A psychiatrist puts down ink stains. "So," he says, "we will begin by discussing your monomania." "My Monomania?" says the guy. "And you with all those dirty pictures!" This is how this movie amazes me.
