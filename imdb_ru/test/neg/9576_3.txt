A deformed elderly woman scientist kills a colleague scientist to steal formulas for rejuvenating cells and reversing the aging process. She takes it and turns into a beautiful, evil satanic (Magda Konopka), who walks around, seducing and killing rich businessmen. <br /> <br /> She dresses very stylishly in fashionable clothes of the late 60s and manipulates those around her, looking very much like the late Marisa Mell from the DIABOLIK movie. Coincidence ?? <br /> <br /> However, despite all this, this is amateur and sloppy without the pop art gadgets James Bond, which was in DIABOLIK. Even the filming locations in Madrid and Lake Geneva do not make up for that. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was written by Manuel Parada and Roberto Pregadio, and it's not at all bad, consisting of a fluffy orchestration with a little fuzz, the guitar is used as decoration. Ideal for one of those European Loungecore CDs that came out in the 90s. <br /> <br /> The Retromedia DVD also uses a poor-quality grainy color print that is in poor shape, and at the beginning there was an explanation that this was due to the age of the film. Bull! They either did not bother to find the best source, or could not find it at all. There are only a few photos of Magda, that's all. <br /> <br /> Sloppy and poor, this one gets 3 out of 10.
