I was not interested in seeing Step Up, but my friend constantly gave me peace and made me watch this movie, especially since she was so in love with Channing Tatum, I constantly tease her, saying that this is the only reason why she really liked the film But she somehow convinced me that this film is worth seeing, that if I loved films like “Dirty Dancing”, “Take the lead” and “Save the last dance”), I have to love "Step forward," what the hell? I think that every movie in some way has the right to watch. <br /> <br /> Do you know the movies I just mentioned? Dirty dancing, take the lead and save the last dance? Well, put them in a blender with some gangster love, and that's what you have. Not to mention whether you have seen these films, well, to be honest, you have seen Step Up. Since Channing is a lower class with street minds who just naturally feel the music, while this snob-up should follow them step by step, how can they fall in love if they are so different? In the end, this is their chance to "rise" to the passion, mystery and thirst for dance! <br /> <br /> Well, that was a silly explanation of the plot, but, as I said, while you saw those films that I mentioned, or even if you just saw the plot, you get a movie. I don't understand how he actually has a rating of 5.5, I bet that those are Channing fans! LOL! I'm joking with you guys, but this is all good, I think I just did not understand what others have done with the passion, the secret dance! Oh, Antonio Bandares, where are you, when do we need you ?! <br /> <br /> 4/10
