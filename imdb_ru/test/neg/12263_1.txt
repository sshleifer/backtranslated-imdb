I am not inclined to rant, and my expectations were low, but how did it seem like a good idea? The fact that you have a camera, some big ugly friends for the actors and a talented delusion does not mean that you have to go and make a movie. This was supposed to be the cinematic equivalent of singing in the soul, that is. E. Never should have seen the light. However, somehow this garbage found a distributor to help him avoid 3-by-4-foot limits. It goes from bad to worse. Talking about a low budget, one scene of torture is that the guy throws a cup of coffee when he is tied to a chair. Obviously, it is very painful, because the big child continues to scream in agony ... maybe he ordered decaf coffee !! The action is worse than wood (I could watch a tree for 30 seconds before becoming completely bored if you can look at this garbage for so long that you are a better person than me!) garden play yard. Do not touch this film unless you enjoy the pain (in this case you should try to spill some warm coffee). I would like to say that this is so bad, this is good, but in reality itâ€™s just terrible.
