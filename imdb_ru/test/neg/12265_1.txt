This film proves a theory that I have followed for quite some time — in Australia, if the film touches the right subject, it will be successful no matter how terrible it is. Aussie Park Boyz can not be worse: the acting is terrible, the plot is mainly fakes for poor warriors, and the filmmakers clearly have no idea about the ethnic gangs in Australia (the Irish gang in Sydney in the twenty-first century! Last time any Irish gangs were in Australia, it was about a hundred years ago in the days of the masters!) But since it’s about ethnic rivalry, one of the four themes guaranteed success in Australian cinema (along with difficult families, minority groups). and the biography of the famous Australian) he received many Academy Awards. I always suspected that Australian critics were skimping on all the nonsense that dealt with these problems, but a part of me thought, or at least hoped, that they had their limits. This film proves the opposite. So for all of you Australian aspiring filmmakers, don’t think about thinking about your film, don’t choose people who can really play, or don’t even support your facts — just write a script about a poor family trying to make ends meet , or someone from a foreign race who comes to Australia and deals with racial prejudice and stereotypes, or if you want to take a list from the book of these people, some ethnic gang fights with another ethnic gang that is actually not right dopodobna during the movie set, and your film won five Academy Awards, no matter how much it is a pity!
