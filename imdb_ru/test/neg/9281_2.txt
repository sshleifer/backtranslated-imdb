It was one of the shows I wanted to continue. But I just couldn’t force myself to devote my time to this show. For the show to be focused on the topic of politics, you really need a strong plot with twists and turns to improve the mood of the show, something like “West Wing” or “Commander in Chief”. Rob Lowe was fine, but actors like Kyle Chandler just couldn't play (he was terrible in Early Edition). It was hard to sit on this show. Due to lack of expectation, urgency and characters capable of acting, I just had to abandon this show, and I am glad that it was canceled, so I have nothing more to miss. <br /> <br /> Grade D-
