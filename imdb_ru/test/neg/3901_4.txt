Do not be deceived by other reviewers. Although this film contains an impressive array of talents, the material they represent leaves much to be desired. The Nat King Cole's 3 numbers are pretty lame and not even close to his last effort, although he is impressive with his piano playing. “Mummies” Mabley is not exactly funny, although I remember her as a very interesting guest talk show from my youth. In fact, the best performances from a couple of fat guys who impress with lively dance and Four Tops take-off, as well as the jazz band itself, especially with bassist. The imprint itself is of rather poor quality, and the wonderful McQueen Butterfly is completely wasted in the conspiracy.
