This film was strange mainly because the plot was so incoherent. The name refers to the vicious wind that makes the surface of the earth almost uninhabitable when it blows, but it seemed to have nothing to do with what was happening. It seems that the film is a very bad plagiarism of Bladerunner, that is, a crook pursued by a bounty hunter (or a ruthless policeman). Luke Skywalker surprisingly well played the role of the aforementioned fraudster. It seems that nothing is decided at the end of the film, we will never know anything about the android or its intentions. There is one confusing scene in which Bill Paxton (who kidnapped the android) without a specific reason plays one particular song on his cardboard plane (this song is called The Yardbirds “Form of Things”). This happens again in a later scene where the same song is being played for no apparent reason. Does this song have anything to do with the movie? Do not think so.
