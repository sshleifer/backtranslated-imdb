This is one of those movies that are so bad that it is awesome !!! It has everything the film needs of the early eighties: flared pants, big mustaches, chickens with Farrah's hair and, most importantly, a ninja !!!! I have a few points of choice to disown you. Cole's army friend has a strange ape-like face, and he always seems to say without moving his jaws. He gets his ass of every other scene from the thugs wanting to get their land, so he gets drunk through the whole movie. At some point, his farm workers are finally returning after mercenary gangsters fled, and Frank, I think his name is Frank, is so excited that he shouts to the whole group: "Let's deal with it!" And they all joyfully moving into the farm cock fighting area to begin the celebration. It is funny at every possible level. Whether dirty or literal, it still warms my heart. Another fun thing is the small grunts of Sho Kosugi and the ninja-style animation moves. I remember this guy when I was a kid, and he used to say that he was the only real ninja in the world (he had ads in martial arts magazines), if I remember correctly. My friends and I were a little crazy when this film was released, and I remember seeing it in the local theater many times. I was wondering when I watched it on Starz last night, why every grubby American type of gangster always has a fortress in the Philippines, and he wears a white Steve Martin suit. In fact, this guy goes a lot further than all of his thugs require Steve Martin to wear white costumes. There's a scene where 20 imitators of Steve Martin attack the 1970s Sears lingerie model (Cole). When we prepare for the final battle, Cole very awkwardly rushes into the bad guyâ€™s headquarters and is immediately discovered by the secretary, who in turn warns the guard who shoots his shotgun, firing a pump, not 30 feet from the bad guys and no one. seems to notice or care. Cole, dressed in a completely white ninja dress, begins to climb the stairs unnoticed, then rushes straight to the area where all the bad guys are. The second person in charge tells him that he does not need to kill everyone as they expected him, and then drives him to the huge Cock Fighting arena. Don't ask me why Cock Fighting is a huge part of this film, but it is. When they arrive, Cole still wears his ninja mask, although all participants know what he looks like without her. The final battle is approaching, as Cole has killed everyone, and now Sho, as I like to call him, shows that he has kidnapped Lady Cole, that is, Frank's wife, and they meet in the brightest arena of cockfighting you have ever seen. Shaw then, very politely, I can add, the lady lets go, and the battle is about to begin. They bow and start circling among themselves, both disguised by the way. When they enter a battle, it seems that Cole periodically becomes someone else, like "Completing the Game," an amusing parody of Bruce Lee's "Game of Death". In the end, Cole wins, kills Sho, who dies with honor, being beheaded, and all is well. Then we see that Cole, after destroying the life of everyone, is going to split the city again, but not earlier than he predicts the brutal death of a fat guy with a hooked hand, and then he inexplicably winks at the camera, removes the freeze-frame, and the credits are ready.
