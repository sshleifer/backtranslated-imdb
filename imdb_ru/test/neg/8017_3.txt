Remember the wooden, inept literary adaptations of the 1970s at their worst? You will see when you see this widely acting, unintentionally funny piece of chocolate adaptation. Most guilty of all are Katherine Z-J, who, while undoubtedly easy on the eyes, substitutes whistling a great dress and looking sultry for actual inclusion in performance. The screenwriter, played as a melodrama, or Cold Comfort Farm without a joke, does not help the screenwriter with a hard ear for dialogue, which completely misses the sense of irony or tragedy of the novel. Shame, given the quality of the proposed acting talent - Joan Plowright, Claire Skinner, Stephen McIntosh - everyone deserves better than this.
