Please do not blame Korea for this bad movie. I'm in Korea (sorry for bad english). I am sad to see these films that make Korea look obsessed with blood and sex. I am even more sad to see the killing of animals and to hear Americans say that Korea is like that. We do not eat live animals !! So please stop excuse the film for its crime, saying that it is a culture! There are scenes with a man who eats live animals, and no Koreans think that this is normal. No, we are also disgusted. The director is an unsuitable, sick person who is obsessed with murder and sex with family members. I would like America and France to stop praising this bad man who is ridiculous in his own country. Please watch ANY OTHER Korean film that will give you an idea of ​​how artistic we are. This film is rubbish.
