The TV announcer, who presented it late on Saturday, said he should have won an Oscar. Quite a statement about the film, about which I had never heard ... although I did not know why I should have paid attention to the television announcer. In this case, the announcer said, spoke in awe. <br /> <br /> This is a dreary, pitiful film that leaves an unpleasant taste in the mouth. I couldn't get along with the terrible accent of Burr-ming-gum. In any case, I do not see any advantage in the fact that it is installed in Midland. <br /> <br /> Unresolved topics abound ... and I would not object to this, but half of them does not make sense. What about when Hoskins says she will pick up Felicia from outside her B & B, although she never told him exactly where she was staying ??? Or her purchase at a funeral, which obviously never took place (and where was she in those days ???). Gloomy and badly thought out cases if you ask me. <br /> <br /> This is a thriller without thrills, It is full of pretentious deeds. This is depressing ... <br /> <br /> I did not like it. Thought it was rubbish. Would not recommend this. 'Enough.
