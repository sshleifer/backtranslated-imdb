Dear Mr. Dante, <br /> <br /> Dude, seriously ... the name of the show is Masters of Horror. And be that as it may, it is supposed that it will be an opportunity to show your scum of horrors, to show the world why you deserve to be called the “master” of the genre. Apparently, you misunderstood the exercise. Looks like you thought it was your opportunity (or, even worse, your duty) to tell the American public about your political beliefs. And your attempt seems disgusting, domineering and, above all, a sermon. <br /> <br /> The only reason ANY marked your short position as highly appreciated is that their political views coincide with yours, and they refer to those people who don’t mind politics drove their throats. <br /> <br /> I, on the other hand, don't give a damn what you believe, they believe, or I believe ... I just want such obvious (not subtle) and unfunny (not satirical) messages from my horror. And although, of course, there were other “Masters of Horror” that were big disappointments or where I was just confused, why did this director (William Malone?) Be considered a “master” genre ... yours just won’t cope with the rest the whole point of the series. <br /> <br /> So next time ... could you just keep your preaching policy with you?
