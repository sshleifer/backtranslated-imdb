The fake genre, which has long lacked creativity and humor, again spat on hacks without talent. It makes no sense, there is no fun, there is no originality; just a few cheap dollars for filmmakers. <br /> <br /> It takes more than just to refer to some recent films and give the characters double names for satire; to make people laugh. Anyone can take a camcorder, and some bad friends in cheap suits imitate someone. Since the genre that genres are targeting this time is inspiring sports films, there are several flimsy references to films of this type: the jokes are so weak that the characters really have to emphasize the links in various ways to make you laugh hysterically. This does not work. <br /> <br /> This is not a comedy. Nevertheless, all the same old worn sofomornye "jokes", torn out of the toilet of the high school (made even softer than usual), all here. If this is not enough, there is a bus that interrupts someone. So funny, right? In addition, one pitiful scene makes more product placement than Michael Bay; again with the same unfamiliar results. The musical beat fails miserably. The pity of Carl Weathers, once Apollo Creed in the Rocky series, is now stuck in roles like these. <br /> <br /> Lousy beyond words. Watching a snail run will be less tedious than watching this movie. Probably much funnier.
