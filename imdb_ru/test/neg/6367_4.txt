This year's Eurovision Song Contest was a big disappointment for me. I watched the Eurovision Song Contest every year since 1986 (well, at least, this is the earliest one I remember, and I was only 2 years old). As in any other year, there were good, bad and terrible songs in it - there is nothing new there. However, this year’s show was the worst one I remember. Only very few good (worthy, probably more like it) songs and a lot of absolutely awful songs. <br /> <br /> Turkey’s winning song "Every Way That I Can" sounded like a Turkish singer Tarkan’s rip-off. The hit "Simarik" just sounds a lot worse. It did not deserve victory from my point of view. Belgium's song "Sanomi", runner-up, was a song without a language. I wonder what next? Do animals sing? Nevertheless, the music for this song was quite memorable, giving the song a kind of dreamy feeling to which the “lyrics” seemed appropriate. One of the best songs, but it says little. <br /> <br /> After one of the closest races in the history of Eurovision, the Russian duet t.A.T.u. finished in third place with just three points behind Turkey and behind Belgium, with “Ne Ver ', Ne Boisia” (“Do not believe, do not be afraid”). For me, T.A.T.U. was one of the few highlights of the show, surprising almost all that they were among the most hidden girls from all the women participating. They allow their song to speak, and if we ignore the fact that they did not manage to perform in the first choir several times, they will allow this song to speak very well. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise, looking at the scoreboard was Austria. The bookmakers here in Denmark had the greatest chances for this song - a song that really was beyond horror - but was in 8th place. Could this be the reason that he was shaking to the rhythm of the song? It was this performance that made me and my family laugh the most, not because it looked good, but because it looked so stupid that it really was fun. <br /> <br /> Sweden has done what they do best; ABBA. In 1999, they won with "Take Me To Your Heaven", sounding like ABBA. In 2001, they entered the top ten with “Listen To Your Heartbeat,” again sounding like ABBA, and again this year they did it in the style of ABBA, ending in the top 10 again. <br /> <br /> England was finally punished for writing those awful, incomprehensible songs like they were in recent years. <br /> <br /> Ireland frustrated the winner since 2000, “Fly On The Wings Of Love”. And I could continue to talk about how bad the songs were. <br /> <br /> I feel a little sorry for the Australians, who this year have finally got a chance to see Eurovision. They deserve better than that. <br /> <br /> I was not surprised by the show. Eurovision 2000 for me stands out as one of the best in recent years. The year 2001 was pretty good, but not so good. The year 2002 was fine, but certainly not anymore. This year was quite simply disappointing. <br /> <br /> Let's hope that next year everything will be better. If not for us, then at least for the Australians. <br /> <br /> 4/10. One for TATU, one for racing at close range, one for ass shaking and one for everyone else.
