I saw this movie when it first came out and hated it. I just saw it again 27 years later. I really liked it ... although Robin Williams was not at all suitable for the role ... What I remember most about the hatred of the film is that it was almost the exact opposite of what I understood when I read the book. Since I did not re-read it, I can only share my impressions from the past - but I am sure of one thing - the film is an extract from family life, whereas in the book almost ALL traditional institutions - including, and perhaps, especially, marriage - these are straitjackets, which we would get rid of well. The only positive point in the book is the amazing nature of the children ... that really captures only the beginning and end of the film (with this incredibly magnificent child floating in the air. It’s a pity that Williams doesn’t have a tenth of his charm!) - because the film distorts the book. Like the movie itself, it looks better, but only for a few key performances. Mary Beth Hurt is wonderful - I think that anyone who sees her will fall in love with her. And John Lithgow, as a former football player who has undergone a sex change operation, is simply fantastic ... he never broke camp and did not make the character anything other than commendable - and as such his game was incredibly fair. I watched him closely in all his scenes, and he was never anything but feminine. Nothing in his performance could match the performance of a transvestite ... and it mattered. In fact, of all the people in the film, he is the only one who is immaculate. It is worth watching this film only for its execution.
