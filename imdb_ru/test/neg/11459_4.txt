The Curse of the Mummy is the latest in a series of films about the mummy of Haris, and it seems that the work has somewhat dried up by the time they did this. Haris and his companion Ananka both fall into the bay of Louisiana, and after the resurrection he is looking for his beloved princess. How they get to Louisiana is not entirely clear, but due to the fact that different people are trying to find them, the viewer can be sure of some murders of mummies. <br /> <br /> The mummy’s curse was watchable, but in reality it wasn’t. Nothing special. Throughout the film, I had the feeling that I had seen it before. Frankly, apart from the original “Mothers with Boris Karloff”, the films “The Mummy” are not my favorites among the old universal horrors. They are not bad, but they repeat a little. <br /> <br /> There are some wonderful scenes in the film (for example, the scene in which Ananka comes to life in the swamp), but in general this did not happen, do a lot for me. <br /> <br /> It’s worth seeing if you want to be complete and watch all the movies about the mummy, but otherwise you can skip this movie.
