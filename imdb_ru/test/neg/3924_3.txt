There is nothing particularly unique or interesting about this low-budget sci-fi film. Despite its purebred origin (the film is based on the novel by Leo Tolstoy), the plot and general themes of this film are unremarkable and not original, science is weak at best, and, unfortunately, the film cannot even engage in compelling action sequences. <br /> <br /> The plot begins with a manned space flight to Mars, and although the main plot doesnâ€™t really unfold until the ship lands, most of the most interesting scenes take place along the way. Unfortunately, as soon as our interplanetary travelers land, their previously interesting interpersonal relationships, reflections on cosmology and the meaning of life, and all that is interesting in the film - all this is inferior to the only remotely connected plot about Martian revolutionaries, environmental issues and a not very convincing web of deception. <br /> <br /> There is also nothing remarkable about the quality of the film. It is bearable. And most of the action, albeit slow, is good. Cameron Mitchell is actually quite good and plays a nice character. I think that the best quality of this film, from my point of view, is his fashion sense. Martians have very nice outfits! If this film had a meaning, it could be much more interesting. Well.
