Watching QUINTET is no different than watching a group of people playing word games in Portuguese or in another language that you don’t understand. You understand that they are playing a game, and if you look carefully enough, you can just begin to understand the rules. But why bother, because it is clear that you can’t join and don’t want it if you had the chance. <br /> <br /> Directed by Robert Altman is not one of those who begged the audience to love his films, not to mention understanding them. Sometimes it allows you to slip into the picture to become part of the crowd, as in M ​​* A * S * H, NASHVILLE and A WEDDING, films filled with noise and organized chaos, one or two bodies in the scene will not matter much. And in other cases, he seems offended by the fact that someone might even watch his film; as in IMAGES or THREE WOMEN, where stories are almost personal monologues made for an audience of one, Altman. With QUINTET, Altman seems to have deliberately dared anyone to take part in the story. <br /> <br /> You cannot rely on what Altman will do logical or expected, which sometimes makes his films as amazing as the Iconoclasts. But sometimes do unexpected things do not dare, just stupid. For example, in QUINTET, we meet a young woman who is obviously the last person on earth to become pregnant, and she really has a child. This last ray of hope in a decaying society almost immediately faded away; Altman does not even wait for the end to play his last dismal card in this complex nihilistic and pessimistic story. He lets us know how empty and meaningless life is from the very beginning. Brave? May be. Stupid? Definitely. Without a goal, he is trying to build a story on a quickly thawing iceberg, all the while reminding us how meaningless these efforts are. <br /> <br /> By the way, QUINTET can at least claim to be prophetic. In the center of the plot is a traitorous game played by various bored characters. This is a form of TAG (killing game): a handful of people aim at each other, each of whom is a potential killer and each is a potential victim. Two or more can form alliances to kill the third. When they die, new targets are assigned. Whoever lives, wins. All this happens in some exotic, inhospitable wasteland. This is, to a large extent, the extreme science fiction version of The Survivor - with the exception of commercial traffic jams and fake "reality." <br /> <br /> This is not a bad concept for a science fiction epic. The post-apocalyptic setting, the microcosm of the world (the cast is clearly multinational), a game in which you can not trust, or at least not for long, and where no one wins. Literally cold war. A director with steel eyes, with a taste of dark humor and cruel inventions, could spend a field day. The secret in QUINTET is not in the game and not in how it is played, but in why it exists. If the game “Quintet” is a metaphor of life, then Altman, it seems, does not see anything in the material, except for the possibility to show life as an empty, meaningless game — a conclusion as obvious as it is wrong. Given the lively, albeit cynical nature of the rest of his various films, I do not believe that Altman also believes in QUINTET. And if Altman does not believe in his material, why should we?
