First, let me make it clear that I am a big fan of bad science fiction, especially when it comes to giant, stomping city monsters. But this one is so fantastically limping that I don’t even like that I’m bad. Obviously, they didn’t get enough money out of the budget, saving on requisites (the only support we need to specify to determine the size of an alien girl is a big new pencil that can be bought in Spencer’s Gifts for about fifteen bucks) also decided not to spend on a concept or plot. In my opinion, the monster looks fine, but it does not have enough interaction with the background, that is, there is not enough destruction to satisfy most fans of the genre. The general rule of giant monster films is this: if you don’t have a lot of fake buildings to smash them, you better fight another artificially looking monster. This film has neither. I can not make my last complaint about the film without giving out the ending, but suffice it to say, the origin of the monster and the method found to get rid of it, just do not hold water. Not even as good as most of these films. Skip this.
