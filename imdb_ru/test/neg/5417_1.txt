Wow. I thought Eskimo Lemon was the most awful and embarrassing first sex movie ever. But I forgot that Germany is always trying to compete. In this case, the famous German film producer Bernd Eichinger succeeded in creating even worse crap. Hart Youngs is stupid, not believable and predictable, and the main thing: not funny. It is almost a tragedy that so many children came to see it in Germany (and, I fear, also in Austria). <br /> <br /> Tobias Schenke, 19, looks too cute not to have a girlfriend, and too ripe to be 15, and his character is too stupid to be true. Schenke is trying hard to make us believe that he knows nothing about sex, but that does not help. Harte Jungs seem to be made by someone who watched Al Bundy and took him too seriously. <br /> <br /> The best actors in the film are Sissy Perlinger and Stefan Jurgens, who play the half-liberal parents of Schenkey. Perlinger and Yurgens are constant comedians who are not particularly talented in the cinema. Nevertheless, their performances are the “best” and “most funny” in comparison with him. <br /> <br /> Complete failure.
