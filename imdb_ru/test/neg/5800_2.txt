this film has no plot. It was assumed that the guy moves with his grandmother, and everyone thinks that he is a loser, and he should redeem himself. but what happens after everyone finds out with whom he lives? they have a big party at grandma's house. The climax of the film did not even concern the rest. This whole story was presented within a few minutes after the end of the film. I can see how it CAN be connected with the alleged story - that the skills of the grandmother of VG save him - but this simply was not. <br /> <br /> However, the film was pretty damn funny and was obviously very dependent on jokes. <br /> <br /> "Her pussy smells like a great depression" "He just sucked her first breast ... yes for 13 hours" "This is for you ... I think this is the devil"
