A weak story about an evil sorcerer who is looking for a century-long satanic Bible, so that he can fulfill the order of Lucifer, destroying creations. In pursuit of all, a 17th century bounty hunter named Redfern and his reluctant assistant Cassandra are stalking. Sounds like a pile of banker? This is true. <br /> <br /> This nonsense from writer D.T. Tuishi gets the superficial attitude that she deserves from director Steve Meiner (who directed this eternally young romantic nonsense). Twohy obviously knows nothing of true evil. <br /> <br /> Julian Sands just flies around and giggles, trying to look evil, while Richard Grant only manages to waste his rich talent. Career Laurie Singer also went against this. <br /> <br /> The special effects team had fun, and Jerry Goldsmith provides an account superior to his subject.
