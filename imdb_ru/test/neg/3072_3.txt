Terrible. There is no way around this. The script is at the level of one of some Mexican soap opera, the choice and use of shooting locations that make the film labyrinth and at the same time repetitive and monotonous, with catastrophic actions of almost the entire cast. References to Tarantino's work, so poorly done, are an insult rather than anything else. I suspect that it would not be for shameless and unrelated to the operation of the generous Matidinho curves, no one would have made an effort to watch this film in any theater. <br /> <br /> These are the films that make me. No desire to watch a Portuguese movie.
