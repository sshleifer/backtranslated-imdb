A trashy girl (yes, a ditsi is as complex as her character) will not answer “no” and does fancy things to bring her husband back. It is too implausible to be believable with such fragile characters passing through the movements. But not so contrived as to be as exciting as "Being John Malkovich." So this is boring. <br /> <br /> sv
