This was the biggest disappointment of the film ...: (It sucks because I was really looking forward to it. <br /> <br /> All the turns were crap. They were ALL the memories !!! <br /> <br /> What makes a good movie with a robbery is the RELIABILITY of this work. Yes, it should be amazing, so the audience is stunned, but if you leave and leave - these are #! T bulls ... what's the point? <br /> <br /> In addition, the main robbery - in any case, grabbing the bag! You did not see the team working with full deceptive and brilliant potential. In this film there wasnâ€™t even ONE good robbery! They were all rubbish ... ... including the crappy game of the French idiot to go through the lasers ... it's easy to do when they are later put together! Plus, this kind of thing has already been done in at least one other movie ... and then it was stupid as well ... <br /> <br /> Also, there is no reason to have even half of 12 or 11 in this film! What is the meaning of half the cast for the outcome of this film ??? SCENES should not even be there! <br /> <br /> The first was stylish. It was not expensive! And it makes the whole team lose confidence. Especially Ocean for bowing to Bennett.
