Here we see another pop star bursting into a grand television country, and from my observations from her pop career directors saying, â€œYes, your great Gwen, you can become a real star, maybe someday you will be on the list "A, they will do anything." to expand the series, there is simply no pretty face, but there is an acting ability almost overnight. Gwen has something to gain the ability to act by observing such actors as James Dean or Clint, to the east. Please let the real people in the world who have to sit behind this box and endure the efforts of pop stars in an attempt to act. Please stick to your cute pop videos with your Japanese squad and do not insult the British actresses by your efforts. in any case, I return to my work in the working class and I think to myself, oh, I could do that. but yes, remember, I will work until the age of 65, if I live so long, and yes, you raise your legs, the girl with your fee every three months, ugh, to marry the money right xxx
