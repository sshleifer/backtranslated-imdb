Here's a fantastic concept for the film - a series of meteors crashes into a small city, and as a result, an alien infection is fixed on the DVR with a single camera when the city slowly captures the city. Leave it to Albert Pyun to spoil everything! Do not come within 100 feet of this click! Damn it, what a bomb ... it could be worse than Pyone! The crazy thing is that there is an embryo of creative ideas - a whole flash told from the POV of the DVR. When I heard about this some time ago, I imagined how a car breaks down into trifles, people run together, infected people break the windshield and surround the car with chaos. That would be cool, right? Instead, we have a lead that goes all the time in a circle in a wooded area, occasionally encountering three infected types that just stand there. The last bit is literally a 15 minute snapshot, when nothing happens in front of the camera, only the noise is heard behind the scenes. Stay away!!! With some relief, I think I officially stop watching “Pyun” ... I only needed 20 crappy films to realize that I had more important things to do.
