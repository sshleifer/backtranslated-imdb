This film begins with a man who seems to be something of a sports driver. He meets with a gang that contains an arrogant boss, an obvious idiot, a fat boy who never speaks, and a woman who spins between the three of them. The group, called Satan's Angels, wants Rod, the driver, to be their personal driver. He says no, but then he says yes after the authorities forced his spy to check them. They rob a gun shop in a ridiculously missing scene. The scene includes a woman going to the store with long hair in a bun and large round glasses. She says she wants protection and wants the seller to load a gun to show her how. Then she takes it from the seller and shoots him. The remaining three in the gang (except Rod) run to the store. They take everything off the walls and then start playing with them, like children receiving their toys for Christmas. <br /> <br /> This film certainly does not waste precious screen time on the plot.
