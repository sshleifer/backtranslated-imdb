I first read about the “Left Behind” series a few months ago and made a note to check it out because I’m interested in how religion is used to control people in our hate-filled world, so imagine my surprise and joy when I found a copy of the book “Left Behind the Back: World at War” in my local library, innocently nestled among militants with a large budget. <br /> <br /> Now, like a film, it is extremely poor. Acting right from the production of elementary school, and "special effects" would look outdated in the early 90s. Being the third part of the series, this story would have been incomprehensible to anyone who has not seen or read about the other films "Left behind me," and even with my prior knowledge it was quite funny. <br /> <br /> On the religious front, I don’t think that someone who was not yet filled with the spirit of a lord would find something in the film to convince them to change their ways. How should you be afraid of the antichrist when he has a comedic Russian accent, and the worst of his abilities is some kind of pathetic CGI? <br /> <br /> However, my main problem with this film is a blatant attempt to try and make people believe that this is a big budget fighter. Picking up the box and reading the spire, I immediately noticed something strange ... nowhere on the packaging was there any mention of the true nature of this film. For someone who does not know, for all intents and purposes, it seems that Left Behind: World at War is no different from the last Tom Clancey. And the copy, which I rented, does not say that it is the third in the series. <br /> <br /> Considering the whole premise of the series that the antichrist deceived the whole world, I find it extremely hypocritical that the filmmakers tried to deceive me TWICE before I even got to resist! If you are so firm in your beliefs, then why not be honest about this? <br /> <br /> The simple fact is that if it were not a “Christian” film with an embedded fan base associated with it, I seriously doubt that it would ever see the light of day. If Cloud Ten hoped that I would see the mistake of my path and give myself to God, I’m afraid to say that I would die of boredom and / or laugh to death before I ever had a chance.
