Right on Kolmister. I completely agree with all your feelings and add them. I came to my computer specifically to leave a comment on this horrible (minus) Bgrade film. I was going to say that nowadays I canâ€™t figure out how someone can make such a terrible movie - but you beat me. Anyone who reads this and Colmister's comment, believe me, don't waste time and money. This is an absolute shocker. The action is absolutely miserable, the script is much worse, and (so-called) special effects are a joke. Of course, no one invested in this film? I really can't think of anything else to say about this so-called science fiction science fiction product, but I have to add this comment to make 10 comment lines for it to be accepted for presentation.
