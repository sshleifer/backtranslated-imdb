I am not familiar with the other works of the producer, but this film is a piece of shit. <br /> <br /> I have never seen the MST3K version, but I can tell you that Mike and Botha probably did not save it. <br /> <br /> I love the movie class “z” as well as the next bad movie fan, but it was almost impossible to see. <br /> <br /> There was no merit in who sounded "The Dark". From time to time, it sounded like Patrick Stewart. <br /> <br /> A group of schoolchildren who found an unnecessary super- 8, could make a movie better than this.
