Before watching this movie, I realized that this would be a low budget movie. But even by these low standards, this film does not cut it. <br /> <br /> The problem is not so much that the directors had a small budget or played poorly, wrote, directed, voiced music and edited. I expected all this to be bad, and it is. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this film is that he didn’t even cope with courage and blood. Most of the “action” takes place behind the scenes, and all we can see are the consequences that look very false - even by the standards of low-budget bloody films. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is no excuse that blood is so poorly made. At about the same time, Peter Jackson made an equally low-budget “Bad Taste,” and he somehow managed to make much more convincing courage and bleeding than was shown in this film. <br /> <br /> Failure at almost every level, I can not recommend this movie to anyone. Stay away from that. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
