The scale of this film stuns me. About a week ago I published a commentary on the silent epic “MASTIA IN HELL” of 1926, calling it “stunning”. Then I ran into the BLOOD RED PLANET Pollonia Bros. Wow ... <br /> <br /> It's all about the scale of thinking. The brothers Pollonia and his colleague John McBride thought so big that the reflections of Arthur Clarke and Stanley Kubrick of 2001: SPACE ODESSA, lucky, were released thirty-two years before this sweetheart. In fact, Kubrick was easy with the modelers, the budget, the actual actors and the main studio support for his little robbery of Star Trek, and all that Arthur C. Clark had to do was write the damn thing. What is so difficult to train on a typewriter? On the other hand, the brothers Pollonius had to think radically, outside the box and quickly. They recruited half a dozen of their friends and colleagues — including a pretty chick — bought a bunch of colored light bulbs, checked old office supply dumps on each keyboard, monitor, and headset for hands-free communication that they could find, made everyone the same black turtlenecks made in each cupcake the bank in the area, learned enough 3D modeling and texture skins to liven up a couple of spacecraft overflights, spent a couple of hours picking up the script, doing what is undoubtedly the most frightening space doll eskogo monster since this horrible little monster Jabba the Hut, which he carried with him, was roasted R2D2, I spent literally days of working with the camera VHS and the Amiga, to shoot and edit their films, and was the winner. This is the best D.I. Straight to the home video fans of the film epic I've ever seen, and in proportion to the number of talents and resources available to filmmaker dwarfs, even LOGANS RUN or BATTLESTAR: GALACTICA (original series), as a frightening look at our future, right up to the speaker, dressed in the wrong, bad suit of the 2nd hand. As a species, we are doomed. <br /> <br /> Seriously for a minute, this is a significant improvement compared to such later epics as “DINOSAURING CHRONICLE” or “PREALIEN: ANOTHER'S PREVENTOR”, which is funny, as it was done before. any of these masterpieces. Approximately the same way, Pollonia began to calm down: this film is played with a certain conviction that makes you believe that you can really breathe in a vacuum by wearing a dust mask and two bottles for bikers. And the scene where the alien beast absorbs a miniature crew member, made me immediately think about where I saw it before: GODZILLA V.S. SEA MONSTER, where a giant frantic monster crab skewers two canoes and eats them on camera. It made me cry when I was a kid. <br /> <br /> It made me cry like an adult, because here I spend my time trying to be a kind of critic or a writer or a writer / critic, and these guys get to have fun doing a real science fiction epic with lots of bright colored lights, a hot chick, and a talking slide projector called KAL. One of the flight crew members can even wear his black space baseball cap backwards and brighter with his goat beard, like this clown from Metallica. Is this supposed to be a joke? Not. This is an epic statement about humanity, from humanity and for humanity, which deserves to be seen by everyone who is able to take it seriously. Look for it on the 2 disc box sets called GALAXY OF TERROR in the cut DVDs of your favorite discount retailer, which probably belong to him, but many of us can say, "Yes, they have a couple of sets of our films for sale at best. "4/10: Anyone who has no sense of humor may try SILENT RUNNING or possibly TRON. But someday, an alien civilization on the other side of the galaxy will intercept the transmission This film and decides that we really should not be wrong. Good work guys!
