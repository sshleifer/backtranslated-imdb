As a serious horror fan, I understand that some marketing tricks are used to sell films, especially really bad ones. So I would not call it naive if I thought it was an erotic horror that rends the Cannibal / Zombie / Jungle Holocaust. Unfortunately, I was completely wrong, since it is very hardcore. I had to understand that when I saw the strange warning "The actual or identifiable minor was not used." Noticed the identifiable part, as if he dared to catch us? A group of scientists, half of whom are pretty women in bikinis, are led by a sea captain with a penchant for hunting on the beach in search of mutated locals who kill villagers. Because of a nuclear bomb exploded on a supposedly evacuated island, radiation turned this last person into a rapist / killer. <br /> <br /> Writer / actor George Eastman is the only one who tries here, and he manages to keep his clothes on. Sex scenes are knocked out. Women go naked, exuding a strange self-confidence, and one even asks for rape when her husband refuses her. Well, two chicks, clapping each other, naturally turn into lesbian scenes, because women are chords. I saw the chicken throwing another salad with chickens and a finger. <br /> <br /> If you need to know something about this film, then it is. Because the rest of this crazy movie is exactly the same. Oh who am I kidding? There is something to tell. Like the white "Duchess" who pays for 2 black guys to tag the team in the living room. Or "Duchess", removing her top to use as a bandage when the captain cut himself. When he refuses her advances, she begins to cry. Being a good gentleman, he reluctantly allows her to give him pleasure in front of other crew members. I honestly waited for the guy from the pizzeria to come, and the “Duchess” would ask if there was another way to pay him. <br /> <br /> And all this happens before they go to the island to conduct them. study. Wait, I thought it was a zombie movie? But the zombies do not enter up to the 73-minute mark, but by that time everyone else has already “entered” in abundance. I caught myself throwing a few or more scenes forward. This is my first spray porn movie, and I don't think he does it a subgenre of justice. I guess this woman in me speaks when I say that I would like more conspiracy and less sweaty, slobbering, hairy sex. It's funny that it could work like a decent horror movie, since the idea of ​​an atomic bombing that mutated a bitter man and killed his family was good. Even the character of Eastman shakes his head and moves away from mating a pair. It makes me wonder if the character or the writer himself is disgusted. <br /> <br /> I don’t want to go into the quality of the sound or the movie, because you should have already guessed that this is bad. This production was filmed closely with 3 other films, including Erotic Nights of the Living Dead, in which most of the same cast was filmed. Eastman said it was done because everyone wanted a vacation and a salary. No matter, I suddenly want to talk about sound. The sound was strange during the sex scenes, because while the actors speak Italian, it seems that they recorded off-screen English inscriptions and played them in dialogue. Therefore, while two people are exposed, I clearly hear someone in the background say, “No! Yes! Wonderful! Wait! ”There was a slightly funny Italian account that could not save this film. SFXs were minimal at best and consisted of blood in only a few scenes. And I would like to point out that there were no violent rape scenes, as written on the bright warning label on the DVD cover (hmm, another marketing ploy), so there is no fear. Just beware of a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Presented in a widescreen format with an aspect ratio of 1.85: 1. I watched the Region 1 Not Rated version, which worked for 113 minutes, released in 2005 by Exploitation Digital. Apparently, there is an XXX version from Alfa Digital that works the same way, so I doubt that something else is. Prices vary, but you do not have to pay more than $ 25 per copy. Or, as I would recommend, do not pay anything and pretend that it does not exist. <br /> <br /> Favorite quote: ship mate: “The civilians were not lucky. Women out of luck. Are they scientists too? monsters. " Additional DVD content: original trailer with hardcore shots and murders to make it more interesting than it is, trailers for SS Hell Camp, Emmanuelle and ENOTLD, as well as a very informative interview with Eastman. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Lame porn, but even weaker, like a horror movie. Either get real porn or watch real horror. <br /> <br /> Rating :. 3/10 Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com
