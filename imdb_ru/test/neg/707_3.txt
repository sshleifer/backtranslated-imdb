When the film begins, it becomes obvious how sick the boys are. Although Oliver Hardy is huge, it is Stanley who looks like death warmed up. Obviously, he was fatally ill during production and, obviously, lost a lot of weight. Although he will eventually recover and live another decade and a half, here he looks like a dying person. In addition, when I watched the movie, I was shocked that Stan had to fail - I half expected him to drop dead from stress. I really can't understand WHY they retired due to their health - especially when history and production values ​​are as poor as in this film. <br /> <br /> Stanley inherits the island and the boat. He and Ollie are ready to leave when Antoine, a stateless person, is literally thrown into their boat, and they begin their journey to find the island. Along the way, they discover that Giovanni has removed, but despite this, the four men became friends and landed on another island. It’s like heaven, and they’re all very happy. A little later, a pretty young lady joins them and everything looks great. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, uranium was found on the island, and this place was inundated with a riff. In the end, the crowd decides to hang four men and capture them - at this moment the island plunges into the sea again, and people will take pity. <br /> <br /> I'll give the film a bit of originality for what is interesting. However, one thing is not funny - and it is unforgivable for the movie Laurel and Hardy. Although the film is not bad, it is certainly not very good. The sad end of their brilliant career. <br /> <br /> All the actors, except for the duet, are dubbed into English, since the film was made in France. Although it may not be the worst movie they shot (it will be BIG NOISE), it’s definitely close! Watching this movie is painful and similar to how people clean up after a serious accident.
