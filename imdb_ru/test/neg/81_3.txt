So the world will never change, and it will be bombed at the box office, but the Honky Tonk Freeway is one of those films that I fell in love with when I was a kid (the BBC showed it several times during the 1980s, and it happened that in the car was a high-quality VHS tape - lucky that!) and looked endlessly. I watched the DVD last night and, unfortunately, the time was not kind to this potential blockbuster. Either that, or I just grew out of this wide, sluggish humor. Come on, when Schlesinger is so desperate for laughter, he gives us close-ups of new-look panties with "funny" slogans, what can you say about the actors or the script? <br /> <br /> Of course, this is ambitious, interesting, unusual and long, but never funny. I would characterize it as a children's film with some “adult” overtones - you can safely let it watch it to children, despite 15 certificates. They will not receive recommendations on drugs, so do not worry about it. I was pleasantly surprised when I realized that I forgot how memorable was the title song and the song of the truck driver writing the song “Everybody's Going Faster, Faster”, not to mention the patriotic hymn of the city of Tiklo. The whole cast gives meritorious performances, the photo is clear and perfectly conveys the mood of various locations, and real-time sensations are associated with fashion, cars, gadgets (especially the drum machine installed on the dashboard), interiors and popular culture links - I He was more than surprised to hear how a crazy homeless man in the bank said loudly to everyone: “I am O.J. Simpson! ”, Especially now Simpson’s legal gossip darkens his sporting achievements. The catch is that there is almost no plot, too obvious to be witty and not funny enough to cause a lot of sincere laughter. I would leave it as a pleasant memory.
