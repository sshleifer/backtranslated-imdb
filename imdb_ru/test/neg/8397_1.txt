How one of you gave it more than 2 stars amazes me. I made an IMDb account just to comment on this movie. The operative is cr @ p, and the plot is cr @ p. He would not deserve stars at all if it were not for the soundtrack for the descent (and yet there are some incredibly clown tracks, in particular, those that show an oboe and sound like a black and white cartoon comedy background, and by no means corresponds the intended mood of the scenes they pursue) and quality cinema. The dialogue and plot are about as complex as those in Dr. Suze’s book. These actors are terrible. I’m actually watching this movie right now, and, with every word, I am stunned that you all have swallowed this crap. The only reason I didn’t turn off the film was because I was fascinated by creating an account on IMDb and posting this review. I dig mainstream movies, I dig silly stupid movies, I dig retro indie films, and almost every other type / genre, if everything is done well. My brother convinced me to rent it, because he said he heard it was good, and he usually has a great taste in the movies; from the moment he told me the name, I looked at him as if I was crazy. It is hard for me to end this rant, because there is so much bad to talk about. The only way I can justify good grades here is that you guys paid to give this film high marks. It is so poorly made, and close to dramatic, artsy, complex, well written, well prepared, or even tolerable. If it was the end product of my hard directorial work, I would be ashamed to release it to the public, so I don’t even feel sorry for the director if he reads it - what the hell do you think, man?
