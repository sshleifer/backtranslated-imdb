Ok, enough. Every time when I think that I saw a film that was so enchanted, so bad in all respects, that I think that no one could find something to compliment, I just came to IMDb, where I was greeted with an ordinary meaningless masterpiece "GREAT film" - I mean, frankly, what kind of film do you people watch, because this is definitely not the same mess that I just watched on the new DVD Fox / MGM / UA. There are about three funny lines and a plot which gives inconsistency a new meaning. And then, after ninety-three endless minutes, it just stops and the final credits begin. Then there is another scene. The DVD is pretty pathetic, which is suitable for a movie. The starting material fades almost completely to an ugly brown color. It’s hard to imagine that this movie followed Get Carter. Critics and the public understood this right then - it was a dazed and box office disaster, and rightfully so. But you experts keep trying. And I will keep trying to find a film that doesn’t have someone who’s raving about it.
