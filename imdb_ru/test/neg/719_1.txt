I read all the plays of Shakespeare, looked at the performances of most of them, and even played and directed some of them. I don't necessarily believe that Shakespeare should be done in the “traditional” way, but I hated this film. <br /> <br /> There is a nude, unnecessary and unnecessary. There is a grotesque that far surpasses what I think Shakespeare intended. Some dialogues are incomprehensible, and there are elements such as singing and dancing, which do not add any meaning to the film, but replace Shakespeare with self-indulgence of the director. <br /> <br /> I am very sorry. I spent absolutely good money to buy a DVD of this film.
