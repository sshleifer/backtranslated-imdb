I got this film from the library and saw that there are a lot of actors in it that I like (John Cleese, Ian Holm, Ralph Richardson, etc.), so I took it and looked. I expected Cleese to play a big role since he first billed, and I was surprised to learn that he had about five minutes of screen time along with everyone else I liked. This film is surprisingly pointless, the characters are worthless, the plot does not exist, and the ending is one of the worst ends I've ever seen. There were some fun parts, but that's all. Stay away from this movie if you want to prevent the appearance of "What?" and "Ha?" a lot. And if you do not want to waste your time. Do not pay attention to people who say that this is a very funny movie ... it is not. Just stay away from it at all costs ... please.
