Unlike other westerns of spaghetti, it has characters that almost make sense, and can be identified to some extent. It still has the dumb skirmish of other Western spaghetti. By the way, spaghetti is another word for a Western without a plot, no characters you can take care of, and a dull firefight that makes no sense for the era, and relying on great music to make the audience feel something carefree, like the ones that Bad Spencer and Terence Hill did together. They also exceeded the rubbish made by Eastwood and others, whom the sadomasochists force their friends to watch if they have a chance. It seems that everyone had a lot of fun doing the movie. It was nice to see such a gigantic actor as Gilbert Roland, who was not even mentioned in the movies, but who was clearly the biggest name. His character was very pleasant. In the end, there is a three-sided standoff that far surpasses the one that it forges (Good, Evil and Ugly), simply because the characters are at least a little cute and a little recognizable. Not a very good movie, but there is a bit of fun.
