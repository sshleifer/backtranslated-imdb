Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro should be a combination that leads to a great comedy. High hopes often lead to disappointment, and this is confirmed by the case. <br /> <br /> When Eddie, as a police officer, spoils the drug deal made by Detective Robert, they screw it up so much that they end up doing a live streaming reality show. Logic is not a big part of this movie. The super pistol they carry out in the second half of the film, pursuing this, confirms this. Twelve gauge machine guns that leave large holes in the sheet metal, and three will destroy the house in about a minute (without reloading) - this is more of a fantasy than science fiction. A five-pound pistol, shooting hundreds of shots per minute without any recoil, is certainly the weapon of the future using technology from the past. <br /> <br /> It is clear that this film is not intended for adults or children, so if you are somewhere in the middle, this is the film for you.
