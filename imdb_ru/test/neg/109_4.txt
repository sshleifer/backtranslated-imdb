Ben (Rupert Grint) is a deeply unhappy teenager, the son of his miserably married parents. His father (Nicholas Farrell) is the vicar, and his mother (Laura Linney) ... well, let's say, she is a somewhat hypocritical warrior in the army of Jesus. Only when he gets a summer job as an assistant to the dirty, eccentric, once famous and now forgotten actress Evie Walton (Julie Walters), does he finally find herself in the real Harold and Maud. Of course, Evie herself is deeply unhappy, and only when these two sad bags find each other, can they put aside their mutual suffering and go on the road to happiness. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is trivial, sentimental, and very predictable, but there is a hard side to this, and Walters, who could sleep, walking on this kind of things, if she wanted, is excellent. When she goes crazy around and finds the pathos in the character (for example, by hitting the bottle and snatching it in the sink), she feels better. The problem is that she is the only interesting character in the film (and this is not because of the script, which does not benefit anyone). Grint, on the other hand, is not just unhappy; he is a bit boring, while the starched bitch lynni is completely one-dimensional. (However, she has an English accent). The best thing to say about this is that it is softly pleasant - with an emphasis on soft.
