God, I never, never thought that I would write the above four words. But, in fact, she is the main character of this little film. <br /> <br /> Since the film was packed when I rented it, it was supposedly a comedy about a girl who was kidnapped, but she has no medicine that keeps her stable. It sounded like a nice concept. For years, all we ever saw about spelling was like Donna Martin in the year 90210 and an endless parade of boring, lifeless television films. It sounded like a chance for her to stretch a bit, and considering that with her success on television and her rich dad, she could not have any financial reason to make this film, I thought that she assumed the role because it should be a budget pearl. <br /> <br /> Wrong. <br /> <br /> Instead, Spelling plays a small role, and a little about the mentally unstable kidnapping victim is just one of several plot lines. When it is not on the screen, the movie crawls so badly that I could swear that it is longer than 85 minutes that were indicated on the tape. It would have worked much better if the Spelling storyline dominated, and it turned into a romantic comedy with her and Phil, the least annoying kidnapper.
