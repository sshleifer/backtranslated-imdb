A brainless movie about two girls and some guys they meet at the airport when they get on the wrong bus late at night and get into a whole world of problems. The big twists are perfect, and I mean completely wasted, in the movie with the plot, incredibly stupid to challenge the description. What is happening in a general sense is good, I mean, the idea of ​​a guy kidnapping unattended girls for nefarious purposes is a good one. The problem is that the details are so incredible that I would be shocked if you don’t turn off the film in complete disbelief. Gee, the guy who is supposed to take you home won't go anywhere, and will you stay on the bus? It gets worse, remember every bad choice, and in this film the characters make it, even to the extent that they can just leave, but they never do. What is annoying is that some of the turns might have worked, if there had been something clever before, but there was almost no reason in this film. Well, maybe the end, the end is smart. The end is what should worry you. it should be "oh # $ * @ !!!!" moment and become a classic horror movie. Instead, he just lies among the stupid ruins of a stupid movie. One of the most brainless films of the year.
