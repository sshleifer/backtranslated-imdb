What starts out pretty well (and quite anxiously) quickly sinks into an annoying mess. <br /> <br /> Dee Snyder (out of the shame of the Twisted Sister) apparently composed the script from his own idea, and although the idea of ​​a cyber perceiver-piercer has a lot of potential, and he really hits his uneven rhythm, poor dialogue and of the greatest without end that you have ever seen. Despite some lifeless performances, the director manages a truly creepy first roll. It really looks like it will be a good low-budget event. <br /> <br /> There is no such luck. The plot unfolds across the entire map, and Snyder's character spits out the tiresome lines of psychotic cookies that must pass for meaningful dialogue. Worse, the cast is barely recorded, and the only plausible dialogue comes from a young girl who helps the detective navigate the Internet. <br /> <br /> What an empty idea. Oh, and there's a new twisted Sisters song, if you're interested.
