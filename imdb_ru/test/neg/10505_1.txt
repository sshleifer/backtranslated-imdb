This film should go down in the history of bad movies as the worst I've ever seen. It was not even a bad movie b ... I would rate it as z. The special effects were ridiculous ... even if you could call them special effects. I think the reviewer, before hitting a nail in the head ... it was the box that sold the film, while the cover was gorgeous, and the synopsis is intriguing (both, so I rented it) a waste of time but money too. I did not last long. I took it back to the store and switched to another movie. I think my local video store took it off the shelf because they had MUCH MUCH complaints about this horrible movie. My 6-year-old could better cope with shooting and writing a script!
