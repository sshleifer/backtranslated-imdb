Diane Keaton is a pathetic actress. She's so boring and fake. It is the same on the screen. I saw her in an interview with Ellen Degeneres, and she behaves exactly the same as in the movies. Her stupid facial expressions make me want to change channels. She was in several good films, but they would have been better if someone had been selected for this role. Steve Martin also adds nothing to the film. He also acts and destroys the old favorite. The funny role played by Martin Short only adds more idiocy to the film. I tried to watch the movie twice, but both times I had to turn it off.
