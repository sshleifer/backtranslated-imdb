Poor Jane Austen. This production dog does not make her wonderful tongue in romance cheeks any justice. Starting at the top ... poorly adapted. The writer deserves additional low marks for trying - if you think about it, I donâ€™t know what she was aiming for, but suffice to say that she missed the mark in light years !! Combine this with all the overly active and terrible production values, this is one adaptation that should never have happened. It would be much better if they just gave up all the money they poured on this flop and donated them to a decent charity. Do yourself a favor, read the book. Almost certainly you will enjoy a thousand times more than trying to survive this painful production!
