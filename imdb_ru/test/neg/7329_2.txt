This movie is available as a special bonus feature on the Horror 101 and Horror 102 double disc: Endgame. This has nothing to do with these films, except that they show that producers / directors Dudelson and Clavell are in a rut. As in other films, in this film, young people walk into the building in which they find themselves trapped, and run around the corridors a lot while they are being shot one by one. In the end, one or more characters have a different identity. This is by far the worst of the three. <br /> <br /> Here people are invited to the opening of Halloween only on Halloween night. There are not many exhibits in the museum, and all of them are connected with the ancient Central American traditions. The museum also has meat-eaters spreading the infection, as well as an ancient cannibal warrior and two female warriors. <br /> <br /> The film is very boring. It kills people pretty quickly, to such an extent that you are wondering who they are going to leave to kill - at this moment a few more people appear without giving any reason for them to be killed. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, one of the characters has a mobile phone, and he can really call the police, who actually take it seriously and appear in the museum. When one tries to break the lock, the other tells him that it will be “forced entry”. If there are people in the building who were injured, I think it does not matter. The police are also stupid that when they shoot a zombie in the head, it falls, but then they shoot other zombies in the chest and they don’t fall. It happens that they shoot another zombie in the head and it falls. They continue to shoot the rest of the zombies in the chest. Stupid. <br /> <br /> The opening captions and nightmare are made in the form of an animation effect over the video, something like “Waking life” for the poor man, but not so cartoonish. This is quite interesting, but some parts of the attacks are executed the same way, so there is no logic in it. <br /> <br /> Awful.
