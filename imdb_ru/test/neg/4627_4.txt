IMAGE PURPLE MOMENT <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Silent <br /> <br /> (Black and white - Short film) <br / > Two unlucky revelers in a nightclub (Laurel and Hardy) cannot pay their bill, which causes cruel retribution from a hot-tempered waiter (Tiny Sandford). <br /> <br /> A typical L & H scenario, less significant than some of their best work over this period, but nevertheless worth seeing. This time, Stan takes center stage, facing a financial dilemma after he holds back part of his salary to finance a night in the city, only to find out - too late! - that his injured wife (Fay Holderness) replaced his stash with useless coupons. Some of Laurelâ€™s lengthy close-ups, when he slowly realizes the unfolding catastrophe, reveal his genius for characterization and pantomime. The moral of the 1920s is represented by Patsy O'Birn, who plays an obsessive person who gives great pleasure in warning the respective spouses L & H (Holderness and Lyle Tahoe) about the bad behavior of their husbands. The finale ends, but the film still has something to recommend. Directed by James Parrott.
