There are many mysteries in life. For example: why did someone, other than Carrot Top, agree to appear in this film? Why did someone distribute this film? Why did someone pay money to see it? I think that none of these questions will ever be answered, but one thing I know for sure, this film is one of the worst ever made with such a large budget. That would be bad, but adding the “humor” of the Carrot Top makes it worse. The only entertainment you can get from this movie is to burn it, smash it or otherwise destroy it in a fun way. If you were comparing it with every movie ever made, it would be just between “Problem Child” and “Biodome”. Enough.
