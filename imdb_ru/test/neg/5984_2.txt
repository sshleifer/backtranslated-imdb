He begins to look like he can go somewhere, and then quickly leads the main characters to a three-ring circus with surprising folly, which will forever destroy any attractive characters. I am a big collector of stoner films, but this is something that I don’t think is the right complement. Bong water is rubbish from the deepest areas of the dumpster, and I wouldn't be stuck with it on the shelf. I’m really convinced that this film was created by the Drug Free America Partnership. If you are a fan of Jack Black, I would say that you might think that 5 minutes of the film is fine, because Jack Black continues his legacy of singing songs for the mentally retarded. I really can't say enough bad words about this movie.
