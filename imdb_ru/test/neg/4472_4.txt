4 out of 10. <br /> <br /> This film was not funny in general and was not even worth putting any emotions into the characters. Eugene Levy is probably the funniest .... The rest of the actors do their work, but the story is never very deep, and there are many holes in the plot that never fill up. It was not very fun, despite the fact that it was fun from time to time. <br /> <br />
