I have seen a lot of bad movies in my life. The date of the movie. That was bad. But this ... this is just ... this is not good. House Party 4 is the worst movie ever. It is so simple. It is basically a ferris bueller with black people in it. Oh, and this is not funny. It's horrible. So awful, Chris Stokes may be a superstar on BET, but he is an idiot. He can't write a comedy. Or a horror movie. I like to call him the black, less famous Uwe Boll. With the exception of Uwe Boll's films, they are terribly funny, if you know what I mean. You can invite your friends, take a peek at Alone In The Dark and have a great time, laughing and snacking with your friends. Chris Stokes is like that, except that if you invite your friends to see House Party 4 with you, no one will laugh. Even a biased black guy or an illiterate athlete. I'm serious, I never laughed once for this whole movie. The acting is terrible, and the film looks like a bad indie film. What was the budget for this film? 5 damn dollars? I mean, what the hell? This film just sucks; Don't waste your time with this shit. It's disgusting.
