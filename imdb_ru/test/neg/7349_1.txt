I watched this show for a while, just because of my cousins, and I HATE THIS! First, girls dress in the same clothes, and they have the same first letters in the names. (C'mon, I could have been better than this!) Then the villains (have mercy), first we have a monkey with a part of his (small) brain showing, then we have a (merry) version of the devil, a pink country girl - the green gang (irony, that's their name), the spoiled princess (again, ironically, this is her “name”) among others. I also found that there is no male hero in the series. (Not that I'm a sexist or something ...) I would rather look at Sailor Moon, this is much better than that. If someone wants to watch a show in the room where you are, find a way to break the TV. Believe me, this will save you half an hour of torture. <br /> <br /> Rating: I give only what it deserves, 1 out of 10. Whatever you do, DO NOT LOOK THIS!
