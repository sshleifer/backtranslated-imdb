I would add a little here to the comment of bowlofsoul23. But as the first Brazilian (born, raised and living in Rio de Janeiro, just a few miles from the favella Vigario Geral, depicted in the film), commented on the USA funded “Favela Rising” here on IMDb, I have mixed feelings: On the one hand, it’s good that the terrible situation of Brazilian favels has attracted more attention from filmmakers and the media, both from Brazil and from abroad, since local governments seem to have long surrendered. On the other hand, it is incredibly disappointing that Favela Rising turns out to be such a missed opportunity to educate non-Brazilian audiences on this issue, because new directors Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochari (who are from the US and, for obvious reasons) neophytes on this issue) turn bi AfroReggae group leader Anderson Sa in glamorous canonization in this superficial, one-sided, under-studied and misleading documentary. Good intentions, tangled results. “Favela Rising” looks like a television advertisement, it is shallow like a television interview in prime time and biased as a commercial. <br /> <br /> “Favela Rising” feels awkwardly false for a Brazilian viewer, and not just because of its deceptive visual interpretation of a grim reality and the inappropriate good mood of a happy ending. “The City of God” is an obvious reference here: COG actors Leandro Firmino and Jonathan Haagensen act as comedians for no apparent reason other than “hype”. Favela Rising is allegedly a documentary about the AfroReggae group and its leader Anderson Sa, but be careful: when you see scenes shot in favels overlooking the beautiful coastline of Rio, you can also warn that Vigario Geral ( AfroReggy and Anderson's house) is located in the Rio region, far from ANY beach. Strange choice of location, if not more. <br /> <br /> “Favela Rising” probably confuses non-Brazilians who will not be familiar with many of the respondents (and the film will not tell them either) and will have to wait for the final credits to find out that many of The songs on the soundtrack are NOT owned by the AfroReggae group (although you will begin to suspect when you begin to hear Pink Martini, all people!). Nor would they know that important questions were simply left without mention: why does the film put forward the idea that AfroReggae is a one-man project? Why not thank the many partners who provide him with substantial financial and logistical support, such as the Rio City Council, private Brazilian corporations, multinational recording companies and international NGOs, without which AfroReggae may not even exist? Why not explicitly state that Vigario Geral is still suffering from fierce drug wars and that its people still live in constant fear of being attacked by traffickers and police? Why not make it clear that many of the archived videos showing violence and police corruption did NOT take place in Vigário Geral? HOW and WHY does baby Richard Murilo finally join AfroReggae? WHY on hell did he not interview again at the end of the film? <br /> <br /> As for Anderson himself, the film leaves the viewer a lot of trouble: what is the story with Anderson? "two" moms? Is the child he holds in his arms his son? Why is he inspired by Shiva? Is he a Buddhist? Why does a female candombla appear on the beach when the films mention the “miraculous” restoration of Anderson after an accident? Is he a follower of Candomblé? Why not let him explain the controversy of creating a group that fights drugs while praising Bob Marley? If AfroReggae is also a movement that creates pride for black favelas, then why are the girls in the AfroReggae group limited to bouncing prey procedures? No, you also will not receive any answers to these questions. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers are interested in turning Anderson Sa into a complex mixture of pop stars, Malcolm X, Gandhi and Christ (see this latest image of the statue of Christ the Redeemer on top of Corcovado, right after how Anderson "miraculously" went after the operation). And this is the worst thing that directors could do with Anderson and his business: turn him into a special SELECTED (by the time they show his surgical scar, you are ready to believe that this is a sign from God). <br /> <br /> What is remarkable about Anderson, who is the most common guy you've ever met, is that he helped change his environment, not being “special,” but copying and adapting winning projects (for example, the Olododum movement in Bahia, among others) to his own community, with the strong support of friends, artists, intellectuals, politicians, businessmen and the media. If you are not fluent in Portuguese, you probably will not notice that Anderson is not particularly clever and eloquent (as opposed to his clever companion Jose Jr.), because he is not particularly talented as a singer, lyricist or musician. However, his “routine” could be the true “inspirational” core of the film: to show that ANYONE with idealism, perseverance and sustained support can actually make a significant contribution to his or her community, there is no need to be incarnated by Jesus. Because movement is really important - AfroReggae, not a guy, you know? Did we lack the personality cult? <br /> <br /> By the end of "Favela Rising" you probably will not know much more about Rio favels than when you entered - you will simply see how some of them look.
