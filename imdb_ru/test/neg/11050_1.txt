This film was terrible, simple and straightforward. Probably, it will be respected by those who watch only “films” and not “films”, and therefore I would regret that I have such a limited understanding of the theatrical brilliance of this film, but in my mind I can confidently say that this is a boring, self-deprecating and the painfully protracted film was a waste of two hours and nine dollars. <br /> <br /> I was shocked to see this from the inexplicable good reviews he received, and left it. The theater, thinking that these reviews should have been written by excited cinematographic students and the aforementioned group of people who avoid regular films, perhaps because of the fear that someday they will really like it. <br /> <br /> The storyline is quite promising - a person has been imprisoned for 15 years, without having learned either his captor or his crime. Then he is suddenly released, and he is given only five days to find out the identity and cause of the person who imprisoned him. However, the great concept soon turns into a pitiful joke when Oh Da Teh-Soo runs around beating people, trying to have sex with a young girl who is trying to use the toilet and there is a living, wriggling squid (presumably for a dramatic effect, because there is absolutely no other reason). All this time he is trying to understand this terrible thing, which he did to earn himself fifteen years in prison, and when he finally finds out, this is both ridiculous and seriously disappointing. His sworn enemy, a man who allegedly went to school with him when he was young, looks like a model of a Banana Republic twenty years younger. Hey, I know that prison is difficult for Da De-Su, but is asking too much to find an actor who looks a little closer to his age? Of all that is wrong with this film, this one seems to be the easiest to fix. <br /> <br /> And the big secret - the one that kept me in the chair for 90 minutes, when I could not do something productive - is some kind of joke about the storyline involving incest and rumors that started in high school. Come on! Throw us a bone here - is this really the best thing they could do? I sat through a silly dialogue, excessive actions, gloomy sets and unreasonable violence for this? (By the way - I’m not at all against violence in the film if it seems appropriate for the story, but in this case, it seems I’ve been forced to watch our hero knock someone’s front teeth and cut his own tongue off the scissors to distract me from thinking that i'm wasting my day watching the pretentious piece of garbage). <br /> <br /> Listen to my advice - do something else with your time and money. Or take your nine dollars and see a modest “movie” that you really enjoy.
