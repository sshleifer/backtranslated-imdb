I come from Bangladesh, and here C.C. Costigan is the goddess of awesome sex. Joke aside, my friend and I did not sleep in the middle of the night, we watched movies on the channel Encore: Action, when we came across a series of science fiction films. There was RoboCop 2 (not bad, ... not bad at all) ... then Judge Dredd (Stallone almost destroys his career), and then a film called Lethal Target. One would think that the title "Deadly Purpose" can be awarded only to a really cool and truly disgusting fake Rambo. But no, what is being delivered is what I would like to call "Semi softcore, semi-active, semi-scientific film" ... in fact, I think I can say that this is not even a film into everything. If it were not for the fervor of the main character, my friend and I would have turned off the film when the credits began. <br /> <br /> I have a few questions for people (I wouldn’t even dare say “professionals”) who made this film. - One, in the future, why do they use the weapons that we used in 1999? Oh, wait, I get it, that's all they could get on, ... right ??? ... well then ... why is the main character wearing a casual linen shirt and waistcoat? Something that people wore in the late nineties? .... oh ... I understood ... in space, it must have been a fashionable statement ... well, then ... WHY, HE, WHY the main character pulled a 3.5 floppy disk one point in the movie to could she download some nonsense ?! WTF !? ... we are so far advanced that we have a space trip, but we still have not advanced further 1.44 megabytes of space ...? <br /> <br /> I suppose I just asked too much. br /> <br /> Question two, Let's just say ... yes ... this is erotic porn. Then why is there only ONE real sex scene, and why does it last 2 minutes? <br /> <br /> I mean that you accept the REASON that people are not sleeping in the middle of the night to see this shit (you dare say “movie” anymore?) ... and shorten it to 2 minutes. Hell, they should just accept that sex scenes and sell him another porn movie, and they would have made more money from this “crap” than they did. <br /> <br /> CCCortigan is hot, And do not be offended by the actress, but she acts about the same as me. and I am mentally retarded, and I have only one egg ... (KS Cortigan, ... write to me ... we will have lunch) I would write more, but I do not have enough space.
