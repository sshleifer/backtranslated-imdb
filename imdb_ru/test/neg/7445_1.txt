I really don't understand who this film is directed at. Based on all this absurdity, not to mention a ridiculously bad game, stupid dialogue and the fact that the villain is a child, I would assume that it should have been a children's film ... but I think there could be more curses than “Pulp Fiction”, not to mention the constant mention of drugs and general chaos and murder - what demography is trying to please? This film is too schizophrenic, as an attempt to combine country music with heavy metal, in the end, no one will like it, because it is a bloody paradox. I would recommend this film because it is so funny (in a bad sense), except that the actors are so clearly unbearable that I would not like to suggest otherwise. <br /> <br /> I am quite serious when I say that I could not look more than 15 minutes of this. Terrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiible
