Although its plot is taken from the history of ancient Rome, Caligula is not made in the style of an epic with a sword and sandal, such as Spartacus or Gladiator. (In the late seventies, this style of cinema was not popular). Most likely, it is more like a cross between soft-core porn and video nasty. At the very least, the shortened 150-minute version does. I have never seen the full 210 minute version, but judging by the descriptions of it on this page, it would seem closer to the cross between the malicious porno and the nasty video. <br /> <br /> As you would expect from a movie released by the publisher Penthouse, you can see a lot of naked flesh, and Caligula’s sexual perversions are lovingly cataloged in the film, including his incestuous affair with his sister Drusilla. What may be unexpected for a magazine publisher so closely connected with the heterosexual male lifestyle is the fact that it presents as much male flesh as the female and distinctly homoerotic shades in many scenes. Obsession with sex is balanced by an equal obsession with violence, as if Bob Guccione, Gore Vidal and Tinto Brass tried to kill two taboos with one stone. (It is a wonderful coincidence that the director of such a brazen film should be called “Brass”, and the scriptwriter of such horror - “The Mountain”). The characters die or are disfigured by various sadistic ways, and there is a charming scene of homosexual rape. <br /> <br /> Emperor Caligula and his predecessor Tiberius were known for their depraved lifestyles, so the concentration of the film on sex and violence is not necessarily historically inaccurate. I, however, wonder if such concentration is necessary to help us understand this period in Roman history. The Fall of the Roman Empire and the Gladiator were established during the reign of Commodus, the emperor, as cruel and disbanded as Caligula. In neither case did the filmmakers find it necessary to turn their film into a mixture of “Up Pompeii!”, “Emmanuelle” and “Texas Chainsaw Massacre”, and both of these films are artistically much better than “Caligula”. <Br /> <br /> The acting role in the film is not so bad, with some exceptions, such as the awfully wooden Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla. Malcolm McDowell makes correspondingly insane Caligula. (Suitable, that is, in the context of this film. The real Caligula was undoubtedly cruel and eccentric, but historians argue whether he really is mentally ill). A great mystery - that is why so many prominent British actors had to agree to take part in such a dirty play. In the case of Helen Mirren (the only Dame of the British Empire with the past as a porn star) was probably related to her highly regrettable tendency to alternate between highbrow and sloppy, but the sky knows that Peter O'Toole and John Gilgud thought they were doing . Unlike some other famous stage actors, such as Lawrence Olivier and Richard Burton, Gilgud did not always fully look in the movies, but here he gives a decent interpretation of the role of Nerva, a decent and honorable old school senator. Unfortunately, in the context of this film, any attempt at dignity is out of place, like a pearl on dung. <br /> <br /> Guccione clearly managed to realize his ambitions so that this film could become a cult classic of decadence. (Brass and Vidal had exactly the same film ambitions, remains in question). The film, however, has no success at any other level, either as a feature film or as a study of the politics of dictatorship. Even perceived as erotic, it is second-rate. 4/10
