This film tries to do everything possible to capture the feeling of classic bad Canadian cinema: <br /> <br /> “Freakish” and disgusting characters (several); "quaint" city with "quaint people" "Quaint" cafe or restaurant (cafe here); many frames of Canadian things for postcards (ocean things here); many references to "must get out of this city"; downright praise. <br /> <br /> And this is successful on all counts. <br /> <br /> But something worth noting. I could not understand whether this film is trying to be a “bizarre” comedy after the “Northern Exposure” or something surreal, like drug-induced or psychotic hallucination. Editing this movie was pointlessly jumping from one unrelated thing to another with zero rhythm or motivation. Not to mention that half the time we didn’t even know where we were jumping. Take, for example, the very first shots of screaming teenagers in a car. Who are they and how do they relate to anything? And this subtask plot (use this word conspiracy freely), meaning children who seem to span generations. I don't think they really do, but editing makes it look as if they are materializing from a memory, all of a sudden, to the current time. BUT? What did I miss? <br /> <br /> Avoid. If not for laughter. Or you want to try to disconnect from inept editing.
