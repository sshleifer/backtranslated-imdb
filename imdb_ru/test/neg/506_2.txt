This is a film that pretty much voiced death for the author in Hollywood. For more than $ 40 million, the Heavenly Gate is so poorly thought out and executed that it takes a lifetime to break every area of ​​failure. What really annoys me is that it is technically very bad, an unforgivable sin for the money invested in it. John Hurt's speech at Harvard is not audible, as is the conversation between Chris Kristofferson and Richard Mazur at the train station. Some people think that Cimino intended it as a “style”. He's not. It's just a bad sound recording. Characters are not well drawn, with the exception of four or five leads; at the peak of the battle it's hard to say who the bad guys are and the good guys. Even at this level it is impossible to enjoy the movie. Casting Isabel Huppert as a city madame is a joke, her French accent turns the whole character into a hoax. The action is usually tough, without any range or depth of feeling; even Christopher Walken is bad. John Hurth's character is the only one who has swagger or vitality (although Hurt, in his 40s, playing Harvard with a new face and bags under his eyes is obviously funny). <br /> <br /> Probably, to say that it is too long, it is unnecessary. A roller skating sequence could easily be cut out, the cockfighting scene quickly becomes a movie cliché, and the final scene aboard an ocean liner is right in the Twilight zone. If Rod Serling appeared in front of the camera at the end to explain what we just saw, it would be a perfect ending. In fact, these scenes themselves are not bad, but Cimino did not deserve the right to include them, because what he gave us as the “meat” of the picture is so incompetently bad. Editing leaves much to be desired, especially during a grand battle. In the same place, the same explosion with the same cartwheel flying from the explosion is used three times. I would like to say something - something good about this movie: a great scene, a great presentation, even one memorable line of dialogue, but I can't. This is just one big unholy mess. The only thing I liked was the amazing cinemas and places in Montana. Even Cimino could not screw it up. This is a long, boring, bad film by all standards. And people who say that it collapses only because of cost overruns are simply fooling themselves. 1/2 * of 4
