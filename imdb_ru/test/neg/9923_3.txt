<br /> <br /> A very slow, stupid movie with a tangled storyline. The only hope of the film to interest the audience - this is a gratuitous nudity, added at regular intervals. Ellen Barkin is mistaken, and her appearance does not hold water when she is on screen with much younger Peta Wilson. Not sure what this movie is about.
