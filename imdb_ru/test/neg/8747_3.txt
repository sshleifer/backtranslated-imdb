Jessica is a young, virgin and very innocent girl who lives with her aunt on a remote ranch. Jessica is also a powerful psychic capable of movement, retro cognition, foresight, and esp. When young and handsome Gordon Hawthorne comes to visit, he is immediately skeptical of Jessica's forces ... until her skills discover a lost wrist watch and unearth an ancient treasure chest. However, the treasure chest contains the severed head of a century of a dead Satanist named Gideon Drew, whose strength is much stronger than that of Jessica. Despite her warnings about evil in their midst, Drew manages to mentally enslave all who look unfortunate in his eyes. But Drew wants Jessica more than anything. He needs her movement skills to dig up his body so that he can rise from the dead and rule over the human race. Can the mighty Jessica Fleur de Lys, combined with Gordon's love, fence off ancient evil before it can destroy them all? <br /> <br /> This is not a very interesting movie. Of course, this could be - the main story is interesting and creative, but the acting is lead, and it all moves too slowly to hold interest. Jessica is also too innocent - almost annoying, and Gordon, her love interest, is wooden, hard and absolutely insensitive. None of the characters are very cute, and the low budget is painfully obvious. Hasty ending also does not help questions. Avoid unless it is the MST3K version.
