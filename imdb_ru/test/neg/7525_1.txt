Pierce guy looks and behaves like a Calvin Klein underwear model or one of those guys who wear Levi's jeans and stand in front of a herd of stamped Buffalo, because they understand that Buffalo is like Levi's. In every scene, Guy Pierce looks like he says: “Look at me, I'm so beautiful!” Like a hero, his character is a complete weakling. In every scene that requires courage, Pierce gets the short end of his club. SPOILERS: Nevertheless, at the end of the film, this stupid character-bookworm overtakes a pack of Morlok-like baboons who can run and jump on the walls (like Spider-Man). At about the same time, the MACHINE OF TIME seems to be causing some kind of nuclear explosion that destroys the whole valley. Strange, though Pierce and his buddy Mumba are about a foot from the last killed Morlock; after a few seconds, Pierce, Mumba and the tribe watch the valley explode from the safety of their mountains. Now it's a quick run! Jeremy Irons as King Morlokov is great. It really makes the film much better than it was. Mumba, the model that became an actress, is not very cute, and she doesn’t do much in this movie. Scenes that occur in the 1900s are devoid of any real atmosphere. Even though historical clothing and vehicles are shown, the characters behave like cartoons of how they imagine people in the 1900s will walk and talk. The original version of this film was much better in this regard. The characters of the period were much more realistic, and they were much better actors. The original version of this film made the PAST seem like the real basis of the characters. This new version lacks content and feeling. The scenes in which Pierce deals with Emma's death and then cannot save her from her fate are very good. The question that Morlocks are cannibals is not very well explained, and it makes no sense that they have a big dark butcher shop filled with knives and cutlery, but they are never seen using any weapon other than a shot. Also stupid is a giant pit full of water and bones. Throughout the underground, Morlocks walk, chewing on fleshy bones. So how can all these skeletons be in a hole? It seems that there are some Morlocks who Bar-B-Que their people and eat them from the grill, and the other Morlok only as a meat fillet ?? And where are the toilets for all these creatures? As I watched dozens of Morlocks who ate human flesh, it occurred to me that they should have a very advanced toilet and plumbing system, given that they threw a lot of bones. All these issues have never been resolved. At the end of the film, Pierce holds Mumbu by the hand, but you can see that he is scaring her friend, Mandingo. Another completely annoying thing in this film is the non-stop music of LION KING, which is in the background. As soon as Pierce arrives in the future (802,710 ad); LION KING's music never stops, and every time local people appear, that African moaning singer (Peter Gabriel or Paul Simon?) appears and starts screaming and moaning over the jungle music LION KING. I watched the credits at the end of the film, and the music in the jungle was not specifically identified, but I think that Elton John probably should understand this question. Time Machine was a mediocre movie with good fx. Look once, then forget.
