I thought this movie was terrible. I understand that it was shot with a small budget, but the game was terrible, and the film itself was just stupid. The plot was predictable, and the central character was an unsympathetic moron. In fact, all the characters were unsympathetic, and none of them was fully developed. The audience does not concern anyone in the film. He had to be tense, but if you don’t care about the heroes, it’s hard to even get into the movie. I felt like an outsider, forced to listen to someone telling me a stupid story. All the plot twists at the end were just too big - I actually laughed when it seemed to me that I was “shocked.” In general, I thought it was really just a bad movie.
