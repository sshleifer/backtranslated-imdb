An interesting plot, but painfully boring. The script is not enough ... not enough acting skills. For me, this film is compared to movies like “Made for TV”. I was lucky to survive the movie, not falling asleep in my popcorn. I watched this movie with my family. It is pretty safe to watch with your children. (only 1 half-sex scene) If you want to see young Meg Ryan ... watch this movie. Very 80th. You will love this movie if you like the combination of depressed people for Christmas, booze, super glue and tar. Or maybe you are like me ... and you have a higher standard for filming movies. However, I liked how the movie began and ended! Mark
