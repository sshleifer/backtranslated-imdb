I can not believe a positive reaction to this film. I had high hopes for this and was disappointed. First, they used all the silly racist clich√©s in the book. It was so predictable. For example, from the second appearance of a young Hispanic guy, you just knew that he would be a really good guy, because he looked like a gangster. Matt Dillon's character has been played a million times, a policeman who has been tempered for years and will see the light to some extent by the end of the film. Predictability is unlikely to end with these characters. The phenomenal cast was spent on a weak script. The moral of this story was the maximum PC. There were a few tricky turns, but they were not enough. The dialogue is sometimes confused. It was not so bad. I just can't believe this movie. It was somewhat entertaining, just a little insulting to the intellect. I admire what this film was trying to achieve, but it failed.
