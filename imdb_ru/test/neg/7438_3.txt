This film is an excellent example of what happens when a studio wants to get a sequel of a beautiful film out of the gate at any cost. Only with this film is it really a blunder. It seems that Robocop 2 may well be a worthy continuation of the groundbreaking first film. Full original composition (except for the victims, of course) returns and gives him the best. It is a pity that the hackneyed script and the incompetent director are so good that they neutralize their efforts. <br /> <br /> Irwin Kershner may have been the perfect guy for George Lucas to direct imperial strikes. For a pedestrian director like Kershner, thereâ€™s nothing to destroy in the insensitive series of Lucas. A worthy successor of such a classic as Robocop would need either Paul Verhoeven to return, or a director who has enough spirit to play his part. Kershner does not know how to do something of his own (Lucas hired him to do this), and he is certainly not Verhoeven. <br /> <br /> So we get a movie that goes through all the movements to repeat the first movie, but without the freshness, humor or courage of the original. Kershner probably thought that he could lead Verhoeven by adding more blood and causeless violence, but instead he shows how much he worked as a director instead of a passionate director. And it's a shame, since everything was ready to make it another classic. As already mentioned, the actors try their best, but Phil Tippet offers some revolutionary effects of stopping the movement, and this story has some great ideas from Frank Miller, who was born to write a movie about Robocop. If only the studio hired a director who was competent enough to unlock the full potential.
