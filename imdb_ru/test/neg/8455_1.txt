This film happened to be on HBO yesterday, so I watched it. It was a mistake. I think that I was dragged in and continued to watch, although it looked like a train wreck, terrible, terrible, but for some reason it is simply impossible to look away. Schaudenfro, I think! ; ). <br /> <br /> This is the story of a photo shoot for models on an island in the Caribbean. One by one, they are all killed. Someone drinks cleaning fluid, someone explodes on a water leash, someone gets over the rock ... so this is NOT an accident, but for some stupid reason, the police never call, and no one thinks that they should “wrap up” the shot and go home, not only out of respect for the dead, but perhaps because of fear for their lives. Not. They just keep shooting, because that's the most important thing. Forget about the dead models, we have a magazine for production! <br /> <br /> One of the sidelines is the owner of Evil magazine, played by Lee Major, his name is Rex. He is the most obvious suspect, and every time a model is killed, he twists his mustache and says, "Well, I can't say that it won't be good for sales," Mooh Hoo Hoo Ha-Ha-Ha. So absurd. Another story - when it turns out that Rex is one of the models of little dads, only when he found out about the child did he try to convince the girl to have an abortion. She did not do this, but always offended him for the fact that he even proposed it. <br /> <br /> They are trying to give you false clues and point to some guy named Raul, apparently because he is the only one with an accent and “looks creepy.” <br /> <br /> At the very end (sorry for spoiling it, but this film was released many years ago, so if you haven’t seen it yet ...) one of the women was found face down dead in the pool. This was the last drop !!!! Vanessa Angel, forget her heroes, the name comes to Rex with a pistol, they fight, the pistol shoots, and now she is also dead !!! While she is lying on the floor, his business partner tells him that with all this bad press, the magazine will be useless ss and this is all his fault. He makes him sign a magazine for him. One day he does voila! All the dead models come back to life, and you will find that this whole thing was a clever trick to return to Rex. <br /> <br /> Oh! What a funny movie. As someone else said; If you want to see something like this, this April Fool's Day will be much better!
