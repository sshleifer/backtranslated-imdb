The director spent a lot of time to make the scenes look believable down to historical photographs and all the sounds of the old western bustle. It is a pity that the producers and writers / directors Michael Cimino spent zero time on any historical facts about what the Johnson war really was. Much of the war ended with how public lands should be used for grazing. Herders did not want the poor shepherds on earth to fight for their prey on this cold, windy plateau. The full epic does not mention sheep grazing, which was one of the most important causes of the war. <br /> <br /> The worst scene is the battle between peasants and hired killers. Peasants are shown circling armed people, as a group of Indians would have done in much earlier Hollywood films. The true fact is that the sheriff of Johnson County William (red) Angus with a detachment of 200 to 300 people intercepted the militants and caught them in the shed at the TA ranch. I doubt that women took part in the siege. <br /> <br /> Ellen (Ella, also known as Cattle Kate), Watson and her second husband, James Averell, were hanged by a mob of vigilantes about three years before the invasion of Johnson County. Ella has never been a prostitute. It was a rumor circulated by the Wyoming Gardeners Association (WSGA) to discredit it. The fact that the plot makes it a brothel only serves the interests of the WSGA. <br /> <br /> I object to the use of the names of real people in a conspiracy that is so clearly invented. There are no facts in the events, time lines or backgrounds of the characters. Why Michael Cimino used the real names of people who were weakly connected with the Johnson War (and the events that led to it), I do not know. <br /> <br /> The film could be much more interesting if he lived on the political implications of federal government intervention in the affairs of the state government and what happened after the WSGA militants were rescued by Calvary. Some effort was made to pursue the pastoralists who were responsible for the Johnson County Attorney. But since Johnson County could not afford the legal costs, and Wyoming Gov. Amos Barber supported the WSGA, the charges were eventually dropped. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think that the film was just a reason for showing Isabel Happert naked for three and a half hours of the DVD version.
