Comments to the "Commune" make it sound like a very interesting film that I was very interested. Unfortunately, the producers did not consider it necessary to include closed captions for the hearing impaired and the deaf. This leaves me and countless people like me, who depend on closed signatures to follow the film, completely excluded. <br /> <br /> This is unforgivable for any film shot in 2005. In a world where every possible shortcomings and disabilities are taken into account, it infuriates and ironically that the ever-sanctimonious entertainment industry does not require that all productions and Cinemas have to be signed.
