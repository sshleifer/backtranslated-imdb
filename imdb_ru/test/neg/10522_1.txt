Even my five year old son was bored. <br /> <br /> Very predictable and replayable. This film could not decide on whether it was a farce or a screaming comment about the state of "pi-pi" sports competitions. <br /> <br /> The characters were underdeveloped, could do more with the connection between father and son, both come from an orphanage. <br /> <br /> I didnâ€™t like the mention of the goalkeeper slipping a laxative to his teammate ... a very mean spirit for a children's film. <br /> <br /> The typical "mafia" behavior was boring and stereotypical. <br /> <br /> The dog was pretty damn cute !!!!
