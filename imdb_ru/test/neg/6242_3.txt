Now I know why this film can be bought so cheaply in video stores. I was curious, since he had three famous stars, but they were among the films “B”, which, apparently, the video can not even distribute! The answer is: this film would attract a very limited audience: a crowd over 50 years old with very liberal feelings. <br /> <br /> Who else, who watches Robert Redford, Willem Defoe and Helen Mirren, gives, in fact, the basic message that “cheating on your wife is OK if you still love her.” This is a nice “nice message” here, especially at the end of this strange story of kidnapping. Who wrote this script ..... Bill Clinton? <br /> <br /> I say "weird" because the kidnapper is the best kidnapper (Defoe) you have ever seen, except at the end. He often unleashes his hostage (Redford), who is not at risk of any kidnapper, leads occasional conversations about family matters, etc. This is all ridiculous! Well, LA The Times says it is an “intellectual thriller.” Ha ha Well, this confirms what most people know about “LA The Times. For those of you who believe in it and have not seen it, I will not spoil it by the large number of giant holes in this story, especially at the end. The fact is that it is an insult to any person with intelligence. <br /> <br /> In any case, you cannot fool all people all the time, since critics have not yet figured out. Here is another film that they advertised, which was justifiably bombed at the box office and video store.
