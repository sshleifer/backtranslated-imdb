"Racketeer" plays the role of Carol (devoid of "e", which usually appears at the end of her name) Lombard as a woman thrown out of society because she left her husband for a concert violinist (Roland Drew), who has since become an alcoholic, and he is torn between her love for him and the interest of the New York kingpin Robert Armstrong (with a top score). This is actually a compilation of what was wrong with the earliest sound systems: tight control, fixed cameras, clumsy actions and ridiculously slow delivery of lines. At that time, when the sound engineers told the directors that their actors spoke every line of s-l-o-w-l-y, and did not begin to speak their own line, until the previous actor finished his own. Made about five years later, this could be an interesting film, but director Howard Higgin conscientiously follows the directions of his tape recorder and systematically undercut the talents that, as we know, Lombard and Armstrong had seen from their later films. "Racketeer" was created in 1929, a year that, despite the problems of transition from silence to sound, nevertheless gave us some legitimate masterpieces ?? "Hallelujah!" Vidor, "Applause Mamoulian", "Heroes of Hell" Wyler, "Ladies Leisure" Capra ?? all from directors with a strong enough will to tell dictators to be crammed with and allow their actors to speak and act naturally. It is a pity that Howard Higgin was not so strong; Be that as it may, watching how a fast-moving actor, such as Armstrong, makes his way through the role in an absurd manner, as he is told, one cannot help but wonder where this 50-foot gorilla is when Armstrong needs it.
