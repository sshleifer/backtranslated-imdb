Here you can see beautiful landscapes, if you can keep your eyes open long enough to see any of this. I am a big fan of films about life, but these people are simply mediocre. Although there is nothing political here, the whole film can be viewed as a political statement that shows how communism destroys a person, turning everyone into the same soft animal who just spends his life sleeping, eating and sometimes making love.
