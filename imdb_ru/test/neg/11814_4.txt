If you find a hopelessly amateur acting game, an uninteresting story, fake blood and all the crazy shooting tolerable, then perhaps you will have a really good time watching this cheesy, low-paid exploitation film. You might also want to check out the pretty good battle sequence that is being offered, although it is not good enough to make the rest of the movie worthy of consideration. (**)
