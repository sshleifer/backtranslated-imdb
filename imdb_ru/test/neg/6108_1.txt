As a writer and a former Orthodox Jew, I was very disappointed with this film. The dialogue is exhausted and wasteful; characters too keen on lines, ranging from incredibly prosaic to stunningly melodramatic, are not allowed to extend to truly textured people. A single trick musical score tries to make up for lethargy by deliberately penetrating the silence to dislodge the viewer and script from protracted catatonia. <br /> <br /> As a teenager revolutionary on a smug tirade, this film is amazed at the wisdom of its revelation - the patriarchy is wrong - and completely wastes its energy by hammering about it. The result of an artistic crime is the complete lack of creative development; the moral crime is to reduce people to caricatures: martyrs and grotesques.
