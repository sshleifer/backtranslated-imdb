“Changi” is an Australian comedy / drama filmed in a Japanese prisoner of war camp with this name. The story cuts between past events and today, when older veterans are planning a reunion. This is a very publicized and controversial mini-series, here in Australia. Budget exceeded (6.5 million Australian dollars); historians and veterans criticized its authenticity; and critics have desecrated an uneasy mixture of comedy and drama (shades of “Pearl Harbor”). The author of the series, John Doyle (half of the successful comedy team Roy & H.G.) tried to protect himself with comments that “the characters are the compositions of real people”; "The troops used comedy to cope with the situation"; “It is based only on real events”; “One of our actors was really there”, etc. I have no problems with any of these points. Many superb fictional and actual dramas emerged from the Japanese film P.O. experience of the camp: “Royal Rat”, “Tenko”, “Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence”, “Bridge over the River Kwai”, “Paradise Road”, “Empire of the Sun”, “Blood Oath” and “Similar City” Alice ”. Black comedy has often been successfully used in the dramas of POB: “Life is Beautiful”, “The Great Escape”, “Seven Beauties”, “Stalag 17”, “The History of the Cold Kit” and even “Heroes of Hogan”. So why is “Changi” a monumental failure? - acting in Changi is equally excellent, music and cinematography are good - this is the script and direction that let it down. Each scene seemed to give me waves of deja vu. When Anthony Hayes was forced to stand under the scorching sun, I thought: “Didn’t I see how Alec Guinness did this in“ The Bridge over the River Kwai ”?” Sudden flashes of surrealistic song and dance brought back “The Singing Detective” Dennis Potter, but without grace. This borrowing happened so often that it smelled of lazy type, not reverence. The constant intersection of past and present stories did not give me the opportunity to focus on one of them. A flash forward and a flash back can be a useful tool - here it left me away from the characters, where intensity was required. "Ausiness" overdid it - every conversation seemed to include "slaughter bloody crows" and so on, what I said: "I understood, I know that they are Australians." Cultural stereotypes spread to British and Japanese, as well as Japanese sadistic officers; alarmed British officer; wise Japanese commandant; funny, wretched australians, etc. I thought I was watching Hogan's Heroes on the River Kwai. After episode 3, I tune in.
