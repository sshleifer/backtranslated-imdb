This film shows what you can create if you have a camera, spare paint and cardboard, a toy ship, a few friends who played in a public theater, and a misconception that you can make a movie. The end result is lost time that you miss if you don’t pull it out of the DVD player and don’t throw it through the window first. <br /> <br /> Actions in the initial scene (especially rotten Lee Morgan as a “captain” and a toy ship “crashing” into the rocks in front of the captions is a good indicator of what you are looking for (with all the foam, it looks like “Special effect" was shot in the kitchen sink. I suppose Boiet decided he would save some money while washing the dishes at the same time.) From a bad movie point of view, the funny thing is “Dungeon of Harrow” seems to have inspired (perhaps by coincidence) twist finale "Manos: Hands of Fate." Yes, it's the same lame "I was the victim, and now I am the place of the mad villain "an ironic ending. It is even more ironic that two inept, untalented directors could make two equally wretched films made in Texas a horror movie and get away with it. <br /> <br /> Monotonous botanist Russ Harvey is a noble a man in a large family (why they were great, never discussed), boring to us, mourning the death of his family line and crest, before his ship even crashed (we also treat the buzzing story throughout the film). Unfortunately, we are not so lucky. The toy ship of his family crashes into some kind of expanded polystyrene in the sink, and washes it along the beach with his bloated captain and some woman, conveniently located on the county's insane island. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, the earl is visited by an evil spirit who, dressed in the attire of Blackstone's Magic Kit, attacks him with various puppets (spiders, snakes, bats ... all obscene things). The Earl (William McNulty) replays worse than Shatner, and he clearly finds it difficult to bear the direct expression of his face during a typical rant of a madman. <br /> <br /> I would also go crazy if I got into this disaster. The woman is quickly killed by the count's fierce dogs, and two jerks are captured by his servant. The count accuses them of being pirates (presumably his worst fear), he slaps his servant a lot (obviously, this is his greatest joy), Fatboy is tortured, there is a woman who is a servant, and the one who is a nurse a rotting leper - a wedding dress - a countess in a dungeon (she digs up Nerdy Noble and the only effective and creepy thing in the film), a lot of empty talk at the dinner table, a creepy captain is killed, making a pathetic flight (to watch a sloth fighting a flock of lions). This is all an ugly haze for me. I spent most of my time on the fast forward button. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the jerk and the nurse run away and think that three guys in the rowboat on the lake will save them (yes, we have to believe that the lake is an ocean). They do not, as the nerd's hair turned gray, and he scared off potential rescuers. Honestly, I think they just took the opportunity to run away from this disgusting film while they had a chance. They return to the castle, the nurse begins to rot, like the countess (and your stomach, by this time), and we end up with the two preparing to descend into. DUNGEON FROM HARROW !!!! Blech! <br /> <br /> I love old, lousy horror movies, but they must have some entertaining value. I feel ripped off, even at a low low price of $ 5.99 for this cookie. Mystery Science Theater would have a hard time making this play fun. I was received by several nutty reviewers who claimed that this film had an atmosphere and some terrible moments. Wrong! Avoid this prank at all costs, and do not even waste a dollar if you find it in the trash can somewhere. This film makes the "Horror" of Corman as a masterpiece of horror and atmosphere.
