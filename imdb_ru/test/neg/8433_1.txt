I have seen a lot of films in my time, and this film is indeed the worst film in the history of film making in the world. It took me 3 efforts to watch this movie. The first time I fell asleep after 15 minutes of boredom, perhaps because I was already tired, as it was late at night. I managed to get through the second effort in 35 minutes, but still I fell asleep again. I can go on and on and on, but I think you understand ... nothing happens in this movie. A complete waste of time and money. This movie really sucks. Look and you will understand what I am talking about. If you can get 40 minutes in this film without shaking your head and not wondering what the hell is the point of all this, you really are a masochist. The only reason I gave this movie 1 out of 10 is that 0 was not specified as an option. I just thought the world should be warned before hiring or even worse ... buying this garbage. THEN!
