By far the most racist and ghettoshsky cartoon for children 7+. Children who watch this cartoon are likely to try to dress, talk and act like characters. I am disappointed in Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. for agreeing to broadcast this terrible program. The Wayan Brothers can be good in films intended for young adult viewers. They should stick to the movies and not make more episodes for this cartoon. Usually, young celebrities begin to work in the cinema and make off-screen shots for cartoons, and then when they get older, they switch to programs for young people. A good example is Nick Cannon. He first appeared in All-That, later appeared in MIB II, then in Drumline, and now in his TV show Nick Cannon Presents: Wild 'N Out, where comedians compete, telling inappropriate jokes. This comment was originally for Thugaboo, but I wanted to show examples of how children who have recently watched on television can become those who participate in programs that are not child friendly. It is very sad that this happens, but all celebrities are changing and growing. It is just the opposite with the new Wayan Brothers cartoon. It is enough that we have to deal with all the bad people from the ghetto, allowing the younger generation to watch this program, it will simply turn children with opportunities into those who have no chance of a good life. Only my feelings for this cartoon and my beliefs about what will happen to our children if they watch it.
