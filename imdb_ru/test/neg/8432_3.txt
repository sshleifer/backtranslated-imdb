The art teacher meets an old wooden bed made of ginkgo trees and places it in her apartment, but she has a terrible story and an ancient spirit hunts on her, who maintains her human form, tearing hearts from people. <Br /> <br /> This is a beautifully crafted horror ?? well, in fact, this is more fantasy / romance than anything else that causes chills and provides stunning visual effects, but the plot was hardly interesting enough, and there was no life in the template script. The problem was that I spent most of my time trying to keep my finger away from the fast-forward button. This, of course, would have accelerated the slow pace of the film, but on the other hand, I would not know what was happening for too long, that it was difficult enough to find out or keep the interest in the first place. The performances ranged from too melodramatic or just plain boring, and this is probably because these characters are flimsy, stale and cause coma. The real history of the old bed and the perfume is incredibly boring and unintelligible folded, with too much attention paid to the fragile novel, when it is ridiculous, when it should not be, and in general it is built in the usual way, which simply lacks words. or the urge to carry the film. The shortcomings of the plot are compensated for by really skillful images that looked grand, but the use of some of the shots stunned me with what they really meant for the film. What catches your eye is a faded color scheme, but sometimes the actual screen will look grainy or snowy. Although, from this it shows the coarse intensity of the working valves, it also adds some nice polished effects that go well with a soothing, but sometimes sharp result. Working with the camera was quite varied (although it did not add too much to this function), but during some of the more optimistic scenes there were too many close-ups or dark lighting that made it difficult to understand what you see. You can also see some nice moments of blood and gore, but they are clearly not grand and do not differ from most other films. <br /> <br /> An extravagantly strange film with glowing images that look like something out of a picture, but still it is not particularly tempting. Watch out, it can plunge you into a deep trance!
