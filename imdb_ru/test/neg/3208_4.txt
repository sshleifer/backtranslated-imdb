Sending Critters into space seems like an interesting idea, but was there really a need for a third film, much less than this fourth? A film with Brad Dourif can't be bad, can it? Well, maybe in this case. The stars of this cheap sci-fi film return the cute Charlie (reliable Don Keith Opper), who is going to destroy the last two remaining eggs of the Nibbler, when Fie (Terrence Mann) tells him that he is going to break a kind of Trans-Galaxy Endangered Species Act. Therefore, at the request of Tew, Charlie lays two eggs in special holders in the space compartment. Unfortunately for Charlie, this damn thing goes into space, and he is locked inside. The smoke under his feet puts him in a state of hibernation, and he wakes up 53 years later in a decrepit space station, while captain Rick with a thick cigar, coarse alcoholism and greed to the depths of his soul explodes the space compartment trying to see what new items are inside for possible sale or exchange. Rick, unknown to him, releases two beasts that drink his flesh. You see, Rick and his team discovered that the space compartment was drifting, and intense dollar signs flashed in their eyes, so they docked it. Ugh informs them (currently occupying a prominent place as an adviser) that money can be earned if they are attached to a space station managed by the organization Terracor. As soon as the crew moor, they discover that this station is destroyed, and many corridors are in poor condition, but worse, this is Angela’s station computer. Angela is a real thorn for the crew, because she was left without repair without proper maintenance for some time. To open and close the door, you need little tricks, not to mention the elevators and computers. Brad Dourif is Al Bert, largely an impresario of computer functions (.. and he is pretty much the real leader of the group, because he is the most reasonable and intelligent). He seems to be a father figure for Ethan (Paul Vitturn) who just wants to go to Earth to find his father ... although this story does not necessarily reach its zenith. Bernie (Eric Dahr) is mainly starred in the film to become a victim of addicts for chewing creatures. In the film, Charlie, after one beast enters Rick's mouth and eats him by the throat {yuk}, becomes the team’s leadership in understanding what they are fighting against. There are some elements in the film that I find quite confusing (or, to be more precise, ridiculous) .. two creatures quickly grow in size, one way or another are able to coordinate the ship for the Earth, not to mention the fact that they have grown to enormous size in this lab to the space station. The crew can click on Dr. McCormick's log {Ann Ramsay, whose badge is in a coat thrown in the direction for which Ethan finds his access card}, which shows that Terracore was trying to create a view for destruction. worlds and people. Knowing this is bothering Al Bertha, who wants to leave Angela and her bleeding station for more green pastures. Things do not work this way, because the well-intentioned Charlie (partly due to the “ancient” colt of Al-Bert .45) kills the creature on board, but when a few bullets hit it, it hits the main ship guidance systems. So many repairs in order, but they stop them when Ugh and his attack aircraft dovetail with Angela and prove that this is not what Charlie was thinking. Fie is a changed person, and Charlie realizes that he is absolutely evil, and his mission is to save Crete for the purposes of cruel nature (representing corrupt types of corporate government?). That betrayal is what changes Charlie ... he may have grown a bit (tiny) and now he realizes that some people are just changing for the worse. Charlie and Ugh will face these opponents. Will the crew be able to escape from the space station that installed the automatic destruction? This film really does not exploit the beasts as much as the other three films. I believe that we can clearly see this as the true end of the franchise. The first film was a scream .. a really interesting romp. But by the time this continuation continued, the creatures ceased to greet them. The actors, however, give impetus to the film. The creatures do feed a little, but their plans for global domination are not sufficiently developed. Their role in the film is not set to the greatest heights. I said to myself: you have a huge space station with losers trapped aboard ... could you take this idea and run with it? Unfortunately, they do not.
