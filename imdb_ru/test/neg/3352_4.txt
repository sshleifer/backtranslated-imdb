I never even heard of ONE DARK NIGHT until someone mentioned it recently on the horror bulletin board, and after reading it, I became interested thanks to the participation of Meg Tilly and the realization that it was an early concert on Friday the 13th VI. : JASON LIVES Director Tom McLaughlin. Unfortunately, unfortunately, this is nothing special. The background has an acquaintance: a college girl must live through the night in the old mausoleum until the morning in order to join the women's community. This girl is young Meg Tilly, like Julie, who wants to prove to her loving, caring boyfriend, Steve (David Mason Daniels), that she can make his cruel, cunning ex girlfriend, the femininity of Carol (Robin Evans), regardless of the tactics she pulls, see her fail. Along with Carol's gang - Kitty (Leslie Speets), always with a toothbrush in her mouth, and Leslie (Elizabeth Daly), who really doesn't want to get Julia in such trouble. While Leslie insists on leaving Julia alone while she remains in the mausoleum, Carol and Kitty plan to torture the poor girl. Meanwhile, Steve is looking for her, while Julie, Carol and Kitty are confronted with an evil that they could not imagine. The corpse of a recently “psychic vampire” patient, whose telekinesis was dangerously powerful, will strive to deplete their life force. The only one who can help these girls is the daughter of the deceased, Olivia (Melissa Newman), who has the same psychic powers as he. <br /> <br /> I think that many will find fascinating the unusual evil that threatens the girls in the mausoleum, this is certainly different from what you usually see in slashers that were at that time. Like Adam West’s character (he was Olivia’s cynical husband, who thought her father’s idea was ridiculous), it was very hard for me to adapt to the tasteless plot, and I personally never found anything in the film to worry, For me, the mausoleum was never creepy (... he really does not achieve the same creepy quality imprinted by FANTASM), and the corpses that are used to attack girls are ridiculously unconvincing (... there is one wonderful scene where the corpse’s face melts). I have a weakness for low-budget films of this time period, but I just could never find a reason to interfere when you have this unsatisfied undead corpse, shooting electrical bolts from his eyes, causing other bodies to break out of their crypts to obey their master. This is too stupid to take seriously. Carol is your typical blond bitch who wants to punish a sweet girl who meets a old flame. Steve is your typical, squeaky, purely American guy, handsome and gentle, who becomes a hero seeking to save his girlfriend from any sinister forces. To make up for a small budget, director McLaughlin tries every trick in the book to excite the public, using a series of oog-boogie effects, such as corpses that chase young girls, chairs that tremble and tremble, doors that slam, and rising objects themselves. The film obviously has fans, and I am glad that I had a chance to see him, but I was a little disappointed that ONE DARK NIGHT was not asleep in horror that I had hoped for. Adam West has a very small role, since the interested husband hopes that his wife will leave his depressed state in relation to his father, who has nothing to do with her. Melissa Newman - worried Olivia, recognizing that she must stop her father once and for all, otherwise he will continue to prey on the living. Donald Hotton is a doxter, Olivia’s father’s partner, who tells her who he was. I was not particularly struck by Tilly's performance here (... she was mostly scared most of the time), but from now on she will have a chance to prove herself more. This will undoubtedly have some value for those who watched it at the time; for nostalgic purposes, this could tempt fans of films from this era.
