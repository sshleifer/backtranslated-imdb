The mission to see the movie “The Cave” was a dream of my friend after he saw a very dramatic trailer full of flashes of a creature hiding in a cave, some young cave divers and much more. It is a pity that the film has not changed much more than the trailer. <br /> <br /> The immediate appeal of such a film is a creature. What will it look like? Why does he live in a cave? How should this differ from other creatures we have seen in films such as Alien, Predator and Relic? Cave "demons" do not look far from a skeletal creature in Alien: Resurrection and even have the appearance of a Predator. It is a pity that this is a complete deception ... <br /> <br /> Well, let's look at the plot: it is very confusing and jumps to more and more incredible turns when the team of cave divers goes in search of the cave and its inhabitants in the Carpathians. At the casting it was very clear that we want young, fashionable, strong chicks, chiseled guys, as well as girls who have brains, should also be hot. We should also have one racial background in case the audience deems that the directors are shifted to a certain point of view. Completely done, and I'm completely tired of it. <br /> <br /> Another final problem was the final, as if to say that there could be a continuation. Shoot me if you have one. Marked at the end made me worthless. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 3/10 stars. The points he earned were more or less evaluative points for creature creators for their high-quality work on creating costumes and designs for monsters who live inside even when they looked completely ripped off. And on DVD there is an interesting documentary about scuba diving in caves. Check it out only if you like new creatures of monsters and creatures, but keep in mind that you've probably seen this movie before, and it was better the first time.
