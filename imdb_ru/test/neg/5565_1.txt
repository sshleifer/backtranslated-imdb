After a few misfires, we are still waiting for the French horror film, which critics will surely divert, but will launch a new trend. Not this time. Doug Headline cannot be blamed for not knowing what a genre is (he is the editor of a high-end fantasy publication, worked in the legendary magazine Starfix.), But why does the script use EVERY cliché in the book (except maybe ) Why make it so predictable? Even nods towards Argento fail. This is not even a European film, similar to the German "Anatomy", much better, this is just a collection of scenes that hardly have any relation to each other and contain MANY holes in the plot. The whole "Celtic" aspect is almost not affected. And after the painfully predictable “denial” scenario, the scenario offers us a boring endless chase in an underground necropolis, which seems more like Parisian catacombs. I really wanted to love this movie. Indeed. But even the mother will not. Yes, and the writer Valerio Evangelista was supposed to have a cameo, but I searched in vain for him.
