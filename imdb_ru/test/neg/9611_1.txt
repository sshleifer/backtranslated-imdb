What happened to the show with the combined parent figures? The parents on this show are almost as irresponsible as the children. Instead of punishing the younger child for the manipulation, they allowed her to get away with the murder. They can never agree on how to deal with children, and instead do nothing. Yes, great plan. Just ignore their behavior, because they are "cute." This show tells already manipulating children who watch it, that the divide-and-conquer technique is the best way to make their parents go down. Older children constantly lose their temper and fall into all sorts of impossible situations, but there are no consequences for their actions. Yes, great tv, everything is in order.
