I am speechless. Matty Simmons managed to do what I thought was impossible. He made "Garlobrotrotterov on Gilligan Island" look like "Citizen Kane." It is painful not to even begin to describe this piece ... I do not know. Keep in mind that the package sounds funny, but now that I saw it, it's funny that it is funny to throw an anvil on the scrotum. <br /> <br /> I’m not going to describe the package. As the name implies, all this suggests that I don’t think there was literally one funny thing in this film, not one, not even a monkey bite. How could one of the funniest characters in the Vacation franchise, Eddie's dirty white trash (Randy Quaid), become so terribly unfunny? I have never felt so much sympathy for the actor in my life. I am equally sorry for the other actors involved in this "comedy" atrocity, Miriam Flynn (Catherine, Eddie's long-suffering but sunny wife), Dana Barron (original Audrey Griswold), Fred Willard and amazing Sun Hee Lee (perhaps the only reason to watch film, at least with the sound turned off), except for the old Kommi, Ed Asner (Uncle Nick), he was waiting for him. Alas, the audience did not. I only say “thank God” that Chevy Chase, who has been in decline for many years, has avoided this diarrhea, this is the cleverest step in his career that he has ever taken. <br /> <br /> I don't know, you, like me, are religious, but I know that tonight I will pray to the Lord to add 2 hours (if not 2 years) to my life to make up for the time, which I spent in front of the TV, which I will never return. <br /> <br /> Burn Baby hot water says ZERO out of 10 stars (If you get a few bong strokes And drink water, maybe 1/10 of a 10 out of 10)
