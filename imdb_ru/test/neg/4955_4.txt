If I understood one of the things I learned from watching George Romero’s Kripshaw, it’s that if you stumbled upon a mysterious old box, then someone clearly put a lot of effort into hiding, just leave yourself alone: something unpleasant. <Br /> <br /> Obviously, Professor Gordon Crowley, the character of Robert Englund in the movie “Jack Brooks Monster Slayer”, is not a Romero fan because he breaks an old wooden box he found buried in his yard, only for order to discover? "Surprise, surprise" - an ancient demon who has his own body (initially forcing him to eat and tear quite a lot). <br /> <br /> When the demon finally breaks out of Crowley’s body during a chemistry lesson and begins to transform the students into hellish, flesh-breaking animals, this is the job of plumber Jack Brooks (Trevor Matthews) to try to stop vile creatures armed only long pipe and fueled by lifelong hatred of all monstrous things! <br /> <br /> DVD wrapping for the low-cost monster John Knauts promises a damn exciting ride offering the raw thrills and spills that can be expected from your regular 80s character (toothy things, rubber monster costumes, terrible blood and absolutely without CGI!) ?? and in the last 15 minutes, this is exactly what the viewers get: the non-stop spray effects; stupid, like tentacles, like the demon Jabba; and macho macho monsters! <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the remaining time of the film — a huge 70 minutes or so — is mostly spent on Jack while he is talking about his boring, everyday activities: plumbing, visiting a psychiatrist, visiting a chemistry and upsetting his girlfriend . If you think that you might like the film, which tells, first of all, how to cope with childhood trauma and anger, buy spare boiler valves in the hardware store and the chemical properties of sodium, then this film is for you; but if you need a huge dose of monstrous chaos, then I would advise you to look elsewhere!
