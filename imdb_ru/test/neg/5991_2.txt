Sometimes Full Moon makes entertaining movies. This is not one of them. The full moon is like a discreet Trom. Their films are not so cruel or non-standard, but usually they also lack talent. The acting in this film is not terrible, but the script is rather bad, and in general it is rather boring and does not even contain any nudity (as in many films in the full moon) to at least redeem it. Skip this and rent the "Head of the Family".
