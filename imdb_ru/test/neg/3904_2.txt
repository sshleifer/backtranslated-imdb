After spending 2 hours of my life watching this movie on nightly television, I went back and reread some of the IMDb material to remind myself why I watched it first. Looking back, I can only think that I like the whole genre. But this film was a waste of effort. It fails at every level, and seeing it described as a comedy on IMDb really leaves me at a loss. I don't remember more than a couple of chuckles. There is more laughter in any episode of Law and Order than in the Last Man. Seriously. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that too much interaction between the characters had no basis, and therefore it was very unlikely / unbelievable. <br /> <br /> If it werenâ€™t for almost free bikini shots, what can I say? Avoid this movie like the plague. Or tape and rewind to bikini snapshots. Do not spend at least 1 dollar on its rent.
