I had to understand that it was a sign that I was fed up with the trailer for this film. <br /> <br /> After seeing several “indie” films based on the reviews here, and subsequently finding that my view is completely opposite to other reviewers, I began to wonder if it was possible that I was watching completely different films of these people or perhaps friends / family, etc. directors trying to “increase” their work? Hmmm <br /> <br /> Are you interested in seeing amateur respect for Pulp Fiction and 11:14, except with the worst actors, a stupid score (undermines various scenes) and incredible leaps in logic? If not, skip this movie. <br /> <br /> Here is my open letter to two players of this film. <br /> <br /> Alfonso Morgan, please, please, please, stop trying to “Be” Samuel L Jackon a la Fiction. No one can do what he does as well as he does. <br /> <br /> Director, please come up with something original. This is a bad service to throw out this material, pretending to be Quentin Tarantino. <br /> <br /> It’s just awful, and I really don’t understand how someone can say it’s a good movie. It's a shame that people somehow managed to put 8.5 points, just like movies such as Pulp Fiction or Goodfells. This is not somewhere near these films; 4 or 5 would be a more reasonable average rating, I give it 3.
