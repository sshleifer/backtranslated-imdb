I recently became a big fan of Patton Oswalt. I think he is the most delightfully original comedian ever appeared in all the years. He is refreshing and fearless in his routines, which cover a range of topics, from how much Bush sucks up to the vile feats of 1970s producer Robert Evans. I am a longtime fan of Maria Bamford and her wide-eyed innocent / schizophrenic rutin. Whenever she easily switches her naturally high voice to one that is hoarse and hoarse, I cannot help but laugh. I liked Brian Posen long before I learned that he was shooting "Just Shoot Me", and there is something really funny in his aging botany. All three of these talented, unique comedians write the headline Comedy Comedians, a Netflix documentary about their US tour. They really deserve to be stars, and this tour gave them the recognition they deserved so deserved. I thought no, I KNEW that I would like this film ... <br /> <br /> But I was wrong. Instead of three comic strips, each of which gets its own regular segments, Comedy Comedians are bogged down in tortuous and boring documentary scenes in which there is no humor, insight and nothing of real interest. I think that in a 109-minute film there are only 30 minutes of intermittent exercises. What a rip-off! Is anyone really interested in our stars making fun of their RV? Where is humor when I see Posen in an arcade and comic book store? Does anyone find occasional snack bars especially funny? If this film could not show our comics, pompous things, at least tell us how life is on the road. This is not the point. Worst of all, comics are never really fun. Oswalt admits how bored he is when he gives a radio interview, Posen confuses how much he does not like when he looks at his house, and Bamford nervously improvises every time the camera points to her, and her humor is only sporadic there. /> <br /> Damn, these guys deserve a chance to show the world their unconventional, surprisingly skilled humor, which is a refreshing change in pace from brainless mainstream comic entertainment, such as Dane Cook. Instead, we must sit in the daily routine of their daily routine in a low-quality film, the quality of which is easily surpassed in any student film. If you can find any of the Oswalt, Posen, or Bamford versions on DVD, be sure to do it. Their talent should be joy, not a chore, like here.
