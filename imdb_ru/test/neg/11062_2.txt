A virtual replica of The Cave, with the exception of fewer budget effects and a bit of a different plot. I knew that the film was going down the hill when I saw the fake firework fires, clearly reflected on the face of one of the actors. The conflicts between the characters and the plots seemed to have no meaning and did not add anything to the film, except for fewer minutes of silence. The acting was not as bad as in a typical B-film, and there was some plausibility in their fear, but as professional cadres they seem too psychologically unstable for their chosen profession. In general, it is not worth spending $ 4.50 on rent.
