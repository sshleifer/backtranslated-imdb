I just got back from AGS. Seeing this, I am convinced that no matter how much it is written, how he carefully studied the film, Stone NEVER watched the NFL game in his life. Great cinematography? Give me a break. The editing games were almost unavailable for viewing, and 90% of the other shots in the film were close-ups. Was there anything in this movie that was not brought up in "North Dallas Forty"? <br /> <br /> Star aging player ... check. Young hot shot .... check. Painkillers .... check. The owner who does not "understand it" .... check. Crazy off-field behavior .... check <br /> <br /> Also, this is a play-off in Dallas (i.e. in December or January) in an open-air stadium, but people are sitting there in T-shirts and shorts! What happened to these lights? Did they play in the Japanese Kabuki Theater or at the sports stadium? <br /> <br /> And the strategy shown in the game was ridiculous. This is the fourth & 1 inside the Shark 30. Dallas leads 35-31. HIT GOOD GOAL. Not only would this make sense in football, but you would have an even better final sequence where they could score and go for a two-point transformation. Damn, tie the game to an extra point, and Stone could do it for another 3 hours overtime. <br /> <br /> Were the unsuccessful installations of footballers of the “old time” as a tribute to the game? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> And the script ... ugh. More cliches than you can shake a stick ... oops, there is another one. <br /> <br /> Slapshot was better than this movie. Of course. <br /> <br /> 1/10. <br /> <br /> Skips this at all costs. <br /> <br />
