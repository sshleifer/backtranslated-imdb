I found the Shuttle an incredibly disappointing movie to watch. It starts quite well and moves quickly forward to the first “injury” (which is dull). After that, it becomes very lazy and signed as a story. This was a case of a plot controlling characters, and not characters controlling a plot. If you hate a movie when you don’t understand why characters do what they do, you will hate the Shuttle. In particular, the last act is strange and seems to happen in a world without common sense. Also at the end, one of the characters confessed to the past of the misdemeanor to his girlfriend, instead of drawing sympathy from the audience, most people began to chuckle. This is probably because the “heroines” of this story were complete idiots. Finally, there is an end that seems just "shocking" and comes from the school of horrors: "people are bad, the audience, so just accept it without giving a reason." <br /> <br /> Shuttle is neither good nor bad, but mediocre. And annoying.
