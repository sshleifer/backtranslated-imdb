I shot this movie today ... the worst movie ever. It was a waste of time and a terrible story. The acting was terrible, especially the actress "Sai". She was so bad that it was funny. I can't say if it was her bad game or because the character was so stupid from the very beginning. I can't even focus on how horrible and pointless this whole movie was. I'm surprised that someone even thought it was a good idea to make this film and take the trouble to release it. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good vampire / horror film ... this is not a movie of you. Go straight! It is a waste of time and money. Damn it, I wouldn't even DOWNLOAD this movie if someone paid me. <br /> <br /> This film is so bad that it doesnâ€™t even deserve "1." I would give him a "0"!
