After several quite successful Dutch militants, such as Lek and Van God Los, Gerrard Vergage wants to make a film about the life of a Dutch gangster. Well, gangster is a big word for Klaas Bruinsma. He is not such a big international guy like George Jung (Blow) or Pablo Escobar. Heâ€™s just the poor Amsterdam man who made some money selling soft drugs. Things often explode in the Netherlands, and this film is just another example. But even then the film could be very good if the story were well told. Now there are big leaps in time: once KLaas is just an ordinary addict, and the next time he seems to be a big player on the drug scene. No one knows how this is possible (except for those who read the book). The acting is really bad; non-Dutch viewers can see one of the worst actresses in the Netherlands: Chantal Jansen. When you think that she finally undresses, then you look at the stand in the model. So: bad behavior + bad editing + crappy history = De Dominee. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this, even if others say it is good, because it is not. I warned you.
