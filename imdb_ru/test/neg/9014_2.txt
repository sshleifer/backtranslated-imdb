Another gray, terrible folly from the family of the Cormans. The first space capsule in the spacecraft lands on Earth (with some of the worst special effects), and the pilot seems dead. But appearances can be deceiving. He is actually more alive than the rest of the actors, including the patronizing old woman-hater (who would also be URGENTLY dull), a fat guy who looks like he has driven the market into hair oil, another guy so boring he doesn’t even makes a great impression on the scientist woman, who seems to never be offended or angry because of the patronage of the old guy, and the woman photographer with Fara Fawcett's haircut (of course, before Fara) and about as alive as a dead duck. <br /> <br /> What are the names of these people? I think it was Steve. Apparently everyone in the cast, including women, was named Steve. In any case, the dead pilot Steve is not only alive, but also incubates little aliens (or seahorses, or shrimps, or something else) inside his body. The Beast Mom, who implanted these little creatures, looks like a giant bald parrot with claws. Once again, I am impressed with the laughter factor of the monsters created by the House of Corman. The cosmic carrot from Venus in the movie “He Conquered the World” is still officially the worst, most ridiculous monster I have ever seen, a graceful screen, but the Kormans always manage to deliver when it comes to bad, bold monsters. <br /> They also managed to put on their other trademarks; that is, a boring, confusing storyline, long gray frames (thank God, Korman made most of his films in black and white, because his colored things still manage to look like gray) in two or three places maximum, stupid and lame details and special effects, and a lot of boring dialogue. In the film, only two deaths (except for a roasted parrot .. uh ... an alien bloody beast at the end of the film). I am sure that greetings have been heard all over the country when an alien tears off the head of the old doctor and (apparently) eats her. Now he can speak English and has the memories of a doctor. It can also move a pregnant astronaut, as if he were Pinnojo. <br /> <br /> The monster’s obvious intent is to rebuild his race, using people as food and giant queens. In the end there is a tangled piece (well, anyway, more tangled than usual), in which the creature tries to explain why it does it, but there is no point in it. Something about how humanity will follow in the footsteps of its race and destroy itself by what it will soon create. He never said what it was. Who would know anything from toasters to digital clocks. His nurse blows himself, and does not allow alien shrimps to crawl out of his body, and the fat guy (and the other guy) burns the alien parrot to death with a Molotov cocktail. Aah, the smell of fried chicken .. uh ... alien. The end of the story in which the rest of the heroes leave and leave their dead comrade lying on the ground to rot. Oh hell, why not save on the funeral? I am sure that this was exactly what Korman was thinking when he tried to cut corners and make his scenes as cheap as possible.
