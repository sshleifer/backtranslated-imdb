This film contains the worst acting game of all time. Spilsbury does not have enough energy, to say the least. Energy is what Clayton Moore gave us in spikes. I never felt in this movie that Spilsbury was worried about something. Revenge, love, justice? Not in this guy's image. <br /> <br /> There is no chemistry between Tonto and LR. If the plot didn't make them friends, you don't get the impression that they want to hang out with each other. Plus, the buddy has a more interesting personality. Ewww. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is predictable and boring. <br /> <br /> The story is amazingly bad, and if you are familiar with the Dukes of Hazzard, you can imagine what it looks like. I can not believe that the director will agree to this. It offended me as a spectator by explaining every storyline I just witnessed. <br /> <br /> Hey, at least the horses and the locations looked good, perhaps this is what happens when you hire a filmmaker for the post of director. br /> <br /> RATING-2 You can watch this movie for a laugh or to show the aliens what a bad movie is.
