This film is about pathetic, spoiled, ego-driven winners who think they have something to say, performed by pathetic, spoiled, ego-driven winners who think they are interesting. Straight from the cola-filled trenches of New York City's dramatic incestuous drama. <br /> <br /> How many viewers cheat, forcing them to think that there is some substance in them, remains a mystery to me. Maybe they secretly belong to this overvalued and overvalued "acting guild" for too long, or maybe they have never seen a decent movie? <br /> <br /> Come out, put your hands on the dirty land and find a real job. Otherwise, kill yourself with a real gun.
