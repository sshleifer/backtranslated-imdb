If you have seen this movie, then you will know that this is one of the worst Bollywood films ever created. Bollywood is known to copy Hollywood movies. Who would know that they will copy Terminator 2. The difference between the two film industry is that Hollywood spends millions, and Bollywood spends 100 thousand (on average). That's the problem with this movie, if you want to make a T2-style movie, do it right. The director added a fake fantastic storyline about a reincarnated snake, which found that his long-lost girl (in a previous birth) had died from 2 guys, but the blame lies with 10 people. She suddenly reincarnates into a ghost, and together they want to kill 10 people whom they blame for her death. Not to mention a reincarnated snake or a villain who has some supernormal abilities. He can turn into anything, he can fly, disappear, the power of fire, the force of the wind, you call it, he has it. He even gets bazookered and survives in the T1000 style. You are probably wondering how he survives. It is best not to ask, but it is better not to waste time and money on this film. It is best to forget that this film even came out. I think it's a shame to use a big star broadcast for this outrageous film with a meaningless storyline.
