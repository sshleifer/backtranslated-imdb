The adaptation of Rosema Mansfield Park in 1999 far surpasses this supposedly slightly more faithful film. The 1999 film is condemned by many Austin purists, but I admire the work Rosema did by making Mansfield Park her own. It may not be Jane Austen’s Mansfield Park, but at least it was well written, well shot and well executed by an excellent cast. I don't understand how Austin purists can be happier with this 2007 version of ITV (and retransmissions on the Masterpiece Theater / PBS). The script is scandalously stuck together and dumbfounded to load, production values ​​are dull, and the actors (except Gemma Redgrave and Blake Ritson) are mostly guilty of a bad game. I can't think of a worse miss than Billie Piper as Fanny Price. Her look was completely wrong (bleached hair and dark eyebrows?), And her talent was simply not suitable for the material. Sir Thomas looked constipated all the time. Michelle Ryan in the role of Maria was on autopilot, as were the actors who portrayed Crawford (when I think how excellent Alessandro Nivola and Embet Davidtz were in the 99th version, I just shook my head). <br /> <br /> I did not see the 1983 version, so I cannot comment on it, but I would advise anyone who is interested to give the 99 version a chance. Read the novel before or after and decide.
