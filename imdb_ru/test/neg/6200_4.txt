I was really determined to watch when two of the best film critics labeled this film as “a riot of laughter”. But the film was disappointing. <br /> <br /> You will be advised to watch this movie while keeping your brains at home, but you just cannot ignore the flaws and flaws. <br /> <br /> 1. The rocket scene was utter nonsense. <br /> <br /> 2. A pair of Katrina Kaif and Govinda looked terrible. (He is 49 years old, and she is only 24 ... more than twice her age) 3. Salman's comedy is not so much a play of actors as a surplus. <br /> <br /> 4. The songs are good, but they break the pace of the film. <br /> <br /> 5. The filmmakers intentionally tried to mix some scenes. 6. Bad and incorrect story. <br /> <br /> However, there are few advantages - 1. Govinda. Excellent individual work. <br /> <br /> 2. Some scenes are actually pretty funny. <br /> <br /> 3. Cattrina Kaif. Looks and acts better with every movie. <br /> <br /> 4. Sequences of Rajpal Yadav Don. Although it is underutilized, it is hilarious. <br /> <br /> So, 4 good points, 6 bad ones ... this one gets 4/10.
