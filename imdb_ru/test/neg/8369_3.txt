I like between a pleasant review and a review of hatred. I was a fan of Lovecraft (and the “purist” of Lovecraft) for a long time, and although this little amateur film was of poor quality, it had a number of qualities that could be used. I looked in anticipation of the worst that I had ever seen, and thought that Lovecraft would roll over in his grave, but I was shocked to find that I really like it. <br /> <br /> I don’t know I don’t want to catalog the shortcomings of the film, so I’ll mention only a few of them that do not allow this film to be a “star amateur effort”. <br /> <br /> It is very low-budget and videotaped, so this is similar to some soap operas, but once you get used to this idea, it stops being big. The direction is quite amateur, and framing of frames and the use of distance in frames are rather clumsy. And yet this film was actually quite creepy, and it remained more true to Lovecraft’s intentions than almost all the stories about Stuart Gordan and Brian Yuzne (my main exception to these films was Re-Animator and Dagon) combined. The idea of ​​being soaked in some kind of “Old” reminds of “The Terror of Danwich” and “The Shadow on Instmut” (which does not mean that this film is as good as these stories!), Therefore the whole plot is completely true to Lovecraft's ideas. One thing that annoyed me was that the words from the Bible seemed to make the imprisoned zombie frustrated and afraid. I’m not sure if this should mean that the words “God” upset the Oldest or only this particular zombie. There was no real answer to this. The rest of the Christian symbolism in it reminds me of how Augustus Derlet accepted the myths. So, in a sense, this is Derleth’s myth. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film only out of curiosity. It shows how a fairly atmospheric film can be made with an almost zero budget. I liked the setting of the wine cellars. Although the pictures on the street were sad. Using the same stretch of beach and trees (and almost the same damn shot) to convey the long journey of the three characters was really sad. To do this, the director needs to hit his head upside down. Acting was standard for an amateur film, with a zombie blonde who received a personal award for "Best Imitation of Gollum Italian Actress." In fact, I think this movie was made before the Lord of the Rings movie. Perhaps Andy Sedaris was looking at her and thinking: “Damn, she would have made a great Gollum!” <br /> <br /> Although one small thanks to the director. Zombie makeup was like bad gothic kids. I was upset to see this, and almost stopped watching. I was like, “Oh, that's how we know that she is angry and possessed,” but later in the film you see a girl who draws makeup on an older woman’s face like that (both are alive). So it was not an attempt to say “gothic makeup = zombies”, but “gothic makeup after zombies”. However, obsessed / zombies make equal "blue contact lenses" ... heh. <br /> <br /> In general, I still liked this film better than the films “Yuzna” and “Gordan” (with the exception of the aforementioned exceptions). Yuzna and Gordan had much better budgets, but this film was better at shooting a story similar to Lovecraft than with a small budget. <br /> <br /> One quick word for a make-up artist. I know that you wanted “claws” or something else on Zaria’s fingers, but the long black hold-down nails looked very silly. <br /> <br /> Quick word to the author of the score: I know that you could not resist, and obviously not one could the director who agreed with this, but when the two characters with a weapon in response to the "duel" playing this little whistle from "Good, bad and ugly" killed any mood that the scene had accumulated, It was cute, but cute did not fit. <br /> <br /> The creators of this film read Lovecraft and highly respected it. I enjoyed the little nods here and there: the character Carter with bad dreams and the character Pickman, who becomes a vile zombie.
