I loved the first “American graffiti” with all my heart and soul, which I considered to be the best movie about rock and roll, as well as the best teen movie I have ever seen. The first film spawned the career of George Lucas, who later starred in the blockbuster "Star Wars", and then removed the prequel two decades later, making Richard Dreyfus a star in "Jaws", "Close contacts of the third kind" and other films. <Br /> <br /> Somehow, without these two, the magic disappeared. <br /> <br /> “Even more American graffiti” shows viewers what happened to the rest of the characters later in the sixties, where Steve (Ron Howard) and Laurie (Cindy Williams) are protesting against the Vietnam War, while their friend Terry "Toad" Fields (Charles Martin Smith) is involved in the war and is trying to get out. John Milner (Paul Le Mat) is still a racer in California, where he never left home. The rest of the actors in the film, from Debbie Candy Clark (Terry's girlfriend), to the members of the Pharaoh's gang, along with Harrison Ford and others, really do little. The original film showed teenagers traveling through the streets without bloodshed with early rock and roll music from Buddy Holly, Fleetwoods, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Bill Haley and Komet, Buddy Knox and many others who brought back nostalgia to classical music. The soundtrack for the film “More American Graffiti” is a mix of rock, soul, country, hippie music and everything that matched the mood in the late 60s of protests, drugs, victims and much more. <br /> <br /> After watching “More American Graffiti,” he seemed to want to show the audience what happened after the title epilogue of the four main characters of the first film (except for the Dreyfus character), where it was not necessary. This film was also not necessary, as I was glad to see that neither Lucas nor Dreyfus had moved on to bigger and better projects.
