I really do not think that producer George Lucas was not going to make such a terrible sequel, what More American Graffiti turned out to be. But in retrospect it was the first crack in his seemingly impenetrable armor. This film was the first film that Lucas successfully selected from Coppola, not spending on the fact that to lead, immediately after the tremendous success of "American graffiti", shot mostly at the same time as "Star Wars". The result is typical for Lukas - much more interesting in terms of its structure and editing method than the actual material. Screenwriter / director Bill Norton was allowed to use different screen proportions and split screens to create strange associations in the images. While it is interesting to see the ironic juxtaposition of 4 plot lines, the style ultimately only embodies the fragmented nature of the film itself. <br /> <br /> Lucas' brilliant original film was dedicated to an archetypal group of friends. ” last big night "before graduation, and Kurt (Ron Dreyfuss) and Steve (Ron Howard) should go to college. One thing that made this film work, despite the fact that it is very episodic, is what you were the main characters together at the beginning, and they come back together at the end.There is a distribution of time, like in Nick Ray’s film Rebel Without a Cause, where a certain period of time becomes very flexible and takes on more importance than actually such a specific time in real life but everything happens in static space. “More American Graffiti” is basically the opposite - the space is very dynamic: Toad (Charles Martin Smith) went to Vietnam, his former girlfriend Debbie (Candy Clark) organized hippie parties in San Francisco, Steve and Lori (Cindy Williams ) participated in student protests in Berkeley, and John Mailer (Paul Le Mat) drag racing on a semi-professional track. In a far-fetched meeting at the beginning of the film, all the principles are brought together to watch John race, but after that the threads are not reunited and not diverging tsya, as in the original. Instead, they split off, and we’ve been following the characters for about 3 years, just watching various events on New Year’s Eve that seem like 1967, 68, and 69. It’s easy for viewers to get confused, and I think it’s fair to say that we’re doing While the original film seemed to unite important events and rituals of transitions in unreal theater time, which caused nostalgia even to those who had never experienced these events, this sequel draws and pulls several plot points from the original epilogue and tries to turn them into single movie. <br /> <br /> For me, the best parts of the film are Candy Clark in SF and Charles Martin Smith in Nam. Some of the jokes have no success, but the style of these sections is interesting, and they create a clear contrast with each other. A good film could possibly have been made if these parts were a little better, and if the other parts were not so protracted. Speaking of drag racing, the whole story with Milner talking to a foreign student was really lame, unfunny, and adding Mackenzie Phillips for the role of cameo didn't help at all. It was just another invented moment, for example, when they briefly explain why Kurt is not in the film, because he is already in Canada. Instead, Laurie just has another brother, who is basically identical to Kurt, but has a different name and now plays a very boring actor. In some things in Vietnam there is a black type of satire, very similar to what I could have imagined as the original idea of ​​Lucas and John Milius for Apocalypse Now. And there are some of those manic fun in San Francisco scenes that made the first movie fun. But, despite all these funny things, the rest of the film pulls him down, as if someone wants to see Steve and Laurie arguing in their horrible out-of-town abode, as if they are auditioned for the Spielberg film about divorcing and leaving the child. I think that even if these parts of the film were not so painful, it would still be incomparable with the first film, because there is no closure and there is no reason to come back together, or someone learned something. It seems to end at the moment when they ran out of money or something like that, cheap freeze-frame, imitation of “Two-way Blacktop” and many other best films. <br /> <br /> Like the original, this film has an excellent soundtrack for historical hits, which is probably worth taking advantage of, and almost makes the film itself acceptable. The performances of Country Joe and Fish are great, and Scott Glenn, all in the children, in love with Candy Clark, hippies are a spectacle - I wonder if he used a wig even then? I could not recommend this film, and yet it has a small affection in my heart, because I really love the original. Every couple of decades, I think I need to try this film, just to make sure that it really is as useless as I remember it. It's a party killer, but that's what every American graffiti fan or George Lucas as a whole wants to see at least once or twice. This shows how much effort can be applied to something, and can still turn out to be pretty unfinished. It makes you wonder how miraculous it is that Lucas made such a good film as “American Graffiti” in general, as if all the elements were there and all the gods concerned were soothed. Unfortunately, this does not apply to this film or to Bill Norton.
