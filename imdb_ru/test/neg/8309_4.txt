I'm from Texas, so I thought I knew big hair, but the villain in this movie had huge hair. Whenever she was on the screen, I could not concentrate on anything other than her hair. Go on stage presence! In this film, it seems, there were a lot of people with hearing problems. There was a traffic warden writing out a parking ticket, which for some reason did not notice how the owner hit the car, screaming at the top of his lungs until he hit the car. Then there was a guy in the phone booth who could not hear the huge bulldozer approaching him until he was 5 feet away. All the hired killers in this film seemed a bit deaf, no one was supposed to sneak up on them. One character in this film was so whiny and ineffective that it was funny. The bar fight was pretty funny. There is an invaluable scene where the hero and his girlfriend had just had sex, and judging by their expression, it was not good for any of them. It made me laugh out loud. This film is included in the series "50 sets of martial arts", if you want to watch a lot of bad movies (with a few decent ones).
