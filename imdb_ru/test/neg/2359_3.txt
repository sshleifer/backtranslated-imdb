"The Best Movie of the 90s" "The Welsh Train" .... Yes, that's right! I entered this film with rather high expectations, and from there everything was downhill. <br /> <br /> This film was supposed to be an archetypical film about the drug culture of the early 1990s and was going to allow us all to be seen in this scene and destroy the preconceived opinions of the media after the moral panic that followed the death of Leah Betts in 1995 year Unfortunately, it is far from over. <br /> <br /> In cases where Trainspotting was able to treat you as an adult on the subject and potential drug problems, it just gave us some damn history of the miracle of drugs and how you you will like it, you know how to open your mind completely. Hint about Bill Hicks and Howard Marx to nausea. Sometimes it's terribly bad. I mean, the scene at the end between Lulu and her aunt actually made me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> Now, maybe I'm just a cynic, but the way Jeep leads us through this story is like listening to IT This acid-tired guy you once met at a house party that tells you about how “man” restrains us, and how Acid freed him from the problems of modern society. You just want to instill in him some meaning and ask him to leave the premises. <br /> <br /> The script became a real problem for me, because where Trainspot had a great Irwin Welsh book for quoting, it was written and directed by Justin Kerrigan. The words "master of all trades, master none" come to mind. You can see where his inspiration comes from, especially in the narrative style of the main character Jeep (who sets the main character in a social situation when he speaks directly into the camera and outlines what goes on in his head when the script ends) ) The problem is that some of the speeches in front of the camera just hurt to watch. Mostly it comes down to a lack of sympathy for Jeep, but they so desperately need to sound philosophical that in the end they sound like your usual dramatic project of level A. The direction is good and the intentions are good, but it lacks integrity. you start to think about what the hype is. <br /> <br /> To say that this is not so bad. There are moments that are really very funny and entertaining. Moff is the highlight of the film for me. For the independent film, he also managed to attract a large number of high-quality British actors / actresses, which perhaps outlines why there was a noise about the film. <br /> <br /> Best movie of the 90s? Not too far away, but if you are looking for a reliable movie on Sunday evening, then it might just be your bag. However, inevitably, the film has flaws due to the hype that surrounds it.
