Imagine if you create an alternative universe where someone made the SEVEN, where instead of a talented actor and team they chose a politically conscious environmentalist and comedian as a leader. If your imagination can't reach that far, just look at the GLYMER MAN, because this is the next worst thing <br /> <br /> !!!! SMART SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> Jack Cole is a policeman with a hidden past, and it’s very ironic that Steven Seagal plays him, because he’s also someone with a hidden past, but don’t tell anyone because it’s top secret. Perhaps the biggest secret is how someone like Seagal became a movie star in the first place, as the GLIMMER MAN continues in the spirit of all other Seagal films in that this is complete nonsense. See how he was presented when his partner enters his office: “Yoi loves beads. In the wrong office, Stephen responds with something that is damn witty, or he, if someone could understand the bloody word he said, because he just mumbles most of the movie. In fact, the only time I could make out his dialogue was a scene in the school where he breaks into an armed man holding a class hostage <br /> <br /> “Don't make me kill you” <br /> <br /> Is that what a cop would say to a suicide bomber? I just think that in another movie where Stephen is not a hero (i.e. a good movie), a policeman would say something like, “Don't kill me, I have a wife and a couple of children who are waiting for" at home. " or else, the suicidal killer goes to blow his head, but Stephen saves his life by hitting them both through two sets of windows. It goes without saying that you shouldn’t try to do it at home <br /> <br /> As you progress plot Stephen (I stopped calling him Jack, although the merit of the writer for what he gave Stephen a reasonable name) becomes involved in the case of plagiarism when someone steals bits from other excellent serial killer films. When Stephen finds more victims, you can see how he thinks: "What was the movie in which Morgan Freeman starred as a policeman?", when he looks body, oh, and the action continues to switch to the hero's home life, so we know that this guy is good as a family man, this guy is very good as a family man, so sorry that he is as bad as a movie star
