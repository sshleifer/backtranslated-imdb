I came across a rare copy of this early film “Almodovar” with great expectations - Almodovar is a prolific modern director, I liked his 1988 film “Women on the verge of a nervous breakdown” and I read one or two very positive reviews about the film. Well, I must have completely missed the humor that reviewers saw in this film. I just found it incoherent, tasteless and boring. Yes, there are many understatements, people in drag and violent sexual situations, and yes, these elements may have shocked the audience in 1982 (which was almost certainly Almodovar’s intention), but much of the shock value probably weakened over the years, leaving sluggish plot. In addition, the entire film seemed very chaotic, not one of the characters was particularly sympathetic, and for the “comedy” - even grim - I just did not find this film funny. I believe that there is a possibility for a VERY chosen audience for such a film, but I simply am not part of this audience and am not sure that I want to be.
