I usually finish every movie or book that I start, even if they are poor, simply because I hate giving up on them. It was so badly done, I was in disbelief. <br /> <br /> I’m not just looking for Spielberg’s magic — I rent foreign films, and I rent really old sci-fi films (just recently Soilent Green is a decent rental). I like both the Hollywood action and the slow character development. To different films need to be approached in different ways, to be appreciated. I could not find any redeeming element to this ... The action was so wooden that I was not a bit on the edge. Character development was virtually absent - you do not have to feel sorry for anyone or even identify yourself with them. Finally, there were so many pieces that simply did not stack. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time - it's better to watch the paint dry ...
