I have to admit, although I’m ashamed that being an impressionable young teenager, this movie below horror was one of my favorite films of all time. Nine years after the first viewing of the frightening story of Stephen King, I’ve already come to my senses and can more rationally evaluate the work of Fritz Kirsch. <br /> <br /> Indeed, King’s story about a small farming community in Nebraska that turned upside down a young demonic boy preacher and his sadistic assistant really worried on paper, but it makes a cheap, average horror show on celluloid. In many ways, this result can be explained by the fact that Kirsch almost allows the beginning of the film to become a hacker-slasher show, and then turns the final into a nightmarish special-effect focus. <br /> <br /> The cast of actors is reasonable, but they can depict as much credibility as this is quite incredible, in the upper part of the film this will allow them, and the soundtrack of Jonathan Elias is more terrible than the photos. <br /> <br /> The real shame that George Goldsmith’s Screenplay turned Stephen King’s haunting story into shocking horror. Isaac, Malahei, and all the other Children of the Corn are not so terrible. <br /> <br /> Sunday, August 7, 1994 - video
