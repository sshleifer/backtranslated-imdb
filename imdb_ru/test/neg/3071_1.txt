Those who read these comments might think that we have a great movie in our hands. I am Portuguese and I am ashamed that this film has become a blockbuster in Portugal. It can not call this movie. The direction and the “mise en scene” are major (even Ron Howard is doing better!); the script is bad and pretentious (really bad Tarantino); The cast is covered with TV stars, models and reality stars who have nothing to do with acting. When you add these ingredients to a movie, of course, that fans of this kind of TV show will see everything. I'm also surprised that the people who comment here in IMDb say that this film is a masterpiece. I thought that this site is intended only for people who truly love the movie and understand it a little. In all films made in Portgale, the same ingredients are always used, and they are always terrible. if you think this film is sensible, do not talk about your love and movie films.
