The only reason I watched it was because of its stars, CASPAR Van Dien, Micheal Pare and Eric Roberts and Catherine Oxenburg * and Jeniffer Rubin, all capable actors and who have performed well in the past. NOT AT THIS TIME, the story of a weak serial killer. You can guess who the killer is in the first scene. Very contrived in all aspects, nothing to recommend in this catastrophe, my rating is * 1/2 POOR
