It's a shame, however, that there were more holes in the screenplay of this film than could be shaken (mixed metaphor deliberately), because Kinski and Coyote are both extremely talented performers who are capable of great subtlety and nuance - all have a wonderful chemistry Fairuza Balk didn't hurt the mix either. Jeremy Piven would also be great if his character (and all the other supporting characters) were not written as a plot device. As for the main process, the authors simply did not know how to create suitable intense guilt or innocence for the Kinsky character - instead they gave us confusion, contradiction and, eventually, a frank hope for the audience not to notice
