The idea of ​​this film is quite convincing: children-zombies are crawling out of an abandoned mine to avenge their death in the wilderness of Pennsylvania. Great. The problem with the film - the lack of creativity when working with zombies. The creators may have really spiced up this film with some horrible images, such as The Ring, such as a halt, a backward walking of the camera, or the like. When children zombies walk through the woods, they look like a group of 9-year-olds going to a playground in West Philadelphia. Instead of picks and shovels, they could easily wear baseball bats and gloves. Why am I afraid of these little children? Anyone can just run away in a straight line to a safe place. Also, who in their right mind would have stayed one night with their children in this creepy, decrepit house? At that moment when I opened this front door and looked around, I would say: “Mmmmm. Mmmm. Son, go get the car. ". Absolutely incredible movie. Do not waste your time.
