It was bad enough. I really hope that there will be no continuation. Perhaps this gives part of the plot, so that you know that it is open to such an opportunity, but no, in fact it is not. <br /> <br /> This movie is nothing special. Well, the special effect was pretty good, but nothing to write home about. <br /> <br /> There were some hot babes in her, especially Elina Madison and Alexandra Ford, but nothing was visible. PG-13, definitely not R. This also suggests that aspects of the slasher were less than impressive. A shovel to the head was the only thing that was unusual. <br /> <br /> Tame a funky rate.
