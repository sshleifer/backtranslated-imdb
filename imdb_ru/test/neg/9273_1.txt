It was advertised as a sequel to Crash Dive, which was a very good movie in the low-budget category. I assumed that this film would be good, but, boy, I was wrong. First, this film has nothing to do with Crash Dive, except that they both occur on submarines. Secondly, the plot can be slow, tedious, and in some cases even ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This film will not attract the attention of most people. (I remember reading a book during slow, boring scenes.) There will be scenes to be used for a dramatic effect that will make the viewer laugh out loud. The corkscrew scene is definitely one. After I had overcome my initial shock that someone had put it in and did not know that people would not only not believe, but also laugh at his stupidity, I could find humor in it. <br /> <br /> If you want to see MD in a good sub-movie, watch Crash Dive and leave this slop movie on the shelf.
