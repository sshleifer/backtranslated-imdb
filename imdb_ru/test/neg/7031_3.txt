We all saw the same movie ??? I can’t believe that some of the other rave shows give this really terrible biography, which, believe it or not, was sanctioned by Shirley Temple itself, based on her book CHILD STAR. It gives me the feeling that some are very easy to please. <br /> <br /> First of all, ASHLEE ROSE ORR, no matter how modest talents it may be, in no way resembles either the form or the form so similar to the Shirley Temple that it can be played as this simple biography of the most famous child star in the world. She gives no indication of why or how this child was so revered, except that she tried her best to portray Shirley, who never clicks on any level. Nothing like this. <br /> <br /> And this is the main drawback of the whole work. But, as if this was not so bad, any drama inherent in Shirley’s story of her rise to near-instant glory was completely whitewashed by a tasteless letter spiced with random song and dance moments that didn’t even come close to what Shirley did for example, “Cod Ball” with Buddy Ebsen, who was probably the culmination of Shirley’s choreographic dance). <br /> <br /> Simply dressing a girl in a polka-dot dress does not turn her into a Shirley temple. None of Shirley's signature charm, warmth, and attractiveness is even remotely offered. All we see on the display is a pale imitation of the original proof, once and for all, that there was only one Shirley Temple. <br /> <br /> There is nothing further to write about this mess. None of the others is more than usual in lifeless roles. My advice to Shirley fans is to read her book or, even better, watch her movies. <br /> <br /> These are pits.
