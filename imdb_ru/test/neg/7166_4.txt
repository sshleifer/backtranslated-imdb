I once saw it on TV, and when my friend recommended it, I began to look for it, although it seemed that it was nowhere near. I finally got it in an antique shop and couldn't wait to see it ... Oh, I saw it a couple of years ago and could really enjoy it. I was surprised that this film lasted only 80 or so minutes, and I think this is what made the plot and story so missing. The plot really sounds good, both in the trailer and in the comments to the film: teenager, Angus (Jesse Bradford) and his newly made crazy laboratory Yellow out on the island during a storm while boating with his father (Bruce) Davison). Together, they manage to survive in the desert and wait until they are found and rescued. However, what is never mentioned is that everything is shortened and plot events are in a hurry. There is a love interest between Angus and Sarah, but they never show together for longer than a moment. Yellow is a harmful dog that parents don’t want to keep, but after a few days it seems to be valued enough to join a boat ride. The scene of the mother (Mimi Rogers), in which he vaguely mentions what death is for a younger boy (Joel Palmer), is not going anywhere. Soon we learn that 9 days were spent on the island, then suddenly 14, and then 19. Of all the animals that could be exposed in the wild, only one species could attack them - the wolf. Why couldn’t something else become a problem, instead of having the same type of animals — maybe even the same type — hit twice? There are few opinions on how Angus prepares food, except when he finds fruit and roots, and when he fries a locked rat. If he knows so much about survival skills, why hasn't more scenes been shown to him? The one thing that made me empty was why the dog did not have much of one. When he is rescued and the dog is left on the island, there is no scene showing how he survives without human help. I wish I was more open to it when I watched it, but I liked it. The game was good and the score was pleasant. However, I wondered why my father looked much older than his family, and why he and the chief search and rescue guide share names. This is a good film for children, but although the main character is 14 years old, no one in 10 would be interested in this.
