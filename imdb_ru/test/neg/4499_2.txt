More like a frisbee looking like a turtle with fangs that rise like a warthog. More battles with people in bird costumes that look like people in bird costumes. Ping-pong spacecraft. Two naughty boys who know how to do everything, including boarding a spacecraft. More tiresome music. More "Gamera is a friend of children". I remember when Godzil and Rodan came out. The films were very funny, because the monsters were actually a threat to humans. Now they are just a parade of silly costumes with a very small amount behind them. All adults are ridiculous and weak-minded. As in American sitcoms, children are bosses (when in fact they could not come up with a way out of the paper bag). These monster films should be the Japanese means of partonizing these little spies. First of all, however, this is that after watching three of these films (with the same plot again and again; see the footage), the final conclusion is that they are boring. If you have not seen this, do not worry.
