The most positive moments in this film were credits (text style) and some moments in the game Ice-T. Story line; the two rival gangs, forced to fight the fake sites of betrayal, power and change, are well-worn conspiracies, but in this case, painful (very) to wade through. The decrepit landscape, which added a bit likelihood in places and dubious lighting, constantly distracted from any interest / identification with the characters (the actressâ€™s forehead / nose was dazzling, not to mention other scenes with the same problem.) Not even halfway through the movie I wanted to know more about how and why this happened, and not about what was happening on the screen. Disappointment if you saw Ice-T in other roles. Kudos to other actors / actresses who seem to be in their roles, despite weak leadership; Corruta side kick and another restaurant employee.
