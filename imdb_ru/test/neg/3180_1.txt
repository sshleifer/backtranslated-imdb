I am shocked and amazed that I have not found pathetic reviews on this terrible film. I rented this “movie” or feces, whatever you called it, from several friends, and after thirty minutes we had to stop watching. Just listening to the dialogue left a terrible taste of sour milk in the mouth. This film was about as smart as pimply ass. I hope I’ll never see a limp Ann (Julianne Nicholson) looking like a bra. It was like watching the most rotten pilot for a sitcom who never gets on television but instead of being quick but agonizing 30 minutes (all I could bare), it was agonizing 90 minutes.
