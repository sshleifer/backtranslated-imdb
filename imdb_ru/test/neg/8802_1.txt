This film is bad, so bad that my mom, who barely stands up to the "unknown" of Disney's Snow White, giggled the whole movie. My first warning should have been that it was in the $ 5.50 trash can at Wal-Mart. But I did find some good films in this trash can, so Iâ€™m not mistaken if this is a debacle. The second warning was to be that when the cashier rang the DVD, it was actually $ 3.88. Again, I never neglected cheap things. This film is definitely not for people who are looking for something good to watch, and certainly not for everyone who sometimes loves a bad movie. If you need background noise when you do something like playing cards with friends, then get it, but if you are looking for something that you can see, don't even worry. It was very disappointing because there were a lot of good actors. I felt like I was watching a chocolate version of Willard.
