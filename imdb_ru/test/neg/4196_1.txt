The guy with the unlikely name Shay Walker is looking for his two daughters in a cornfield for an hour and a half. This is the whole story ... with a bad game, of course. Walker wanders through the corn maze (corn? I get it! HAHAHA ... not funny) and shouts, "Girls? Where are you?!? ”About 1000 times. For some reason, whenever he runs past a pumpkin, the chipmunk laughs (as if the pumpkin laughs at him, oh well ...). His daughters scream for most of the film ... even when there is no reason to scream (perhaps because they are still stuck in this horrible movie?). Twin girls straight from the Shining appear from time to time. Most of the corn maze looks the same, so Walker's search is aging very quickly. The filmmakers understand that in this film, NOTHING happens (even the music repeats), so they try to do something interesting by rotating the camera very quickly, shooting upside down, inserting smaller photos of the same picture from different angles, using the red light makes the corn look scary, and rotate the camera 360 degrees (at least, I guess it was done on purpose, but most likely these are just examples of incompetent filmmaking). Most often, when Walker wanders through the maze, you do not see his face. I believe that a child holding a camera cannot look so high ... This film gives you a new appreciation of the original “Dark Harvest” (which has nothing to do with this film, except for the fact that it also shows a niva). Don't be deceived by the R. rated. Walker says the word F three times, and now we have an “R-rated horror movie,” ugh. The stuffed animal on the cover doesn't even show up in this movie ... and when you want these stupid stuffed animals to come back from the first movie, you know that everything is bad! Instead, we see a guy in yellow boots stalking our hero (unfortunately, he is dressed like Mr. Walker, so I didn’t even suspect that he was being followed for a while). I found out the identity of the guy in the yellow boots long before Walker did (the movie almost ended when he connected 2 and 2, naturally). The end of the film stretches and continues ... in case it is not slow enough, there is slow motion! The last sound you hear (besides your own laughter) is very bad. If you can't tell, this is the worst movie I've ever seen. At least they did not end with the promise of another sequel!
