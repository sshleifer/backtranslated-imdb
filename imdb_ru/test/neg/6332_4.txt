I have to say that I am a big fan of these “Last House Left” robberies, even those that most people seem to hate are often highly valued by me; but one of these films, which I didn’t like very much, was Aldo Lado’s Night Train with Kills, and, unfortunately, it may seem that the trains and Last House on the Left do not mix, since Horrible Express is another weak blast. off Something that this type of film really needs is a terribly nasty lead character; and although Terror Express offers three potential candidates, not one of them is promoted and becomes this villain, leaving a flaw in the most important area. This is a really good start, since the three young people on the passenger train are beginning to slightly annoy the guests on board. This leads the audience to the conviction that there is something else in stock, but, unfortunately, it will not start when the stage is ready. From there, the trio eventually "captures" the train and uses its new found strength to terrorize the guests and rape the women. <br /> <br /> I must say that there are a lot of meanness in this. a movie that will appeal to many viewers; but there is hardly any blood. Director Ferdinando Baldi seemed to think that he could get away with replacing blood with sex scenes, and he might also get away with it; if he could shoot a scene of ill sex. The idea that these men took the train by force comes out of the window when it comes to sex, as the people you expect to be strong and strong seem too interested to show their women a good time, and despite that , a very manual sandwich sequence, no gender is particularly interesting. Since most of the film is occupied by these sex scenes, it becomes a huge problem. Such films often lack style, tension and trust; but you know what you see is bad when you are bored. As expected, none of the actors have anything in common; and the central three stand out particularly as rubbish. The direction is absent in style, and there is very little tension or suspense; making it difficult to care about what will happen. In general, this is a pretty stupid example of a movie about exploitation, and I cannot recommend it.
