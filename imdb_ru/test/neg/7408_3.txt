I'm not sure what it is, but there seems to be some kind of curse when it comes to films about the elusive snow man. There was still no film that reasonably approaches the subject, nor a film that creates real tension. Both The Legend of Bogey Creek (1972) and the first film called Sasquatch (1978) became a small cult classic, but none of them was very memorable. Both films were aimed at a family audience, thus not allowing themselves to actually scare anyone. “Harry & The Hendersons” (1987) was the first big-budget film to use the snowman, with the stunning design of the creature Rick Baker. Nevertheless, they also decided to strive for a younger audience, but this time as a comedy (as Bigfoot did in 1995). I waited a long time for someone to take up this story as a thriller, perhaps in the spirit of "Jaws" or "Predator." When I saw this in my local video store, I thought that my dream came true. Boy, I was wrong! Lance Henriksen plays a billionaire who is leading an expedition to the Pacific Northwest in the hope of finding his daughter when she was aboard a small plane when he crashed in the mountains. The package is interesting and promising. The truth is, he never creates real expectations. I have never been interested in any characters, since each of them was very two-dimensional and rather soft. It seems, even always reliable Henriksen calls. Every time he appears on the screen, he looks bored. It should be, since there is no action to talk about the first hour of the film. As for the creature, where do I start? I thought that at least we would get a cool-looking monster running through the forest, but instead we would get this bald (yes, I said “bald!”) Man with completely black skin and pieces of fur here and there. Imagine a cross between the “Swamp Thing” and Chucka from The Land of the Lost, and you will understand the idea. Nothing like the cover of the box, I assure you. Careless editing and careless guidance also add to the confusion, since half the time everything seemed inconsistent, while the other half of the film was constantly used with these long, slow fading (which had no meaning or no purpose). They even stole all of P.O.V's infrared vision from a creature in Predator, which looked too stupid and inappropriate to be effective. Maybe all this proves that Hollywood should just forget about trying to make more Bigfoot films, since they have not done the one that works. Until now, everyone has been as scary as the episode of "In Search" 3/10
