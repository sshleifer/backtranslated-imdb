I have to admit it, I love horror movies ... especially the 80s slasher movies. Hell, I even like cheese, like Lunatic Camp and Night of Demons. But I didnâ€™t really think about this movie. The death scenes were not very well made, the CGI was terrible, and the acting was ho-ho. Worst of all was the story, which had no meaning at all. I would say save your money, but chances are that if you want to watch this movie ... you are still going. I didn't hate it ... just not very good. In general, this is just another soft, lifeless horror film, in which there is not enough life (not surprisingly, this film was on the shelf in Dimension more than a year after its completion).
