I love comedies and independent films, but it was too slow, and the humor was exclusively regional. I think it would be better if the protagonists were cute, but they were just typical gen-x loafers, just like the people who had been causing problems in high school for forty years ... I can understand the high marks for a young indie director when he deserves it, but this is an extremely average movie.
