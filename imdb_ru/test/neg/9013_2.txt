For those spectators who thought that the film “Alien” of 1979 was the first to depict a man-earthling impregnated with an evil alien, “The Night of the Bloody Beast”, shot 21 years earlier, could be a surprise. In this film, America’s first man in space crashes returns to Earth and is considered dead after examination. Later he comes again, with only half a dozen or so alien seahorse tricks growing in his stomach. An alien (?) Also appears to frighten a small group of scientists who are watching our serious hero, and she (?) Seems to have the body of a bear and the head of Jarnek, a stone creature from the 1969 Star Track Episode. In any With his short 62-minute work time, a small group of scientists and a cheap monster, this film offers nothing more than a Z-class warm-up for Outer Frontiers (which will premiere four years later), but without the wonderful letter this show usually boasted. Despite the grim name, this The ilm is obviously sci-fi, not terrible, and does not offer any scares, recklessness, little waiting, and little food for thought afterwards. It seems that it would cost about $ 100 (but probably cost twice as much), and the musical score often seems to be irrelevant to the events (I will not use the word "action") on the screen. By the end of the film, many questions remain: how could our hero give birth to these creatures? Why should a foreigner behead people in order to learn our language? (In justification of this title, no doubt!) Why can't space aliens land on our planet instead of riding our ships? How was our hero soaked from the start? These are all questions that this little fool cannot be concerned about. This is actually only for science fiction finalizers of the 1950s.
