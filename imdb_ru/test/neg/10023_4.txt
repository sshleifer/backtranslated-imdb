Everything that everyone said is already believable when it comes to “Booty”. Endless footage of nature, a bad game - in addition to these elements, this is a watchable film for fans of slashers, which in some cases is considered a cult classic. <br /> <br /> Jackson Bostwick and Jackie Coogan play each other pretty well, there are also a three-minute banjo solo that demonstrates Botswick's skill at the instrument. Not so bad if I say so myself. <br /> <br /> The last ten minutes of the film - his saving grace. The ending still haunts me to this day. It may also have a short-lived plus in that early John Carl Bucheler does special effects. Someone might know him from films like Troll and Friday, 13th Part 7. He made both of these films). In general, this is not the movie in which everyone will find something useful. In fact, at the Hollywood level this may take one of the first places among the most amateur companies, but even a poor cast and brutal footage can be forgiven for this handful (although very loyal) of slasher fans in the world.
