Edge Vs. Michaels-Boring as a whole (loved the sweet music of the chin in the chair) 4/10 Taker Vs. Heidenreich - One of the worst matches I've ever seen, predictable as hell 1/10 of a match Tripe Threat WWE - Why I watch them, no one wins the championship in the buzz, this is not the main event 3/10 World Heavyweight Championship - a pretty good match, rather Tripe H, than a battle, but I was glad to see it after watching shit. 5/10 Royal Rumble-Good Rumble, Liked the disassembly of the brand, the thing Hassan and the end. 7/10 In general, still crap. Why is someone watching the buzz ???
