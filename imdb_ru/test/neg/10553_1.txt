What can I say? It was one terrible movie to watch. Iâ€™m usually not very critical of gay movies in general, because most of them are usually low-budget, but it really pushed me to the wall. I mean, was it with gay movies? Didn't gay producers and directors learn anything from the films of Gus Van Saint and Ang Lee? Just watching the whole movie was like sitting in a dental chair and removing wisdom teeth. I continued to pray in moments when I felt some connection with any of the characters, but this never happened. Most of the character representations were not very convincing. It was like watching one of those poorly prepared commercials for television on local television channels. I can not tell you how much disappointed. He saw this film as a big fan of Tori Spelling, other works and directors who worked on Latter-day Saints. It was definitely not worth the wait. Definitely, in a few hours of my life I will never return and, of course, I will not buy it on DVD.
