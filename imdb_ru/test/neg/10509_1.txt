This film actually almost made me cry. <br /> <br /> For starters, fake teeth. Then you notice a nice plastic or painted set. To make it even more boring, all the action is accompanied by a bright light flash. Then they say: sound levels are so different, sometimes too hard, then too soft, never as good as in good films. In addition, it sounds so strong that I think they had one microphone for the whole set. And worse, ever heard of stereo? If the camera switches, the sound always remains in the center. The actors speak as if they were reading from a board mounted behind a camera. And scaling in another scene is so terribly childish. <br /> <br /> Music is chosen so poorly that it never adds anything. It only destroys any randomly created excitement. <br /> <br /> To finish this, the fight scenes ... my 3-year-old niece would make the best fight scene. <br /> <br /> This movie is not even good for a laugh, it's just so bad ...
