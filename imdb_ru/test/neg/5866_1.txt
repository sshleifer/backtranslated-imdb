The person with whom I start everything about this Cartoon, from Episodes to "Plots", "Scripts, Animations", for me - the most stupid, boring and most annoying cartoon that Walt Disney television has ever created and made. (2006) and Disney Channel will stop showing it in the US since May 2008. <br /> <br /> Believe me, this is a wise choice to skip this video and the black cloud of the cartoon, if you watch it do not say that I did not warn you to warn. <br /> <br /> You are on a boring and boring right, Dim and confusing time, I wish and pray that I will not even see 1 Episode from this comic Buzz Lightyear Of Star Command, If I could, I would delete Part my brain, who remembers watching her, yes, that was so bad.
