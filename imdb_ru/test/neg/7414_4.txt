Bigfoot films are usually bad, so I am not inclined to watch them. However, there were some good commercials on the Sci-Fi channel, so I decided to watch it. A mountaineering expedition headed to the Pacific Northwest to find the fallen plane carrying the daughter of the expedition leader (played by Lance Hendrickson), and brought a revolutionary DNA detector that can be used to prove the existence of saskacha. And in fact, this causes some anxiety at first. Saskatch is not visible, but he sees the warmth of the mountain climbers (like an alien in Predator), and I really wondered when he was going to strike. The action is tolerable as background music. Dense wooded location is well used. And when the creature is finally seen, the costume is not bad, although nothing special. But as the film progresses, it becomes increasingly annoying and absurd. Most of the characters are unpleasant people, rude to each other and only on expeditions for money and advertising (except for the character Lance Hendrickson), so it’s impossible to care about what happens to them. And their behavior is becoming increasingly stupid. One person shoots a creature (not fatal), then gets drunk and sits alone in the dark. One woman tourist puts on a tight silky negligee before climbing into her sleeping bag, and then barely escapes when she is dragged into the forest without losing her hair and makeup. The survivors then conclude that the sasquot is indeed after the DNA detection machine and will leave them alive if they leave it behind (“the creature knows what threatens it”). Obviously, the instinct does not apply to these actors, otherwise they would not have appeared in this film. And the end is so stupid that you want to kick the TV screen. If it were not for the script, it would be a horror movie.
