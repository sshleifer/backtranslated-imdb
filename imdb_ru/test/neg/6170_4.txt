Mickey Rourke hunts for Diane Lane in "The Killing of Elmore Leonard." Mickey Rourke never disappeared. He had a steady sequence of appearances before he exploded on stage. He was remembered in Dominoes, Sin City, Man in Fire, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, and Get Carter. But in his powerful dramatic performance in Wrestler (2008) we see a full-scale character presentation, which is only hinted at in Get Carter. Whenever we recognize him, Rourke remains a cool, but sloppy, muscular slender ball. <br /> <br /> This is Elmore Leonard's story and production. Leonard has written such famous films as Mocking Western Thriller 3:10 for Yuma, Be Calm, Jackie Brown, Get the Shorty, 52 Pickup Men and Joe Kidd. That means we have some cool guys, some good, some not so good. <br /> <br /> It also means that we get dense, realistic scenes with characters that do what is best for them in every situation, weaving complexities into violent conclusions, Killshot is no different. The hard, slim ball killer Rourke pursues an unhappy married witness Lane. Think the history of violence does not meet the country for the elderly. It is not as intense, bloody or bloody as these two, but almost as good. If you like these two, including the equally wonderful “Eastern Promises” by David Kroneb, you will also like Killeshot. <br /> <br /> Directed by John Madden did not make many films. His last few were pleasant, if not successful: “Proof”, “Mandolin” by Captain Corelli and “Shakespeare in Love”. <br /> <br /> Diana Lane did not have a strong film role, as she and Richard Gere gave incredible performances in The Infidels. Recently, she is charming and attractive in romantic stories such as "Nights in Rodanthe", "Dogs should love" and "Under the Tuscan sun." Here she is just at the height, balancing her sex appeal with restrained tension. <br /> <br /> This is a small part for Rosario Dawson. And yet Dawson does an excellent job with this. You see a lot more of Lane, including the underwear scene in which Sigourney Weaver competes in the movie “Aliens” and Nicole Kidman in the movie “Eyes Wide Shut”. <br /> <br /> While you are in the crime drama section, raise also “Kiss, Kiss,” Explosion, Explosion, and Gone Baby Left, and Before the Devil Knows Your Dead. The latter has remarkable performances by Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney. <br /> <br /> Kilshot flopped at the box office. More our luck. It is definitely worth 3-4 dollar rent if you like this genre. 6/20/2009
