Indeed, a disappointing movie about robberies, I really expected that a pretty cool game with cats and mice would take place throughout the entire movie, and there really wasnâ€™t much going on with cats and mice, but it was just pretty silly. And it basically showed all the good scenes in the trailer, in fact, if you saw the trailer for this, you basically saw the whole movie, because it's just so predictable. Thus, the story basically concerns several armored personnel carriers who try to steal $ 42 million, which they must transport, until one of the participants gains conscience. I thought the film would be better with famous actors, but I was wrong. I mean, this isn't necessarily a bad movie, but it just wasn't so good or has some depth. This is definitely a rental at best, just not worth watching it in cinemas. robbery <br /> <br /> 4.8 / 10
