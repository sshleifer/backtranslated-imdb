The director seems to be a good, solid person. His parents are struggling with the same problems that we all face. They deviated from each other. They loved each other. They misunderstood each other. And a poor audience should spend in ninety minutes something that may be the trials and tribulations of one of the most boring families ever to come out of Long Island. <br /> <br /> There are few interesting options in this documentary - the music is banal, the shooting is not inspired, and the story is the same story that plays on every birch street in every city in America. I do not want to seem too harsh - rarely there is a sweeter, more benevolent documentary made. The director is the person you want to be friends with. You simply wish he had tried his best to present the material just as his parents supported their marriage.
