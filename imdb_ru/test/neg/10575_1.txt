It was the stupidest film I've ever seen in my life. It is a complete waste of money and time. I went to see this movie with my friends, and when the movie ended, not a single person in the cinema - not that there were a lot of people to watch this horrible movie - said: “Wow, what a good movie.” Someone really released! It was absolutely horrible! It was disgusting, and I hated every minute of it. My friend put her head in my shoulder near the end, because after the scene with Rick on the ceiling, she wrote, she had enough. It was not at all funny. Believe me, I went with 11 other girls, and none of my friends liked it. That was funny! I've seen a lot of movies, but it was absolutely the worst! I mean the scene in the film where the old man drags with the dead man in the coffin. I just can't think of these things.
