A group of young people opens the way for the salvation of the spirit of Elizabeth Bathory when they tell her poem from a video game, supposedly representing a session. The only one who dies in the game is Miller (Adam Goldberg), who is also considered dead just as he died in the video game mentioned. While the characters of others did not die in a video game, their reading of her poem instead brought the video game into reality with the walking CGI characters haunting and killing each of them, one by one. They must follow certain methods using a mirror and nails to defeat Bathory and save their skin. <br /> <br /> If this assumption sounds silly, then it is. Heroes - obscene deviations from the bad TV shows of the WB, this time allowed to spew profanity. This click follows the rules of the slasher, but does not show much violence or is bleeding. It remains safe PG-13, and most of the deaths occur behind the scenes. There is a scene where the true hero and heroine flee from the video game characters that are chasing them. Yes, this is so bad. Nothing to recommend. Beautiful cast, including Sophia Bush as an October name.
