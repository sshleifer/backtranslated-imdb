In 1970, feminists invaded the Miss World beauty pageant in London and stopped the event, throwing flour and eggs at the scene. What for? Because, right or wrong, they felt that this event humiliates and humiliates women. I do not offer any criticism of their actions. This is the free world in which we live. What I want to know is: why their modern equivalents do not penetrate into the studio, where such shows are held, and do the same? <br /> <br /> Sex & The City is all about four self-absorbed women from New York: Carrie is a fashion slave who turns into a cat when a man claps her hands, Charlotte is eager to find the perfect a man (they don’t exist, love) so she can use sex to trap the poor devil, Miranda’s lawyer scares men off, witnessing nonsense like “out of touch with my emotions” an old martini ad "anytime, anywhere, anywhere." Feminists consider these characters - especially Samantha - a shining example of modern femininity. Well, if shouting harsh words in busy restaurants is progress, I think feminists should take a close look at themselves and what they should represent. <br /> <br /> If “Sex and the City” were the creation of a man, it would be taken off the air for sexism. Instead, like Charlie’s Angels before, she made supposedly intelligent women think that she was acting as a positive force for good. There is something very clinical and cool in this show. The Benny Hill Show was also sexist, but at least it was funny.
