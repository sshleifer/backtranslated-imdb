Attica starts well. A somewhat boring story helps a lot to the two main actors, and here there is a semblance of studying characters, but the film quickly goes uphill when the character Carrie Snothress buys a monkey. None of those cute little monkeys. She buys a real big chimp !!! <br /> <br /> This sudden plot kills the movie. It is simply unthinkable for a woman, similar to the one that Snodress plays, which makes it difficult to do anything because of her powerful father, for her to suddenly buy a chimpanzee. I mean, come on! Forget it!
