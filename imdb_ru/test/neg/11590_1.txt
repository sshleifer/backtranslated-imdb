Where do I begin? First, the story sucks. Actual sucks, effects really sucks, I think I'll start with the story. The story of Komodo vs. Cobra: number one, it does not explain how and when Komodo and the cobra even got there. Or for that matter, how it was created. Acting: HORRIBLE! It seems that the director has just pulled several people from the street (which he probably did). And last and definitely least, the effects: they are so terrible that the komodo doesn't even look like a komodo, just a dinosaur that looks incredibly unreal. The water doesn't even move when the cobra appears. In general: a terrible piece of shit, do not even think about renting it.
