I saw this piece of pseudo-intellectual shit a couple of years ago, and now he is returning to the local film club. He uses all the clich√©s in the Intellectual Guide for Filmmakers (beginner's edition) to appear as intelligent as the director probably considers himself. You get your mediocre slow motion, a brown color scale, slow bomber panoramas, empty, suffering facial expressions, overly symbolic images and the required unfortunate end. This is a complete failure, an unintentional perfect caricature of a typical Russian feature film. Directed by Alexander Sokurov perfectly mastered the technique, but he lacks an eye. He does not see when he crosses the line into the realm of the pitiful. <br /> <br /> This film is a wet dream for haters of feature films. This corresponds to every stereotypical view of a genre that exists. <br /> <br /> If it was bad in an entertaining sense, it would be a turkey. But for a movie that is so bad that you then royally leave, we need a new term. This is the film Sokurov.
