This adaptation consists of two parts: <br /> <br /> 1. The time is “now” when Gulliver is at home in England, and soon his wicked doctor Bates was sent to a mental hospital <br /> <br /> 2. “ Described "time in which Gulliver describes his travels. <br /> <br /> Times alternate at a very variable pace, which makes the will of insecurity in disbelief much more difficult than it would have been if the film had just been I abandoned this part and followed the book as written. There is no Dr. Bates in the book, no shelter, and Mrs Gulliver is mentioned very little. Travel - in the plural - are depicted as one in the film. There are several films on the topic of sensible people, thrown into a shelter by some vile man, look at them if you want such a thing. The “now” part of the time adds absolutely nothing to the value of the story, is a complete invention of filmmakers and takes precious time from the real story. All the time, while this was happening, I was eager to show the next piece of real travel. <br /> <br /> So many flaws. The parts that are actually part of the real story are well done, and the CGI is really well done for its time. Many small (and a few medium) parts of real travel are simply cut out, but this does not stop the story. This AFAIK is the only version that describes all four travels, and for this the film should receive a special mention. <br /> <br /> Two impregnated parts get about the same time. I rate the first part 0 out of 10, and the actual travel coverage is 8/10. Averaging, I give it 4/10. If only they would cut the garbage and focus 99% on actual travel, since this reduction would free up much more time spent filling out the details cut from the rides. <br /> <br /> Why some adapter believes that he is talented enough to improve Swift, I do not know. My guess is that CGI was so expensive in 1996 that the film company felt the need to include a lot of filler, which did not need complex sets, GCI, etc. To keep total costs under a certain limit, while on at the same time, produce a mini-series, which begins in a certain number of minutes.
