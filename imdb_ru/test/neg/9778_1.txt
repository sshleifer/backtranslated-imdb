I spent $ 5 on renting all this crap. Dr. Zack is the most embarrassing lead character I've ever seen. The film was full of EVERY cliché you could think of and did not contain a single ounce of originality. There was a typical sexism portrayed by rude foreigners; all the guys were “too proud to accept advice,” which are as outdated as the grandmother’s Christmas cake. The concept and deaths were really cool, but they lose all newness when the monster is revealed. (read SPOILER at the end) Although nothing is revealed anymore, the finale is the largest passage you have ever seen. I predicted everything before it happened, including who would die and how. There is no dialogue, and this is certainly an understatement. These are mostly just random screams, thoughtful looks and short sentences. The actors are terrible! I don't want to talk about this movie anymore, it makes me angry. I'm just wondering if the director watched when it was done. <br /> <br /> (SPOILER WARNING !!!! SAVE $ 5 DOLLARS!) The monster is just a group of ants that have "evolved", so now they need bones so they can move, (not to mention that it does not serve as an evolutionary advantage, and that the ants simply killed anyone who was available, although the film behaves as if they were being killed by necessity. This film made me dumber.) Lead idiot killing ant-mom (big thing ), which destroys all other ants. Pretty cliche, huh? In the end, he almost loses consciousness due to a sudden emotional attachment to the mother who overpowers him. Give me a break.
