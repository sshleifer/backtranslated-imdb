Scarlet Dawn uses Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as a Russian baron, who has been roughly ousted by the forces of the Russian revolution, and now he has to stand up for himself in a world that is not very hospitable to former aristocrats. It is also not very suitable for any real work. <br /> <br /> Doug could be caught red, but the fact that his former servant Nancy Carroll did not give it away. Nancy has a great old love for Doug, and they marry when they come to exile in Istanbul, which throughout the film is referred to as its former Christian name Constantinople. They marry and agree with Doug, now forced to wash the dishes. <br /> <br /> But Fairbanks' former mistress, Lilian Tashman, who always plays bad girls in films, notices him and invites him to return to some style once he got used to fraud against father and daughter of American tourists Guy Kibby and Sheila Terry . <br /> <br /> It is good that this film has an incredibly short lead time - only 57 minutes, usually those that were given to westerns B, because it is tedious and melodramatic. The ending is pretty incredible. Doug knew that he was in a special Thanksgiving and really replayed to hide the flaws of an incredible story. <br /> <br /> What I didn’t understand was that Fairbanks was studying military affairs, why didn’t he? become a mercenary soldier after leaving the new Soviet Union? It made no sense to me. <br /> <br /> I would see it only if I were a devoted fan of any major players.
