In the small dusty town of Farlow, Texas, an animal kills livestock and local residents. When the teenager Tommy (Michael Carreo) was killed, their friends Anna Farlo (Erica Faye), her Mexican-American boyfriend Miguel Gonzalez (Gabriel Gutierrez), Jill Gillespie (Sarah Ericson) and Rosie (Martin Hughes) discovered that the Mexican werewolf Chupacabra the killer, and they are plotting a plan to kill the beast. <br /> <br /> “Mexican Werewolf in Texas” is an amateur nonsense, and among the worst films I've ever seen, if not the worst. Nothing works in this film: the script is ridiculous, with some of the most horrendous lines I've ever heard. The direction does not exist, and the camera follows the “style” of the “Blair Witch Project”. Amateur acting game seems to be a high school joke or play. The “special effects” are terrible and extremely poor, and the “werewolf” is the cheapest I have ever seen. Ed Wood's movies are iconic, but this “Mexican werewolf in Texas” is pure trash. In the end, Jill says that no man can resist her nipples (actually the most beautiful thing in this film). But I believe that the correct quotation should be: “no man (or woman) can resist to see this movie to the end.” I was interested in seeing how bad a movie can be, and I lost 88 minutes of my life, but I believe that most viewers will stop watching in less than 20 minutes. My voice is one (horrible). <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Um Lobisomen Mexicano no Texas” (“Mexican werewolf in Texas”)
