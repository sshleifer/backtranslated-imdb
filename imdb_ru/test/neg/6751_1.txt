it was pretty bad. pedestrian work or worse. I do not think it was homophobic, just very bad. in any case, it was really amateurish, for example, when you are 14 years old and for the first time you discover damned words and skins. <br /> <br /> The essence of this film, romance, looks completely flat. I can't help but wonder if there has ever been a serious relationship between the authors before this film. <br /> <br /> Story and walking are terrible, they won’t go anywhere. for one minute, we see these guys catching cheaters, then we are in a gay club, then we have a date. Out of nowhere, the girl seems to love comics, and then they sleep together. None of this seems real, as it was in Shakespeare’s elementary school, if Hamlet was written by a frat boy. <br /> <br /> The ending was kind of creepy because of the fantasy about the main revenge of the loser, which the girl threw. Unnecessary and really disturbing. <br /> <br /> However, you should watch this. Why? <br /> <br /> As others have noted, the director’s comments are actually ridiculous - what kind of professional talk about “knocking” or “contacting” actresses? the dialogue sucks, the relationship lacked chemistry. you will laugh at this pretentious donkey on the floor.
