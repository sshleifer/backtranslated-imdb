Of the 15 people, I also borrowed this film .. No one finished it .. It was so terrible. ???????? Not good ... Just awful. She sits in the chair the whole movie. She is in the closet. The chair on which she sits is good. I can't think of anything else to say. But 10 lines of text. To print it. My friend Nick thinks this is a great movie. Because he can give it to his friends, and he does not need to worry about calling them back. He delivered it as a film about the oath for 10 years. That's how I got it ... Then ... I tried to get my friends to finish the terrible piece of this nonsense of this limb ... Without aval ... no one could finish this ... Raises boredom to a whole new level. They could use this in Iraq TOGETHER OF WATER BOARD ... PLEASE SEND COPIES to Guantanamo BAY CUBA. Makes a great Christmas present.
