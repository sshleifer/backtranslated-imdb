I love exotic fantasy / fantasy movies, but watching this movie was very unpleasant. Suggestions and images of child abuse, mutilated bodies (living or dead), other horrible scenes, holes in the plot, boring actions made this a deplorable experience. The basic idea of ​​penetrating the consciousness of another person is not even new to film or television (External Episode Limits was better at studying this idea). I gave 4/10, as some special effects were good.
