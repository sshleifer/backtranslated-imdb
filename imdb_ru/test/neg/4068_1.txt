I can not believe that someone actually paid for this film. Stupid, unrealistic and stereotypical. Immediately after taking off the massive 747, the pilot pulled the throttles back to increase speed. then you have 5 armed men with a semi-fully automatic weapon, shooting without a single bullet piercing the walls of the 38,000-foot sealed cabin. Then, one day down in the belly of the plane, a stray bullet hits the FUEL line, and we see fuel coming out of the plane. The game was just awful and forced. There simply was no direction. I have seen some pretty awful B-movies in my life, but with the names that were in this movie, I was extremely disappointed.
