This is definitely a “less well-known” comedy from the 1920s. The only reason I saw this was because she was on a Kino Films DVD with shorts without Laurel and Hardy with Ollie. They are interesting and historically important, but, as a rule, on average and below the average for the style of the film. Compared to shorts from Chaplin, Keaton, Arbuckle and Lloyd, they are definitely one step lower in quality and humor. In addition, the accompanying music was rather poor by the standards of other silent DVDs. I ended up turning off the sound due to the irrelevance of the music in order to set the right mood. But despite this, they are still worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I have to be honest in this short film. It was the last of 8 on this DVD, and by the time I got to it, I was pretty bored with the mediocrity of 7 of 8 shorts. Thus, it is possible that a movie may be a LITTLE BETTER than 4 - but, of course, if so, not better than 5! The film is a fairly standard story about an incompetent bell. Nothing particularly interesting, and, of course, there are MUCH better than silent shorts.
