6 of 8 comments on this topic rated this movie as worthy of viewing, so let me restore the balance. <br /> <br /> If this is the best that British independent directors can offer, then they need to collect things. their cameras right now and find work in another industry. Unfortunately, for me it was 82 minutes, I will never see again and, I hope, I will save some of you from wasting 82 minutes. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the idea of ​​the film is interesting, it is not developed enough to keep the viewer. Student characters are soft and uninteresting, and, frankly, you will not care what happens to them. Soldiers are practically caricatures of every villain who has ever been seen in a film. I kept waiting for Captain Markovich to twist his imaginary mustache. Some effects were pretty good and showed some imagination, but they were destroyed by a shockingly bad game, poor script writing and unstable camera work. Perhaps the budget was better spent sending “actors” (and I freely use this term) to acting classes or the Thomas brothers to the filmmaking school or perhaps to spell checkers because the subtitles were written incorrectly. The fact that incorrect spelling has not been identified and corrected speaks volumes about the immaturity of the entire production. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the positive comments were delivered by the filmmakers, either this or they watched a completely different film. I implore the Thomas brothers never to quit their day job, because if they continue in this area, they will surely die of hunger.
