Daft boilers are not so great, but this is a Douglas Sirk film in which everything is fine. Except in this case, it is not. Based on the sanctimonious novel of the sanctimonious Lloyd S. Douglas (he wrote "The Robe"), and already filmed in 1935 with Irene Dunn and Robert Taylor, he became more lifted than a cantilever bra. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson is an arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for what Jane Wyman did to the widow, but later is directly responsible for the accident as a result of which she loses her eyesight. To remedy the situation, he takes the medicine, becomes an excellent surgeon and restores it. (No, this is not so stupid; he planned to become a doctor before becoming an arrogant playboy). Meanwhile, they fall in love with each other. <br /> <br /> Try as I could, I can’t find the redemptive social commentary and criticism of American morals, which are supposed to lie just below the surface of Sirk’s films, (this one is not too deep). On the positive side, Rock Hudson is not so bad (I think I reopen it) and, of course, looks great (in the films of Sirka people live in rooms the size of cathedrals). Nothing in this film matches the best of his later works, and even in terms of a soap opera, this is definitely daytime television.
