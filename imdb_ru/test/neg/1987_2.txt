This film tries to be artistic, but it seems to be as childish as the first attempt of a film school student. Then he tries to be erotic, but looks clumsy, like the first attempt of a virgin. Finally, he tries to be cruel and exciting, but apart from Kinsky’s performance — powerful but clearly out of place among amateur melodrama — he also clings like your hand, hugging wet noodles (which is a suitable metaphor, considering there is). It has a blowjob scene, which is even worse than Chloe Sevigny’s career in the Brown Rabbit. Run now while you have a chance. Find your Victoria's Secret lingerie catalog - it's more artistic and more erotic than this trip.
