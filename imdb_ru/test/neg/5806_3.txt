What one would expect from any comedy created by Adam Sandler, “Grandma's Boy” is predictable and so stupid that it is disgusting. Allen Covert is cast as Alex in the film, a 35-year-old potef who works as a video game tester and had to move in with his grandmother and her two roommates after losing his apartment. Some usual plot twists take place: it is difficult for him to adapt to his new life situation, which, in turn, creates problems for him at work, which is especially bad because he is trying to nail one of the new office consultants. Throw a strange boss, an almost alien company star, a really boring best friend, a few scenes from a burnt pot dealer, a really big party scene and an original video game that Alex is trying to finish with the mix that Grandma Boy you have in full. Allen Covert makes insignificant good leadership, Linda Cardellini is pretty enough for her role as an office consultant for only one of the nerds Samantha, and a few scenes really manage to squeeze out a chuckle or two, but none of this makes Grandma's boy a lot of time. Most of the supposed funny “jokes” or “jokes”, or whatever you call them, are nothing but “humor” that would make anyone of the National Lamps look confused, Joel Moore is incredibly unmixed in his role as the mastermind behind the video games JP and the whole movie actually manages to be boring, not funny or meaningful. Well, at least “Grandma's Boy” did something for someone: Adam Sandler was able to get some salaries to his non-working friends David Spade, Kevin Nilon and Rob Schneider.
