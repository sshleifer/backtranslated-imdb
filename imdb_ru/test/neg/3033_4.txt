The film is progressing quite well, but acting, directing and editing leave much to be desired. The characters are mostly removed from other films, and the twin Winnie Jones is a thing of the past in 50 seconds. The comedy gangster movie is a genre that should have a lot of contrast, stupid Lock Stock dealers and shootouts from which everyone dies. You should never know to laugh or just sit in shock. This film had the right elements, but it was too easy to sit there, like a man, knitting and stinging into small details that needed to be corrected somewhere along the line, and as soon as faith ceased to act, the person becomes more and more critical. It is a pity that it was a bold attempt, and although Clint Eastwood is known for saying that everything will be fine for the stage, he puts the work before he shoots, and he is Clint Eastwood. Here, a little more imagination with the camera and a little more workout and rehearsal for the delivery of the lines would make a big difference.
