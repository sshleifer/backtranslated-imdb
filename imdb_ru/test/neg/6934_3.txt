The film gets 3 points because he dared to be completely different. It shows the cast while you can hear their thoughts and desires! This is really a strange film and experience that I will not forget. The only problem is that the experiment, although in some sense interesting, is generally rather boring and uninteresting. In fact, it’s amazing that Norma Shearer and Clark Gable’s movie can be IT boring! The film is based on the play of Eugene O'Neill, and he really looks quite informative. In fact, it would be better if he remained as a production film - he simply did not broadcast on the big screen at all. <br /> <br /> So this film is recommended only for die-hard filmmakers and those who love Gable’s films so much they just need to watch all of his films!
