What a story, what is on the screen. First, I must say that do not touch this film, it is for your own good (sucks). And indeed, what is this story, in the beginning everything seems fine, but after ten minutes everything gets worse. And that's not all, you can hardly see that the screen is too dark all the time. <br /> <br /> Don't touch.
