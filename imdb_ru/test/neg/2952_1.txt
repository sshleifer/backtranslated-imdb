The first scene makes you feel like you are watching a play in high school. But I have seen school plays with the best acting! Each line was written so obviously that I felt that I was looking at the actors, not the characters. I found that the character development was bad, and the acting was very forced! I found that after 25 minutes of the movie I didnâ€™t care what happened, because the plot was too obvious and I was bored. I kept hanging there, waiting until the film was restored, but this did not happen. Sister Theresa was too sweet, even for a nun, but she looked impulsive and slightly manipulative. In general, I was very disappointed.
