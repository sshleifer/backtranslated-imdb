Loki, the Norse god of evil, creates a mask that endows the wearer with cartoon-like abilities. At the command of his father Odin, he spends the rest of the film in search of a mask so that it can no longer cause grief to humanity. In the meantime, the owner of the mask gives birth to a child who inherits the power of the mask. Etc. etc. If this sounds like a rather thin storyline, then it is. Add to this the fact that the film is processed ineptly from beginning to end, and the result is very, very bad. You may find the worst movies, but you will have to actively look for them. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the “Son of the Mask” is presented on the intellectual level of a preschooler, but in light of such scenes as a child mask, peeing heavily in six different directions, including the father, this premise seems unlikely . I asked my son, who, in his opinion, could be the target audience of the film, and he replied: “Convicted felons”, obviously forgetting for a moment that the Constitution forbids cruel and unusual punishments. <br /> <br /> But just a bad movie is not a sin, otherwise hell will overflow. The sin is that 72 million dollars was spent on this piece of garbage. For comparison: the next day after we watched Son of the Mask, my son and I watched the movie Good Night and Good Luck, which received six Academy Award nominations (including the best photo) and brought in $ 7. million. That's it. Only one tenth of the money spent on the Son of the Mask. Then it’s a sin to dump good money down the drain when it could be better used to make watchable films or to feed hungry children, or, for that matter, for almost any other purpose. Manufacturers should be really ashamed of themselves.
