You can describe it in just one word, and it will be WOW !!! Wow, I really did not think that a piece of shit like this could ever be released. If you are watching a movie called Ninja, then expect to see at least a few cool martial arts masters, right? However, none of these guys know any martial arts, and it seems that they went to China and chose the first people they saw on the street and taught them a whole day in the martial arts, this is their level of martial arts skills! The actors simply replay, the special effects are ridiculous, and there is no plot that makes any sense. This is the worst martial arts film I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot!
