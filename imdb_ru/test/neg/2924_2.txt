The great thing about Talk Radio is how bad it is. In all voices of the callers there is a fake melody “reading from the script”. The evening with the annoying loud voice on a radio station in Dallas is told with an impressive Sartre's glimpse to hell. Stone tries to get existential revelation and instead receives an unintended comedy. Whenever the caller makes a “deep” (empty) remark about something, Stone pokes the camera in the face of one of the characters when they are hit by some traumatic awareness that the audience never reveals. Bogosian replays everything in one of the most annoying speeches ever smeared on celluloid. Unappreciated classic? Give me a break.
