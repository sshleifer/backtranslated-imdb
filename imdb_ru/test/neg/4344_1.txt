Usually I would not even stoop to such garbage, but since role-playing is my favorite hobby, and so I became the object of the film. It was rubbish in many ways, so I don’t know where to start. I would prefer to sit in the “Plan 9 from Space” marathon than watch one more minute of this vomiting. At least Plan 9 didn't have an agenda. How the media can capitulate and irresponsibly present an extremist agenda as a fact outside of me. This is a terrible time when a whole group of people can be unceremoniously disfigured without protection and without real facts. I know that this comment has become more social, but nothing can be done about it, as requested by this film. Imagine that a pro-Nazi film is viewed solely on the basis of its merits. It does not happen. At present, the people who shot this film are themselves nationalists and, perhaps, should go into the communist enclave, where propaganda is accepted.
