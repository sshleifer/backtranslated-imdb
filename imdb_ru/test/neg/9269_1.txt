It's hard to decide where to start. I bought it for a few pounds, and it was the worst one ever wasted. There were no pictures and several plot lines on the back of the DVD, it should have warned me, but I usually like bad movies to laugh, so I decided to try. The film consists of three short stories, each of which revolves around someone who was once in a particular bus (it was never clear what the meaning of the bus is or what city it is in) <br /> <br /> POSSIBLE SPOILERS (as if there is something that could be spoiled) The car seems to be demonic Brahm and seizes the power of his life. <br /> <br /> The second story is about a man who never cleans his refrigerator, and a monster-bacterium emerges from it. <br /> <br /> The third is about the woman who is leaving. in a dating agency, just to find out that her date is not so normal. <br /> <br /> Between them, shots from the bus (or the bus, anyway) are considered by us, while the narrator dumps a lot of garbage about the relationship (in fact, it seems that he is responsible for what he says "). <br /> <br /> There are no expiatory features in the film. The action, the costumes and the little Spfx are disgusting. There are even attractive female cast members to admire. Simply put, this film is a rout.
