This movie ... terrible and beautiful at the same time. I first saw it when I was 13 or 14 years old, so it has a great nostalgic meaning for me. In this film, Cesar Romero actually plays Octavio's character, the man who “discovered” Santana. There are also two other actors, Monte Markham (played by Sam, who is trying to save his daughter) and Peter Mark Richman (playing by the priest), who have great filmography, and these are the only performances that are suitable. The rest of the acting and the film itself has all the qualities of a B-film that some of us hold dear. <br /> <br /> I recently spent 2 years trying to get a copy of this film, and it almost does not exist. I guess it was discontinued very soon after its release. But in the end I found a copy and paid a pretty penny for its purchase. If you stumbled upon the Judgment Day in a video store (unmistakably recognizable with cheese green "Satan" on the cover), consider yourself among the blessed people who live next to one of the few video stores that still have a working copy. Be sure to look for those of you who love to laugh at the stupid attempts of a scary movie.
