Based on what I have seen little in this show, I don’t think I’ll ever see it again. It's not even remotely believable, and, to be honest, Derek's character just makes me angry. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but can you see how such a spoiled boy breaks through again and again? Why should I watch it?!? No, thank you, there are many other shows in which insidious characters participate (for example, Phil Pugh in the future), where the evil do not win, or if they do not win as they do. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that I think this is a terrible picture of life with half-brothers and sisters. Yes, life is not bright, but you can try to portray a character who was not evil and won. <br /> <br /> I suggest you watch this only if you like to see how the villain won.
