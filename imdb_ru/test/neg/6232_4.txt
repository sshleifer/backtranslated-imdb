as in many past films, one would think that Hollywood would know about it now, which makes the film very disappointing, not to mention making sure that the kidnapped victim is alive before paying the ransom. <br /> <br /> Maybe this film wants to remind you of these basic facts in case it ever happens to one of us. Why walk for a long time in the forest and can a city boy really walk through the forest without getting lost? Just an opportunity for some sentimental dialogue, which in the end was meaningless. <br /> <br /> I had to listen to some of the directorâ€™s comments in the special features section of the great steps Redford took in the past, (Sneakers for one) was surprised that he agreed to act in such a film. The director's comments and reasons were weak. <br /> <br /> The best parts of this film were the scenery, I can not wait for the onset of spring.
