Something strange is happening in remote areas of the Arctic. Weather Station Air Force found destroyed, its inhabitants were missing. Eskimo village destroyed. The fishing boat disappears. Curious traces are found in the snow. Four-foot piece of a living organism is located near the destroyed aircraft. The piece looks like half a claw of a giant Alaskan crab. The military (Craig Stevens as an Air Force officer) and their experts are confused. The eminent scientist (William Hopper) and his handsome assistant (Alix Taltan) are summoned from New York. Hopper deduces from this inconclusive evidence that they are dealing with a monstrous mantis. He's right. A beautiful assistant looks out the office window and sees a disgusting face with bulging eyeballs staring at her. She throws what she carries, slaps her palms on her cheeks and screams in horror. <br /> <br /> The praying mantis starts flying south along the Gulf Stream, stopping from time to time to attack large towns, such as Washington and New York. overturn buses and there are people. Military weapons have little effect on what, but finally, Stevens crashes into him in his jet fighter and inflicts fatal damage on an animal that comes to earth and occupies the “Manhattan Tunnel” connecting New York and New Jersey. <br /> <br /> Stevens, having survived the collision, leads his team into the tunnel and kills the big beetle with the 3RG mines, despite its fierce appearance, threatening behavior and a terrific roar. Stevens and Taltan kiss in front of the body, and Hopper giggles and takes pictures of them. <br /> <br /> ho ho <br /> <br /> Like the deadly praying mantis itself, the formula by this time was choking and gasping for air, flopping around, seeking not people for its victim, but something on the way to a new or original idea. Like this, they missed one cliche. Hopper had to hastily invent the Super Duper DDT, which itself could defeat an insect. This is what the 3RG mines should have been filled with, not the usual explosive. <br /> <br /> The model is pretty good, considering what the budget should have been. Not much money could be spent on something else, because everything else is pretty common. Craig Stevens - soft, face and style created for the series. William Hopper looks right - tall with silver hair - but his instrument has only one note. Pretty helper is pretty simple, considering her role. The piece calls on Joan Weldon or Laurie Nelson. They also could not act, but they carried with them small but distinct hints of mobility. Anything would help this crazy movie. <br /> <br /> I wish that the deadly praying mantis doesn’t thunder so loudly and often, because you can't growl — you can't even whisper — if you're not light I didn't mind when the monster met its death in the tunnel. The mantis is a graceful insect in its own subtle way, and it's great that they are in the garden because they eat caterpillars and whatnot. But when you come straight to this, they are not really very attractive. The male mantis is smaller and weaker than the female mantis, as in humans, and when the couple is almost in the aggregate, the woman bites off the head of the man, just like in humans. But at least men know when to stop. The male mantis continues to copulate for several minutes, although now it has no head. We humans have no meaningless men copulating with purposeful women. We?
