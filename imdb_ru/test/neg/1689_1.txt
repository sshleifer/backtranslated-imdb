I hate, despise and hate this film with a passion that makes the hot gates of hell look cold in comparison. this is nothing but an indecent, frightening and utterly trashy journey down memory lane at that terrible time, 70th decade, I am glad that I was not a part if this absolute banal were all that was offered! <br /> <br /> the animation is outdated, not least with its tasteless, missing frames and characters with huge, bulging heads; this film causes eye pain. from the knowledgeable, quiet nod to parents with bizarre cheerful seahorse, and his movements in the camp hand and the voice of Kenneth Williams, to the frank, unconvincing drug hymn, “High Cacarum” child, and I still could not fully recover from the horror he caused for me .... <br /> <br /> This terrible manifestation of complete horror must have a certificate with an R rating, so that its content worries!
