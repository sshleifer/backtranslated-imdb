This movie is terribly bad. Kevin Spacey is a really great actor, he works brilliantly in Los Angeles Privately, American beauty, Ordinary suspects, 7, etc. But this is really rubbish, he didn't fit a decent Irish accent, maybe he should have practiced it with Kate Hudson while she was doing about Adam. For the Irish, this film is ridiculous and even worse; it is rather annoying for several scenes. I think that the producers made this film, hoping that the target audience (non-European) would never see or hear about the “General” or Martin Cahill and was fascinated by the intriguing and entertaining story. Totally raw !!
