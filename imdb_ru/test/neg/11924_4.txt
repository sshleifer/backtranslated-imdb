While Aeon Flux was a bit interesting and a slightly better way to spend Wednesday night than a pub, I was pleased that I received one ticket and received one free ticket. Without knowing anything about the film, I didnâ€™t even know that before I read this site, there was a cartoon series, I was ready for anything, and, as some other viewers noted, trailers showing a well-made, good film. An interesting piece of cinema attracted me. Halfway through the film, although I was a little disappointed, he reminded me of the fifth element, but I also feel that he simply lacks additional depth and I have left an empty feeling. and quite senseless and a bit boring firefights, if you are going to carry them out, do it with a certain style, and not just with a lot of explosions and inept guards falling down. personally, I would prefer to learn a little more about this story and the people in the city or learn more about how the chairman was undermined than about another long and loud exchange of fire.
