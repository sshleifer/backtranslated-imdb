Bhagam Bhag was a waste of money and time! I wonder if Govinda made this movie? Govinda ... dude ... your big fan, do you have to make the right decisions now when choosing a movie? Interestingly, he played some role in this film. The role of Govinda could be given to Johnny Levera. Akshay Kumar steals the show here! Akshay ... do you really rock! You have created a space in the heart of every person in the whole world! Lara Datta, Tansuhri .... you guys deserve better. Paresh Rawal is good at his wit! In general, there were few scenes where I laughed ... otherwise I just wondered: "What the hell did Priyadarshan make such a stupid film?" In any case, let's wait and see the movie.
