This is the most overrated show on television. I believe that people continue to watch it, because they think they should, because it has become a kind of “cool” show, to watch and talk with friends about the next day at work or at school. rarely does it really cause anything more than a chuckle, and never cause feelings of irony or thoughts to the audience. each joke is interchangeable with the "highlights" that seem drawn from a hat. the complete lack of originality combined with even some kind of lamer impulse that he spawned (see “American Dad”) makes me doubt the mind-blowingness of the audience, which continues to show this terrible show on TV. I reward the family guy with no points, and may God have mercy on his soul ...
