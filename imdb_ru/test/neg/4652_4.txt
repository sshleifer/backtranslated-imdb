Along with his turn in the super-lazy "classic" KILL FROM TOOL (1978), this is considered to be the most terrible horror of Cameron Mitchell. To my taste, he is too slow, there are zero cute characters and not very many actions to the very end, but Mitchell’s selfless central psycho-perspective as Vincent Rinard’s vengeful spirit is entertainment. Not Anthony Perkins well, mind you, but definitely fun enough. As a fake Hollywood petty vanity, this is the only way; like a horror movie this is also true. And even if it's just a simple vintage picture, everything is in order. I am a big fan of an unnecessary senseless dance sequence, so I was also grateful for the appearance of Gazzarri dancers who simply rule. Five of them perform a crazy, touching, half-sliding, hip-shaking dance with a go-go to the song "Do not cry, look for a rainbow" in T-Bones. Watching these women bouncing around with huge smiles on their faces in a covered bahini top and parachute trousers is the decisive reason why I give it a slightly higher rating than usual. <br /> <br /> Former make-up from the movie Man Vincent Rinard (“The Best Since Lona Cheney's Time!”) hunts for people at Paragon Studios. The memory shows how Max Black (Berry Kröger), a jealous and drunken studio director, threw wine at Vinnie’s face when he was about to light smoke. He is engulfed in flames and dives into the pool, but not before he injured one side of his face and lost an eyeball (not to mention his sanity). Currently, Vincent works in the "world famous" Movieland Wax Museum in Buena Park, California. He uses a special serum (described as a mixture of truth serum, nervous medicine and special "vitamins and minerals" ... Beware the Center!) To paralyze the victims. They disappear, and the dense detectives in the case (led by Scott Brady) behave confused, because new “statues” are displayed in the museum. Vince speaks to himself (“I'm a terribly good man!”), Smokes, mumbles, hisses and tells him how the sound of a female scream “excites” him. <br /> <br /> He also has to deal with a bunch of dregs and self-abandoned witches, most of whom deserve to come to them. There is also Nick (Hollis Morrison), a drunken, inept museum guide who sees the “statue” blink, but not go to the police. Besides Max (a real dork of a class ... who doesn't even die!) And stupid cops, the other two leading roles are women, and both are pretty brutal. Marie Morgan (Ann Helm) is not your typical innocent heroine; this tramp was engaged to at least five different characters in this movie (!), including Vince, Max and two wax manikins / missing male stars (I guess she never had time to try herself in one missing girl), For some reason, she also pleads and pleads with her annoying voice to Vince give her a “copy” of the head, which he designs for the newest missing actor (and groom number 5) Tony Dean (Philip Baird). She doesn't know that Vince has already poked his syringe in the back of the head, but I like it when Mitchell dryly agrees with her demands "so that you can completely retreat from reality." He also wants her to "pose" for him, which means that she will eventually be encased in a box. Unfortunately, there is a hole in the box through which her head sticks out, so we must continue to be attacked by her piercing cheek. <br /> <br /> Another “woman” is Teresa (Victoria Carroll), one of the aforementioned go-go girls. She first saw that she would prove that she had a rhythm deficiency, swinging on stage in a bikini with a pale green fringe. Teresa is tolerant before she speaks, but when you realize that her annoying presence combines the abrasiveness of Lorraine Bracco and the Landers sisters mentality, you want Vincent to bring her serum as soon as possible. Unfortunately, we first underwent a scene when she made endless demands on the studio manager and ran through the museum, trying to avoid Mitchell. She and the other characters are not at all sympathetic, but, in my opinion, they serve as a way to make fun of the Hollywood system as a whole. And I probably give this film more respect than it deserves. There are few advantages, and they are far from each other, but include (except for Mitchell and the dance routine), colorful, slightly stylized lighting and a whimsical finale, which seems to suggest that Rinard will be severely punished for his crimes, spending the rest of his life in his own personal hell ... Married to Marie! ... Yes, now it's scary. <br /> <br /> The film also directed by John "Bad" Cardos (also production manager) as a police sergeant. James Forrest as a director, Virgil Fry as a statue, Renee Martin and Kent Osborne as a bartender. Many of the people who worked on this (including executive producer and screenwriter Rex Carlton) also worked on Al Adamson’s film "BLOOD OF DRAMER'S CASTLE" and other atrocities. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4 out of 10
