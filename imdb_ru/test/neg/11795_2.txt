This film is a good companion for Blair the Witch, because he does so much bad that BW did the right thing. Like BW, he pretends to be a documentary about ghost events, where each team member shoots his camera. <br /> <br /> However, the sensation of reality never happens. The participants are badly written cliches, and the events taking place are equally cliched (the cat jumps out of the closet, the chandelier falls, etc.). In addition, the unnatural dialogue and inept improvisation, performed by an overly attractive cast, detracts from the feeling of the document. And, worst of all, the cameras that the participants allegedly hold are recording too many events, too perfect to be even remotely believed. In fact, with some re-editing, this thing could be a parody of Blair the Witches. In fact, there is a scene in which a blond historian eats a sandwich with a huge roach on it, which is actually quite funny, and reminds me of a similarly rough scene from Austin Powers: The Spy Who Seduced Me. But in the end, the event is played directly, without a single line. It is difficult to say what was the purpose of the experiment in St. Francisville, except to get a few crazy dollars. But sadly enough, when the only real interest I could find in this was whether the blond historian was going to bandage his T-shirt from her belly with a certain shot or not.
