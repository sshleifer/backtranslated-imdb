Perhaps this film really should have become a satire like Airplane, but it failed just like a thriller. I do not understand why they could not pay a real pilot a couple hundred dollars for a small technical advice. Damn, I would do it for free! This magic plane was able to transform from 757 to 767 to 747 per hour, and the engine control levers worked backwards. And the dialogue sounds like it came out of the back-end of the children's game “telephone”, where everyone spoke different languages. I actually rewound TIVO and watched some of them a second time to see if it was really as bad as I thought at first. It was.
