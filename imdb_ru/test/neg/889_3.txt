I'm not sure why the producers had to trade on behalf of a fairly successful film franchise, because the name suggests that this is a continuation of the first three films ... what’s wrong. Although Mark Houston actually appeared in HP3, he played a completely different character (he was eight years older) in this film. Well ... so Reed and Martin were not the most talented and could not carry the film alone ... but to trade in the HP franchise, it seems to me that some kind of link (albeit minor) could have been made earlier films. I am sure that everyone who wanted to see him was “deceived” - they thought they were watching a sequel - not a completely different movie with a familiar title. And I'm sorry ... Kim Wheatley is not funny, and could not hold a candle to the late Robin Harris, Ketty Lester or DC Curry in earlier films. Although Meagan Good and Marie Morrow are a significant visual deviation ... I have to give THIS THREAT !! The simple title of the movie “Until the Last Minute” would be good. In addition, the Khadlin brothers (who produced the first three films) did not participate in the creation of this film.
