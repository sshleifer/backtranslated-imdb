This movie is sad. According to my fellow IMDb users, (* SPOILER *) RAPTOR uses video from Karnotaur films. Well, since I have not seen the Karnotaur films, I cannot say. But I notice pretty bad editing and even worse game. This film is one big smoking pile of ***. It makes absolutely no sense. This is the thing that calls itself PLOT: A mad scientist recreates predators. Predators kill people. Sheriff is investigating. * SPOILER * (although I donâ€™t know what I spoil) The sheriff is catching up with the plans of the mad doctor. The guys from the army go, and the predators start killing the guys from the army. Predators. Yes, right. I could make a clay figure that looks more real. FX is the cheapest movie ever. There is a lot of blood here. Cheap blood. It doesn't even look real. I agree with another person who appreciated this film that the only thing this film has for this is the fact that it ends. In this film, about two seconds of originality. And this happens only when the sheriff talks on the phone with some tax agent about his electricity bill or something. This idea has been used in about 100,000 other films with 100,000 different names. In general, I'm going to give RAPTOR 1/5 just because it's over.
