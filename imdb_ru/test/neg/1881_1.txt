What really surprised me about this film is that it sounded so fake. First, who in the late 80s (when the film was made) lived like this family? A college professor will not earn enough money to support the lifestyle I saw in the film. Consequently, he and his wife remain at home due to financial problems, especially when she has cancer. Secondly, Streep is my age, and most women, especially in her class (educated, white, well-off), have experienced a feminist movement. Yet this woman does not seem to notice her anachronistic behavior. I really felt that she was a very controlling woman who held her husband with an emotional child, taking care of all his needs. <br /> <br /> The fact that the film has touched so many people is amazing. I have admired Carl Franklin films in the past, and I really like Meryl Streep, but what the hell is a manipulative and deceitful film.
