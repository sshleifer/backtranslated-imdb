This is really a mediocre film in the spirit of “Bacaru Banzai”. Actors run as imitators of Mad Max, and they seem to share a joke they don’t want to share with the audience. Wheeler-Nicholson is one of those pleasure actresses you enjoy playing in movies, but it's not worth the cost of hire. The Space Worm inflames electric fire and burns 4 voices.
