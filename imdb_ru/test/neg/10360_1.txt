Yes, I admire the independent spirit of it all, but it's like a road trip with a bad actor and no budget. <br /> <br /> I laugh when I watch American comedies, I donâ€™t laugh. This film made me laugh, but only because of very obvious attempts to simulate a high-budget American high school / pot-flick. <br /> <br /> If you want a good, independent American comedy with pots, see Kevin Smith or Richard Linklater clicking or something. Do not waste your time on this film. <br /> <br /> I mean, how can you take these comments seriously when most people complain about characters who don't smoke pot! <br /> <By the way, in Norway this is called "Dude, where's my pot"!
