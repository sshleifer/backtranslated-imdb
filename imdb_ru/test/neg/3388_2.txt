I would like to know who deceived the producers of this film to pay for its production. This person is a kind of genius. This film somehow kept my attention on about two-thirds, until I realized that it was going nowhere fast. I think that music has managed to create the impression that something is happening, but in fact nothing happened. It was not scary. The dialogue was poorly written. The first 90 minutes should have been covered in about 15 minutes. This would be a moderately acceptable episode of the Twilight Zone or Outer Limits. <br /> <br /> At this moment, Iâ€™m just going crazy about having spent all this time. This is a couple of hours that I will never return. <br /> <br /> I hope that these comments will save someone from losing the evening. Take a nap or go to the gym. Or, if you want to get scared, turn on the cable news feed.
