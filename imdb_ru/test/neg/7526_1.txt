H. G. Wells is spinning. There is no doubt about it. <br /> <br /> Indeed, it would be a good sci-fi / adventure film if it were not based on a classic novel and filmed by the author's grandson. I kept hearing about how this would be the final version of the novel. The result was a pathetic and simple-hearted bastard. <br /> <br /> A novel is a great science fiction story, but many people miss it when they read it (probably because they read it when they are very young). in that it is filled with social commentary. Eloi and Morlocks are a satire of class differences in Victorian England, and the general idea of ​​the film is that ALL MAJORITY AND DISTANCE, a satirical attack on Victorians complacency and their civilization will last forever. There is no love story, no romance with a beautiful woman Eloi ... in Eloi's novel - these are 3-foot children's creatures with mental abilities not much higher than those of an animal. The time traveler made friends with the woman Eloi, but it is clear that he thinks of her more as a pet, and in any case she is killed before the end of the novel. <br /> <br /> This film first tries to give us a completely stupid backstory, "Why does he want to travel in time." Awesome romance and the lessons he needs to learn are enough for the fans to vomit. <br /> <br /> Journey to the future is interrupted by a future catastrophe. Well, not bad, but it would be better if we were allowed to see that humanity as a whole degenerated, as in a book. I believe that this is another reflection of the time, because in the version of George Pal there was a nuclear war. <br /> <br /> Common story? Ugh. Complete distortion of the novel. Eloi are too competent and warlike. Morlocks are too smart. UberMorlock is embarrassing and there are no settings. He just appears in time to be killed. Yawn. <br /> <br /> Samantha Mumba is coping. Guy Pierce is one of my favorites, but he often seems confused. (He reportedly broke a rib during the shooting of this film.) He also looks unhealthy and overly thin, as if he had been sick for a long time before doing so. <br /> <br /> A sad, apologetic version of a film from one of the world classics. H. G. Wells deserves better .... MUCH better. <br /> <br />
