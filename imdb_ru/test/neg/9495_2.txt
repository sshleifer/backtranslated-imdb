I really don't know much about the Marquis de Sade, who has not read any of his books, but I have never imagined him as a burning queen. Carson Kressley from "Strange Eyes" for "Simple Guy" or Jack from "Will and Grace" would easily fit into the role that Nick Mancuso gave us. <br /> <br /> The film itself was rather thin and seemed more like a parody - or a reason to show the Parisian brothel several times with men and women having a good time on the couches in the living room. What kind? They can not afford a room? I was very pleased that Madame (Irina Malysheva) felt that she was performing her patriotic duty, taking care of the needs of the soldier. <br /> <br /> The film was just a reason to show a big chest - and I mean a lot! Fans of Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) may be interested to see him in another capacity as Inspector Marais.
