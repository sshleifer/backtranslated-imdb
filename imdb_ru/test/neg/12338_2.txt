Downhill Racer is, in essence, a film that can only be seen for stunning skiing episodes. Although there is a story, the character of Robert Redford, the skier who is trying to make the US Olympic team, is so soft and not sympathetic that you wonder why bother to take care of him at all. Gene Hackman in an early speech adds that this is good, but this is a film that can be watched without sound, and it will not matter much.
