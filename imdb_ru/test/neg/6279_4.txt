The War of the Worlds, directed by David Michael Latt, written by director David Michael Latt, is a film with a slightly lower average, which is not bad considering the budget he had to work with - just $ 1 million. For this budget, the production value was not too bad - the best part of it was visual effects (I was completely impressed with CGI, given the budget) and sound design. Less stellar parts of this film are a story that at best VERY drags on (but again, I think it’s because of the budget they had - they had to extend certain scenes to create a 97-minute full-length film) the game (again, because the actors didn’t have a story to work with), very few exceptional camera and music shots. However, again, I can let the negative parts go for the most part just because this film was made for a tight budget and still had good production value. However, you must see this in order to see how the low-budget version of War of the Worlds can be done even with flaws. 4 out of 10
