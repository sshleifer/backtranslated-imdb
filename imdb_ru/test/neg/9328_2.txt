Well, when I saw the Beginning, I thought what the hell they burned Schradersâ€™s version and did this poor one. But now, having seen the Dominion, I deeply understand this decision. Even they got it not much better. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but this movie is really crap. Some good moments, but really boring stories and some serious plot holes kill this film. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the story of the Exorcists has a lot, and in the prequel of this you can build a lot and give references that viewers would like to see. But the film has so much of it. The effects are really bad - not even the television standard.
