Terrible! A friend of mine (who obviously thought I had a terrible sense of humor) recommended this. <br /> <br /> These are bobbins. I almost turned it off. Only my anal desire not to leave things unfinished did not allow me to do this. <br /> <br /> This was obviously an attempt by the British to make a film in which many television actors also worked using some sort of lame script from their business partner. I'm struggling to come up with something, even approaching the lack of this film. Less funny than global warming. <br /> <br /> Usually I am not so passionate, but I watched it much longer than ten years ago and thought that I spent about an hour or so of my life. <Br /> <br /> Baby, less plot, useless undertaking. <br /> <br /> I'd rather eat my legs than watch it again.
