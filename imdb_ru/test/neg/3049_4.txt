I begin to wonder if all these PG-13 horror films are simply glorified screens for young and novice talents. Take a new screenwriter, an inexperienced director, several television actors looking for a break on the big screen, and see what they can do. “When a stranger calls” is a little better than most of these recent sentences, but still fully captured; Replete with plot holes and genre cliches. <br /> <br /> The story is incredibly simplified. The subtle 87-minute running time is abundantly complemented by unessential friends and a senseless cheating guy. The killer is deprived of even the symbolic motivation of Jason or Michael or even the killer of the original film, and as a result is never particularly frightening. The police behaves so incredibly inefficiently and lazily that it borders on professional misconduct. Simon West brings the same attractive banality to the affairs that he managed with Lara Croft, but his style of direction is definitely universal, with no signs of real talent or vision. The performances are routine, the dark corridors replace the true horror, and are frightened because of the weary variety of cats in the closet. <br /> <br /> However, cinematography and design is above average for this type of film. The house is beautifully designed, all in dark wood and glass reflections, and there are several points that are of visual interest. <br /> <br /> Despite the lack of an ounce of dramatic originality, it acts as a rather satisfactory "dark house" Thriller, and holds the interest longer than most of its likes.
