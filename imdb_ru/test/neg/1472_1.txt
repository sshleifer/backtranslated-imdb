I usually like underground films and anti-heroes, but this is a bad joke. I wonder how you can call it a movie. All these people are losers, and the director cannot make them interesting at all. They are not funny, not tragic, just stupid and boring. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed something, but I will not watch it again to find out what. Anyone who has a video camera can do more ... <br /> <br /> I give it one for originality. Everything else is crap.
