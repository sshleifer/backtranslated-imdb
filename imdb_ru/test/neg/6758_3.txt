The remnants of the ambushed army units are connected with a group of cowboys to make their way through the Indians onto the warpath. It looks like it can be a fascinating Western, but this is boring, boring, boring. It moves like molasses, action scenes do not inspire, acting is pedestrian, writing is flat, even photography is not very good. Eastwood in a very early role is played by a former Confederate, who does not like the idea of ​​fighting on the same side as the Yankees. This is the only distantly interesting situation in the entire film, but Eastwood was not an experienced actor enough to handle it, and his character looks irritable, not angry or embittered. Very ordinary western. In fact, a very unusual western. It is worth seeing if you are a dedicated Eastwood fan and want to see him at the very beginning of your career. Otherwise, do not worry.
