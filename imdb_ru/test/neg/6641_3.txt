This movie is stupid. There is no work around this. But just as dumb. Keep in mind, dumb and dumber are much funnier than this. However, for example, I like to watch stupid movies (Tail Sting) and laugh with a group of good friends about how bad it is. Call me callous, but watch this movie and youâ€™ll understand that the only way you can laugh at it is to laugh at it, not at it.
