Dr. Marnie Bannister (Magda Konopka) is a terribly mutilated woman. When one of her colleagues discovers the formula of rejuvenation, Marnie sees in her the opportunity to become beautiful. When she is denied a drug because of possible side effects, she kills her colleague to get what she wants. The drug works and it becomes beautiful. But the formula reveals the worst in it, and soon it left behind a number of bodies. <br /> <br /> Have you ever heard the expression “as exciting as watching a paint dry”? This pretty much sums up satanic. During the film, one of the characters utters the phrase: "Something so terrible, it is unthinkable." I wasn't sure if he was talking about something in the film or in the film itself. I am really disappointed because I had high hopes for this. Satanic had opportunities, but they were never realized. At every opportunity, the plot makes Marnie do the darkest things imaginable. The letter is terrible. And part of the problem is Magda Konopka. She is not so attractive and can not carry the film alone. <br /> <br /> Another big problem with Satanic is directing and editing. This is a mess. We see things and places that have nothing to do with the film. The camera is delayed in the pictures for too long after the end of the scene. I can not come up with a single picture that would call anything other than unoriginal. This group of filmmakers does not show much imagination or talent. <br /> <br /> I may not be familiar with the Italian comic book on which Satanic is supposedly based, but I am sure that he should be better than this one. ,
