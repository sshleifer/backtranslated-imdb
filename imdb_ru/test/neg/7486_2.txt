I again and again chose this at the box office, wondering if I should try. Today I broke down and turned around, and I probably wasn't worth it. <br /> <br /> Although the writer / director made respectable efforts to the film, he was unable to attract attention. The characters, although you wanted to feel them, just didn’t have enough development or depth to really connect with them. Sarah's sexy bursts are quickly tired. I do not mind sex in movies, and I do not mind bitchy characters, but being a “bad” girl does not mean that you tend to defiantly ask people if they want sexual services. When it turned out what happened to the characters, I was bored, and I was ready to quickly go to the climax, the end, everything exciting ... and deliver nothing. What the guys from this story ultimately tell you seems forced and unrealistic, and is simply not entirely correct. If they had added a bit more misery there, I would be interested. It should have been more like a surprise / drama film, and he had to stick with the name “John Goode’s Wife”, rather than the entire “red right hand” and cover that looked like a horror movie. Damn ... this was supposed to be waiting, period. <br /> <br /> In any case ... watch it on a rainy day or late at night when there is nothing on TV. Although not as great as I had hoped, I would stop at some commercials.
