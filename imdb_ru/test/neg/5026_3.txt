Let me state this from the beginning. I do not hate this show. I really like some of its aspects. In fact, when I first started watching it, I quickly got hooked. I was just starting out of the whole stereotype of "anime for children", and the mature elements of the show intrigued me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, after watching the entire series and several films, I can say that my general character has changed, and it falls into almost all traps that plague the "bad" anime. Seven or eight friends and I started watching this show on TV. By the end, only one friend and I were still watching, and none of us liked it. <br /> <br /> Let me explain the plot to you. You can skip this paragraph if you do not want to know. Kagome is a high school student who once falls into a magic well near her family temple. When Kagome comes out of the well again, it is transferred back in time to the feudal era of Japan. She meets with many other characters, and they form a group of five or so companions who set out on the path of revenge / justice / fumble in one character case =). In general, they are trying to recover fragments of the sacred gem, which increase the strength of the demons who use it. <br /> <br /> Although there are many MANY side stories and plot arches, they were not close enough. The material will take 167 episodes. The only storyline arch that is interesting enough to view is still boring (a group of seven). After halfway through the series or maybe even earlier, it becomes painfully obvious that the plot is frozen on the spot, and the person who made the series decided instead to add dozens and dozens of episodes of filler. <br /> <br /> These episodes have little effect on the story and rarely even the characters. In some cases, some characters that have played an important role in the story disappear simultaneously for dozens of episodes. Many episodes follow the same patterns of cookie cutters as the stories before him. Inuyasha shoots at the enemy with a scar of wind. Windscar is distracting. Characters gasp in horror. The enemy is a barrier. The characters conducted three episodes, trying to kill the enemy, before Kagome finally released a sacred arrow at him, and he turned into dust. <br /> <br /> Also ** BASIC SPOILER: CONCLUSION WILL BE DETECTED ** The absence of any conclusion creates the impression that you jumped 83 hours. <br /> <br /> ** THE MAIN SPOILER IS COMPLETED ** <br /> <br /> The animation itself is above average, and in some cases excellent. Despite this, reusable animation cells hit most of the militants, and it is very difficult to ignore them when it becomes clear that the same boulder passed the character five or six times in a row. <br /> <br /> incl. However, on the other hand, all the characters are very well developed, and the romantic relationship between some of the characters was really charming. In addition, the character design (appearance) was brilliant and sometimes one of the best I've seen, especially with a group of seven people. There is definitely no shortage of cosplay opportunities. Despite this, I hoped that the character would die just so that there would be some movement in the plot. And part of the humor in the show between the characters is used again and again. One particular joke (sedentary guy) is found in the first five episodes, and you can literally expect it to be used again and again in the remaining 162 episodes. <br /> <br /> Although there are some good aspects of the show and itâ€™s easy to understand why he has a lot of fans, the series seems to be dominated by obsessive fans who drool over Sessomira and InuYash. the whole series. The first 30 episodes are very smart, original and enjoyable for everyone. But after that, it just becomes boring and tedious. Watching a TV show should never seem like a chore, but somehow this show does just that. Do not expect much from "InuYasha", because you will only feel disappointed.
