This was done in that beloved age, known as the 1980s, and filmed in my hometown of New York. in fact, it has become one of my favorite science fiction movies. Oh, of course, it really stinks of hell, but so much to laugh, laugh and enjoy, that becomes more tolerant after each viewing. <br /> <br /> For example: <br /> <br /> Try to find a similarity between this and ... well, okay, nothing as bad as that. Well, except for Castle of FuManchu. <br /> <br /> Socks can be dangerous for your health. <br /> <br /> Create surcharges by describing a voice-over, rather than showing any images. <br /> <br /> Let the leading villain “Valeria” (wonderfully played by Angelica Jager) create the most exciting lines in history! ! <br /> <br /> A lot of men and women in post-apocalyptic style (the so-called leather bikinis, loincloths and dead animal fur) <br /> <br /> In the end, be horrified! <br /> <br /> I'm going for a salad. Toodles !!
