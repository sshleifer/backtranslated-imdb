Gordon prevails in a typical full moon, but this was to be expected. Combs are surprisingly restrained, keeping its performance at a more realistic level than we used to see. Also the usual black humor of Stuart Gordon disappeared. <br /> <br /> The film is effective enough to show the destruction of the Crest and its last heroic act to save his wife and daughter. You actually feel sympathy for his character, despite his omissions. <br /> <br /> Personally, I was more surprised by the nudity and borderline porn sex scene than I was shocked by the scene of violence and gore. <Br /> <br /> Not a classic Gordon, but certainly something that you might like if you watch his more famous films.
