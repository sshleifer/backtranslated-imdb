Although it was a well-told story, it seemed to me too unpleasant. The main theme is child abuse, which is never funny - a dirty topic. Add to this a lot of profanity of a drunken husband-rapist and a small child, no less - and this film turned me off to such an extent that I never saw him again. <br /> <br /> Punks on two little boys are also shown here, another unpleasant viewing experience. Realistic plot makes immersion in a swan, when one of the boys flies away on a homemade plane! Give me a break! <br /> <br /> The only positive and enjoyable part of this film is the beautiful, loving and touching relationship between the two young brothers played by Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazello. The latter became a familiar face in the next couple of years with large roles in the Jurassic Park, Shadlowlands and The River Wild. Wood, of course, did not achieve great success until a decade later, but he made it very big in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. These two children and the story of the undeclared Tom Hanks are the only facets of this film that I liked.
