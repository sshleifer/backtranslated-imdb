Man this thing bites! I'm sorry I ever sat down and watched it! Fridkin was mad because he made the film, trying to win the sympathy of the audience for this crazy person. If it were up to me, I would have made the audience hate this low life instead of looking at it with a hazy look! He killed people! I can also add a grizzly! And Fridkin wants you to feel sorry for him, because he is “wrong”! I say that Fridkin can forget it! I hate the guy on whom this movie is partly based, and I hope they really came up with it and gave it a smashing ass! In a nutshell, do not waste your time! It hurts and perverted!
