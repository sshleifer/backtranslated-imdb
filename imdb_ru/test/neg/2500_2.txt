Strangely, although the film features full X-rated scenes and brutal murders, it is never as shocking as it should. <br /> <br /> A group of scientists travels to an island in the Caribbean to investigate a radioactive substance. incident. Upon their arrival, the mutated islander talks about a happy deed - killing men and dealing with women. Isn't that always the case? <br /> <br /> Among the boring actions, we find several lesbian meetings, tripartite communication with male prostitutes, various heterosexual relationships and the rape of a dead body. Although all this is completely clear, it cannot shock or move as intended. As soon as sex goes completely pornographic, it just loses its edge; the suspension of disbelief is broken, and we understand that we are just watching people have sex. <br /> <br /> There is blood and blood in the killings, but given that this is the film of D'Amato, he is really tamed. For a more rounded experience, look similar to the Erotic Nights of the Living Dead. <br /> <br /> 2/10
