It is alarming to see so many people giving incredibly high marks to this film. Some praises use such distorted reasoning (and transparent agendas that betray simple love for everything that is at least somewhat critical of the United States) that they are approaching hysteria. <br /> <br /> Heavenly Gate is a bad film, this is terrible. Endless scenes, using carefully thought-out shots that make no sense, dirty dialogue, gloomy image, no sense of any subject, except excesses ... /> <br /> The high rating of this catastrophe is a product of revisionist history and temporal shifts in perception. <br /> <br /> From some point of view, look at Lawrence of Arabia before looking at the Heavenly Gate. You will see how pointless and lost this film really is. The “problems” he may have been trying to cope with are lost in the miasma. <br /> <br /> I have no problems with films that are critically related to the United States themselves, but when a terrible film receives such undeserved praise purely because of this element ... it's worth disputing. <br /> <br /> The film is worth seeing for two reasons; curiosity, and as a cautionary tale for young filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I saw this at home for free, imagine the torture when you are in the theater and sit in it ... for 4 wandering hours!
