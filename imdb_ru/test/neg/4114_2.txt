Ray Bradbury, run and hide! This tasteless version of his short story about time travel and its impact on deevolution in the 1950s is little known from a theatrical production (was it?) And now exists as a DVD on the shelves released during a slow week. <br /> <br /> Something that seems like a fantastic fantasy thriller from the first scenes quickly misleads us, because computer-generated graphics are replayed unchanged throughout the film, which is supposed to be about another 'journey back in time, when a large company sells macho in 2055 the opportunity to hunt dinosaurs, paying exorbitant fees for returning back to prehistoric jungle in time. One foot / butterfly glide in one of these plants, and the course of evolution changes with the resulting temporary waves rolling around the planet, turning everything into cannibalistic plants and animals. Of course, there is a pretty girl who knows how to reverse the process, and a hefty man, risking his life to act on her orders, and everything is fine in the end. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a story ... and the most amazing fact about this poorly written, terribly disruptive film is that it attracted some wonderful talent to portray flat comic characters. Edward Burns (all amateurs and funkies) is our travel hero, Ben Kingsley is a bad corporate guy with a funny white wig, Catherine McCormack is an all-knowing woman who created, and Wilfried Hohholdinger is an excellent person as an evil person and should know better than join this flop. And the saddest thing is that for those who love this genre of fantastic monster thrillers, the creative department sold out some of the darkest animations to get on the screen in a long time. Must miss. Grady harp
