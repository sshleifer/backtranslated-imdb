Except for the very early Norris, “Breaker, Breaker” cannot offer anything that cannot be found ten times better on any of the broadcast channels. The pathetic attempt to make a film is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Despite this, I watched it by pressing the fast forward button, because the game was so terrible that it was comical. Of course, the film should be a fighter, but it turned out to be a treatise on how not to make a film. Everything that can be wrong with the film is on the screen in this “dog”. If you come across this, take a look at this. This is so bad, this is ridiculous.
