Call me old-fashioned, but I like movies with plots. I thought that “comedy with stones” is just a way to more specifically describe a comedy in which a lot of weed is smoked, and people who watch it are more inclined to enjoy it. “Grandma's boy”, however, decided that this was a full-fledged niche and that the stoners represented a piece of comedy cake that needed to be gotten. Obviously, Allen Covert (star and producer) and the Happy Madison gang were right, but that doesn't make “Grandma's Boy” less boring and unfunny. They can be completely stoned, but the characters are mostly half burned. <br /> <br /> Alex (Tywer, longtime supporter of Adam Sandler, the first star) is a professional video game tester from the mid-30s. whose roommate made them evict. He could look for a new apartment, but then we don’t have a movie. After trying a couple of friends, he ends up living with a good grandmother, Lilly (Doris Roberts from "Everybody Loves Raymond"). She wakes him up at 6 am and makes him do household chores, and he soon falls asleep at work, so the new sequel to the video game may not end on time. <br /> <br /> Like most people, Alex deals with his frustration and eliminates boredom by playing video games, or becoming higher or higher. His friends / colleagues do the same. Most of them are virgins who live at home in addition to loving video games. They are all clumsy and everything, except for Nick Svardson and Joel Moore (only from time to time), their characters are not funny. It's funny if you are damned ... of course, I suppose, but I can't tell by experience. <br /> <br /> Maybe all we, fellow lovers, like is gaining height, playing video games, and embarrassing to look at women with certain attention on their breasts, but even in this case, it should not be the driving force of the whole movie. It should not make the old women get too hot from the accident (saw that it is approaching) or from sexual jokes, but this is what happens when the film is not about anything. There is no conflict until during the last 20 minutes, with the exception of minor problems related to the lack of a bank, Alex is trying to get a pretty girl (Linda Cardellini) to love him, and the guys are struggling to finish their levels by the video game deadline . <Br /> <br /> Characters can be the saving grace for these wandering stoners, but besides the cute Doris Roberts mentioned above Svardson as a virgin friend who lives with his parents and calls them his roommates, and Joel Moore's ability to make sounds robots A little ingenuity of character. “Secret” is an ordinary protagonist with no comedic dimensions, his friend-dealer Dante is an inept actor and a waste of screen time, and John Hill and Kevin Neilon are written so far that it doesn't matter. br /> <br /> If you like movies about something, and you watch them in a state of mind and body that reinforce this nothing, “Grandma's Boy” is most likely what you are looking for. Those who need more talent and ingenuity to get on board the comedy will remain unchanged. The most that I can say about "Grandma's boy" is that it is watchable, despite its senselessness. It will not be a waste of time, but you would like you to take drugs so that you can at least make the most of an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> ~ Stephen S. <br /> <br /> Visit my website at www.moviemusereviews.com
