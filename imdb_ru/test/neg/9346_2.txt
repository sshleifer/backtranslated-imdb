Oh, man, this movie was terrible. A bad look, a horrible story ... the list of good things is shorter than the list of bad things about this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, of course, it must be a comedy, and everyone, except for something, tells me that this film was supposed to be real. Most likely, the film does not begin as a comedy, but rather as an adventure film with funny elements. You can especially say that they were serious about this in the acting game, which was a serious and not ridiculous way, except for, of course, a few excessive sequences. It seemed to me that at first they tried to make a real and serious sci-fi adventure film, perhaps even a franchise, but soon began to notice how bad it all was, and just decided to add a little more and deliberately overdone the comic sequence to make the film more like comedy and don't let it turn into a complete catastrophic mess. <br /> <br /> The film is a strange attempt to mix adventurous pirated films with serious science fiction. The film was clearly inspired by the Star Wars films and its success. The film is not even ashamed to copy entire episodes, and even how the plot unfolds, the plots, characters and robots show similarities. They tried to hide it by inserting some clearly deceptive sequences, but I don’t fall for it. So the film itself is not even original, despite its original concept. You can say that this film is “Space Balls” for a poor man, even without being completely deceived. <br /> <br /> The film looks bad, with special effects from some video games (in some episodes, even literally), terrible-looking costumes (chain mail and swords in space?). The sound is sometimes even ridiculous. Looks like they filmed some episodes without sound, and then forgot to add all the necessary sounds later in post-production. mixing is also very bad. They tried to hide it, from time to time minimizing the sound and adjusting the musical score of Bruce Broughton. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the movie is so busy trying to make the movie look humorous, which completely forgets to tell the story. This makes the film's story seem extremely dirty and poorly written, with an almost completely undeveloped core plot. It also does not help make the film really ever flow. Many things are not explained, and some are even discarded after a while. The film begins as a “pirate” film that constantly watches and steals water, since there is hardly any, and only one planet with water remains in the entire galaxy (yes, that's right!). However, this storyline is soon abandoned, especially in the middle part of the film, in which the film seems completely different, with other motives. It's just like one weird and bad, stupid sequence after another, without a single click. It also makes the characters too superficial and uninteresting to take care of them. <br /> <br /> It is sad to see that actors like John Carradine, Angelica Houston and the still young and unknown Ron Perlman were tied to this catastrophic film. <Br /> <br /> Okay, I admit that I liked some of the moments, especially the fact that the final, when they go through a temporary deformation, was original and fun, but in fact all this was enough to save the film. <br /> <br /> I didn’t even like the movie in a mannered manner. <br /> <br /> 2/10
