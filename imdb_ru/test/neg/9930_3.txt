This film tried, but in the end it was a waste of talent. He tried to be "sexy." I don’t postpone the work of such actresses as Ellen Barkin and Peta Wilson (who will find something other than the television “Femme Nikita” worthy of her talent.) some real emotions, although I know that the fans tried very hard to make the scene work. If the sexual elements of Wilson’s disturbing sex victim did not touch our heart (which it didn’t deserve even at the end, which it didn’t deserve), the same thing happened with the killer element of the plot. Perhaps it was a script or perhaps a direction, but I did not feel anyone in this film, and without this feeling the film does not work for me. If you are interested in a movie about lesbianism, there are at least two films on at least two sides of the Spectrum to check: 1.) The pleasure of playing “Bound,” which works well in noir conditions; and 2.) A more truthful and touching story about a lesbian who grew up in Hellish Kitchen, called “Everything Above Me”. This is a well-defined indie from the mid-90s, which solves the problem of adulthood with feeling, not with forced sexuality. Both that, and another would be the best option of rent, than "Charity" in which there is almost nothing.
