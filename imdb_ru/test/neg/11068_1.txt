I am an avid movie viewer and enjoy a wide variety of films. However, I did not find the pleasure in this film. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I do not feel that it was a big storyline, the characters were not cute, and the relationship between the characters were at best unsuccessful, and the final only made me no longer love the movie. This is definitely not in the same category as Cave, which, in my opinion, was the best cave film ever made. Even The Descent was better than this film. <br /> <br /> It was a waste of rent in the amount of $ 3.79. And my time to watch it. Do yourself a favor and stay away from it.
