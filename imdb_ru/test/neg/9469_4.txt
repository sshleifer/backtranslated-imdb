Telly Savalas delivered a tolerable (but no better than this) performance by Pancho Villa, the infamous Mexican gangster / revolutionary in this story about Villa's raid on the city of Columbus, New Mexico, in 1916. The villa is actually not a historical person, which I am too familiar with, so I will not talk much about the historical details of the film. Like a film, this is not very good, although there is something here, both in action and in humor. Speech by Chuck Connors as Colonel Wilcox, commander of the US military base near Columbus, seemed somewhat unexpected, and Clint Walker, as a friend of Villa Gringo Scotty, didnâ€™t really help me. The film is obviously quite budget, with limited technical quality. For a film with a playback time of just over an hour and a half, I have to say that this film has stretched in places, especially in the last 20 minutes or so. Reid Villas to the United States was interesting (if not generally important in general terms) a historical sidebar and probably deserved better treatment than this. 4/10
