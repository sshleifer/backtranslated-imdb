Wildly uneven film, where the main problem is a difficult combination of comedy and thriller. For me, an unusual premise is clearly comedic, and they had to go to an all-out comedy. For example, Rock has some funny lines, but sometimes he is too unpleasant for a comedy. The scene where Betty's husband gets the scalp is too unpleasant for what should have been a less violent comedy. Another best example is the left Hollywood writer, who at first tritely preached to us through the character Freeman about the plight of the Indians; I mean - yawn! They had to give Freeman something funny to say in this segment, but this, of course, is much more difficult than just writing him a boring speech on a PC. <br /> <br /> In the New York New York New York the final form is even more: the girl not only does not receive the boy - she does not receive the boy at all; in fact, the message is that the girl doesn't need a boy at all! A bit of feminist sayings there. The first half hour is weak, but the film improves - ironically - as soon as Zellweger gets to Kinnear. I say "ironically," because I'm not a big fan of Kinnear, although he is solid here. Zellweger, as usual, very cute; she has an all-American good looks that almost every guy should like, and I have to wonder why more of these women are not "represented" at the moment, instead of dogs that inexplicably have become stars such as Diaz, Roberts, Aniston, Lopez or Barrymore. <br /> <br /> Since the film sometimes tries to be very serious, I have no choice but to criticize the character Freeman, who is the gangster equivalent of the film “A World with a Prostitute” -Gold Heart. There is also absolutely nothing in the relationship between Freeman and Doom that could even remotely assume that they were father and son.
