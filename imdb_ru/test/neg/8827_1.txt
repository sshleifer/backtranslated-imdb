In all the episodes, I have never seen any real action, drama or comedy. <br /> <br /> The plot is so repetitive. <br /> <br /> **** Someone gets something old, and then someone else will tell them a little about it, how much it costs, who made it, where it came from and how much it can to sell, and if any work was done with him. <br /> <br /> I completely watched 30 of them, I understood ... there is no drama .... no one ever loses limbs or lives, does not get divorced and does not get hit by a car or an airplane. <br /> <br /> No chases or explosions - not even racing with old carriages. <br /> <br /> All these guns and swords, and no one goes to violent murder ... what gives? No pshikosov, no murder with an ax, reckless old Englishmen in bad suits ... just yanking yep ... you have an old tea set, and he arrived from the country of Germany in 1602 - blah blah blah. .. <br /> <br /> I'm still waiting for someone with a time machine to come out on the screen and ask about it, but no ... this does not happen, and the only thing that happens is something stuffy An Englishman or woman faking some nonsense because something old was sold in Boston or China during the Ming dynasty is a big deal with EFFIN. <br /> <br /> Is it possible that no one can steal one of the leashes and hold them for ransom? Is there an alien spacecraft that will destroy the entire floor? Who the hell is writing this stuff as a show and expecting us to be awake? This is about as exciting as watching dried paint - only with comments. <br /> <br /> No sex, no comedy or romance, no action, no expectation, no action, no drama, no secrets or martial arts. <br /> <br /> This show sucks! What happened to supermodels wearing thongs and spewing lasers from futuristic weapons? Antiques Roadshow - More like a blanket and pillow and go to sleep, show ...
