This disappointed romance is a brilliant journey into the frenzy of the abdomen, but this makes stupidity in the style of television cinema painful and painfully slow. Stick to Mike Hummer. I find it hard to believe that no one has created a brilliant version of this book, Kubrick spilled it on the cover, he had to take the reins on this. Stacy Keach is too affectionate, like Lou Ford, and it all has the same production values ​​as the TV set released in the seventies, Planet of the Apes. I highly recommend that you go out and buy a lot of Jim Thompson's novels, although, in fact, “The Grifters” are not so bad, this is one of his main roles, John Cusack.
