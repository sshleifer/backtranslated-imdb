This should be rated with the worst movies I have ever seen. It just wasn't funny. My wife fell asleep. I suppose if you are one of those people who are crazy looking at a dog, then this can do something for you. If you expect that there is some kind of humor in the comedy film, you will be disappointed if you donâ€™t find an English radio announcer who pronounces this word very fun. The stripper at the club wore underwear, so there was not even nude to get rid of boredom. What happened at the strip club didn't make any sense. The main character, with whom I did not feel sympathy at all, mumbled a lot. Mena Suvari was hardly in the film, presumably just there to make people think that it was a serious attempt at producing the film. The bad guys were unconvincing and posed as much a threat as a dead sheep.
