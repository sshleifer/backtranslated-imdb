This very compelling attempt to combine Robert Altman and Quentin Tarantino (who himself greatly overestimated) is neither informative nor entertaining. Character development is arbitrary and incredible - especially in the final scene of the thugs and the little boy, as noted by other observers. In addition, with the exception of a few humorous moments, the film is not so funny (black humor or something else), as it seems, the director believes.
