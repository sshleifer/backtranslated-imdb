After watching the first film in the new Aztec Mummy Collection BCI collection, it’s hard to believe how much I was excited about the shooting and how upset I was when the release date was postponed. I have seen a lot of Mexican horror in recent months. Any great ?? Curse of the weeping woman. Some interesting despite the obvious flaws ?? The night of bloody monkeys. And some cheesy ?? Choose any Santo movie. One thing that unites all these films is that none of them can be called “boring.” Well, this is not the case with the Aztec mummy. Some time has passed since the last time I watched something that caused a dream. I did not hope and did not expect a good film, but at least entertain me! The Aztec mummy takes every situation that may be interesting, and sucks life out of it through repetitive scenes when people do nothing and then expand those scenes to infinity. I think this is what happens when you shoot an 80-minute film containing only 30 minutes of material. Hauling extraordinary! For example, for anyone watching a movie, what is the purpose of The Bat, except to display the type of fighter in the mask and extend the lead time by 15 or so meaningless minutes? <br /> <br /> I can only hope that the other two films in The Collection are more interesting than this one.
