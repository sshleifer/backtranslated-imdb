For the record, I hate fake movies. With the exception of Mel Brooks and PLANE! because it is a classic and make fun cliches, not the films themselves. I think fake movies are the bottom for both comedy and film. I especially hate the things created by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Zeltser, the “geniuses” behind DATE MOVIE, EPIC MOVIE and Meet the Spartans. <br /> <br /> I decided to take a look at COMEBACKS. Since Friedberg and Zeltser had nothing to do with the production, I was as objective as possible. It was like one of their films. It was basically every sports film, combined with one hooligan anecdote in kindergarten, and disturbing images of physical injury that were supposed to make me laugh and fail. <br /> <br /> Only someone tall laughed at these jokes. Toilet? Who wrote it? 11 years? I was surprised to see that it was the creation of the producers of WEDDING CRASHERS, which was actually pretty decent. But the attempt to fake the genre was as funny as a burning orphanage. The only reason I gave these two stars (when they clearly deserved one) was because Friedberg and Zeltser had nothing to do with it.
