I watched this video because I like Malta, and this film was shot there completely. It is very disappointing, since it cannot catch every taste or beauty of the island - only hot, dry and fruitless elements. The film was boring, boring, completely incoherent from beginning to end, pretentious and devoid of any imaginable plot. You had to be a psychic to follow or lack of a storyline. He had his moments, of course; but it also goes to the dentist. <br /> <br /> In short, I would prefer to undergo another colonoscopy before seeing this terrible mess again. It was so bad that I could not sleep. There are many films "Eurotrah", which were made without adult supervision. This is one of them. On the other hand, who is Nadia Cassini? Never before have I seen a more beautiful set of legs. She is the only saving grace in this film. <br /> <br /> The wild boar hunt depicted in the closing credits was also alarming. A boar that was released on someoneâ€™s property (there are very few local mammals in Malta; they are all small - rats, bats, etc.), and then the dogs were attacked before they were shot. Oh, well - go to Malta anyway, despite this film - this is a beautiful, colorful island; rich history and lots of fun.
