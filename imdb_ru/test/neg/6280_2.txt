Although it has been many decades since I last read Mr. Wells's The War of the Worlds, or The Time Machine, or any of his other works, I believe that all of them were installed in London or at least in England This class "B" ("C"?) Film is set in the eastern United States, just like Orson Welles' excellent radio adaptation 67 years ago. However, this film does not demonstrate the quality of the Mercury Playhouse narrative style. The emotions of Thomas Howell would not be acceptable in most high school theater clubs. I was really confused for him. His rolling in the grass on the hill shouting "My family, my family" was almost ridiculous, as was his reaction to the death of his brother. Of the three film versions of the story I saw, it was much worse, and Gene Barry’s 1950s version is the best. In addition, it was the first time I saw a “machine monster” dripping sticky saliva, such as a creature in “Alien.”
