The final shots of the original “American Graffiti” contain brief descriptions of the fate of the four main male characters of the film. While to some extent, sexists omit female characters, the end of the original film provided all the information about the people that even the most ardent fan would have wanted. Nevertheless, someone felt that mega-bucks could be made by detailing the dreary life of these characters after the end of the original film. Bad move. Creating an insurance vendor and his wife, a bored private individual in Vietnam, a driver of a drag-racer and an overgrown hippie of interesting characters in interesting situations was far beyond the talents of those who wrote this almost imperceptible film. While most of the original lineup returned, and only Richard Dreyfuss had the good sense to stay away, “More American Graffiti” is a mess of silly situations that include protests, car races, vocal performances and the Vietnam War. The use of split screens, once considered innovative and daring, is overly used to divert attention and confuses an already confused situation. This sequel demonstrates almost everything that can go wrong with a sequel. Perhaps this should be shown in film schools as a lesson. Even the use of period music, which was a delight in the original, is poorly done here. If you want more “American graffiti”, look at the original twice.
