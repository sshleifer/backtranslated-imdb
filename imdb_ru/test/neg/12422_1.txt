Legendary pop star Steve Alaimo (“Don't Let The Sun See You Weeping”) plays the role of an unattractive stock car racer whose career has reached the goal (haha) because he constantly crashes his car (or, as he laments, I) ) I'm tired of being hit by every fat-free monkey that gets behind the wheel. "). He gets into a bad crowd of humorously inept Nazi bikers, who are incredibly named Jeter, Banjo, Fats and ... Linda. Fats are the most pleasant of all; surf to the back of the skull and now general only grumble, like Harley Davidson’s leather face. <br /> <br /> In any case, Steve tricks cops into catching dastardly scammers in the middle of one of their bank robberies. The gang just robs banks for “kicks, dude.” I I think they give money to charity. Steve is constantly failing, bikers are getting fatter, and all this never seems to be bold, because it's so boring. This film looks like it was shot through a wet paper towel. Not since the Necromantic movie so trampled on my soul. <br /> <br /> The guy who played Fats, starred in the production of “Mad,” a biopic about Ed Heine with Robert Blossom in the lead role. <br /> <br /> In any case, in conclusion: Wild Rebels: funny on MST3K, terrible everywhere.
