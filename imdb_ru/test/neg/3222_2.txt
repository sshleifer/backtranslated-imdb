An excellent gangster movie with brilliant performances by famous actors with great fighting scenes? Well, not this one. <br /> <br /> It is amazing to see such a wide composition of famous actors who have a lot of good films in their films in such a film, no doubt this may be one of the worst cases they can appear. <br /> <br /> First, the plot is what you expect from your usual gangster biography, nothing new, nothing fantastic. The way it is said makes the film look much longer than it is (when I thought that two hours should be almost finished, I was very surprised that only 45 minutes had passed). <br /> <br /> Scenes in the action movie are very similar to the TV shows of the 80s, for example, A-Team. Just in the 80s (especially with the A-Team) these scenes were much more sophisticated than in El Padrino. It is especially fun to see the guys sending their guns into the air and still beating something (not to mention the people hiding behind the doors of the car, who later look as if they were shot). <br /> <br /> the acting game fits into the action. Either you get the same reaction to everything that happens (in the style of Dolph Lundgren), or it is so overrated that you might think that this is a parody (but, unfortunately, it is not). <br /> <br /> I advise you to avoid this movie, any other gangster movie is better than this one.
