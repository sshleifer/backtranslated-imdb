This is strictly for Pryor fans. The fact that he was a wonderful, funny guy does not mean that it is more than B-Movie. The scenario is terrible, it just wriggles around the constant ridicule of crimes and prisoners of war. He balances comedy and melodrama and continues to fall on his face, paying tribute to none of them. <br /> <br /> First, 30 minutes of a rather unrealistic, non-inspiring time of a prisoner of war in Vietnam ?? at some point the guy is playing basketball ... How else can you indulge your audience? ... This prison time is boring, unconvincing and can easily put a person to sleep. <br /> <br /> Returning to the United States, the guy without any real reason is considered a “war hero”. And yet, of course, he is quickly forgotten by the public and seems to be faced with all sorts of silly failures. Or are they really? We will find out soon. Yon There are annoying clichés: his sick mother, his little daughter, whom he never meets, a high-class slut falling in love with a hero, etc. It is very strange how this film constantly switches from tragedy to farce in an instant. Not working at all <br /> <br /> In general, this is just a bad comedy that damages prisoners of war. The fact that this guy was a great comedian, starred in several good films and died from MS is not a reason not to annoy this stupid, unconvincing, unfunny comedy. But if you like Richard Pryor, he will probably be delighted with reading 3 hours of Dadaist poetry.
