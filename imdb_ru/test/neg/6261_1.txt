Such a film makes me appreciate the work of professional actors. I think that film lovers, in general, are too hard on professional actors and are ready to beat them for the most minor reasons. Just look a couple of minutes of the “Massacre in Cheerlader” and believe me, you change your mind. Razzy would be almost a compliment for these mediocre actors. But then again, this is a Jim Winsky movie. Vinorski is a popular director of these ultrabudgetary B-films (he worked with Roger Corman many times). The problem with this film is that he is really trying to develop a plot. And when you have actors who pass out lines as if they are reading letters from an eyeball, how should I take care? In Vinorsky's Bare Wench 2, he did not try to develop a plot. He was just trying to make erotic porn / Gui taking off at the Blair Witch Project. It was fun and exciting. "Cheerleader Masscare" is not fun. There are a couple of obligatory female nude scenes, but they are few. So even at an erotic level, it’s not worth enjoying. I have to say, the worst scene is the one where Nikki Fritz is walking over the bridge that is about to collapse. First of all, her character did not need to walk across that bridge. Secondly, when the bridge starts to creak, instead of struggling to run across, it just stands there and behaves helplessly. And to top it all off, we don’t actually see a bridge collapse, because the filmmakers did it for a budget of $ 2 !!! Unlike many horror films, this one is boring. And this is what makes it the worst of all bad movies. One of the few bright spots was Lank Johnson, who is probably the most natural actor in the film (although, of course, no more than halfway decently). He was funny in Naked Girl 2, and there were funny scenes in this movie too.
