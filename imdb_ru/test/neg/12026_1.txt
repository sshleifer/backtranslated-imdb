You know, I really hate the IMDb censorship system, since my entire review is almost gone if you remove the curse. But here we go. Editing time! <br /> <br /> My God, this is bad. I thought it might be a cool little movie, judging by the plot, since I know that I had previously blindly rented jewelry such as Frailty and American Nightmare. But this is just disgusting. We are talking about a killer who uses the works of Edgar Allen Poe as a reference to his murderous exploits, and the story of a detective who must stop him. Can't these dazzling khaki make a good movie without desecrating the grave of the great horror writer? I mean, the killings here are absolutely devoid of thought or originality, and the references to Paw are hooligan and fake, without enough thoughts. They are small and disgrace the work of Po. Full of holes, with terrible consistency. The game is also bad, reminding me of abortion, which was known in some third world countries as “Fear X”, which with all the pauses and unemotional lines. <br /> <br /> I understand that this is an indie film, but this is not an excuse. I saw high school students behave better than these assholes, and I myself could come up with the best murder scenes and the best story if I had enough time. <br /> <br /> There is no reason for this. Avoid at all costs.
