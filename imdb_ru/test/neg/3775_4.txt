Weber is not known for his outstanding directorial skills. In fact, no one cares as long as they laugh, to be honest, many here are scattered throughout the process, thanks to the foolish characteristic of Depardieu and the dialogue that Weber puts into his mouth. <br /> <br /> But this is not enough to make a good comedy, because beyond the usual premise of Weber there is no film: the tough guy is doomed to team up with a very naive character. In L'Emmerdeur, La Chèvre or Les Compères, there is a true story of fire and water. Le Diner de cons, although it was a play, managed to create a real alarm about the next catastrophe caused by Pinon. In Thais, prehistory of revenge is both redundant and too weak to arouse our interest. In addition, heavy texts limp on the screen as well as in the script. <br /> <br /> What's wrong? Weber completes this without creating any action, no rhythm. Instead, he uses systematically and excessively uses ellipses (he may have met William Goldman in Hollywood), and “music” really underlines the lack of nerves and the backbone in history. <br /> <br /> So you have to be content with the speech of Depardieu.
