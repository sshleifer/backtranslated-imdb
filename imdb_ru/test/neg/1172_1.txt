The story of Ed Heine is a disturbing and scary story. Ed was truly a spoiled character, and his legacy inspired such "great people" as The Tooth Fairy, Norman Bates and Leatherface. How is it that such a charming person inspired such a boring melodramatic piece of a fool ?? Ed Gein made belts of nipples, bowls of skulls, lamps of leather, danced under the moon in costumes of human skin. None of this got into the film because they needed to tell us a fictional story about a ridiculously horrible deputy and his rather homely, sexually hungry girlfriend. This film seemed to be struggling to falsify the story. It confuses me that most films deviate from the path of truth in order to exaggerate the story; This one seems to do this to minimize it. I just do not understand
