See the work of Dick. <br /> <br /> See the work of Jane. <br /> <br /> Dick and Jane are married. <br /> <br /> They are successful. <br /> <br /> They have a son. <br /> <br /> They have a nice home. <br /> <br /> They have a latina. <br /> <br /> The housekeeper teaches her son Spanish. <br /> <br /> Son speaks Spanish. <br /> <br /> Haha. <br /> <br /> See how Dick is promoted. <br /> <br /> Pompous CEO - swindler. <Br /> <br /> See that Dick falls for a pompous CEO. <br /> <br /> Jane leaves work. <br /> <br /> Oops. <br /> <br /> See Dick and Jane out of work. <br /> <br /> Dick and Jane are turning to crime. <br /> <br /> As a conspiracy, they decide to rob the CEO. <br /> <br /> See robbery do not handle. <br /> <br /> See that Dick and Jane finance the company's retirement plan with money from a robbery. <br /> <br /> Yay. See the end credits. <br /> <br /> Ok, now you have the plot. In addition, Dick and Jane move from one scene to another. One who barely connects with the last or the next. All this is terrible episodic. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey did not bother to bring his material “A”, he was just bored and a little ashamed of all this. But damn it, when you get paid $ 20 million, why? Leoni tea is crazy. I think I would be mad to not be accused of this flop. <br /> <br /> Something like Dick and Jane. Kerry and Leoni are not funny and some chemistry. The script is not funny. And it is not well prepared. <br /> <br /> But it could be more than that. The reality of Dick and Jane may be too real. Maybe it's just not funny for people to lose their jobs in a situation like Enron, when in real life there is still no happy ending.
