I love other works by Brian Yuzna, even more rude things, such as the Necronomicon, but Offspring was too much even for me. My main complaint is that it is useless to exploit the nudity of Gillian McWirter, I am not a hypocrite, but these nude scenes just stretch back and forth ... just for the culmination (almost every time) in bad taste, sexual abuse. The scene where she is trying to abort a coat hanger after a few minutes of bare screaming is a prime example. Arnold Voslu’s performance is completely unattractive, but even Jeffrey Coombs could not save this festering pile of the film. Aliens are boring, evenly dim lighting weakens your interest, and the plot is absolutely predictable. The only bright moments for me were a very brief idea of ​​the true form of the aliens (a very good model) and the scene in which Voslo finds his wife in the closet is also all right. But you were warned.
