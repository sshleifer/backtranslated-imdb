The game was bad, and the plot, well, I do not think it was. <br /> <br /> A fat, fair-haired guy who is always wearing a dinner suit, kidnaps something from a nightclub, I think, then kills the cauldron. Then meaningless fights happen. A kidnapped girl is put in a cage on a boat, why? A hard uncompromising policeman trained in martial arts appears, speaks poor English and does things that have no meaning. This is a full trip. But he has a good car. Christ on a bicycle, this film was a waste of 90 minutes.
