Oh, man, that was really bad. <br /> <br /> I saw it on video. <br /> <br /> In the scenes where the soundtrack music was playing, it was hard to hear the dialogue. When people were on the phone, it was hard to hear the person on the other end. It turned out that at least two different types of films or videos were used, because the colors and focus sometimes changed dramatically between revisions. And there were a lot of unfocused pictures that did not seem to be intentional. <br /> <br /> One of the budget indicators (one of many) was when news appeared on television. There is only the title card "news flash", poorly superimposed by the video effect on the TV screen, and the voice-over announcer. They could not take pictures with the speaker, and then show it on TV? <br /> <br /> The film begins with a killer dressed in surgical scrubs and a mask with a scalpel. Supposedly, he is a paranoid schizophrenic who escapes from the hospital to avoid a lobotomy. <br /> <br /> Students are released from school for a break, and three young women decide to have a hen party. Three guys decide to have a party, and a geek named Science also decides to have it. The overnight party is pretty boring, and the guys just continue to appear in random masks, removing their masks and then disappearing. The mother and father (the surgeon who was supposed to do a lobotomy) of one of the girls also continues to appear. The killer breaks people's throats, and no one notices this. The obvious guide to the film is more or less lunatic walks through the film. Perhaps it was a bad game, or perhaps it was intentional, since most of the movie is a nightmare, and some is a nightmare in a nightmare. <br /> <br /> The ending is really terrible. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film is the funny cover of the United Home Video VHS, which was restored to the DVD release (a double function with Terror in Tenkiller). Honestly, I can't say whether this is a photo, or a picture, or a combination of both. The women depicted on the cover are not in the film, and the clothes they wear are more revealing than all the women in the film wore. Cutting the throat on the cover is worse than in the film - where people tend to affect the dull look with pop eyes. In fact, this is what the killer has most of the time: his head is tilted, his eyes bulging, robbed in front of the camera. Often the scalpel was held in focus close to the camera, while the killerâ€™s face was masked, but not in focus in the background.
