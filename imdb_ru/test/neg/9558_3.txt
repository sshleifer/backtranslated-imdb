My girlfriend wanted to see it (laughs, this is very common) ... so I rented it. Then I saw how this is greeted by 10 Oscars. A GREAT! it must be a good old drama. This film had a lot of potential ... the direction and the way things went was very good. But as soon as the film ended, I could not help but wonder if this story was worth making the film. Virginia Hill (Annette Bening) was extremely annoying, I just could not tolerate her character. Warren Beatty was an excellent actor in the film, but again, it was just hard for me to show sympathy for his character ... he just lost his mind like an idiotic, hot gangster loser ... who has no place for life "in the first place. How he got with the likes of Meyer Lansky and Lucky Luciano ??? This film just left me with a light but unpleasant feeling ... what was it like? I just didn't feel full with Bugsy. Beatty's pranks, though acted pretty well, seemed too casual and illogical. I guess that was Siegel on himself But it was too much. It seems that there was no real story here. My baseline assessment was <br /> <br /> “Hot, playboy, who was not successful, falls in love with the woman’s loser, comes up with the idea of“ Las Vegas ".... but his failed attempt to create a casino, which he builds, as well as a lack of attitude to the money of his bosses kills him." <br /> <br /> What else is there besides this? I just did not see anything special about it, and it was a big disappointment. There must not have been so many films to come out in 1991, as it was nominated for 10 Oscars, I don't know (although the two that he won are justified). 1.5 / 4 stars.
