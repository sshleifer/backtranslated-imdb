To be honest, I donâ€™t know why this show lasted as long as it did. Well, humor is subjective, eh? but yes, this show is unbelievably funny if you ask me. Tim Allen is annoying. Jill is annoying. the boys are annoying. Al annoying. neighbor annoying. it's just more annoying than funny. The plots are the same, Tim drives Jill crazy and has to fix everything. and the last seasons? the less they talk about, the better, who the hell will cancer be useful for a damn TV series? yeah, great asshole idea. so yes, home improvement is not a good comedy. I would recommend you go watch the news radio or Seinfeld. if I had to give this show a rating, I would give it 1/10, because it never made me laugh. Ever so yes, it's still better than a nanny, though.
