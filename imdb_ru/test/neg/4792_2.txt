Another horrible movie from Hollywood. This time the woman is helping the revolution in the country of Central America. yes yes yes Hey, let's make a movie without any realism. I'm so tired of movies like this one. Actors and actresses are lousy, showy, and the dialogues are terrible. And suddenly I see John Rhys-Davies the evil president. From Gimli to Ugo Louis Ramos. I bet he is very proud of it. Well, I should not have expected much from this film, and I did not. And I'm glad because it sucks. I wonder what kind of people love this movie. I think that young people are aged 12-16 years. And I think some people love because of Kristin Dattilo. Well, I don't belong to any of these groups, and I hate it. Rating: 2
