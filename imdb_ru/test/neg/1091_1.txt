Well, I noticed that IMDB did not offer any information about the plot ... this is because it cannot be done without looking disgusting and disgusting ... because this is what this film is ... FILE AND RESPONSIBLE !! I watched it because I'm a big fan of Chris Nota, whom I personally met, and he is a great guy ... but if I ever meet him again, I will not have any doubt to ask him what made him star in something so terrible. He plays a former prodigy who is now a brilliant doctor who spends his free time running around the small children in his car to mutilate and cripple them ... it's not a "spoiler" because everything is done very clear from the start ... quite sickening ?? Oh, it gets better ... he manipulates it, thanks to his incestuous sister, who threatens to hide the sexual services from him if their last victim does not die ... even Clive Barker could not write anything so disgusting, Please, if you want to see Chris Nota in something worthy of his talent; rent a Teddy Roosevelt and Refraders
