I have to admit that as soon as I started watching this movie, he captured me, which made me watch it to the end. It is quite possible that this was some kind of hidden trend of voyeurism in me, which wanted our hero to cope with his victim, or, maybe, the passion that they received funding to make, distribute and show this film, which made I look for his dignity, or perhaps some bizarre fantasy of wish fulfillment, which may be the end of all the pain. But there is no such luck. <br /> <br /> Therefore, you are warned that you should not start watching this, first, so that the same thing does not happen to you. There is nothing worth spending your half hour on. <br /> <br /> The “First Person” edition and the joke about Fabian’s “aspiration” to permeate the women of the Falkland Islands look even more like second-year students (perhaps a freshman is a high school freshman, that is) a student film project than you can imagine imagine. The result is not only a mockery of the locals (who, in addition to the two professional leaders, are actually real people), but also the pursuit of a rather repulsive sexual policy (regardless of whether you take it all literally or symbolically, it is meaningless) and a sexist) . <br /> <br /> The reason I’ve been watching all this time is the same reason that as soon as you start picking at the scab, there is an overwhelming desire to continue doing this until it completely shuts off, even when you know that this is bad for you. You just want to see what happens. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is rather dishonest filmmaking, because it seems that in the end he has neither a moral center, nor a clarification of the local political situation, nor a place in the class. political-sexually-personal film of the universe a la Goddard. In short, he has nothing to say, and he spends a lot of time pretending that it is. Smug is a one word slogan. <br /> <br /> I would advise filmmakers to rent Waiting for Guffman several times, or hell, even Blair Witch Project, if they want to continue the game with a bit more style and a little more sincere emotion. Or at least entertainment value.
