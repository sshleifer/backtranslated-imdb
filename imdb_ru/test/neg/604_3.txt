Summing up, it can be said that this film was disappointing and could be shortened by twenty minutes. <br /> <br /> The acting was low, the only good actors in the group were Tricia, the killer and Molly, The music was a bit lame, but suitable, and the special effects were too overloaded. The plot / screenplay was bad, unnecessary torture / romantic scenes dragged on for too long and a disappointing ending. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the film was rather slow, the false-looking blood was not very interesting. Trisha arrived at the house, and there was some kind of prerequisite for a good storyline. <br /> <br /> Trichet started threatening phone calls, which heightened tensions. This instant wait, the best feature of the film, began to be created, but then friends broke this place, destroying all the potential wait / horror in the film. <br /> <br /> The plot from now on becomes stupid. Chemistry sparkles between two pairs, and then the killer selects Frank and another girl. This scene was dragged out and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The killer heads to Trichet and binds her. There is a weathered torture scene that lasts at least ten minutes. Since bloodshed is bad, itâ€™s not at all interesting, and it brings more than shocks. <br /> <br /> In general, the first thirty minutes of this film sound promising, but then poorly written dialogues and a general lack of plot destroy this film. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
