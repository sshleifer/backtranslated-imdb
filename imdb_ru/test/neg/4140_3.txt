If there is one word that I can relate to this film, this is “embarrassment”. It should be a shame to everyone who is associated with the film, to watch it in the cinema. Everything - script, script, dialogue, lyrics, direction - trashy, lousy. <br /> <br /> Saw this movie when I was a kid. I liked it then, mainly because it was a fantastic superhero film. This is not a very well-studied genre in Hindi movies. The attempt is credible, but that is all that needs to be done. Sasha Kapoor seems to be very in a hurry in making the film. I can not understand the reason why the actors are for Hindi-speaking characters who can not even properly set up the synchronization (say nothing about duplication). The script is terrible. Editing is even more. If you closely follow the dialogues, you can find grammatically incorrect sentences (which completely change the intended value). Nothing special in music. <br /> <br /> The greatest embarrassment should be behind the Censor board. There are several episodes in the film, one of which is absolutely clear (so much so that I can't even think about the metaphor). The director missed them. The editing team missed it. And the censor board also missed it. Here you have the motto "Indecent Exposure." Officials probably fell asleep while watching a movie. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why Amitabh went with the role. This may be because he was a good friend of Kapoor. But the role is hardly something for him. With remarkable roles in Hume and Agnipat, he could not follow him with the worst. There are a couple of heroic scenes that are really worthy. But otherwise, they are incredibly incredible (for example, catching an arrow. With CGI this could be better, but it was '91 ..). <br /> <br /> Dimple and Sonam are not exactly installed screen on fire. Shammi Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor speak enthusiastically, but their possibilities are limited. Amrish Puri, as usual, plays the role of a fairytale villain (occasionally letting out a villainous laugh). <br /> <br /> In general, an interesting concept. Could be much better.
