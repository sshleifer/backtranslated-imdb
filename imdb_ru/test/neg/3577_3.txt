"R Xmas" gazes into the lives of middle class family drug dealers who are married to a child during the Christmas holidays. There is no history here - just a scattered collection of events. Ferrara seems to be crazy about the combination of holidays and family life with drugs that sell in New York, jumping back and forth between everyone. It seems that the players from time to time improvise and love, and then make an unconvincing watch. In general, a bad effort is not worth the time. (D)
