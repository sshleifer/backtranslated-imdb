I bought this film from the market stall three years ago. I had to give it to you when I sat down and looked at it. I thought, â€œGood! This will be another big action movie ... "Obviously, I was wrong .. While watching this movie ... I began to understand that this movie takes me to another planet ... full of CREE * R! <br /> <br /> I was very bored and I was fed up with this film .. Although I wanted to see that this will happen in the end .. I really felt that it really got on my nerves .. /> <br /> The people behind the film may have attracted famous actors to this project. But what were they thinking about? Even these actors could not save this film. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film .. I felt it was a waste of money ... just buying this movie with a low lifespan for a small amount of money. A few months later, I sent the tape to charity .. I did not want to see it anymore. <br /> <br /> Sorry! But if you think about watching a movie, and then you fall asleep .. I highly recommend it to you .. I? I'd rather go to the Pro-Plus and see something decent ..! <br /> <br /> I disappoint 1 out of 10!
