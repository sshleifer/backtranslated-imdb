In this film, everything is terrible. <br /> <br /> In the first five minutes you can say that this movie will be terrible. You cannot, however, assess how bad it will be. <br /> <br /> We start the film with a seemingly endless opening scene with gay music and without dialogue. Moving the camera up and down the big guys who are trying too hard to look like mentals, do not cause the slightest emotion. <br /> <br /> What begins seems to be one of two separate stories. The first half of the film consists of worms, which compete in paid midnight fights with other ethnic groups. Of course, worms always win because they obviously lift weight and have “respect”. It is in these scenes that we see for the first time the degree of bad play, editing, scripting, and hatred of the people who financed this film. <br /> <br /> The main character and his partner end up in jail. The entire prison part of the film is not related to the fact that, as I suppose, is the plot, and consists of many fights. <br /> <br /> Once out of jail (3 years for murder?) The main character and his friend rejoin the Wogs. Then they go to the “other side of the city” and try to lie down, because, obviously, everyone wants to kill them. <br /> <br /> Soon the worms are preparing to rape another girl from the gang and run away. around the city, hordes of different gangs fought back. This point of the film can be compared to an arcade game, since the wogi simply run and fight with enemies, who seem to get worse and worse with the continuation of the film. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film ends with a large-scale climate struggle scene in which the remaining worms (the two main characters) take on every gang in which they have fought until now. Obviously, other gangs have no problems with unification in order to take the remaining wogs (skinheads are not against Asians). After the invincible brothers beat another million people, the film ends with the main characters going home. However, they are not returning home because thousands of angry film critics burned them to death, storming the film set and leaving angry letters everywhere. <br /> <br /> This movie is more like a computer game, then a movie, because it would explain how two guys can inflict about a million blows to the face of a million different people, who in most cases are twice their size. <br /> <br /> There are also tons of more stupid Inexplicable events in this film, such as an Asian fighting his own gang and taking a katana to the head, just to fire the worms. <br /> <br /> As someone else mentioned, this movie is not so bad it's funny, it's just so bad.
