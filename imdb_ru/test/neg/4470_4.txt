C'mon, let's leave aside the humorous humor that we can find in racism and to be honest ... it's not funny. I was shocked by the fact that the two main stars would agree to make a film that was so offensive and so harmful to race relations, and I mean not the obvious black and white comment in the film, but a blow to other ethnic groups such as Bettyâ€™s White Latinos. Should we just state that she agreed to make this film as a sign of insanity ... is she too old to distinguish comedy from stereotypical trash? Or is it the authors' fault? What about the third assistant makeup artist ??? No, the blame is that we perpetuate this kind of shit (under the guise of comedy) that Hollywood will continue to feed us until we have the decency to say that enough ... racism is real and it is not. joke We are all different, let's celebrate this diversity, not to mock it and promote division.
