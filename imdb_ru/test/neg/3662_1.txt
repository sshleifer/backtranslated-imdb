This film looked as if it was filmed on a videophone, it had very little plot and unnecessary nudity. The film was never intended and didnâ€™t make much sense, and for such a film, of course, there were unwanted tits. The director obviously tried to make the film subjective and dissimilar, but he just never gave enough information about what was actually happening, even in the end I was left with a mixture of anger and confusion. Disorder due to lack of conspiracy and anger, because I wanted to get my two dollars back from the blockbuster and 1.5 hours back of my life. They should have a payment program for people who accidentally rent this film.
