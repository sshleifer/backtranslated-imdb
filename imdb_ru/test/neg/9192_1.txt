One of the worst movies ever made. Let's start with the surface: Joaquin Phoenix, above all, is too fat to be a new fireman. NYFD does not hire Pillsbury boys. John Travolta has a poor color job, and the strange gleam in his eyes throughout the film made me think that he was in some form of an extended Scientology caster. The plot touches all the tracks and clich√©s of what ordinary Joe considers to be the life of a fireman: they all get drunk, quarrel, have difficulty expressing emotions, all their wives cry at home, everyone has a father problem, everyone has a Boston accent and so on. The delightful part of the schwarmerei, which plays on our long-standing cultural worship of the hero of the firemen after 9-11 - which was, by the way, the real cultural worship of the hero. This film, unfortunately, does not represent any believable heroes for worship.
