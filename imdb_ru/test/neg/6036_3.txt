The White Warrior is definitely one of, if not Steve Reeves, the weakest films. Set in the 18th or 19th century in Russia (??) Steve plays a Cossack warrior who tries to defeat a crazy Russian tsar, running up the side of a mountain with his rebel gang in a stupid Russian white tunic ..... Reeves's physique is hidden in a blunt knee-length tunic with an even more stupid Russian hat. <br /> <br /> The action is quite minimal, only a good fight scene from the middle of the waist shows the great physique of Reeves. This is an obvious attempt by producers to translate Reeves from the sword and sandal genre to another historical era with poor results. The dialogue from the script is difficult to understand at different points, and only a comment from the narrator allows the viewer to understand what is actually happening from scene to scene. I imagine how Reeves regretted having shot this film, but trying to get out of his toga, sandals and armor in the stands helped him to get acquainted with other historical characters such as Pirate Morgan and Thief Baghdad.
