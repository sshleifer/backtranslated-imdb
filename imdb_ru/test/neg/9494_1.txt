The revisionist history — turning the evil Marquis de Sade into a semi-heroic romance — is staggering. But the brutal acting, amateur cinematography and terrible dubbing make this film terribly bad. The only reason to keep watching is that almost all the women in the film are great. And, surprisingly, torture for several days, with his hands tied over his head, apparently, does not detract from the beauty, hairstyle and makeup of a woman. I assume that the producers were filmed mainly in Russia, choosing women for their appearance - and willingness to work cheaply - rather than acting skills. If you decide to watch it, because you have nothing to do, or you study the film, look for bad examples, take it to each scene that is not related to nudity.
