Of all the films in the history of cinema, I cannot imagine that someone would sit and say that I want to spend X dollars (or pounds sterling) to remake this erroneous classic film called Breeders. Many stories have been turned into films about meteors arriving on Earth with something sinister hiding inside. Why not spend your money on creating a fascinating three-dimensional remake of "It's from Space"? Why look for a dirty film about naked people that existed only to boast a rubber set of monsters and some naked students? Was the script for the 1986 Breeders version so inspiring that these producers felt that this had to be done again, and this time it was done right? When you come to this, the only reason this film exists is to show the Britcom cutie cake to Samantha Janus. But if you want to make leather from skin and use Sam Janus, it’s better if you want to succeed, it’s better to bare it than this, and more often than this. <br /> <br /> ... the monster is running away ... the student is dressing ... the monster is eating people ... and one more thing "what if?" finale ends. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I never thought that I would ever recommend the original "Breeders", but some other film, but it will be the second one in this place.
