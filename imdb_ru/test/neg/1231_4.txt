Well, I forgot to watch and only caught the last episode, thinking that this is the first or second episode. Honestly, I thought that CM would have at least one more installment for resolving plot points. The Rangers were left on the plains ("we will have to eat horses"), first. Little Newt is deprived of another. What an end! But my biggest complaint, especially if it was the finale, is that in this episode there was no expectation, no big climax, no dramatic clashes. Even the last fight between Blue Duck and Buffalo Hump was poorly organized. The whole episode was terrible, and this is what drives the West. Steve Zahn was watchable, Karl Urban (performer Johnny Knoxville) played Call, like a man with a limiting case of jaw blocking. All luminous looks, ringing spurs and protruding chin. And what about the Rangers? They talked a lot about cleaning up Texas and then wandered aimlessly around the center of the city, getting drunk. And how nice it is with Hal Holbrooke to lend Val Kilmer his wig and Mark Twain's peg! The Austin set looked like a fake Rocky Ridge from the Burning Saddle, the whole facade. I admit that I was dragged into the plot, but this is mainly because there were a lot of things that I did not quite understand, thanks to the late story. If I watched from the beginning, I would not get to the third episode. Now I need to look at Silverado to clear my palette.
