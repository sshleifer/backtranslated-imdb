I have seen almost all Kurosawa films, as well as dozens of other Japanese films. Compared to these other films, this film is rather medium or bad. The plot depicts two warring brothers - none of which I didn’t care much about - and it’s very difficult to understand who is connected with whom. Music and cinematography are pretty good, but sometimes the special effects are terrible - the rubber heads fly off with about the same realism as in high school! In addition to these complaints, the end of the film completely DESTROYS and ALLOWS the whole picture. It turns out that the end is not true, but was completely "fictional." What is the point, then? If you've seen this movie, see that there are A LOT of better movies, so don't give up!
