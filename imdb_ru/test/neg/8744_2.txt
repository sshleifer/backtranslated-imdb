It brings together an endless series of banal, predictable sci-fi ол 50s. As usual, this is pretty bad. There is not a lot of plot that I could discover, and excessive exaggeration only leads to unintended laughter. The name is misleading as well. Catching it on MST3K is probably the only way to see it, and better leave it that way.
