I understand the draw and appeal to this type of films, and I am a big fan of films with a little dialogue, but still this is absolutely terrible. I was in the Scottish highlands and found that the lack of Scottish accents in the characters is disappointing. This plot was strong enough in theory, but cheap sets and the lack of a single realistic character prevented this film from taking off. I feel that using silence to create an atmosphere only works when you have actors who can radiate a presence, without saying a word, and these actors, of course, cannot. If you want a quiet movie that captures this presence, try (Le Dernier Combat). There were very few films that I could not even finish, and it was one of them. Absolute drop!
