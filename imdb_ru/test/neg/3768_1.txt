There is a phrase from experimental filmmaker Nathaniel Dorsky, who says that some films are structured like a camera mounted on a dog’s head that goes along the alley, sniffing everything along the way. <br /> <br /> That's how this movie is. The structure is as follows: “Kurosawa started as a child, then he became a child, then a young man, then a director, then he began to make masterpieces, and then he grew old,“ The End ”. The word “masterpiece” is often used in this film to describe the output of Kurosawa, without explaining what makes his films so good / wonderful. Just because the narrator, who reads the script, says that the film is a masterpiece, should we kiss its back and recognize that a certain film is one of the greatest works of art of the 20th century? And one moment. The voice of Paul Scofield is used as the voice of Kurosawa, when excerpts from the director's memoirs are read off-screen. He brings pearly Shakespeare tones to the text ... but why should he ?? If you were filming a Billie Holiday documentary, would you use Dame Judy Densch as her voice?
