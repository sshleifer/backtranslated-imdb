I watched this AFTER watching Death Tunnel (this is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen in my life) so you can understand that I rolled my eyes a little when I saw the directors and producers of this cinematic stone. being responsible for that. First, I thought that the director and producer is the same guy. Both of them - Kid Rock meets the Dog Bounty Hunter. I watched the TAPS investigation, and I am not a skeptic - I think TAPS is the closest scientific method ever found in this area. It was cool and believable - I believe that they are being followed. <br /> <br /> But this, like the aforementioned reviewer, looks like a tour. Well, the tour is good, but the “investigators” and “group leaders” seemed to have made a lot of money and invested money in pursuing them or not, so when they have incredible stories, I have to take them with a bunch tsp. salt. <br /> <br /> As someone mentioned, I could see everything they wanted me to see in the picture, about 50% of the time. The rest of the time I could not make out anything. In addition, without taking photos into account - time of day, camera type, humidity in the room, dust particles (75% of which are spheres), weather and many other factors, I cannot accept them. I also can not help thinking that some can be corrected. <br /> <br /> Why does this group hide numbers from the door? Vandalism? Also during the TAPS investigation, they tried to dig up the death certificates of these nurses - and they found only one that was deemed "accidental" (people did not want to officially announce suicide). However, when one of the guides mentioned this, he said: "Yes, and this is a clear suicide." It really looked like haunted guides here in October. <br /> <br /> I REALLY, like interviews with patients and staff from an old hospital who really gave him a great perspective and personal contact. I am also pleased that they mentioned that the staff had good intentions, and not some nasty guards. These were not the best methods, but all that they had. They were desperate to stop the disease.
