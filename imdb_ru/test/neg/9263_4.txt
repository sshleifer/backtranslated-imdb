This movie is boring. It has many Predictable plots & endless moods from the very beginning. It starts well with a cool room, but it seems that he is lost halfway. <br /> <br /> On the Surya & Jyothika screen, it works very well, and Bhoomika does a good job. Why include Vadivela? He disappears completely in half an hour! Santhanam again proves his wit by picking up a comedy. <br /> <br /> AR tones will certainly last for a while. But he could have done better. Whatever the disadvantages, itâ€™s still worth seeing once if you feel at home or are looking for a good time out.
