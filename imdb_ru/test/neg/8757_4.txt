Well, I did not know what to expect from 555. In fact, I did not even hear about it until several months ago. But, being a collector of almost all kinds of horrors, I decided that I would go further and take this obscure slasher of the 80s. <br /> <br /> Basically the storyline is connected to the killer, who kills every 5 years for 5 nights in a row. What the third 5 in the title means ... nobody knows. In any case, the murders begin with the fact that the killer is looking for young teens fooling around in unknown places. He decapitates men and brutally kills a woman to death. After that, he proceeds to rape a dead corpse. The police think they are leading the killings, but they really have no idea what is going on. How do they find the killer? Does anyone care? <br /> <br /> In this film, some of the worst actors I've ever seen. Not surprisingly, none of these actors literally did anything. The three main actors are two detectives and a “sexual” female reporter. I am sarcastic when I say sexuality, she is as non-sexual as she is. Two detectives are similar to how tweedle and tweedle ladies look. One of them underestimates his role, while the other may have gone to the Shatner acting school. The acting is so bad that it almost makes you lose interest in the film, almost lulling you to death. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps this horrible movie together is a few decent bloody scenes. For a film with such a budget, the creators must have invested all this money in special effects, which are still not so good. <br /> <br /> Unless you are like me and should not own every horror movie. there I would advise to avoid this film. 4/10
