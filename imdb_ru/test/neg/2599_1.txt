“Family Guy” is one of the worst shows I've ever forced myself to watch (but not at the bottom - I saw Jersey Shore). A popular hit among schoolchildren and schoolchildren, who mistakenly take immaturity for sharpness, this show is unoriginal and stale. <br /> <br /> Since this title was called comedy, let's take a look at his “humor”. 1. Random memories of celebrities, movies, politics, or anything else that makes you laugh. He grew old after 5 or so repetitions in each episode. Simple solution: every time you hear "This is worse than time ...", close your ears. <br /> <br /> 2. Inconsistency for its own sake. This show is notorious for inserting inappropriate gags that have little to do with the plot. Solution: watch out for South Park. They did it right. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that the Family Guy is not worth your time and does not hold a candle to the Simpsons.
