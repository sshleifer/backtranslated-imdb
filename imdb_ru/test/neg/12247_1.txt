This film would be a great piece of history, if in fact it was a real film about the Kennedy assassination. There are too many mistakes in this movie so I can point them out. This is a film about the Kennedy assassination, but many important facts have been changed. There are missing scenes, and many scenes, after the president’s limousine passes a sign, do not fit. Both Kennedy move noticeably slower than the other four people in front of them. The next time you watch this movie, look for things that don’t add up, such as the Texas government and it, along with the SS men in front, rush forward, but you can see that the limo doesn’t stop or slow down . This film is clearly a disguise attempt.
