Heh ... I'm surprised that this film still exists in any form, not to mention that it is available for rent! <br /> <br /> This click is one of many bad slashers that exist only for T & A and cheap laughter. The storyline crosses a small part of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, telling the story of a psyche, reminiscent of a psycho, and a bit of good old women in chains. for good measure - in other words, complete lack of originality, wrapped in half-naked women, seasoned with a feature of complete idiocy! Looking at how the director is trying to force the quagmire of Quebec to impersonate the south of the United States, the land is sad, I tell you! <br /> <br /> It's funny for me that I was at the premiere of this film, since at that time I was a friend with Ratchford, the “star” of the film. It was painful to watch as Jeremy sank into his seat, while a click unfolded his disfigured wings. <br /> <br /> I am glad to see that Ratchford, after this pretense of the first click, turned into one hell of an actor. He can be seen regularly in the Canadian police drama Blue Murder, which appeared in CSI, not to mention his role in Clint Eastwood’s classic film Unforgiven - we forgive you, Jeremy! It was a difficult beginning, but you are well done! <br /> <br /> ~ T. Pol
