“Rabbit Fever” is a trendy collection of sketches, each of which focuses on a female personal device, which became popular due to the only episode of “Sex and the City” of 1998 (the second half of 1998, rather than the early episodes that were sent by ). With the discovery of statistics that make tularemia sound like a soft porn movie, we treated a sea of ​​predictable sketches with real and imaginary characters in the world to run amok with the dependence of women in solitary pleasure. <br /> <br /> Men, As Germain Greer quite arrogantly explains, invented a gadget for women that makes men redundant in the bedroom. Rabbit vibrators (which, according to some statistics, account for about a quarter of all sales of vibrators) are called so because of small rabbit long ears that vibrate to stimulate the clitoris, and rotating pearls inside the shaft stimulate the inside of the vagina. The film interviews characters who visit Anonymous Rabbits to help overcome their “addiction”, as well as famous people such as Tom Conti, posing as a professor, or Richard Branson (among scenes when rabbits are banned in aviation), saying that he would give free rabbits. its first class passengers traveling by air and, ultimately, all of them. <br /> <br /> The main weakness of the film is that this idea is not enough to sustain 85 minutes of cinema, there are no inscriptions on the scenes. skills, say, Charlotte’s church or Ricky Gervais, to make them fun enough, and although it can create disgusting late night television, they don’t have the hook to make people stand in line in public places in multiplexes to watch jokes about masturbation . <br /> <br /> Lines like: “It's been almost a week since you used your rabbit - how do you cope?” wear pretty thin in five minutes. The film is based on the idea that simply mentioning the word "rabbit" will cause laughter. and one more and one more. Mad midnight battery purchases can be fun in real life, but here they look rather laborious, and a special emergency delivery service welcomes them. <br /> <br /> Strange, but the BBFC issued him 18 certificates, despite the zero. violence, hardly any outright sex and sexual links that are less “perverted” than any night comedy show. The company appealed this decision, but the BBFC did not budge. At first glance, this seems superfluous on their part, and their consumer advice now simply says: “Contains frequent strong sexual references.” Some might think that teenagers find jokes about masturbation funnier than the most desperate parties of hen parties, and this topic deserves discussion; but Rabbit Fever does not even have the saving grace of a balanced approach to its subject. <br /> <br /> The best part, probably, is The Rabbit Song from Ruocco (who plays a band called Thumper in the film). For those who dozed off and woke up in the closing credits, there is a bonus scene at the end to reassure them that they have not missed anything.
