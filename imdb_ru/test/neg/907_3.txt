Sigh. I am confused when I see how a short circuit attracts attention, tasks and whatnot. I saw this film at the festival before the director got any attention and immediately forgot about it. It was a bit annoying to see him hit Grinch, who stole a Christmas heart gag, along with the narration, set design, which he had seen many times before, all of Tim Burton’s weak style and story, which led nowhere. And we got a "joke" about shooting crows from the 45th for the first time, okay? <br /> <br /> But I think that it’s really unacceptable that he even pulls out his core concept from a comic book around 1999 called LENORE A SMALL SMALL DEAD GIRL from Roman Dirge! Like any quick search on the Internet will show. I mean what is it? On this they base a Hollywood contract and open the door in Canada for the director? “Shake your head,” as Don Cherry might say.
