the movie is just awful (2/10). Although the actors are trying their best (well, sometimes it's not so much), special effects ... let me put it this way, it would be better if they weren't there. <br /> <br /> The script is based on Sapkowskiâ€™s prose, so this should be the biggest advantage of this film. Unfortunately, the opposite is true. Nothing is left of the original atmosphere. And all this is very chaotic. Perhaps they just had too much material to show in 2 hours. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you want to watch this movie, I would recommend you watch the series (the same name, the same actors, even the plot) remains the same), which was done at the same time as the movie. It is much better (9/10), and the story there really makes sense :)
