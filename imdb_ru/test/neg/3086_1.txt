One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Yes, I know that I am not a target audience. The target audience is women, student or middle-aged or any age, I suppose. I am not one of them, so the creators do not mind if I do not like it. But this does not justify the fact that the dialogue and the plot are terrible. The main character, Phoebe, goes on a trip to Europe to find out what happened to her sister Faith, who committed suicide. Phoebe is a meaningless character with whom, I hope, no one identifies himself. Faith is also a character with very low credibility. The wolf is the only person who seems somewhat reasonable. As I said, the dialogue is boring and uninteresting. The plot sometimes does completely stupid things. Worst of all, Phoebe and Faith's father is an artist, but his paintings are absolutely terrible. This film is nothing new, interesting or refreshing. If you are a guy, you will pray for the ending. If you are a chick, you can sit through it, but you will not be impressed.
