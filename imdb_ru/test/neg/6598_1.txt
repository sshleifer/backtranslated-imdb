The authors and creators of this film really should be brought to justice ... For pollution of the world with this shit! "Man in the mirror" is actually beyond horror! The path, the path, the path beyond! <br /> <br /> ... and people, Iâ€™m not just saying this because I'm a Michael Jackson fan! Or because it is truly one of the most backward images of his life that I have ever encountered! <br /> <br /> I say this because it is a waste of time, money and celluloid! I am ashamed of myself just seeing all this! This is 1 hour and 26 minutes of my life, I will never come back! I tell you; Watching the grass grow is literally more interesting than this movie! <br /> <br /> Consider yourself warned!
