First, the easy part: this film - pretentious nonsense! <br /> <br /> This reminds me of Magnolia. And then I thought, “Wow, someone made the film even dumber and more irritable than Magnolia.” <br /> <br /> I don't know anything about the Polish brothers, but this film seems to have been made by someone who has learned a lot in film school, but knows nothing about storytelling. Elements of the banal plot and the symbolism of the sledgehammer are bad enough, but the dialogue is simply pathetic. <br /> <br /> Detailed comments would be just a crossed-out list of failures. they should be funny or satirical, and not “elegiac” parts - beautiful pictures of coffee tables with mediocre music, “emotional” parts - simplified. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that there is no love for heroes in the film, with the exception of a small dignity of a priest. <br /> <br /> I still can't believe the respect that some people show for this picture.
