The preview was so funny that I could not wait to see this movie. I have just returned home and have to say that I could not be more embarrassed in this film. Yes, there were times when jokes were funny, but stereotypical roles were painful. Joan Plowight is a great actress, but the scene with the "Negro spirit" was just bad. It goes without saying that there was little laughter and far away in the cinema for most of the white crowd (I was one of a very small amount of black).
