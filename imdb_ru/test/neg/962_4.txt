The 1950s Rudolf Mate film was updated to the 80s, Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid) - a university professor who had a successful writing career, but now he has collapsed along with his marriage. The initial exposition instills in the viewer's opinion that everyone has something against him, so when the revelation comes that he was poisoned, we are not surprised if, of course, you are not familiar with the original. Dexter, after being told that he had less than 48 hours to live, decides to follow his steps with the help of one of his students, Sydney Fuller (Meg Ryan), but they discover that there are many obstacles in their way. <br /> <br /> The film begins promisingly in black and white, as Dexter reeling in the rain to the local police station, where he wants to report the murder ... his own, but 80-year Hewy Lewis punch The accompanying this scene only serves to remove any sense of tension and tells the viewer that this will be pretty bad, is it just a question, how bad? Of course, we will soon use the old flashback environment, but now the film makes full use of Technicolor. Noir has a few brief tributes, since the embracing couple is facing the blinds, but there really is nothing to recommend, the performances are terrible, especially Ryan performs her usual dizzying blonde with a pleasant smile routine. The film is a lazy attempt to add some unnecessary noise to the already excellent premise of the film, obviously trying to make money on one Body Heat audience, the seeming results are undoubtedly aimed at the youth audience and, of course, they are welcome. 4/10
