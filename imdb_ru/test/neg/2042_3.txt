I just canâ€™t understand it, the crazy people on the planet talk about it as something to see, they even dare to call it exploitation, because the obsessed girl seduces priests and masturbates all the time. Don't let me laugh. I watched the film, seduction - only at the end of the film, and do not call it seduction, it's just a bad language that she speaks about. And the masturbation scene is a big laugh too, she is trying to seduce her father while masturbating, let me be clear, with her clothes on you perverts. It's not ugly and not bloody, everyone is tearing at Beyond The Door, well, let me say that one is better for me than this film. Only the last 5 minutes have possessed vomiting and strange eyes. If I had known that it was so bad, I would never have caught a copy for me. If you really do not want to see an explosion about exorcism, look at Angel Above, The Devil Below or other stupid ones. time waist is.
