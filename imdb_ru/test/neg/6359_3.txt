Unfortunately, this film is not very good. But does it really matter? We all know the basics of history, and this is nothing new. But I love the low-budget classic of horror and science fiction ... so I forgive this one. The only thing everyone remembers from this film is that little Leonardo DiCaprio made his debut in it. <br /> <br /> He did everything well. In this role, excellent acting skills were not required, and the director probably never gave him the chance to somehow provide him ... Little Leonardo DiCaprio was very cute ... just like a girl. The film is hilarious, if you like the classics of horror and science fiction and have experience of viewing them.
