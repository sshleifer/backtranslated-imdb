I watch a ton of movies and enjoy the episodic film “B”, but this film was terrible. Besides the "self-made" quality of the film, it was very slow and did not seem to make sense. I just comment on b / w of another comment that I saw here, which said it was great! BLIMEY! It may be good to watch on a rainy day when nothing else is available. <br /> <br /> The characters were scattered and did not correspond to any noticeable model of reality. The dialogue between the characters was forced and sometimes very confusing. <br /> <br /> I suppose if you were very attentive to the whole area 51 and understood some of the nuances referenced by other comments, it might be good - but for me - Average Joe - I don't understand!
