No matter how much I like the story of David Copperfield, I cannot say that I liked this film. It was probably the second worst film I've ever seen. One problem I see is that the scale of the novel requires a mini-series of several hours, rather than a regular movie. It is simply impossible to capture a significant number of events that occur in history in two hours. I do not like the thoughtful format of memories. It was divided and it would be impossible for someone who did not know the story to fully understand. In addition, I do not think that the filmmakers correctly interpreted Copperfieldâ€™s identity. The idea that he is walking along the beach, moaning about his life, seems incompatible with the active, visionary nature that Dickens gave him in the novel. Agnes also bothered me. She looked like a home decoration, not like a strong woman. Dora was beautiful, however. This film was full of problems, and I look forward to when someone makes a decent film adaptation.
