I tested the screen and read the script for this turkey in 1988. Then it was awful, and now it’s even worse - I noticed it on the VHS on the local video clip HollowWood and said: “Oh, what the hell is behind the old Angss” Yech. <br /> <br /> Most of them had to shoot in Mexico after they ran out of money, a couple of “star” bitches, because they ended up with some kind of crap with exotic fruit drinks. I believe that everything is in order with the plot of the film, but I accidentally found out that the writer intended to make the stream of spy hunters everywhere. <br /> <br /> Doctor O turned out to be a cartoon character. He must still be spinning in the grave near the Kremlin wall. <br /> <br /> There were technical mistakes throughout the film, not only with the use of atomic technology, but also with uniform, insignia and military jargon. Of course, they were too cheap to hire a professional military adviser. Even Mr. Newman’s August and expert presence could not save this bird from the effigy of Thanksgiving.
