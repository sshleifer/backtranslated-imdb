.... You get this stupid excuse for robbing a kid's game! Man, what were they thinking? First, they get involved with the horror film Rumpelstiltskin, and then they do nonsense like this. Fari Tale of the haters! Well, to be honest, I saw it in childhood, and it scared me a little, simply because I was in the age of thinking that Pinocchio would not do this, wow, wow. But I grew up and began to think about it as about breaking a child’s play, about bullshit from a fairy tale and about the fact that it was an episode of “A Tale from a Crypt”, or at least I tried to be one of them with a silly ending, it was a lot of holes in the plot, and I still can not understand how it came to life. Was it the work of evil jeppetto? Then what, after several atrocities, does he become a real boy who becomes the most wanted in America? Personally, I think that the concept of evil Dzhepettto sounds better, he builds an army of wooden murderers and starts a ridiculous wave of crime. But this is terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! Smelly like a shoe, and terrible! He sucked his sucked! If you need killer puppets, settle for a killer doll, in particular, for the “Children's game”, without any conditions. Or, if you want the fairytale figure turned upside down, take a look at the Leprechaun, or if you want Pinocchio, take a look at the animated version of Disnet or the live version with Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Martin Landau. >>>>> -10/10 (minus 10)
