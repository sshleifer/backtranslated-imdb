I grabbed La Bandara because she reunited Jean Gabin and Julien Duvivier, whose Pepe le Mocot is a noir masterpiece. I will give him a few points, because Gabin, but a clumsy plot, cheap sets and the ridiculous Annabella playing the role of an Arabian princess, put the film on my shelf to sell. If you look at it, you will find that you ask why idiots did not build a fort * around * the well, and not a few death yards from it. And why use tin roofs in the middle of the desert? But by then, the sheer perversion of ingenuity that makes up the script should eclipse you from further reflection.
