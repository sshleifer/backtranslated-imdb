This is, of course, a direct video, but the story is not as bad as other reviewers think. I really like the fact that the hero does the wrong thing most of the time. <br /> <br /> The reaction of the hero and the reaction of the rebels is just human. The character hopper actually plays god. This may be correct, but in any case it may not like it. <br /> <br /> In the end, the theomachist is doomed to death, and the hero who would have spent his life can live. Totally morally. :-) <br /> <br /> The most unrealistic thing I saw was that the Earth is doing well, and the Moon does not stabilize its rotation.
