Patsy Kensit and some random Australian black star are playing a duet with penny imitators who are investigating a series of murders related to the art gallery, but in the meantime they can still find time to shoot young shoplifters and suspect a new male police officer of adultery. The serial killer suddenly ceases to be important when the wife’s alleged lover (who is basically just her colleague) is found murdered, and the male police officer becomes the prime suspect. Tunnel Vision is a really boring Australian thriller, incredible and stress-free, which clearly emulates popular sex thrillers such as Fatal Attraction, Disclosure and Basic Instinct. The characters are extremely one-dimensional, and almost all the good-bad-cop cops are described in detail in the script. The martial status of police women in a corpus full of men, the mentality of “first shoot, ask questions, then”, alcohol problems due to stress, etc. And so on. ?? Even unhealthy eating habits by the cops is a gag. To yawn! Kensit really does her best to make this film more tolerant, but she lacks the authority and talent of a real movie heroine. The final turn is more or less interesting (not at all original), but by that time you have long ceased to take care of the characters. Scenes filmed in sex clubs look ridiculously false, and Clive Fleury doesn’t inspire direction. What a waste of time ??
