Reba is a very stupid show. You can predict almost everything that should happen. Barbra Jean is too stupid. As if she is not even a character. A show like this should have at least someone who looks like a real person. I think Barbra Jean represents a retarded person. Keira or what is her name, Reba, Brock, they are all stupid! Kira as the smartest person on the show, and she is still stupid. ALL STUPIDS! This is my opinion of the Rebbe. Since I have said everything I can say about this show, I will simply take the next few lines of text, say what I am saying now, and do it until 10 lines are available. There. Reba gets 2/10.
