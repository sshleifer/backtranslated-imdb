My friend and I shot this movie for 3.99 in a blockbuster. If I knew how terrible this film would be, I would not pay a cent. I had no warning for this bs. Acting cannot even be called acting skills, the inevitable sex scene is inconvenient, and you can say that both girls are embarrassed, and the man-villain ... a god who could not say that he was going to attack Emily And musical signals ... my mr. This movie makes me cry. Never give it up. In fact, if you happen to take a look at this, rate your eyeballs. This film is not from God - it is from hell. I'll just take the last couple of lines to write bla-bla-bla-shiz, because I really do not want to continue this review.
