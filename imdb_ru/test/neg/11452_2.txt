This film was from 67 of the 71 best shots that I have seen, of course, the worst. First of all, I found the storyline somewhat absurd - the missing husband is 25 years old / still in love / not even a letter! Give me a break. And why was the guy who had been absent for so long, by coincidence, working on an oil rig next to a female congress? This film also featured some of the worst stereotypes of blacks I have ever seen. This makes Gone With the Wind (see Prissy) look completely progressive! I barely saw a movie that I didnâ€™t like so much. Ugh!
