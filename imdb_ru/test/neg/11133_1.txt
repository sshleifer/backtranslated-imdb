Wow, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! Packaging for film is better than the film itself. My friend and I watched it over the weekend, and we continued to watch it only in the hope that it would get better ... not ... <br /> <br /> Image quality is poor; It seems that it was filmed and transferred to the film. The lighting is not very good, which makes it difficult to read the facial expressions of the actors. The game itself was stupid, but I think this is acceptable for a “another” teen horror movie. The sound was a huge problem: sometimes you need to rewind the video, because the sound is fuzzy and / or muffled. <br /> <br /> He has no real personal merit; trying to ride jackets from Sleepy Hollow. Do not worry about that.
