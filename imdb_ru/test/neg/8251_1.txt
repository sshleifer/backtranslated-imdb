I am not surprised that so many people fell in love with it. When I watched this movie, a couple of spectators, sitting next to me, sobbed whenever you "should" sob, or at least feel "touched." For example, when Hunting said he did not like a girl. For example, when the character of Robin Williams (excuse me, I forgot what his role was called) repeatedly told Hunting: “It's not your fault” (oh, God, I have goosebumps at the mere thought of this scene). I could not care what happened to the characters. Many people cry about Hollywood characters that they don’t even belong to (think of “Titanic”; disgusting!) ... But it really made me cringe and want to leave the theater. I guess I just give up all these mental and emotional manipulations. <br /> <br /> People, it’s not me who is lenient ... these characters, and for no good reason, because they are unreal. Worse, nothing new or surprising. Even the character of Robin Williams is all stamped. <br /> <br /> I gave him 1 out of 10. This is probably not so bad; it's just pretty mediocre ... but so many people went to the other extreme and gave her 10, so I decided that a single balance wouldn't hurt.
