I enjoyed what Reynolds said to his lawyer: "Listen, I did a lot of stupid things in my life, but I never killed anyone." Obviously, he forgot about his career, which rolled down the slope after he began making stupid films, such as Cannonball. Initially it was assumed that “Physical Evidence” is a continuation of “The Jagged Edge”, from which Glen Close reasonably rejected. The sentence is passed, avoid material evidence.
