This is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. It seems that the three main actors did not succeed. The character of Giovanni Ribisi was rather annoying. For some reason, he seems to like to repeat what he says. If he were the "Rain Man", everything would be fine, but it is not. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
