World War I gets a glossy, sepia-colored make-up in Jean-Pierre Jonne's relentlessly quirky “Very Long Engagement”. Jeunet’s corporate identity consists of a mechanical, almost groovy, watch-like, narrative design, decorated with luxurious chocolate boxes and flavored with artificial humor. This is an approach that worked very well with his previous film, Amelie’s romantic fantasy, thanks in large part to Audrey Tatu’s inimitable contribution to the title role. In relation to a much darker material, the Zhonet method has rather unpleasant consequences. <br /> <br /> Tatu reappears here in variations of the same kind of sweet non-standard character as Amelie. She is Matilda, an orphan who lives quietly with her aunt and uncle in an idyllic countryside, deciding to track what happened to her daughter, beloved Manech (Gaspar Ulliel), several years after he went missing in a war. Manech was one of five soldiers, soldiers sentenced for self-destruction in 1917 in Bingo Krepuskule, and was sent to draw land as punishment. He is considered dead by all, except Matilda, who hopes to find him. The film is stubbornly searching for Matilda to find out what really happened, and how she delves deeper she reveals a sad, even shocking tale of high-level corruption and inhumanity. Matilda must filter the facts from the fictions that arise from various contradictory, partially coinciding or incomplete descriptions of what seems to be the last hours of Maneja. <br /> <br /> All of this should be sharp and exciting, but most often it is just confusing, thanks to the visual and verbal confusion with which Zhonet beats up his audience. There are too many things happening at any moment, including an obsessive story that adds absolutely nothing to our assessment of the story and the characters. Without a minute's respite from information overload, I felt that he did not have enough space to think about finding Matilda or being able to do it on my own terms. Jonet's continuously occupied chamber rotates in a circle, rolls in and out, caressing each surface contour of its elegantly designed production, but it is not able to penetrate the soul under the skin of history. The result is deeply uninteresting and, even worse, grotesque. World War I was a particularly dark hour in the history of mankind. Imagine it being recreated as one of those pictorial commercials for a famous Belgian lager, and you have the measure of this film.
