Terribly, in a completely new way, ANYTHING, BUT LOVE should probably be considered by movie lovers - at least as a precautionary measure that proves everything that can go wrong with “vain” production. I suppose that the vanity of the production, as there is no other reason on the green land of God, to play the role of a mediocre and not particularly attractive singer / actress like Isabel Gold in the lead role of the lady - for which more "spectators" like Cameron Bancroft and Andrew McCarthy - except that she also helped write this weird little movie. Her singing leaves much to be desired, and yet, oddly enough, all the other characters in the film think she is amazing. There are a few moments of true charm or humor, but very little. Otherwise, this is a stupid, sad fiasco, which moves from drawing by numbers to drawing by wrong numbers. You know how this happens when people look at a work of modern art, and someone says: “My child can do better than this!” Well, this is a film in which your (or someone else) child could do better.
