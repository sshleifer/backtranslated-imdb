After the American son of Indians, screaming with a bang, borders number one, the border guard Bruce Bennett (like Daniel Boone), at first glance, it seems that he wants to recoup; but he really wants to make friends with the natives. When the sad-eyed Indian leader Lon Cheney, Jr. (like the Black Fish) also loses his son number one, it becomes harder to sort out misunderstandings. Apparently, it was Republic Pictures' attempt to make for its “Daniel Boone, the Trail Blazer,” what Disney had done successfully with “Davey Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier” (1955). <br /> <br /> The ”Dan'l Boone song, whistled and sung by a group of children in a wagon, did not follow Fess Parker’s Davy Crockett before the Heath Parade. Singer Faron Young (as Faron Callaway) does not perform the title song (perhaps wisely); he sings "The Long Green Valley" and makes a good impression of a blond guy on Boone's daughter. But the Spanish actor Freddie Fernandez is the most valuable film player. In the cute scene, Mr. Fernandez reminds Mr. Young of the name of the character (“Susanna”) with whom he was supposed to fall in love. <br /> <br /> **** Daniel Bun, Trail Blazer (10 years old) / 5/56) Ismael Rodriguez ~ Bruce Bennett, Lon Cheney, Jr., Faron Young, Freddie Fernandez
