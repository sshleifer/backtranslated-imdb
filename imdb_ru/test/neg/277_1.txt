I watched this film, and it became all the more boring for me from a stupid conspiracy, which did not lead to anything, when suddenly the story takes a surrealistic turn for the worse, and the actor plays herself. Oh, how I grumbled. Because it's sooooo funny, isn't it? We know that Julia Roberts plays the character Tess, and here in the movie they joke that the character Tess is a bit like Julia Roberts. So Julia plays someone, imitating Julia. How well she does it, we will never know, because 99.999% of the audience actually do not know Julia Roberts personally (and reading about her in Hello magazine does not count). <br /> <br /> And then Bruce Willis appears! Apparently, he is Julia Roberts best friend. Well, he's in the movie ... how do I know if Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts know each other? I am not interested in the personal life of the actors at all - I just pay my money and expect them to do the work for which they are paid. In any case, they start joking about the plot in the film where Willis (rather unconvincingly) plays a psychiatrist ... the one with a small child ... do you know the one? I have not forgotten what it is called. Willis even adds a comment about how well this film was at the box office - how modest of you, Mr. Willis! <br /> <br /> The problem is that these scenes are not only meaningless, they also indulge themselves terribly, it also reminds us viewers that we are just watching a group of actors running around and receiving huge amounts of money for very small efforts. You see, when I watch a movie, I want to suspend disbelief and forget that I’m watching actors — I want to believe in the story I’m watching. When you start shooting the scenery in the middle of a movie, you just destroy the illusion for me. <br /> <br /> You know that the series skipped the shark when it starts to represent celebrities, playing themselves (get up and “The Simpsons, Friends, etc.”), but for the first time I see the movie “Jump from the Shark” . I usually avoid such films (for example, “Scary Movie”, “Naked Gun”, etc.). The problem is that I honestly never thought that Ocean's 11 films would go in that direction. What a disgrace. <br /> <br /> So, because of the suspension, unbelief is thrown out of the window, and the plot, which is now languishing in the film, then breaks through the most cruel joke of all the spectators - in fact, the robbery occurred even in history, and the last 90 minutes The film was meaningless. Yes, that's right: Stephen Sodervatsit and his friends-actors get up, point us at the audience and say: “Ha-ha-ha ... you were all ... thanks for your money!”. Then they give us the only salute with fingers. <br /> <br /> Well, again at you. I didn't really pay to watch this movie ... I downloaded the DVD for free. How do you like these apples? Now it's a plot twist.
