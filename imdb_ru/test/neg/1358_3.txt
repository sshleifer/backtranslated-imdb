From time to time an indie appears, with a terrific cast and a story that sounds really interesting and cannot be missed, but the film sucks. Recent films in this unfortunate category include Frivolity and Object Security, and now United States Lelanda. <br /> <br /> Among the wonderful actors are Ryan Gosling, Kevin Spacey, Don Cheadle, Jena Malone, Lena Olin, Michelle Williams, Chris Klein and Kerry Washington. Gosling is played by Leland P. Fitzgerald, a teenage son of a famous author (Spacey), who commits a terrible and unforgivable crime (killing a retarded child), but does not remember him and does not seem to have any motive. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle plays a teacher in the hall for minors who tries to understand Leland (and also exploit him by writing a book about him), and Jena Malone is his former girlfriend. We see their deteriorating relationship (due to her heroin addiction) in the memories. Sounds like an amazing little drama, huh? I thought so too. <br /> <br /> The fact is that this film is simply bad, poorly written. Dialogue and narration are painfully pretentious and loaded with annoying banalities about “life”, all the characters are two-dimensional indie clichés, and although he manages in some sense to draw sympathy from Leland, he obscures his crime. <br /> <br /> For the most part, there is no problem with acting. Gosling (who was Oscar-worthy in “The Believer”) is an extremely talented young actor, but, as they write, none of these characters (least of all Leland) even feel like real people, so he can do little, but muttering his funny lines and looking sad. <br /> <br /> Jena Malone is the most memorable. She has one of the most expressive faces I've ever seen. Even playing a characteristic role in such a bad movie, she can break your heart with one look. When she has good material to work with (as in Donnie Darko or The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys), she is truly amazing. <br /> <br /> But this is not very good stuff. Maybe after a large-scale correspondence this could be something worthwhile, but “United States Lelanda” is a heavy, inert film, and for a film that seems to be in love with how deep it is, it’s really shallow.
