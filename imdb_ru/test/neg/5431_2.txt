CONGO is probably the worst big-budget film of the 1990s. It is so bad that it can be observed again and again. A group of people with different plans penetrates deep into the darkest Africa, where they encounter a temple of wealth, as in ROYAL KING, Solomon, but with cannibal gorillas guarding these riches. On their side, people have a “talking” gorilla named Amy, who helps save the day at one time or another. So much for the plot. The dialogue is reckless everywhere, the acting behavior is almost equally brutal, certainly polite (Tim Kerry and Ernie Hudson are on hand to secure the ham factor), and the special effects are terrible. Wait until you see the cannibal gorillas. And lava! Oh yes, did I mention that there is a volcanic eruption to complete the big finale? Laura Linney of all people is preparing for this most successful trip. What could she think? It was just at the same time that she appeared with Richard Gere and Ed Norton in the PRIMAL FEAR film, which helped her guarantee her fame.
