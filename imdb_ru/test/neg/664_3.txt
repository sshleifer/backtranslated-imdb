Another movie with a star of wrestling. So far I have noticed ... wrestlers cannot act on the screen of the film. This film is no exception. <br /> <br /> The action is terrible. It makes you laugh at what they say, and they can't be serious, they try to act frightened, but they fail and look stupid. The game is terrible, perhaps from a bad director. <br /> <br /> The plot was stupid ... Some people just come to the hotel because they are criminals and they are accidentally killed. The film is dull to the end, making it one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only thought, and therefore, I give him 3, not 1, because Jacob Goodnight Polyus dies through his head and the stories of his fall were amazing. <br /> <br /> On the whole, this is a really awful movie, and you definitely shouldn't waste your time on it.
