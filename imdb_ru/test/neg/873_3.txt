* Warning: 1 tiny unimportant spoiler * You are right. These were not Madison County Bridges. As soon as the lonely woman and Richard Gere were settled in a large empty hotel, it was decided that something funny would happen. Question: how is this going to be? The answer is some stupid story about how to connect the dots that you shouldn’t see. In one supposed connection experience, they get drunk and clean the cupboard of old cans (this was my spoiler). And the next day they put them back. LOL It was not convincing at all. I am an old married woman, like the one in the film, and MY friendship is more interesting than her love affair with Richard Gere. Lol This had this advantage. You go and go, oh brother. .. even I could write something more believable than that. I think my life is not as boring as I thought, if I could laugh at the affair with Richard Gere. LOL! And this friend inherited this completely modern, probably computer mansion, half resting in the ocean, from its INNER MOTHER, who built it AFTER THE CIVIL WAR ??? Maybe her grandmother Oprah, and that was the WAY after the civil war? And yes, where was the email address? In what alternative universe do these people live? I never want to watch another movie that pretends we don’t have email, Facebook and text messages. And well, maybe these people have a terrible aversion to delivering news by telephone, but don't ask me to believe someone in this age of instant communication that someone just enters your life without calling first.
