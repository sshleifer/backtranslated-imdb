Another Indian legend that you have never heard of has been released. As the name suggests, this is a vengeful ghost who loves to absorb the skeletons of people while they still use them. As usual, ancient burial grounds (can you say, “Poltergeist?”) Were disturbed by the ingratiating greedy developers building things. <br /> <br /> CGI, if it were better, could have made the effect look more treacherous, but they save on a budget, and this shows a comic effect. The released creature probably had to remain out of the scene during his first few killings, which could add some mysterious or imminent atmosphere of death, but the inept director decided to show us in the first five minutes what it looked like and it was not impressive. Deaths are simply poorly made, again with crappy computer graphics. I assume that the ancient spirits always kill, using cheap special effects. As for the "victims", they look like they will laugh at any moment while they make silly screams. It is always clear who will receive it: a character appears with several lines, strange sounds are heard, CGI points are flying, the output character. Repeat (several times). <br /> <br /> However, there are a few monster chase scenes that actually made this thing watchable. Unfortunately, the director seems to use them as a device to which he can resort (therefore he is used too often) when he cannot come up with something else for his characters. Overall, this is pretty stupid, but I have seen worse. This film is cheap, but it’s funny to watch.
