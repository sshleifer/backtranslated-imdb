It was the worst movie I ever had to watch. 30 minutes in the film, and I couldn't take it anymore. Seriously, don't worry about it if you are not sentimental or one of those pseudo-artistic types who like this kind of pranks so they can feel more cultured. It's boring, although acting is fine; the baby is just annoying. Some scenes are a bit strange with very strange close-ups. I don't know why they shot the entire film in black and white, but whatever effect they had hoped for, they failed miserably. There was simply nothing to watch, and although it is a sad story, supposedly so stupid that it is difficult to feel sympathy for the characters.
