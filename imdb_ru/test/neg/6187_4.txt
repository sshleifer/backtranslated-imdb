This film is compared to the funny British comedy “Fish called Wanda”, although I don’t understand why. The only connection I can find is Monty Python (Eric Idle in "The Nuns", John Cleese and Michael Palin in the "Wanda"). Otherwise, they are not comparable. <br /> <br /> Slacker and Robbie Coltrane are two gangsters who want to go out of business before they die, so they decided to frustrate their boss and go to Rio. When the flight does not go as much as the nuns, they are forced to take refuge in a monastery. <br /> <br /> What first promises to be a rebellion will soon become a predictable, average film with ordinary tasteless sex jokes and a gentle humor. High points happen again, but neither the cast nor the team can inspire the hearing. Attempting to make a manic aftertaste like "Wanda" also fails, along with the effort of humor "people in drag", which is not surprising. When you think about it, men trying to be women are funny, men who try to be nuns are funny. <br /> <br /> Friday, April 22, 1994 - Video
