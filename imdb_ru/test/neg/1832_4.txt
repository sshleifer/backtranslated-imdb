1st watched 06.24.2007 - 4 out of 10 (Deer-Stefan Ruzowicki): OK, thriller, but too predictable. This story is based in Germany, where the film was also shot. We are talking about a young medical student who gets a chance to go to the premiere school in Heidelberg and arrives watching strange things happening. Someone whom she met there on the train and saved appears on the school experimental desk, and she will immediately suspect a dishonest game. She is conducting some kind of investigation, and the disappearance of her friend leads her into a secret society called AAA (and no, they are not Alcoholics Anonymous), which has something to do with the oath against Hippocrates and is used to conduct experiments on living people who the doctor did not I usually can't do this. She learns that her grandfather (who was the dean of the school) played a large role in its creation, and it is quite easy for the school members to fill it. This is an interesting story, but the problem with this film is how quickly the audience is told what is happening, and then it's a kind of horror film with a heroine fighting a bad guy from the group who takes things to a new psychotic level. Although this film was made in Europe, it plays for a young American audience with an emphasis on blood, sex, and the premise of a horror film (which is actually a great failure) and explains why he probably earned good money and spawned a sequel, Don't necessarily make a good movie.
