Some time ago I vowed never to shoot another Joe Castro movie (maybe after “Near Death”), but I happened to be with this movie because it was a release of Troma, and I did not carefully read the cover. Unfortunately. Well, I watched it, and it is by no means good, but it is, I think, something like "tongue in cheek" ... if it is not, then it seemed to be exactly like that. Some fearless guys from the University of Rio Grande decided to find out if Chupacabra exists, because of someone's Goat's camera recording from the camera, showing this strange thing, jumping over the field of view. And also because the man who was allegedly killed, was the uncle of the leader of the expedition. There are a couple of cameramen, one of whom whines all the time, and there is a certain former marine named "Army" (?!), Someone like an expert on ammunition or something like that. In any case, they found Chupacabra on some guy's ranch and decided to find him, contacting two alleged witches along the way. The creature itself looks rather ridiculous, with spikes on its back and a huge long tongue, for which Gene Simmons will die. In the end, after a handful of dead people, Chupacabra, too, and they take her to the university for an autopsy. So this is from another planet? Is this genetic work from some lab in Puerto Rico? Oh, they don't tell us, really. Not quite intriguing, but not entirely horrible. Definitely not a wide audience for this. 4 out of 10
