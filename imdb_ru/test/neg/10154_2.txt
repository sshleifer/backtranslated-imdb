my friend and I rented it a few nights ago. and, I have to say, this is the best movie I've ever seen. i mean, wow! "Dude, we better drink a little before this joint closes" and "dude, Linda no longer puts on her bra." what poetry! in! and this is such an amazingly original film too. I mean, you usually won't find a slasher movie where every kill is exactly the same. I mean for sure! now it's originality. and almost all the transitions between scenes are close-ups of psychos in ER scrubs. So cool! acting is so wonderful. Dad was just great. Must have studied real dads before filming. and how many films do you find that simply make no sense? Little. but this is one of those pearls. I mean, how great is that one guy was waiting outside for about six hours to play, and his friends were inside? it's really cool. In general, I would say that this is the only greatest film of the genre, no, in the world! *****
