Most likely, “Cleopatra 2525” will be of little interest if you have not watched the series during its broadcast; and I don't think so many people. But if you are still somewhat intrigued, this is the room “Buck Rogers in the 25th Century” without spaceships and no budget for wardrobe or design. <br /> <br /> In this case, the role of Buck Rogers (Cleopatra) is performed by Jennifer Sky. Which of them can be good, since Jennifer is very beautiful and quite talented; and has a good comedic touch. But a quick glance at the advertising material will show that it is somewhat worse due to poor haircuts and wardrobe from the rescue shop of the salvation army. If you remember how Jennifer was fascinated during her stay at Xena, her awesome Cleopatra look would be a huge disappointment. With a target audience of "teenage boys who want to burn their eyes, looking at" hot fetish girls ", you should not save on the operational value of your character or her costume. And they wonder why some TV shows do not. attract most of the audience. Like it or not, Buck Rogers had hotter costumes and much better looking guest stars. <br /> <br /> Two other elements of exploitation - two women Cleopatra, Hel (Gina Torres mainly plays her character "Firefly") and Sarj (Victoria Pratt - another connection with "Zena" - an extremely wooden version of Natasha Henstridge) . Torres copes with the role of Cleopatra, providing most of the comic relief of the show. <br /> <br /> Torres sings the title song, a somewhat lame parody of Rick Evans’s song “In 2525 (Exordium and Terminus)” (1969). Do you remember the one that opens with the words "In 2525, if a man is still alive, If a woman can survive, They can find ..." I suspect that they gave him he wrote her name so that they could cut out this memorable little song, although, who knows, perhaps the name is a tribute to "Buck Rogers", and they thought about using this song later. <br /> <br /> So, the premise of the show is that the surface of the Earth was invaded by aliens who were called Bailey (and not WKRP), and the people were underground. Our three heroines are fighting against Bailey under the leadership of the incorporeal (supposedly) female voice (respectively called the “Voice”). Unlike Buck Rogers, Cleopatra is a kind of stupid third puppet still dazed and confused from her cryogenic sleep or perhaps just disorientated hairstyles. There are a lot of good close-ups of Sky with wide eyes and bewilderment. Like “Buck Rogers”, the oath on the run is Cleopatra using the usual expression of the 21st century, and everyone finds it either completely deep or completely confusing. <br /> <br /> Unlike Firefly, the action is rather the over-edited Xena trash, which is neither realistic nor particularly interesting. One good trick is that the girls travel in the Spiderman fashion, a kind of cobweb, sifting through the tunnels and mines in the labyrinth of their underworld. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough (or, perhaps, without considering the budget), these are only half an hour of episodes, and, with the exception of one two-part show, there is not enough time for some subtleties and nuances. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
