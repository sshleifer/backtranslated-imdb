Well, I'm 26 years old, so I went through all the hype about the heroes of the 80s, and Chuck Norris along with Seagal, Van Damme and the rest of the guys were my childhood heroes, fought the bad guys, shot dozens of bullets from just one round ;) I saw an ad for this movie on TV a couple of days ago - Chuck Norris was throwing several ball lightning from his fingers. Wow “It’s a must-see shit movie!” I said. And indeed it is. Only much worse. It is very difficult to see the entire film - filled with religious thoughts, absurd zombie-like monsters that serve Satan, the whole idea of ​​the plot in some forgotten community representing all of humanity - this is a load of Christian fundamentalism wet dreams. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against Christianity, not even in the cinema, but this lacks taste, it lacks almost everything related to common sense, oh well, Chuck Norris plays ANGEL, whose job is to look after a small town where Satan lives?!?! The whole plot is so damn straight and boring, not to mention its stupidity (yes, this is no longer stupidity, we speak of stupidity as ... as a joke of a retarded child) to make a completely horrible film, shot, as far as I believe, for older very loyal to the catholic church, because young viewers laugh on almost every stage. Technically, this is wrong, the result is worse than what you saw in the beginning of the 90s in the series, the plot seems VERY stupid, the actors can be easily exchanged for cardboard stands, not to mention the music that, as far as I heard, was played on children’s toy piano. I have seen a lot of films, even the worst (from the bottom list of IMDb), such as “Cosmic Riots” or “Manos - hands of fate”, BUT, believe me, nothing can compare with this ridiculous, terrible, terrible acting quasi. a film in which I recall films about the jokes of some students, and not about serial production. Avoid this. Avoid this at all costs. There is nothing to laugh at. Chuck Norris officially ended his film career.
