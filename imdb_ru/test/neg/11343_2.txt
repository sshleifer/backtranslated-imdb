Ladies and gentlemen .. Sorry (or be happy!) .. We are in the abominable forensic series T.V-ERA !! Now count along with me and bring us luck: <br /> <br /> “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation”, “CSI: Miami”, “CSI: New York”, “NCIS”, “Crossing Jordan”, “ Da Vinci Inquiry ”,“ EVEN “Cosby Mysteries”! .. Didn't we already have enough? <br /> <br /> From the late 1990s to the late 2000s we have almost the same sickly series about a genius criminologist with a partner (or team) who is investigating crimes by carefully examining the autopsy ... and what an unpleasant mission. So you will surely have many, many repellent scenes where we are clear, but also we will see terribly the most horrific shots in the history of TV <br /> <br /> Oh, God ... Once we had wonderful days, a good cop (or detective) ERA, such as Colombo, Kodjak, Magnum and Simon and Simon. Or the good old science fiction era, for example, “Man for Six Million Dollars”, “Bionic Woman”, “Knight Rider.” And, oh God, we also have such hot and sexy things: cover, Love Boat, Baywatch, even failing as a Thunder in Paradise. <br /> <br /> It was all unforgettable, original, it was good. Real good thoughts, actions, women .. Until X FILES came ... And then it was the beginning of misfortune or, to be exact: Catastrophe! <br /> <br /> X Files Undoubtedly was one of the greatest, but there were several small flaws, we had agent Dana Scully (a doctor and an FBI agent) who did an autopsy in each episode ... and, of course , her knees (after successfully passing the series) became a part of our living room, so the Producers, thirsting for money, loved him with all the physical horror + exciting hunt for the truth. Therefore, they tried to repeat it in another, not too far classification: Forensic! <br /> <br /> But it has become as ugly, deformed, and very coarse as Bones. Plus the unsexed gift of Emily Deschanel and pale David Boreanaz (he was much better in the angel), and all those corpses .. To the extent that every time I watched it, I found myself screaming AAAAXXXXXX !! What a terrible gross !! .. <br /> <br /> Cancel it, please .. You canceled your actions before really good shows, such as (The Lone Shooter) or (A man named Hawk). Here it is bad .. So, please .. A little mercy and that's enough with ERA OF BONES !!! .. or we ourselves will die of nausea and monotony !!
