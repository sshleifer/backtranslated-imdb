I just just watched this movie just because of Sarah and I also give these 4 stars only because of her, on the other hand, this movie was one of the worst films I've ever seen. The action was terrible. The script was boring. It was a film that contradicted itself. The film was sloppy and unoriginal. not that I expected a good movie. Just something to give me a couple of jumps. It did not even do that. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the more I think about the general plot, the less meaning it has and the more holes we constantly find. It's really a shame, as I’m pretty sure that somewhere there was a good idea ... <br /> <br /> Maybe I’m a little harsh on 4/10, but considering the actors involved and again the obvious talent of the writer SARAH , this film really should have brought much more.
