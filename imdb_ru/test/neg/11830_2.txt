"My blue sky" is boring. The plot is tasteless; characteristics and dialogues stink; musical numbers, although sometimes put in interesting ways, are not only too often absurd, but also lyrically banal, painfully bright and emotionally full to the depths of the soul. Presenters, Betty Grable and Dan Daily, are attractive professionals; however, despite all their talented attempts to raise dull and unforgiving material, they fail. David Wayne and Jane Wyatt, despite all the talents they demonstrated in other projects, are more or less encrypted here. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is only one reason to watch “My blue skies”. One reason ... one star: Mitzi Gaynor, in her movie debut. Her total screen time is probably less than ten minutes, but so what? Her insightful and promising screen personality, her feline beauty and her exceptional charisma shine brightly and make these moments the most watchable, memorable and exciting moments throughout the film. If you appreciate the opportunity to see the incredible young talents on the rise, then look to Miss Mitzi Gaynor in My Blue Sky. <br /> <br /> By the way, I despise (and urge you to avoid) Drew Casper's obsessive-compulsive commentary on this film. Loud, disgusting, overly fastidious, often untimely to what is playing on the screen, and jumping around everywhere with an excess of nervous energy, his comments are absolutely not digested.
