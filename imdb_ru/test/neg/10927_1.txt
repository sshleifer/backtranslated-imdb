This conglomerate fails at every level, so it’s hard to decide what to say. It does not deserve a single line, and even less so ten, but in order to stick to the rules of IMDb, this is a question, and I probably won’t succeed the first time, and I’ll have to type a little more to compensate for this submission to be accepted. LOL <br /> <br /> If I had seen this nuts in the 70s, when I was passing through the mushroom phase, I would still consider it unimaginable and shallow. The most exciting shot for me was the long shot when the elevator door opened and closed. I was on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> One person here wrote that he met the creator of this mess, as if it was a red letter day in his life. One can only pray that something much more exciting happens in the life of these posters. Pull yourself together, amigo.
