"The Tempest" by Jack Bender is a screen version of Shakespeare's play "The Tempest". Bender transports the plot from medieval Italy to Mississippi during the American Civil War. It includes the problem of slavery and the role of revenge in wartime. <br /> <br /> Prospero, renamed Gideon Prosper, is not the Duke of Milan, but a landowner in Mississippi. He is studying voodoo magic from slave Mambo Azali. He saves her son Ariel, who thus accompanies him in his exile. The island is located not on the sea, but in a swamp near the banks of the Mississippi. There lives an alligator hunter, the so-called “Man-Gator,” who later tries to rape Prospero’s daughter Miranda. During the civil war, Ariel wants to join the troops of the Union to help in the fight against slavery. Prospero doesn't care about the war. He is interested only in his personal revenge on his brother Anthony. When Antony and his accountant, Willy Gonzo (Gonzalo), try to cross the river, Prospero raises a storm. Union soldier Frederick is lost in the swamp and finally comes to the island. He and Miranda fall in love with each other, but Prospero will not accept this. Meanwhile, Ariel, turned into a crow by Prospero, learns that Anthony pretended to be an ally of the Union, but plans to betray them. Anthony and Gonzo meet Gator Man in the swamp and conspire with him against Prospero. They kidnap Miranda and Ariel, but Prospero freezes them and helps the Union defeat the southern army. In the end, Ariel is released, Friedrich and Miranda must get married, Prospero returns to the plantation, and Gator-Maine returns to the island. <br /> <br /> Peter Fonda introduces Gideon Prosper powerfully and convincingly, while Anthony’s character remains fairly flat. It was not a bad idea to execute the Storm against the backdrop of a civil war, but perhaps the director took too much risk. In some parts, the story seems built or comical. Gator Man for example just appears without any explanation. The fact that he needs to be kidnapped to remember Prospero, and that he is losing confidence in his strength, shows that Bender tried to make Prospero more human, but only made him a weak old man without his magic. Prospero’s initial authority and wisdom is not clear. <br /> <br /> ------------- End of the first part --------------- ----------- -
