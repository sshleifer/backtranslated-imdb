“The Lonely Pigeon” is my favorite Western second after the “Seekers” with John Wayne. I watch “The Lonely Pigeon” about every 6 months and I never get tired of it. I read all the LD books, although I cannot remember much about the Comanche Moon. I also looked forward to this mini-series and decided to record it on our DVR so that we can quickly move on to advertising. Unfortunately, I messed up and did not record the first part, but decided to look at the other parts and try to pick it up. <br /> <br /> There is no one who could ever compete with Robert Duval or Tommy Lee Jones, and I expected to be disappointed and I was. <br /> <br /> Although there were a lot of things that didn’t ring true, the most obvious to me was that Nell died the day before, and Gus was on the distance, it switched to what Clara wrote him a letter from Nebraska, who said she was sorry to hear about her death. How could she have known the way out of Nebraska the next day? In addition, it should have happened 7 years after her departure, and her children looked about 6-7 years old, maybe a little younger, but even more time passed before they actually moved to the Lonely Pigeon, and in the Lonely Pigeon they had been there for about 10 years or longer before they left for Montana. When they stopped at Clara in Nebraska, which probably took another 6 months, the girls looked about 10-13, as they played in the yard like little children. Math just doesn't add up. <br /> <br /> I agree that the man who played Gus had a lot of his manners and was a bit like Gus, maybe he looked like a young man. <br /> <br /> I'm also a little confused by one thing. The white captive they brought back — was she the one they captured when they raided Austin? They said that she was captured 25 years ago, but if she was captured in Austin, it was only 7 years later that happened in the film. Was she caught earlier? I remember seeing a captive girl after they raided the city, and I don’t know if she’s the same one. If someone can explain, since I missed Part 1. If it were 25 years old, she probably would have been more than 40 years old when they found her, because she looked like an adult lying on the ground. In addition, the way they ravaged her when she was captured is hard to believe that she would live to get married and have Indian children. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that there is nothing worse than John Voight, who plays Coll in the sequel to Lone Pigeon or Lorena’s incredible marriage to the Pie Eye in the continuation of McMurty with Lonely Pigeon, which was never explained. In addition, the way he killed Triton was, as I heard, despite the fact that they continued on with John Voight without his approval. <br /> <br /> If anyone can resolve these discrepancies, I would appreciate it.
