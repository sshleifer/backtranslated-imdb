I hate weapons and never killed anyone, but when even half of the events taking place in the Shuttle happen to you or loved ones, and you find a weapon, you shoot the attacker. THREE TIMES. FIVE TIMES. Everything that makes the pulse stop at them and intensify at you. I think even God would say, "Good call." In a movie like "Hostel", but more realistic? how can this really happen to anyone, well, if you are a pretty young woman, that is ?? Shuttle was a good movie, albeit on the long side. A few good shocks (always call AAA, even just to change the tire), basically this is just one surprise, but for the most part you can see that everything goes ahead. And besides the typical “tie him” instead of the previously mentioned shooting at him, the most annoying part was the revelation of the approach of one best friend to another. Passing by them, it's nice for what it is. In fact, we have two unsuspecting women who travel alone from home in Mexico (wow, this is original), and one lost her luggage, preventing them from leaving the airport until late. And after the obvious foreshadowed sign language scene, they enter into a “too good to be true” trip on the shuttle at half price. Josh Klished, previously presented, set off on the shuttle to join what looks like Alan Ruka's double from Speed. From here it is obvious what is happening (I mentioned that it was a “Hostel”), but I still did not find too much horrible, but nothing special. Although it would help the audience with about 15-20 minutes removal, I would recommend if you have almost 2 hours to kill and experience terrible horror.
