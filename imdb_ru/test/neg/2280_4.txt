This is the first recorded attempt to deliver sound with the film, and the oldest, which obviously still exists. This historical fragment of the film is the introductory episode on the DVD “More Treasures of Natural Archives”. <br /> <br /> This is just a 15-second clip of a man playing the violin in front of a huge recording cylinder. Two men dance next to him. Towards the end, another man walks on the scene. William Dickson, the director of this experiment, is a violinist. This "film" had several titles over the years, but the sound experiment was not really successful. From this point on, more than 30 years have passed to synchronize vision and sound so that something can be given out to the public for entertainment. Nevertheless, it was the beginning, no matter how primitive it happened. <br /> <br /> Further technical information and a history of this film process can be found in another review of "Boba Fett1138".
