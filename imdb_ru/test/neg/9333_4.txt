“Solomon and Sheba” is the film that you just needed to watch and see as early as the late 50s when I was a child: a biblical epic performance with famous performers, unusual costumes, many additions and combat episodes. So, I went to see it; but I remember that at that time “Solomon and Sheva” made no impression on me, which was strange, because I really liked “Ten Commandments”, “Quo Vadis”, “Elena Troyanskaya” and others. The fact is that when you are a child, you ignore things in photos that adults do not (for example, a bad game), and it is easier for you to please the soldiers in their armor, battles, sword fights and battle, so if you are not impressed , then something is wrong with the product of this genre. <br /> <br /> This film, although it has some of these features, is definitely standard and medium. Yul Brynner’s wooden representation in the role of the Jewish king doesn’t even light up when voluptuous and half-naked Gina Lollobrigida dances defiantly around him. It is better and has an acceptable effect. George Sanders is not interested in what he is doing, and Marisa Pavan (Pierre Angeli's twin sister) does not at all consider this a kind of Brynner's conscience. <br /> <br /> The last sword duel between Brynner and Sanders is just because of the plot, he lacks interest and tension (he had to be shot, that's all). <br /> <br /> The unfortunate farewell to director King Widor, Solomon and Sheba will probably be remembered as the last unfinished Tai Power picture.
