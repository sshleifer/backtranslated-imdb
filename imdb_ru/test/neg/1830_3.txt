Finally got to see this movie last weekend. What a disappointment ... it barely reaches the level "made for television". Given the cast list, I would expect something significantly more complex. There is no good story in the film, well, in fact, any story to that effect. It has no credibility, instead a lot of predictability. Save yourself time and money.
