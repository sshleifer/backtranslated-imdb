It is a disaster film in both meanings of the word. Every character, every role, every conversation, every turn, everything in this film stinks a great time. It's a shame to see Dennis Hopper's talent disappear in this horrible movie. I can give you hundreds of examples, but see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Or rather: no.
