The premise of this film is ugghhhh. The guy is married, but everyone on this site seems to think: "Yes, this is a funny, cute and good movie." What the hell?!?! What is so funny about immature girls committing adultery with a married man and a new child? What good is he cheating on his wife? What is wrong with finding teenage boys for sex before they go to college? Nooo, this is not good enough, the guy should be married, outside, outside the market, this is what we should have. Stupid girls! Then one of the girls decides that she "loves" the guy. No, she just "loves" what he makes her feel. Two girls have fun with it, they think it's funny, and no one seems to have any moral problems with what they do. It's just shameless, but yes, it's all good with everyone on this site. The dark-haired girl even has the courage to have her dad take her out of the guys house under the nanny trick. This is a morally disgusting film, and where is the wife? Poor woman working and paying bills while he screws up the babysitter.
