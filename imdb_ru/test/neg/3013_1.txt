this show just sucks. I do not think that I even need to say this or why, because, judging by the number of comments, I simply repeat everything. Keys to vip - it's like to turn on the TV and make him throw a poop at you. that's exactly what it looks like, i'm not even exaggerating a bit. these guys are so stupid, not funny and not smooth with ladies, that it is not even funny, because it is stupid. I spent four episodes and want two hours ago. where they find participants, because they have clearly insufficient mental potential. if I were the person who came up with this idea for the show and put it on television, I would have done the world a favor and jumped off the highest building I could find. How does such garbage get on TV? especially the comedy network, shouldn't the show on the comedy network be, at least, a comedy show or maybe so funny?
