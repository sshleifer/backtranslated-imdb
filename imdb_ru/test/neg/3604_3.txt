I really liked the film “The Emperor's New Groove,” but watching it was like going back home and seeing how your wife had a “relationship” with a lama. Seriously, this movie was bad. It's like Club Dread after Super Troopers. I have to write 10 lines, but I don't even know what else to say. I laughed a couple of times, but only because I drank. Such a film should be at least funny when you're drunk. Did not have. Maybe lamas are just ridiculous, but ordinary cartoons are not. In any case, just stick to The New Empover Groove if you want a funny, animated film on the theme of llama. Line 10 is this line right here.
