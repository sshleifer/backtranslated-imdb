Don't get me wrong, I love the Gentlemen League series. It was funny, perverted and completely inspired. I was looking forward to the movie, the package was interesting, and I was looking forward to see what they did to the characters and where their strange storyline would lead them. <br /> <br /> This was a complete disappointment for the beginners. The three weakest characters in the series were leading, and it contained only bit parts for other characters (why not choose Mickey and Pauline, Papa Lazaro or tubs and Edward as the main parts!?). Everywhere it was not funny, half-baked jokes and bad humor. <br /> <br /> This decisive moment was a simple funny drama / comedy of the period (and I will use the word comedy fluently). He was distracted from the main storyline and felt uncomfortable, not to mention being painfully unfunny. The direction of the film is terrible, and it often seems that the characters play the strings in one take. Very hurried. <br /> <br /> Then - the three-headed monster clay. What the hell was all this? just ridiculous, it seemed to me that the League of Gentlemen marked them at the end. <br /> <br /> In general, I found myself looking at my watch and sighing with disappointment throughout the entire film experience. What once was a terrific television series was spoiled by a horribly unfunny movie. <br /> <br /> If I could give 0 out of 10, I would. Do not waste your money on this.
