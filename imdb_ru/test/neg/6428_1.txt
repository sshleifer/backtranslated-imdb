Well, it was a complete waste of celluloid. The preview was promising, but after watching the movie, it looked like the preview * was * the entire movie. No plot, no clear storyline, just some kind of inappropriate expectation. It seems that the director tried very hard to create an atmosphere of mysticism and fear, but there are still gaps that need to be filled. Why drugs? Why is the number 11.11? (By the way, when Sarah enters the library, the clock shows 11.14) What does this murder have to do with parents? What is the role of this woman Ryden? Is she one of the children or not? Who are these kids anyway. There is a lot of material lying around to create a final cult film like “Omen”, but the director simply leaves them on the floor without going into the story. Even the "Blairwich project" was more scary than this. All the gaps that you hope to fill, as in the “Butterfly Effect”, remain open as loans start to roll .. OK. Off to the next movie ...
