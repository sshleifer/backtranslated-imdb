I assumed that I was really expecting a Bollywood remake of "The Fog" from the title, but this is actually a more Bollywood remake of "I know what you did last summer," with some elements of "Scream", sort of, not very good either . Apart from a couple of very entertaining songs and dance numbers, this is pretty awful. He obviously has a decent budget, and yet he spends on the heated leftovers, which were not so tasty from the start. A creepy guy threatens a young woman not to participate in a beauty contest, because he wants his sister to win (she, fortunately, doesn't look as creepy as her brother), but she still comes in and wins, and, of course, Creepy follows her, and they kill him, after which the incendiary game “Hide the Body” enters. Of course, the body disappears, and no one seems to know why, but someone knows, and they are waiting for the end to reveal the ridiculous turn of the plot. With this weary paraphrasing, several elegant dance numbers alternate, especially the festive dance number at a party for Simran, the girl who won the beauty contest ... it is very colorful, well done and totally fun, and completely useless in this awful movie. I would prefer to see the old film of the Ramsay brothers than this piece of shit, although someone thought that they should not be made accessible, for the most part, which in itself is a crime. But not such a big crime as this movie. I took one for the team overseeing this, so take my advice, don't worry. 2 out of 10.
