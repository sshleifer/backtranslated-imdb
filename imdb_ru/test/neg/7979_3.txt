It was my very first film, Bollywood, and I found it in the same way as many other recent viewers, through The World of Ghosts. After I got a little familiar with the Bollywood film industry this week, I understand to some extent why there are seemingly unrelated musical numbers, as well as romance and comedy, in the horror film. But “Something for Everyone” does not always constitute a single whole. <br /> <br /> Jaan Pehechaan Ho’s ultra-cool music dance number has conquered the world in a way that he probably couldn’t do. in 1965. Now all over the Internet, and many are trying to find a good English translation. Laxmi Chhaya does an amazing dance job in turn, making it all fresh, new and fun, even when any normal person is exhausted! She rules! <br /> <br /> On the beach with Miss Kitty, light fun and a pleasant tune in complete contrast with the plot of horror. However, I sing in Hindi a week later. I found an approximate translation: <br /> <br /> if you want to live in this life, then listen to what I say, leave your sorrows behind and join the party, accept my advice <br /> <br /> of those who wants to live with laughter and singing, bring hair and relax people of this world, what do you know? come to me and I will explain. <br /> <br /> Whoever is there, who sees me, he will stop worrying in this world. Fish swims freely here and there. <br /> <br /> My second favorite issue in the movie Butler's Dream, where Mehmood is fascinated by Miss Kitty's dances. Electric tiki-like idols are just as sticky as the whole set of this number. On the Internet, I have seen how it is described as what happens if "Liberace vomit" !! Very funny. <br /> <br /> Gumnaam is not a very good movie in general. That's why I gave him a rating of 3. This is actually a really nasty movie with funny, kitschy musical numbers that have nothing to do with the plot of the murder.
