The best thing I can say about the Quintet is that it is not as bad as I remembered when I was on the first viewing. <br /> <br /> But this does not mean that it is good. <br /> <br /> This strange, sci-fi thriller is not exactly like any other film I've ever seen, which, I think, at least makes it new. But this is a border catastrophe in the film, and one of the worst that Robert Altman ever shot. On the DVD, the feature about the creation of Quintet is clear that even Altman did not know what the hell was supposed to be a film. <br /> <br /> It is set in the distant future, when the world is in the grip of another ice age. The film was shot at an abandoned Montreal Expo '67 venue, and I have to admit that it gives the film some interesting elements of production design, even if most of it looks like it was being shot in an icy mall. Paul Newman, looking exhausted and totally uninterested in everything that is happening around him, and Bridget Fossey, play strollers who roam this futuristic city in search of Newman's brother. Soon, Newman finds himself drawn into the deadly game Quintet, which all bored residents play because of the lack of something better, and the rules of the game are never explained to the audience. All we know is that the goal of the game is to kill everyone you play with and remain the only living person. This gives these nihilistic inhabitants their only thrill, because, as one of them said, at some point a psychological-biblical monologue, only by being near death one can appreciate life. <br /> <br /> The film is slow, ugly and actually uncomfortable to watch due to its inexorable gloom. It seems that Altman deliberately shoots a film that no one wants to watch. There are no characters here - oh, of course, the actors walk on speeches, but none of these lines matters much, and the impressive list of international actors Altman has compiled for this roster is no less. Only Bibi Andersson gives the closest to an unforgettable performance that can be found in such a film. But, nevertheless, he manages to create an atmosphere, even if this atmosphere is simply terrible, and it is strangely fascinating, because it would be fascinating to watch a person slowly starve to death. <br /> <br /> After almost a decade of excellent films, Altman really lost his composure. The “quintet” followed the cruel “Wedding”, followed by not bad, but mostly easily forgotten “The Perfect Couple”, terrible “health” (which I have never seen). saw, because it is nowhere available to see) and the disastrous "papay". Thank God, he recovered. <br /> <br /> Rating: D-
