This movie is incredible. Read other reviews to see why. <br /> <br /> I would say that most of the characters were plastic, but they could not even afford such a small luxury; they just act like cardboard cutouts. Of course, they needed to attract real surfers to participate in competitive surfing competitions, so this is shit, can they act. At least, Oxy didn't give a shit and just went with him. But "Lance" ??? Fuhgeddaboutit. <br /> <br /> Hero Lopez portrayed one character who sounded believable, but in fact he was largely himself. He is quite used to stomping people. :-) The only reason I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 was because I posted the newsletter on my laptop when it appeared on some cable channel late at night. This saved me from having to pay all the attention to this stupid little waste of time. I would never watch it.
