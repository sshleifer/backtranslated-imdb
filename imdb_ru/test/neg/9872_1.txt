True, when the opportunity arose to see this horribly infamous legend about the film, my expectations were rather low. They were not low enough. Sholkmaster Roger Korman somehow took possession of the rights to create Marvel comic characters sometime in the late 80s or early 90s and transferred them to Olea Sasson, whose directorial work was mainly in television series like Hercules and ' Viper '. With an estimated total budget of $ 1.5 million, it was shot, filmed and briefly released on video, and then sent to the wasteland of a forgotten film. There it was supposed to stay. However, like a banana peel in a vaudeville act, this “Fantastic Four” is on the air, waiting to cause an accident for those rare people who are unlucky and foolish enough to step on it. <br /> <br /> If you have ever heard of these comic book characters, you know what to expect. The people who did this were very faithful to the source material, and this is the only thing for which they deserve all the praise for this fiasco. This represents the origin of the heroic group that develops superhuman forces when the defense on their experimental spacecraft cannot protect them from cosmic radiation. Reed Richards (Alex Hyde-White) develops the ability to stretch his body and becomes Mr. Fantastic. " His girlfriend Sue Storm (Rebecca Staab) can become invisible, and her brother Johnny (Jay Underwood) can spontaneously cause fire from his body. Finally, Ben Grimm (“credited” to both Michael Bailey-Smith and Carl Chiafarlio) gets superhuman strength when his skin mutates into a stone-like guide, and is then referred to as the Thing. There is a prologue in which former classmate Reed Victor von Doom (Joseph Culp) becomes their enemy, Dr. Doom, who organizes the sabotage of the space flight of the Fantastic Four as an act of revenge for injuries that he accuses of Reed and, ultimately, the struggle for climate. There are other details in a poorly written script, but they are minor. <br /> <br /> This film, which was made simply because the creators (I use it in the technical sense of the word. there is a lot of creative imagination.) had legal rights to it. The plot will undoubtedly be reflected in the expected release of a large budget that should be sent by Tim Storey in 2005, but the solution of such a large-scale project on special effects without a comparable budget or qualified actors qualifies as an act of cinematic madness. There are special effects, mostly hand-drawn, or simple camera stunts that have existed since the initial “Great Train Robbery”. When half the climax battle returns to full hand animation, you almost feel relieved when you watch a cartoon instead of poor actors who have been cursed to participate in this project. There is also very little consistency in style in this mess. Most of the scenes are either flat in accessible light, or in wild primary colors, and the only ones dressed in scenery are obvious science fiction works. There is camera work, but basically it’s just the concentration of characters on the screen and the minimal information that comes into the audience. Editing includes leaving in additional lines and using obvious wipes (at some point there is even a transition using the center of the number 4). Spin editing is even used to supplement bad special effects when transforming The Thing. The only scene in which the morph technology was used was shocking only because it was such a positive leap in quality. <br /> <br /> Limited camera operation is not unforgivable. In "Clerks" only the most basic movements of the camera are used, but almost no style. It worked for this film because it was about people who didn't have style, and it was consistent. Kevin Smith never allowed his reach to exceed his grip. The Blair Witch Project made some viewers suffer from motion sickness from the grumpy tame things that connected this pseudo-documentary film. When everything was said and done, it was an effective job about the fear of being lost and absorbed in a frightening situation. There is no sense of a story or topic here, either verbally or visually. With this Fantastic Four, you will never get anything but casual laughter over the fact that the filmmakers and performers seem to be actually trying to compete with other comic films with this poorly funded recording. <br /> <br /> Any film requires a lot of time and work. Just so sad that so much has been invested in such a project. If you are one of those who have been associated with this, then, most likely, this was done as a step on the way (hopefully, improved) of a career in the cinema. Everyone knows how to get a job to make the most of opportunities. For those who are interested in watching this film, I advise you to do it only with a group of friends (so that you can point out everything and say: “You also watched it”), who were warned about this experience (so that no one was hurt by shock), and Perhaps you can come up with a drink to ease the pain between casual laughter. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
