This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Several years have passed since I saw him, and since then nothing has come close, and I doubt that a film will ever be made that will be as bad as this one. He tries to laugh at a lot of different films, for example, “Nell” (!), But instead of ridiculous it’s just a pity. Whatever you do, do not rent or this garbage, and if someone throws it at you ... turn around and run the other way !!
