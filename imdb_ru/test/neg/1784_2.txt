If this film were made two years earlier, it could have been much better. But, unfortunately, this was done during the decade, in which there was no idea how the horror film should look or act. When I first heard about this film, people on IMDb classified it as a continuation of the camp of fans. Oh, how wrong they were. Yes, Betty Russell was in this, but Uma Thurman was not exactly. I really would like to find the person who started this whole rumor. I'm sure many of us will, though. I'm not going to give anything, because, frankly, I do not remember how this film will end! Iâ€™ll just tell you to watch a real horror movie in camp ... Burning with Jason Alexander, Fisher Stevens, Holly Hunter and a fan from Fast Times in Ridgemont High. Word for the wise - The fact that the horror film has the word "camp" in the title does not mean that it is worth seeing. Oh, and one more thing, ANY HORRIBLE Flick MADE IN EARLY TO THE MID-90S, WAS EVER REVIEWED EVEN REMOTELY GOOD
