There are many flaws in this fake documentary film, it is poorly made, there are uninteresting characters in it, but the biggest problem I encountered is the main premise. <br /> <br /> This film uses the idea that NP Lovecraft traveled in Italy, and some of his works are based on real supernatural events that he witnessed. Iâ€™m willing to accept the fact that he traveled around Italy (only to suspend disbelief), but that some of his works are based on reality, and the existence of Insmouth is complete nonsense. <br /> <br /> In general, Lovecraft did not believe in the supernatural, in his letters he clearly states that he considers himself a mechanistic materialist, his monsters, where it can be shown that people are not so special. Another myth used in this film is that Lovecraft was an expert on the occult, he was not; all of his knowledge on this subject was obtained from the most basic sources. <br /> <br /> So we end the movie about people shouting at each other a lot, and when we finally see the monster, it's so bad that you can't even laugh at it, you just feel the pain in your love to horror. <br /> <br /> After watching the Frankenstein Lovecraft movie, he said he felt sorry for Mary Shelley because he felt that her work was killed. I'm sorry for Lovecraft.
