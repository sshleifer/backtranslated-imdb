Taylor Dimer, Mrs. Drake, English 10 PIB B4, March 31, 2010 <br /> <br /> Snapshot in darkness <br /> <br /> It’s hard to do in the Heart of Darkness movie because it’s incredibly uninteresting The book on which this film is based has little action from the start. So the thought of turning it into a film in any case seems like a completely different idea, basically guaranteeing failure. <br /> <br /> A large part of the book is devoted to the mental journey of a young sailor named Marlowe to work in many of the dark Congo and people in general. It seems to me that the screenwriter failed to capture the essence of Marlow's travels. It completely missed the biggest challenge of light against darkness. This is the main thing in the book, and when it does not translate into a film, all that remains is 100 minutes of boredom and monotony. <br /> <br /> In this case, the question is raised, why would someone turn it into a movie? Then an even better question may be asked: who wants to see it? It is very hard work to watch. If this did not affect the grade in my class of English, I would never have thought to watch a movie. I never recommend this movie to anyone. The heart of Darkness is devoid of all its insight and meaning when taken from the pages of the book. A novel is a torture to read to the last twenty pages or so, but the afterthought is that it’s a pretty decent book. The film is like a shot in the dark, and there is no chance in the world of hitting a target. <br /> <br /> How can you portray a book about mental processes and realizations of darkness in a physical, visual sense? I feel it is impossible to accurately show thoughts. In addition, I feel that the time difference between the book and the film creates major points that do not seem to add up at all. The novel Heart of Darkness was published in 1902, and the film Heart of Darkness in 1993. 91 year between these two events may be the cause of the appearance of seemingly different localities. The novella seems to have much more severe conditions, and the film does not reflect the prehistoric feeling of the Congo. Congo in the film just seems to be a different place, and not a dark, inhuman place in which the book draws this setting. I feel that this removes another important element that really contributes to the novel. <br /> <br /> The film lacks two main aspects of the plot - a bit of decency, which is described in the book "Heart of Darkness". gone away When the argument between light and dark is the biggest topic, if you do not include it in the film, it seems that the whole film will be incredibly pointless - and it is. It is boring, uninteresting and a big waste of time. There is no reason to watch this. The book is devoid of any value that it has. If necessary, for some reason, read the book. Avoid the movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> Cast and credits Marlow: Tim Roth Kurtz: John Malkovich Russian: Morten Faldaas Purpose: Phoebe Nichols <br /> <br /> Director: Nicolas Roag Screenwriter Benedict Fitzgerald, based on the novel by Joseph Conrad Duration: 100 minutes Nominal PG 13 (some sexuality and language)
