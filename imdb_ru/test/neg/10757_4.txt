Not to mention how it ended, suffice it to say that all this degenerates in about five minutes before the end. If the standard were maintained everywhere, the film would be worth seven. <br /> <br /> I wonder why a woman was added to the cast? (Well, not really!) A good premise. The situation in which the victims find themselves is quite terrible, and it is quite well done, but you get the impression that the filmmakers lost interest towards the end or, as the previous participant said, they changed the authors and passed on to someone else.
