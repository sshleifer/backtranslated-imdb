Well, guys, this is another stereotypical portrait of gay life, however, an additional drawback includes a bad game, a terrible scenario, a lack of budget, a terrible sound and let's not forget the impossible storyline. <br /> <br /> Now Christmas is a novelty The city of York and our story immediately "focus" on two male people, apparently for some time lovers. One of them did not let his parents (right wing, religious fanatics) understand that he was gay (adding to the imprudence of the story, because this guy is just as outstanding as the gay people today), and his parents come to see him. They will stay in his New York apartment, where he and his lover have just decorated Christmas. <br /> <br /> The story continues to evolve due to the arrival of parents who still don’t like anybody and - as soon as through obvious and predictable ways - they come to find out that their son is gay. Tears spilled, as was my interest in this film. <br /> <br /> The cast of characters seemed like an introductory course in a local community theater. The lovers in this film do not match, and there seems to be no unity with their union. <br /> <br /> The landlord is flat and her attempts to be humanistic in this situation are unhappy and, of course, did not help to budge. continue the plot. <br /> <br /> A friend of dragons, who at his “right time” walks to help one of the lovers, is stereotyped and gives notoriety to the unique art of dragging. <br /> <br /> Although some guys at night discover that one of the lovers has a beautiful body (again, stereotyped images), this story will not help. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this film, especially if you think about it. purchase. You will shoot if you do!
