I thought I could see something good, but ... I was tired after watching this movie, I don’t know what I hated most: script, acting, fx or music. Try to imagine the worst episode of the Power Rangers and still be kind. I have seen the best FX in FPS games (the touch of a bone sword or his breath that makes people disappear in green smoke is the touch of a genius), and the music seems to come from a spaghetti western. I really liked how women screamed in the car when a “monster” was walking around her (even if she was looking in the wrong direction). So give yourself a break and don’t watch it, at least call someone to watch a horror movie with you, believe me, you will end up playing a monopoly on some blows.
