In the only act of common sense they ever did, the NSW Film and Television Office refused to finance this film. The producers raised a smelly mood and in a bright advertisement transferred their products to Victoria. In addition to the lost work of technicians, NSW was lucky that they were not involved ... <br /> <br /> The film fails at almost all levels. Postmodernism fails, casting fails (what is the character of Rose Byrne? What kind of vile nasty jerk did Hugo's channel? In fact, the story goes more like a prolonged prelude, not like a storyline. <br /> <br /> Maybe , there would be a chance if the “pop culture meets depression” style was better thought out and performed. If the casting were more bizarre, if the style was less serious ... if everything was different. <br /> < br /> Besides the usual perfection in costumes, design and cinematography (as in most Australian ilm), the film is just a mistake. <br /> <br /> With a stated budget in excess of $ 7 million, “The Tender Hook” is a symptom of the ailment of the Australian film industry — the wrong people and the wrong projects are funded. Compare this mess with " Noise "(less than 2 million. Dollars) or Cedar Boys (less than 1 million. Dollars), and you will understand how to do it. Hard, interesting films are fighting for funding, and flabby, bloated projects with the roles of names get their money. <br /> <br /> Donors who have invested in this deserve the same path as Hugo Weaving’s character at the end of the film.
