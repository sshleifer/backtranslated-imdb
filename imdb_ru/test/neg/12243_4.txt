This film is a comedy about nonsense / parody, in the form of “Airplane” or “Naked Gun”, but it doesn’t even come close to these two, because it lacks originality and slightly smarter jokes, and not just old light jokes. <br /> <br /> You can find some references to other films, I identified Dodgeball and Rocky from my head, so you can have fun trying to figure out which films are Fake. <br /> <br /> In a movie, you can laugh from time to time, but there’s nothing that could hurt you, so there’s nothing funny about it. <br /> <br /> I liked the character of the iPod in a sense (even though some of the jokes with it are standard comedy 101). <br /> <br /> I think this movie (and, like most nonsense / cheating comedies) depends on the mood you are in, so if you think you will laugh at any joke, watch this movie . If you are in a serious mood, forget about this (re) viewing of "Airplane", it will definitely make you laugh
