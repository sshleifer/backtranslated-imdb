... if only Disney stayed away from it. See, I think this film has some potential. Well, at least the situation of the protagonist. Take away the whole story of Jordan Cahill, and you have the beginning of a worthy movie! Of course, you also lose more than half the film, but oh well. Not such a big loss. <br /> <br /> So, here it is: you take a typical, neat, suburban teenage girl (Danielle Panabaker, who is actually a decent actress), whose best friends shout a lot, mostly for "Pop Sensation" ( I guess this is a direct quotation from a film; a film like this almost always includes this particular phrase) named Jordan Cahill. Except, of course, TPSTG wants more from life. Enter the character of Brenda Song, a sophisticated person who is exactly what TPSTG needs (honestly, I don’t care what the character’s real name is, I prefer the abbreviation). Two new friends go to Jordan Cahill (one is drooling, the other is making fun of drool), and they come out of it with their mobile phone. Jokes are coming, and in the end everything turns out well. <br /> <br /> If only Disney or any other large film studio in this regard had such a low opinion of 8-14-year-olds. Or, maybe, if from 8 to 14 years old expect a little more from films aimed at them. This shit is covered with sugar, like this, which makes me more than unsure of who is more disgusting (I recall a little movie called “High School Musical” ...)
