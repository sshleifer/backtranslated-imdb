I guess my biggest mistake was watching this remake of the 95th Piranha side by side with the original Joe Dante of the 78th year. I did the same thing last week with Omen. It is curious that viewing the remake immediately after the original of the 76th year made me evaluate the 2006 version differently. <br /> <br /> But this approach made itself felt in the 95th version of Piranha. This reinforced the fact that it is indeed a smaller picture. In fact, the 95th version is more or less exactly the same film, since it tells the same story and follows it almost sporadically (only the character Barabara Steele and military intervention were written from it). But the cinema was not so good. The game was even worse. Especially Alexandra Paul (playing the role of Heather Menzies) again showed me what a terrible actress she is. Bradford Dillman (from version 78) had his own way of life of Charlton Heston, which was funny, while in version 95 William Catt copes with the role of William Catt. So I didn't mind him, really. But the whole cast is largely inferior, and the only worthwhile event was the appearance of James Karen (“The Return of the Living Dead”, parts 1 and 2) in a cameo. The effects of John Karl Buchler’s make-up are not as neat as Rob Bottin’s. The musical score had some sort of sound, but the Pinot Donajo score was much more memorable in the original. Thus, all these flaws actually shine after having just re-looked the original as part of this double counting. <br /> <br /> Since the remake of Scott P. Levy does indeed follow Dante’s original, I think it’s interesting enough to see it. Although it lacks the wit of the original Dante. But the thing that really made me really fall in love with Levi’s version is that quite a lot of the footage from the first movie was reused during the piranha attack scenes. I never like it when filmmakers do this (and I'm not talking about using footage for memories or other good reasons). I mean, if you don't have the budget (or imagination) to come up with recently filmed material, then for Pete's sake, don't do a damn remake. But Roger Corman created this (cheaper) remake, so I think it shouldn’t surprise me to reuse the footage. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch Piranha, make sure that it has been a long time since you saw the original. You might like this remake a little more. And, oh, yes, this cool little stop-motion creature from the original is nowhere in this film, as you would expect. But what's worse, there is also no female nude in this film (in the original, some tricky shots were actually taken, and this blonde girl from the opening scene even accidentally pulled her underwear too far when removing her jeans!) Figures like this '95 version was made for tv.
