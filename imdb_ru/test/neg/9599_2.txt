Well, let me start by saying that I love the original RS for 64. The graphics were new, the ships were really fast and cool. Missions were challenging, but you had a strategy to come up with. The computer did not tell you every step of your mission, you could wander and explore. <br /> <br /> This is the first thing that is wrong with RL, everything you do is scheduled and controlled by other people. I mean, don't you, as a leader, have to tell people how to handle each mission? <br /> <br /> And speaking of missions, why do they mix the original trilogy with completely fictional crap? Nevermind. <br /> <br /> I was waiting for this game when I heard that they would allow you to fly through the asteroid field from Empire Strikes Back. I think that anyone who is a fan of movies wanted to do it. So they give it to you. This is the stupidest level in the game. You start flying through an asteroid field, ties are chasing you, and your goal is to move further into the field, removing your ties. You must kill them all to get ahead. Hey, remember how much Khan killed when he was in the field? None of them had piloting skills in comparison with him. I just wanted to dodge asteroids when they came at me, but instead I had to use my automatic aiming weapon to kill the connections behind me. <br /> <br /> This was the biggest disappointment, you have no control over your flight, everything is sluggish. Everything except A-Wing is probably the fastest and most maneuverable ship in the entire fleet. But oh yes, didn't Han say that Falcon was? In any case ... <br /> <br /> You finally got to the Battle of Endor. Here is the ultimate level, you can destroy the death star, the first instinct of each is to choose Falcon and become a leader. But, of course, you get there and have to do stupid pre-selected strategies, such as searching (not to mention decoding the differences) bomber. This is impossible in a falcon, when you notice one group, the frigate will be destroyed. The only way to get through this part is to choose A-Wing. After that, you have to attack the star destroyers, and this is a real stupid job. This game makes you feel that you are the only one who is defending the rebel alliance. <br /> <br /> After the disappointing passage of this "fun" fight, you fall on the death star. And here, you might think, “Hurray! I'm going to destroy the death star, ”and again, like in the Asteroid field, you have to do something tedious, passing by the tunnels of impending doom. Your mission is to protect the ship in front of you, remember that from the Return of the Jedi? This is so stupid, because if you choose a falcon, you will die, because you are not manoeuvrable, but if you choose an x-wing, you will have to continue to block and unlock the s-foil. So the choice is to kill the bad guys or try to catch up with Lando, who obviously does not know how to maneuver. So you die in the process. <br /> <br /> Bonus stages are not even worth pursuing, as each level becomes more and more disappointing. It makes me feel the same as I did when I watched three new films, frustrated and in need of killing something. Fortunately for me, Smash Bros Melee exists. <br /> <br /> I hope that with the Wii they will get something much better and get the original levels of the trilogy at full capacity. I'm going to sell this game as soon as possible.
