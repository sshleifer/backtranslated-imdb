This roar ... <br /> <br /> This gloomy ... <br /> <br /> Random violence ... <br /> <br /> A rough voice ... <br /> <br /> Fetish clothing ... <br /> <br /> This shaved head ... <br /> <br /> This can only mean one thing ... <br /> <br /> GRACE JONES BACK! <br /> <br /> Actually, my sources tell me that the main role in Blade was played not by the diva of the 1980s, but by Wesley Snipes. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is not an improvement. <br /> <br /> Blade is an adaptation of a comic character; somehow, in translation from the simplified, two-dimensional world of the printed page, it became even more simplified and lost several dimensions. <br /> <br /> The plot is exhausted almost unbelievably and adds nothing to the vampire genre, in fact, very similar to Nosferatu, it seems to suck the life out of the public. In short, the upward-moving vampire wants to become more powerful, but Blade confronts him, half the man, half the vampire, and all this is annoying. All this ends with Blade getting into the vampire juice press, some bad martial arts and the most pitiful CGI since 1968. <br /> <br /> Blade should be the least empathic character since Dolph Lundgren's The Punisher (also comic adaptation Perhaps there is a trend here?). Of course, the audience should be on the same side as the “hero”? And although a vampire can be a tragic character, it does not apply to Blade, he is mercilessly cruel, dismissive and not much better than the bad guys. <br /> <br /> I assume that Wesley Snipes has an acting career only so that it is possible to compare all the others with advantage. As he growls in his film, you find yourself looking for a count — even a ballpoint pen — anything to put Blade into the grave. <br /> <br /> As part of narcissism, Blade is largely unbeatable — endless protracted shots from a fresh sniper gym in the gym for no reason at all. Similarly, no other actor has the ability to give a reasonable idea; such as Stephen Dorff * CAN *, but they have to play second fiddle after the exhausting performance of Snipe. <br /> <br /> Chris Kristofferson used to appear in good films, here he turns into a friend whom you just do not know is going to go to the final movie. And what happens when Blade finds out? Yes, you guessed it, he rushes to the stage to get revenge in the gigantic underground lair of the villain. <br /> <br /> Why world domination can not take place in a quiet country house? They always lead the way in the underground cathedrals, which would have caused Albert Speer to wonder if they were a little grand. Many of these plans could be stopped right now if local councils paid more attention to cellar expansion plans. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is just as boring and unimaginable, and there is nothing new in this genre. The vampires were killed to death, and perhaps they should be laid down for a while — at least until someone figured out how to make them interesting again. <br /> <br /> To finish, there is * THERE * Grace A film about vampires of Jones, it is called “Vamp” and is about ten times better than this.
