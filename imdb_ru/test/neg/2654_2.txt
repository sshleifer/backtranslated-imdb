I work in a video store, so I try to watch the films that we are going to release every week. I have no problem with this; in fact, I feel it is a privilege. Not so with this movie. After an hour and a half of our hero, whining and snarling his way behind the scenes behind the scenes, I really wondered if they were planning to get to the point. I felt that I was being paid for viewing at home, in my free time. And if I knew that there was another hour, I could give up right now. I was not worried about the characters, the shooting was unremarkable, and Ford made kisses look like routine. Even the bill was inappropriate and sharp. What a waste.
