I have no idea what these people thought when they made this film. No plot, very limited action, and that with third-person comments throughout the film ???? Instead of running around the planet to shoot at all these locations, they had to spend some money on writing scripts and actors. What was there was lousy. It was 90 minutes of my life, I can never go back. I have to bill the director for the cost of renting this film. The director and authors of this movie ... please drop now. This film should have a front label that says to beware of boredom. The only good thing I can say about this movie is the generation of computers. This is normal as a generation. This film should never have a sequel .... never.
