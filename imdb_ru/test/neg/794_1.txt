BOX (2009) * Cameron Diaz, James Marsden, Frank Langella, James Reborn, Holmes Osborne, Sam Oz Stone, Celia Weston. A really disappointing sci-fi chiller adaptation of the legendary genre Richard Matson "Button, Button" from the wicked prodigy, directed by Richard Kelly, who really draws a small, well-designed piece into the bag "WTF" -a-thon! Mysterious (and ridiculously crippled!) The man, Langella, offers the millionth sentence to the “fighting” couple Diaz and Marsden (both surprisingly vanilla-soft!): A box with a red button that, when pressed, kills some of the World Stranger (!) Of course, there is strings, but does it matter here? Why, in the name of God, Kelly is embarrassed by so many oddities (i.e. nosebleeds; watery transport systems? Right? Watery.Transport.Systems) when the tension should be stretched as tightly as possible (about possibility). If this sounds like a bad TWILIGHT ZONE episode, you're half right (restarting the 80's TV actually made a decent adaptation to the small screen; in fact, they rented instead!) One of the worst films of the year.
