I don't leave IMDb movie comments, but this ... this movie was bad. very bad. I quickly went through most of this, stopping where I had hoped that the acting would improve from the last scene, only to continue the fast forwards. The formula of the plot - as soon as the obvious killers were discounted, only one remained. And that was in the first five minutes. Behind the scenes, it seemed that I had already read the script before, because there were no surprises or riddles. Tory character ... bad bad game. A real waste of time on a DVD and a certain option “let's go to bed early” if this is the only thing on television. If you watch this movie, you will understand that you understand that you will never be able to reclaim the time you wasted.
