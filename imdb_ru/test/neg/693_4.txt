Wrestlemania 2 - the only Restlemania | Thank God | held in three different places, and although it was an interesting idea, it actually didn't work. There are only two matches that really hit, and the rest were decent, or most of them, pretty awful. There are several celebrities such as Susan St. James, Ray Charles and Kathy Crosby, but for the most part this experience was a waste of time. The British Bulldgos Vs Match The Dream Team is worth the price of the entrance ticket, but you can honestly see it anywhere. <br /> <br /> Matches. <br /> <br /> Nassau Coliseum. <br /> <br /> Paul Orndorf vs the Magnificent Murako / Mr Fuji. For all the time, and, despite the cheesy aftertaste, it was surprisingly tolerable, the crowd was really interested in it. The crowd humming "Bull * t" at the end. It said that it did nothing for any career. The match ends with a double count when they fight outside the ring. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Intercontinental championship match. Randy Savage | C | Against George "The Beast" Steele. Not such a wise struggle, but very interesting because of pranks, and some great comedy from Steele, except that a savage can fight with potatoes and make him interesting. Savage wins when he puts his feet on the ropes, behind the levers. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Jake "The Snake" Roberts vs. George Wells. For a one-time match, this was better than it should have been, but it is too short to have any effect. Roberts defeats with DDT, pulling out snake afterwords that are nasty to St. James. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Boxing match. Mr T / W Hatie Kidd and Joe Frazier vs. Roddy Piper / W Lou Duva and Bob Orton. A huge failure in my opinion. I was bored all this time, and although it may have been a marketing success, he certainly could not entertain me. Many rowdy chants are also noticeable. T wins DQ when Piper claps T. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Rosemont Horizon <br /> <br /> Women's title. Fairy Mula | C | Vs Velvet Mcintyre. Ends too quickly, before he even gets a chance to start, making a record for the quick fall of a pin, as for women's matches. Mula wins when she uses the missed velveteen splash from the top rope. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> Corporal Kirchner versus Nikolai Volkov / Cool Freddie Blassi. Great popularity for corporal. A stupid match, with a boring insult to both participants, albeit too short to matter. The corporal wins when Volkov strikes Blass with his cane. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Battle Royal. William Perry and Andre get the biggest pops. This is quite interesting material, despite all the talent of the NFL. This is also noteworthy for the first ever appearance of Brest Hart. Andre wins when he throws out the Hart Foundation. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Command labels. British Bulldogs / W Lou Albano and Ozzy Osbourne vs. Dream Team / W Johnny Valiant | C |. An absolutely awesome match, this is one of the best wrestling matches of all time. You will not have time to catch your breath, with all the maneuvers at hand and an excellent ring psychology. This is a pure struggle in all its glory, you can not call yourself a wrestling fan, if you do not like this match. Bulldogs win when Dynamite Kid collides with Valentin. <br /> <br /> 4/5 <br /> <br /> Los Angeles Sports Arena Memorial <br /> <br /> Ricky Stembot vs Hercules Hernandez. Pretty decent match here, with both men showing good results. Hercules is a disgusting cattle, with above-average skills, and this contrasts well with high-flight fly-steam. The steamer wins with a high flying transverse body from the top rope. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Adrian Adonis vs Uncle Elmer. A terrible match with annoying comedy. Fans love Uncle Elmer, and I don't. Adonis wins with rope maneuver. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> The Funk Brothers Vs Tito Santana & JYD. There is quite a solid coincidence, with a lot of memorable punches taken from Terry Funk. The one at the table was something else for that time. I would rate this as my second favorite. Funk win with a megaphone Jimmy Hart. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> WWF Championship. Hulk Hogan | C | Against King Kong Bundy. Worthy pop for Hogan. One of the most popular matches in the history of Restlemania. Hogan cannot fight, whether to lick, and Bundy himself is not so great. At the time, the violence was brutal, but the act of Hogan's superhero is annoying, and too many boring moments. Hogan wins when running away before Bundy. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Total. Wrestlemania 2 is a failure in most aspects. Fans of brutal struggle should see it once, but you donâ€™t have them either. This is not enough to satisfy the true fan of the fight. Vince blew it on that. Do not be fooled by the hype at the main event, this is really a boring business, like most cards. It is not recommended, and is considered one of the worst Wrestling competitions outside of a brilliant title match. <br /> <br /> 4/10
