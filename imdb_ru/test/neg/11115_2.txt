“The horror of Chupacabra” was saved from “1” thanks to the presence of the Canadian cutie, Chelan Simmons, as the heroine of the Canadian cutie She enjoys watching from the front, the back and the side. Otherwise, you have a standard movie about monsters, Playing as a low-budget ship version of THE RELIC. John Rhys-Davies plays the captain of the ship on which the monster is transported. And the most nonskar monster is just a man in a suit. He commits about 100 meaningless At least bloody murders, so the number of bodies in this is quite amazing. Formula, to say the least. I like the moment when Simmons ominously tells someone what the chupacabra means: Goat Eater! Oooooh ... scary!
