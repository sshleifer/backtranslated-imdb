Good old Jess Franco! Always a reliable choice of director if you are looking for undemanding meanness, shameless exploitation and 200% gratuitousness. Jess again really surpassed herself with this completely cheesy piece of jungle adventure. Let's face it, this film is basically just an excuse to show the delightfully hot (and underage ??) actress Katya Bienert at a parade around topless. It is actually a rather disturbing thought that an innocent 16-year-old girl had to walk on the set of nudes in front of a whole team and especially in the eyes of the pervert Franco! And it was not even the first time, as the duo had previously made Linda together. In any case, just in case if you are interested: YES, Kilimanjaro Diamonds really has a plot, albeit a very stupid one. During the introductory episodes, the plane carrying a rich Scottish boy and girl aboard crashed vegetarian cannibals among an African tribe. I say “vegetarian” because they never once tried so much in the film to consume human flesh. The nasty Scotchman declares himself the Great White Leader, and the girl grows up to become a beautiful and barely dressed White Goddess. A few years later, the expedition reaches the middle of the jungle in order to return the girl to civilization and even more importantly to steal some of the legendary diamonds of the tribe. It could be an exciting and thrilling adventure film, but Jess Franco clearly could not be bothered. Why shoot chase episodes in the jungle or bloody rites of cannibalism, when you can just as easily aim the camera at a hot young chick sitting naked in a tree? Most of the jungle settings just seem to be filmed in someone’s garden, and there are a huge number of National Geographic clumsily edited wildlife videos to fill gaps in continuity. The flip side of the DVD describes Kilimanjaro's Diamonds as a brilliant, feminist and adult-oriented version of Tarzan. Yes, that's right, they just put this sentence, because the character Kati Binert moves several times from one tree to another.
