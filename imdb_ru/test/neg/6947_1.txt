I could not believe it. This film was a complete loss of time in my life. The name fits. Love did not knock me out of this rut, this film did. I kept looking and watching, and waiting, and waiting, and hoping for something, something would happen. And nothing happened! Nothing!! Terrence Howard could not even save this crap job, called the film. It was dark and confused, and I did not understand who eventually killed the girl. The tone and pace of the film should have led to a dramatic climate final. It only baffled the audience, because the film just fell apart and is not going anywhere. If you want pure torture, watch this movie.
