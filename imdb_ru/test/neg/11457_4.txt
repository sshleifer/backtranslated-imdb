Not all films shot in 1931 are so raspy, and the fact that it was “The Best Picture” should have given even greater impetus to the development of television. <br /> <br /> This is typical of Ferber’s novels, it’s not. You can display the whole story on the screen, not to mention the evolving character. Dix - so reckless in the first third of the film - makes a face, but no one knows why, and it makes no sense. And what makes Dunn so resistant? The scenes of Edna May Oliver are, as usual, priceless. <br /> <br /> This film plays an important role in the history of cinema, but it is long and boring.
