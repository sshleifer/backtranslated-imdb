Judging by the comments made so far, everyone seems to either hate this film or love it. I think it would be fair to say that, although this is not a BIG film, it has its own interesting moments. On the one hand, it was filmed on the spot in Colorado (was it Breckinridge or Telluride? I don't remember, but it is in the credits). The place is absolutely awesome and impressive. This is wonderful, even for me, who lived in Colorado for several years. <br /> <br /> Then, Disney has a penchant for great character actors. Harry Morgan has never been in better shape than when he plays in the Disney movie. He is literally hysterical. Also, remember the wonderful Mary Wicks? Although she has a “small role” in this film, she is, as always, gorgeous. If you do not know who she is, think of an animated version of “Brokeback” in the style of Disney from Notre Dame (she was one of the gargoyles), and she was the most interesting nun in “Sister Act” and the best nun. in "Trouble with the Angels." She has always been a great character actress, and most character actors never get the recognition they deserve. <br /> <br /> In addition to character actors and cast, in the 1960s and 1970s, Disney may not have had the “greatest” films, but if you really watch some of them from beginning to end , you will notice that there is some really funny or hysterical moment in every movie. The whole movie may seem funny, but in every single “live action” movie ever made by Disney, there is always a comic pearl (at least 1 or 2 ). Whether it is Harry Morgan one of his roaring tones, or Tim Conway, floundering around, or J. Flynn throwing one of his priceless horror looks is all good. The whole movie may not be very good, but every Disney movie ALWAYS has hysterical moments of the period I've ever seen. Disney always managed to make a person during this period. smile, despite the dullness of the movie. <br /> <br /> Judging by these comments, I do not agree with the audience, who say that every Disney movie during this period is terrible. This statement is not entirely accurate. Rather, it is easier for me to pay tribute to the funny moments and not to notice the weakness of the plots. <br /> <br /> Some of Disney's live-action films are real classics (Old Yeller, Bedknobs and Brooms, Mary Poppins) But for those who don’t, I can appreciate them for what they were - good pure family fun at times when movies have become vulgar, rude, and offensive.
