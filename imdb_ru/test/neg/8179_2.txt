I think it is freely available as it is on a DVD. First, it is a good propaganda film that will be shown to the Australian wartime audience, so it cannot be considered a serious retelling of Tobruk. The first half to 3/4 is a very dry story in Australia, I think, like in many American military films where the recruits get together, oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo is so cool and long. What we get to Africa and Tobruk is pretty bad, with a low budget. The battle scenes on the DVD copy I watched were almost completely black. See if you need to, but be prepared to use fast forward, since I doubt that you can do it in a few minutes. I liked the Italian “Battle of El Alaiene” much more, as well as Richard Burton made an African theatrical film, which was good “Desert Rats”, this film is just a real play and should have stayed at that time, today it is not good that then it was also highly appreciated). The same thing I'm talking about my American war films, so do not take it personally Australians (I love Australia, I was there twice!).
