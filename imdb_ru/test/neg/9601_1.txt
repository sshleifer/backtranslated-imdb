Anyone who thinks that Cole Mo Dee, Carol Alt and Corey Feldman make a list of good actors should smoke something that I would like to try someday. Where to start: a lousy soundtrack, hammy acting, "action" on the ground. This is a typical amateur-written hacker food, in which lovers were and have never been love stars. I really felt embarrassed about the “stars” in this “movie.” The only talker who could not lead this shit was Gary Coleman, who, if he had been in the film, would have made him at least somewhat awful, and not just bad. <br /> <br /> There was one part in the movie where Carol Alt screamed: “Do you think I'm an idiot?!?” Yes, Carol, I do, your agent does, and PLEASE love all that is worthy and holy ... GO and stop so humiliating yourself! Anna Nicole Smith participated in this movie. <br /> <br /> I would tell you about the plot, but it would be another piece of the sentence to this article, plus my thoughts changed many times during the film, anyway, so I hardly paid attention.
