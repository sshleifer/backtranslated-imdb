For producer David O. Selznik, none of the directors will not. Consequently, at Farewell to Arms (1957) we get two ?? Charles Widor and John Houston. Although both of them were completely perfect in their own right, neither of them could have made the head or tail of this disastrous remake of the opera work of Hemmingway. Hemmingway never translated well from book to screen. But under the zeal of Selznik to turn him into his next "Gone With the Wind" excursion is both punitive and exhaustive. At this point in the career of Selznik, he was no longer a titan who could take "box office poison" and turn it into "Gone With the Wind." Tired, frail, without his studio, and with the inevitable feeling that his second marriage with Jennifer Jones could have been a mistake, Selznik conveyed the creative board of this film Fox Fox Studios ?? but he kept enough of himself to become damn unpleasant on the set. <br /> <br /> By now, someone knows or should be familiar with the bitter-sweet tragic love story of nurse Catherine Barkley (Jennifer Jones) and her hero soldier Lt. Frederick Henry (Rock Hudson). It is assumed that their passion serves as a stabilizing force for what is essentially the story of a war correspondent with romance added for good measure. But the chemistry between Hudson and Jones is both dull and boring. In the last clip, Jones' face deformations are so bad at the time of the child's birth that I am surprised that not a single director decided to exclude them from the general release. Part of the problem with Jones is that at thirty-eight she is too smart to play optimistic Katharina with any great conviction. However, older actresses often manage to get viewers to forget about the differences in age. Not so with Jones. Someone is painfully aware that she does not meet all the requirements of either acting or years spent on this planet. Hudson's laconic charm is hopelessly divorced from the stoicism of an army soldier whose heart is broken, but his head remains strong. The supporting cast is littered with luminaries such as Vittorio De Sica and Mercedes McCambridge, but this is nonsense that in no way reflects on the enormous talents of both actors and is best manifested elsewhere in their canons of film production. > <br /> The anamorphic image element for Farewell to Arms looks quite good, although in some scenes this reviewer has a lot of film grain. In general, colors are dull and muted, but balanced according to the DeLuxe color processing currently used. Some extinction is obvious. Carnal tones do not seem very natural. Contrast levels are a bit weak. Black, as a rule, solid. White is almost pure. There is not much to recommend this movie by sound. This is essentially a verbose picture with pistol shots as a background. There are no additions.
