This for one has nothing to do with an absolutely fantastic first click. And, of course, we Americans just need to redo everything successful into English, because the person reading the subtitles is SOOOOO. It is difficult, is not it! From what I see in the new trailers with the charming, now pregnant Jessica Alba (well, that destroys every fantasy of teenagers, isn't it!) It looks EXACTLY the same, but it will probably double the budget. I thought the original was one of the best horror / suspense / mystery films that I have seen in any language for quite a while. I would recommend to watch this film and skip it all together, there is no reason to watch it, because there is no reason to even call it “Eye 2”, except to benefit from the superiority that was the first click. Make yourself an “Eye” watch with increased volume and get ready for possible jumps. I watched it with headphones and was pleasantly surprised by the superiority that the Pan brothers led. If the remake of "Eyes" works well, I hope that he does it for the sake of the film career of the Pan Brothers, but at the same time it seems a shame that people do not see / cannot see the original, because very often / almost always the remake as good as the original. Look at this, if someone wants to be a little boring, but the original is no match for this sequel by name.
