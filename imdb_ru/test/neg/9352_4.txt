Awful Star Wars fake with a slightly more comic touch. The stars of Robert Urich are the leaders of a group of ice pirates who steal ice, because water is the most valuable substance in the universe (like all poor people remain alive, a mystery). He is associated with Mary Crosby (daughter of Bing, about 25 years old and cutie), a princess who is looking for her missing father. Also in the cast are Angelica Houston, embarrassed in appearance, in funny sci-fi outfits and plump short man Ron Perlman (who, I thought, was seven feet tall from his other roles!) And John Carradine, who looks like the days of death and the ridiculous man of Hollywood squares (relative term) Bruce Vilhench. If you ever wanted Bruce Vilench to be beheaded, here is your movie. But, again, even this is not worth seeing, as it does not close him at all (I think he could have been a robot, but I nodded a couple of times).
