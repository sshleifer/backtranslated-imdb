It is impossible to make a film on such a book as The Brothers Karamzov, F.M. Dostoevsky <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks is a great director, but this film is at a very low level. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the film is the final. Well, let's think about the book. As a result, we have the "guilty" Dmitry Karamazov. After that, he was sent to Siberia. In the end, the famous epilogues of Dostoevsky, friends and family make up a plan for his salvation. But that's all ... and now the film takes two more steps and shows us the illusion of the end of the escape of Dmitry and Grushenka (I think). From a moral point of view, I am sure that Dostoevsky would finish the book with an open end, because, on the one hand, he is not guilty (Smerdyakov is a real killer), and therefore he must be a free man. But on the other hand, he goes to his father to kill him, so he decided to commit a crime ... this is a moral dilemma, and therefore the next moment is an open end ... well, in fact, he is simply not a complete Open. <br /> <br /> William Shatner as Alyosha Karamazov ... Sorry! -> NO !!! <br /> <br /> Other characters play in a good performance, as we expect this from such great actors ... Ahead, of course, is Yul Brainnerâ€™s magnificent performance as Dimitri. I think that there are not so many actors who could play this role better. <br /> <br /> But, as I said at the beginning: this book is non-adaptable. This should never be a movie in two hours, it is impossible. I think there are several longer films, so maybe they could do the right thing ... But I just hold the opinion that this book cannot be adapted. <br /> <br /> So - 3 points: <br /> A point for the great director Richard Brooks <br /> <br /> A point for a great performance by Yul Brynner <br /> <br /> Finally : a point for one of the greatest writers of all time: Dostoevsky
