Well, I caught only the end of this film on HBO, only the last 10 minutes or so, but I must say that it contains, perhaps, the funniest depiction of the distance that has ever been put on film! I am a serious long-distance runner and a devoted fan of this sport, and I have already seen many painful demonstrations in the movies. However, nothing could prepare me for what is shown on the screen in the last 10 minutes of this film, it literally defies faith! The image of runners is even more ironic, given that African runners completely dominate the sport, and they are elegant and graceful. The protagonist of the female shuffles like a pregnant woman with overweight, and her "well-trained" male supporters are no better. Up until the race, this supposed world-class runner is surrounded by fat, fat people, many of whom are walking! It is interesting to me that the director decided that she would lead the competition among women, but towards the end she was shown passing people who look as if they are staggering on two broken legs! Should we believe that this amazing star athlete only overtook a disabled person at the very end of the race? Perhaps the director simply thinks that female runners cannot run faster than 12-minute miles, and he obviously never heard of athletes like Paula Radcliffe or Tirunesh Dibaba. <br /> <br /> Even if you are not a runner, you will be amazed at the insanely inaccurate image of running, and this film can only be watched as an unintended comedy. Here is a note for the director: The next time you decide to make a movie about sports, you may want to hire at least one person who actually saw this sport in action.
