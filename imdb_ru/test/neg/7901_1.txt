I gave Soul Plan the benefit of doubt and thought that there was something comedic about it. I'm not black, but this does not mean that I can not appreciate the black comedy. I know this because I like watching Wayans Bros, Good Times and other TV shows. <br /> <br /> I’ve seen shit movies and it’s hard to beat me off. As for Soul Plane, I did not even bother to finish it. I don’t know if they managed to land, and I don’t care. It would be unfair to say that I do not find some parts amusing, as I laughed, but I also laugh at the Youtube video about skateboarders falling on their nuts, so this says little. The men in the film looked like a horned hyena in the mating season, who wanted to “get some” when and where possible. And we wonder why all these stereotypes do not disappear. To summarize: Soul Plane makes the Harold and Kumar series look like the Godfather.
