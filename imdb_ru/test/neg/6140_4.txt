I had the honor to see this powerful Broadway game headed by Kathy Bates. I saw only one other play in the 1970s-1990s, which had an emotional effect, like this play. I was really looking forward to turning the play into a film, but I was very disappointed when I learned that Kathy Bates would not repeat her role in the film - she was not known at that time on Broadway, and the producers must have wanted Star Power I suppose, and instead, play Sissy Spacek. Sissy did an adequate job in the lead, but didnâ€™t fit Katie Bates. I love Ann Bancroft, but she seemed too young for this role. The plot of the film was true to the play. Anyone who ever thinks about suicide should watch this film in order to recognize the devastation of those left behind.
