I have witnessed some atrocious movies. It seems that in the last couple of years, producers and directors have been striving to make films that bring me closer to madness. Hannibal was no exception. I did not expect much when I went to see a movie. The book was ridiculous, and the statement “The book is always better than the film” did not guarantee me that this film would be nothing more than rubbish. But what I saw is a movie in which all the other bad movies look better compared to him. <br /> <br /> Usually, when I watch a horrible movie, I find myself more surprised than anything else. Unfortunately, I could not even laugh at the sad excuse of the film, which is Hannibal. I think the film was shot with a promise. Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore and Gary Oldman were there. And for the directing was Ridley Scott. There were films with significantly fewer talents that were much better. There were so many that I would cut out of this film that I doubt that anything was left. It was a pity. The storyline was so ridiculous that it seemed like a complete idiot wrote it. Worst of all, the book was even crazier, and there were some scenes that were too extreme to be included, which is sad in the case of a movie where <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER AHEAD *** <br /> Ray Liotta's brain was prepared piece by piece. This scene more than others made me cry, because it stained its predecessor to such a monumental level. The Silence of the Lambs was one of my favorite films of all time. But Hannibal was a joke with two hours. This film should be watched only if people want to learn not to write a good film.
