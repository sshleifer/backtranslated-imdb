I thought that "puppets make crazy phone calls" were pretty low, but I do not believe that the show of Carlos Mencia is even considered a comedy. His main goal is to make the audience feel incredibly awkward, using the word "beaner" as often as possible. I never felt obliged to write a review announcing the terrible things on IMDb, but I really hope that this show will never be resumed or restarted. <br /> <br /> Mencia is trying to become the next Dave Chapelle, and maybe he was hired only by the network, because they hoped that he would fill these shoes. This is obvious to the point of breaking up the Chapelle entry (blues guys against Mariachi). Nevertheless, Mencia has absolutely * no * relationship, and he doesnâ€™t understand the popular views on Latin American culture enough to come up with a creative approach every time. Instead, he sticks to a few shocking nicknames for his fellow Latin Americans and jokes about immigration. From time to time, he will use the light darkness of his skin to make fun of someone else, like Middle Eastern cultures. These jokes mainly consist of repeating every joke or stereotype made against culture, and possibly some incredibly old themes (such as 9/11), in a relaxed, upright style, while he laughs at himself to hide the style audience. I think he is too afraid to really hurt anyone, so it just makes the viewer feel uneasy. He also beats jokes to death. If you have ever seen "Why the hell is this news?" you will understand what I am talking about. At first this is ridiculous, but he just rumbles and at some point becomes the obvious captain. <br /> <br /> This is a train wreck that just hurts to look at.
