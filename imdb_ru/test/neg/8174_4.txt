Well, that's the point ... this film is full of banal dialogues, unnecessary play and a worn script. <br /> <br /> There are moments that should have been very dramatic, but simply with humor because of overly acting and poorly written lines. I could not stop laughing in moments that were supposed to be very serious. A bright spot in this film is the circus. To see the circus in its heyday was certainly a pleasure. <br /> <br /> There are moments that go just as well. But then he immediately returned to the territory of the B-movie. I was tempted to stop watching him several times. <br /> <br /> However, I donâ€™t know exactly how it happened. It must have been a slow year!
