I play well, write and direct, but not yet known. My friends and I often make bad films, just for fun and laughter, but when we went to a local family video and found a movie called “Biker Zombies from Detroit”, we knew that this would be the worst movie of all time! Biker Zombies from Detroit does not have a script! They may say they are, but they are liars! There was a 4 minute scene in which two guys talked about women and sexuality, and you could say it was improvised. And if they are going to improvise, it should be, at least, decently, but it’s not, and you can say that the two actors screwed up and said things that didn't even make sense. <br /> <br /> To give you an idea of ​​how awful and backward this film is, here’s the beginning: a girl clicks a guy, he hits her face and beats her, and then rapes her. Then we see zombies attacking, and they both turn into zombies. <br /> <br /> This is the beginning of the movie! Not to mention the main voice of the zombie, which permeates the entire film, tries to be ominous and makes you wonder, but it sounds like Marilyn Manson, tuned to the plot. <br /> <br /> The worst movie ever. Bottom line, guys. But watch it if you like movies without a script, no plot, bad game, bad editing, bad music and more than 100 words used in the film. <br /> <br /> If it hits video stores, my future films are going to win an Oscar.
