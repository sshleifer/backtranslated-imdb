Sebastian Cabot is a wealthy jerk who wants to buy up all the land because there is oil there - although not one of the locals knows about oil. With the help of an evil shooter in black, they kill and terrorize everyone. When the son of the murdered man arrives, he refuses to retreat and confronts these forces of darkness. <br /> <br /> Wow. When I watched TERROR IN A Texas TOWN, I had the feeling that I had seen this movie many times before and would probably see something like that again. This is because, apart from a few new products (such as Sterling Hayden using a harpoon on a bad guy), he has a story that is too familiar. Once again, we have a rich guy who is trying to drive out all the farmers in order to gain control over the whole land. And for this he brought hired weapons to force people to sell or kill them. Been there, made it in too many films. <br /> <br /> I love Stirling Hayden in movies, but I just canâ€™t recommend it as something other than an unfortunate passerby.
