Michael Caine may have tried to make the character bigger than life to a successful degree, but the whole storyline and character around him were completely unattractive or interesting. Everything was very boring and somewhat predictable. Martin Landau, my favorite actor, played no role. He was useless. After some time, Michael Kane was a bit annoying, and the film could not decide whether it was a comedy or a serious thriller. Kane was trying his best, but I felt that the direction and the storyline brought him down. Do not waste your time. It starts well during the first 10 minutes, and then everything. The film is for Die Hard Caine fans only. Stay away from this ...
