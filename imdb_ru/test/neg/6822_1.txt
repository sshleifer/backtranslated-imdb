I sit here and watch the movie "Tango and Cash." This led to a discussion about other great films of the late 80s. There is a ridiculous connection between Tunrer and Hooch, K9. <br /> <br /> Of course, I have never seen K9PI, and if I still value my life, I will never be. Joshua quotes this as his film of the year. Wow. Wow. I am very surprised that this film exists. But much more than the fact that Joshua likes this move worries me deeply. I think Joshua is one interesting guy. <br /> <br /> K9 <br /> <br /> K9
