This thing, directed by French sensation Patrick Sebastian, is worse than all the turkeys you might have seen. Forget Independence Day, Kazaam, Patriot, etc ... You get the picture, it's the pits. Sebastian is a television celebrity in France (if you need the equivalent, say, he is Jerry Springer from IQ 13), this is his first film, let's hope he is the last. I hope that Troma or someone else will distribute this film in the States, so you guys may experience a French stench at worst. Let's cut it, this is a masterpiece S ** t.
