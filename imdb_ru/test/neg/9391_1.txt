I must immediately admit that I did not watch this whole film. I missed the first hour during the Sci Fi Channel broadcast. Or have I spared the first hour? Other reviewers summarize this well. It was badly conceived. Bad written. He acted badly. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing for me is ADR. The entire film, which seemed to be dubbed, sounded as if it had been shot in someone's garage. A cumbersome echo sounded in the words, which simply caused the bad dialogue to hang. And hang. And hang. Even a film made for television had to admit it. <br /> <br /> In the 80s, guys, the idea that alternative sizes vary in color saturation appeared.
