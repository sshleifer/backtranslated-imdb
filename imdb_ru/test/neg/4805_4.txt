It was only the second year at the Academy, but they had already voted politically - Gene Eagles’s brilliant performance in this squeaky early talkativeness had to get by with an Oscar nominee, and the statuette was the worst ever won - Mary Pickford the imprint was a working imprint without music or final editing, but wherever it appeared, Igls stuns and captivates with his attractive, powerful work. She is so convincing on the stand of witnesses that, although we know that she lies through her teeth (we did see how she killed this person), we in the audience find ourselves, like jurors, who believe in her innocence, before we suddenly catch yourself. THIS IS A GREAT ACTION. The film should be available on video so that the world can enjoy this amazing performance again. (The archival print edition contains one silence about Jin - “MAN, WOMAN AND SIN,” and her only other jealous person, “Jealousy”, is “lost”, so this is the only document that we have about her. will be shown in New York at the beginning of the 70s, the Village voice printed a full overview of the page dedicated to the performance of the Eagles).
