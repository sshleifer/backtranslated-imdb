Oh, I'm basically not the kind of person to give a film less than 5 points. Mostly, only because of the efforts of the actors and directors. <br /> <br /> 3/10 for Kayman from me. If someone thinks that the main character (or someone else) deserves an Oscar, I deserve the Nobel Peace Prize. <br /> <br /> Seriously. I can not believe that this film was in Europe. The acting was terrible, the plot was terrible, how about 70s horror music. Give me a break. <br /> <br /> "Popeye" for example. What about him? Why is he there, he has nothing to do with the film. <br /> <br /> What about Keiman talk? One time he cannot say a decent word, the next time he starts talking. He also almost dies when he wakes up, and sunlight shines through his bunker. But when he walks down the street, the sunlight seems to be doing nothing. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie just because you are dying of boredom. I regret that I did not observe how my roses grow, which in any case are more interesting than this piece ...
