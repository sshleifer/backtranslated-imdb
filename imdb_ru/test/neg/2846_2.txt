Bridget Fonda is the sexually contented wife of handsome Hart Bochner. One afternoon she comes home, calls him "cute" and quietly pours a drink for him, only to find out that he is sulking. Minutes go by while she meekly puts up with his gloomy silence. Suddenly he becomes enraged, accusing her of infidelity in the complete absence of any reason for this, calls her the word "C", slaps her head on the cabinet, slaps her around, and as a result she throws her from the second floor. balcony, breaking her arm and a pair of ribs. <br /> <br /> She wakes up in the hospital, where, as it turns out, she is deaf, although we notice that she reads lips well. This avoids the embarrassment associated with the ASL translator or with its screams in the language simulacrum. <br /> <br /> Good. Let me just lay out the main elements of the plot. This beautiful and devoted disabled woman was beaten by her husband, misunderstood by her elderly mother betrayed by her sister, devastates her bank account with unknown hands, almost raped a fat man who accused her in a bar, and is believed to have killed her missing husband, and two policemen (Kiefer Sutherland and Stephen Weber) are pursuing her, one of whom is interested only in justice, and the other does not seem to love all women and is embarrassed by their presence. The end reveals that she is standing alone at a deserted bus stop with a hand full of money - alone, whining but brave. <br /> <br /> Now the pop quiz. There is only one multiple choice question. "This story was written: (a) by a man, or (b) by a woman." Don't sound sexist. It would be just as easy to imagine a scenario about a decorated military hero and a trained warrior who was captured by his enemies, betrayed his organizations, beat and tortured, he managed to get revenge, and he ended up with his beloved woman, who, as he thought, he lost <br /> <br /> Direction is functional and conditional. When Fonda wakes up in a hospital bed, we see from her point of view agitated doctors and nurses looking down at her — that is, at the camera — the echo of each scene in countless second-rate films in which the gurney rolls the gurney down the hallway starched white robes and decorated with stethoscopes with garlands over the camera. <br /> <br /> Hart Bochner played some evil people in an interesting way - some of the characters are stupid (“Die Hard”), and some are more than rude (“And tell the sea”). His manly hand has a kind of evil shade. It would be too easy to make him a hero. Good, deliberately soft performance of Stephen Weber as a dull policeman - perhaps the best in the film. <br /> <br /> Bridget Fonda is also interesting. Her acting range is limited, but he is fully here. What makes her an object of interest is her almost stereotypical beauty. She's like prom queen in high school. Very feminine. Of course, she can't help it if she slips around or moves her hands so elegantly. Also, she can not do anything with her nose. For most of its length, this is perfectly normal and attractive, but at its very apex there is a bulge that follows the natural flash of its nostrils. The tip of this nose is full of intrigue. <br /> <br /> As for the film - Pfuy.
