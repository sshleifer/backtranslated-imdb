After the meteorite landed in Boston (actually somewhere on the Isle of Man), the hideous fanged alien monster is released and is free in the local school for girls, causing chaos and turning students into zombie-like creatures. This film appears to be a free (and I emphasize free) remake of a 1986 film with the same title, because it depicts the same monster, but a different plot. Both films are terrible, but to honor the 1986 version, it was watchable. This is not so. Let's start with all the problems - the acting, especially from the leading professor, was very, very bad. It is assumed that this film will take place in Boston (we know this, because the filmmakers had a brilliant idea to put the Boston Police or the Boston Gas Company on everyone), but everyone seems to have quite intricate British accents (at least , they did not try to use Boston accents, thank God). The script is a big mistake. The best example of how stupid this letter is is when it is determined that you can turn zombie students into people by removing a necklace containing a piece of meteorite. Is this what our brave heroes do? No, they run, shooting zombie students. Nice. Directed by Paul Matthews, who also wrote / shot a weak 1995 monster movie "Grim", clearly does not know how to make the tempo of his films. The film is terribly boring in some places. The lighting is terrible. The film looks cheap and tasteless. One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of visible blood. 99% of the death scenes are due to the fact that the creature jumps out of a dark corner and leads someone away, while we hear that they are “scared” shouting in the distance. This agreement has never worked well in the past, and, of course, does not work here. The visual effects were terrible. The opening CG sequence in space looked as if it were created in Microsoft Slideshow for God's sake! The "explosion" of gas tanks at the end was just as terrible. Well, I like to consider myself a fair critic, so I’ll give due credit — the effects of the creatures were actually pretty cool. Gotta love these big and slippery teeth close up! <br /> <br /> To summarize, Breeders is a terrible, cheap horror film that should be avoided, like the Ebola virus. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10.
