Boring <br /> <br /> This is slow. <br /> <br /> Where are the horrible and brutal murders? Where is the stress that should scare us? It’s like looking at Sesame Street without the funny characters of Ernie, Burt or Grover. <br /> <br /> This is really unconvincing. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was written ... perhaps a direction .... Maybe acting, maybe editing, maybe cinematography, maybe special effects, maybe makeup. <br /> <br /> Perhaps all of the above led to the fact that you could hardly concentrate on your eyes. <br /> <br /> I wanted to get scared ... not boring. <br /> <br /> It didn’t scare me ... it didn’t even interest me ... It was more fun to watch time on the microwave instead of watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about buying it ... and if you see it on TV, by some strange coincidence, there is no need to put children to sleep.
