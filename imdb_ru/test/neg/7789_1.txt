It was only the second version of the classic story of Charles Dickens, which I saw, and, unfortunately, it was one of the worst. The film begins with a short live action movie in which Simon Callow, as Charles Dickens, begins the story of "The Christmas Carol" and then, obviously, moves on to the most animated story. You probably already know this, Ebenezer Scrooge is a grumpy cold-blooded businessman who refuses charity and hates Christmas. He is visited by Jacob Marley (Nicolas Cage), who warns him about visiting the other three ghosts of the Christmas past (Jane Horrocks), the present (Sir Michael Gambon) and the silent future / still ahead. After all this, he is obviously aware of the true magic of Christmas and promises to be better in the future. The only changes I noticed in this story were that Scrooge had mice in her friends (stupid idea), the former lover of Scrooge Bell (Kate Winslet), who needed his help in the orphanage, the Ghost of a Christmas present, showing "and" ignorance, Scrooge is still persecuted after he is pleased, and he worries that he cannot keep his promise to be nice. Also starring Rhys Ifans as Bob Critsch, Juliet Stevenson as Mrs Crushts, Ian Jones as Scrooge Fred's nephew and Colin Macfarlane as Fezzyvig. The animation is not very good quality, the actors have wasted their voices on a useless piece of trash. The only good thing that comes from this film is Kate Winslet’s good voice, singing the final song “What, If,” as for everything else, it’s just terribly awful. Very poor!
