I admit that I didn’t pay enough attention to everything that happens in this film, but, to be honest, I don’t think it would matter. In fact, local councilor Sydney Fiddler (Syd James) convinces the incompetent mayor Frederick Bumble (Kenneth Connor) of Firecombe to hold a beauty pageant to improve the image of the city. They face opposition from female liberator Augusta Prodvorti (June Whitfield) trying to sabotage the competition, but they have an advertising agent Peter Potter (Bernard Bresslav) and the owner of the Palace Connie Philpotts (Joan Sims). Soon, young, beautiful models of imitators appear, including Hope Springs (Barbara Windsor), Paula Perkins (Valerie Leon), Dawn Brakes (Goldfinger Margaret Nolan), Debra (Sally Jison) and Ida Downs (Eastern Anders' Wendy Richard). When the girls have fights with cats, it distracts the permanent residents, but after a while some funny hints and the fact that William (Jack Douglas) is experiencing excessively active movements, he finally reaches the competition, and only then I can not be concerned Also starring Patsy Rowlands as Mildred Bumble, Peter Butterworth as admiral, Joan Hickson as Mrs. Dyuks, David Lodge as police inspector, Angela Grant as Miss Bangor, Arnold Ridley as adviser to Pratt, Robin Asquith as an adviser in the role of Pratt, Robin Asquith as an adviser in the role of Miss Bangor, Arnold Ridley as an adviser Pa ritsiya Franklin as rosemary, Jimmy Logan Cecil Geybodi and Bat Pertwee from Pope Army as chief of the fire brigade, Charles Hawtrey, obviously, threw Carrie, but where Kenneth Williams? I guess seeing Babsie and a young, beautiful-looking Pauline Fowler in a bikini, but because of the comedy effect, it fails miserably, and excessive use of the whistle whistle simply gets on your nerves. Pretty poor!
