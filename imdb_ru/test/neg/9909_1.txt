Contains the main spoilers, in case you really take care of the storyline. <br /> <br /> OK, we have storms that destroy the city, and a computer hacker who clogs the power grid. <br /> <br /> Predictable shlok from the very beginning, and if that was not enough, then 5-second strikes between the film and commercials kill that little wait that could be. For example: will they make it to the airport on time? Things look dull when we go to a commercial, and an action movie, until an advertisement shows how they bounce inside the plane! Well, I think they still do it, but again, they had to, because they are good guys. <br /> <br /> The game wasn't very impressive (exception and welcome relief: Randy Quaid as Tommy Tornado), the effect was kind of lame, the bad guys got it, and the good guys went through it. The real disaster of this film was the script, especially the final. Not only did they wrap things up as quickly as a soap opera, with 24-hour cancellation notice, but they glorified the hacker with good intentions. So he caused death in a billion dollars - he meant well. And, of course, the inspiring final television report about people who get together. Barf. That was all I expected from the ad, and I'm glad I wasted my time watching it. Tomorrow at the dinner table will be great to talk. <br /> <br /> Does CBS insult us with this? Of course, but we watched it, right? Did you find a lot of ads that were for home backup generators during this pig? <br /> <br /> Here hope for the next Plan 9 from Outer Space (which gets better with each view). This is not true. <br /> <br /> 1 star.
