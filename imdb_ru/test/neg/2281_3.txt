By quantity, an Oscar-craving biopic about the late, great singer Ray Charles. In * Ray * there is one - just one - a great scene. This happens during the recollection of Charles’s youth, after the boy is completely blind. Running into the house of an accomplice he shares with his mother, he stumbles on a chair and falls apart on the floor. He cries out to his mother; She, in accordance with her philosophy that a person should “stand on her feet,” silently and thoughtfully watches from the kitchen, waiting for the boy to retreat to his own resources. The boy proves that he coped with the task, using his ears and memory, to find a kettle on the stove, the nearest fireplace, grass blowing in the wind outside the window, flooding cricket on the floor board. <br /> <br /> Here the movie stops; it expands; he breathes - even if in just 40 seconds. The scene is a hugely needed respite from the noisy Taylor Hackford film. By "noisy" I do not mean music, which, of course, is excellent. I mean sound effects (big booms! Preceding another memory) and meaningless dialogue (“I talk to you like FRIEND, Ray,” etc.). From a visual point of view, Hackford catches the eye equally and senselessly: sepia filters over camera lenses during memories; Whirling dervish 360-e from the camera-crane, etc., etc. All modern amenities. What a horrible cinematic style is displayed in * Ray *! - The style is too common in the "important" films about the last decades or so (Scorsese's Aviator is stylistically very similar to this film). These tricks are used to confuse the cliché script. Some of us will not be deceived. <br /> <br /> Some of us are also not quite ready to perceive Jamie Fox’s performance as more than just superb facial expression. Of course, Fox terribly reminds Ray Charles: he walks like Charles, speaks like Charles, and even twitches like Charles. Imitating a Foxx singer during a live performance is technically perfect. I do not envy Mr. Fox his Oscar; he deserved it. (In any case, it was a rather weak field this year.) But I wonder if Fox really UNDERSTANDS Charles. The actor really achieves one remarkable moment when he insists on having a taste that his group mates shoot: he registers, at least for a short time, aversion to the injustice of blindness and the life of darkness. The film seems to want to dramatize the struggle inside Charles between the bright rescue of music and the forgetfulness of heroin, with his blindness as the battlefield between these two compulsions. But this damned film just does not take time: it jumps from triumph to triumph, never stopping to understand a person. Need to stretch to find dramatic stress; need to put a drama for the film. In other words, you need to imagine a better film than this. <br /> <br /> In pursuit of a glorious conclusion * Ray * represents and then shies away from several great ideas for the film: his early years "Chitlin Circuit"; his bold musical novelties for the label Atlantic; the problem of his addiction to heroin; the inevitable artistic compromises accompanying overwhelming success; the importance of a person in the fight for civil rights (the film tells about the three minutes of screen time) and much more. The filmmakers are too lazy to focus on any of these elements. Two and a half hours of observing how a person overcomes one disaster after another can make us feel good, but such a film is not necessarily a great work of art. This approach, of course, does not give a deeper understanding of the subject of the film - and shouldn't understanding be the real purpose of such a film? If I wanted to get a list of Ray Charles achievements, I would just google it. <br /> <br /> 3 stars out of 10 - an additional 2 stars exclusively for music.
