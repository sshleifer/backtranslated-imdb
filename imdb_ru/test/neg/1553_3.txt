I had to watch this movie on my Canadian cinema course, and I was told that it is considered the “best Canadian movie”. When I watched it, I really disagreed, considering that I had seen much better. I understand that there were Canadian topics and messages, but the fact that the characters and the plot were so detached from me (as a spectator) did not really bother me that the film was trying to tell me. The plot was too dry. The characters did not have many positive personality traits, but this should emphasize the message, and not annoy the audience. This film tells a little about the history of Quebec. Not a very interesting film; it definitely does not deserve to be set on such a high pedestal.
