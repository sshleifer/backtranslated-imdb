It was an irreverent 1970s comedy, teasing the psychiatric profession in Beverly Hills. I did not object to this, but I objected to even greater disrespect regarding marriage and religion: two topics that secular filmmakers (that is, about everyone in Hollywood and elsewhere) simply cannot stop destroying. <br /> <br /> Walter Mattau plays the lousy Donald Becker character who walks with the priestâ€™s collar, which offends me, but when Hollywood ever worried about offending Christians? > In any case, despite all this nonsense, the film has its own interesting moments and even some charm. Dan Aykroyd is well able to pay, and Donna Dickson ("Laura Rollins") - a knockout. I wish she had a bigger role.
