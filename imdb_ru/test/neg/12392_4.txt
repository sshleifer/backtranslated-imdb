Grosse Pointe Blank really was a movie below average. His hitman theme is very dry and more like a romantic comedy than a rider's thriller. The game is very normal. The performances are sometimes very embarrassing, as many characters seem very "eccentric", and this annoyed me a lot. All reunion and “Wow, I haven't seen you for 10 years!” The element is very stupid, and many scenes just drag on, especially towards the end, when they are at the reunion party itself, and the characters go through each of their former classmates, one after the other welcoming them. It just seemed very sticky, meaningless and poorly executed. <br /> <br /> The role of Dan Aroyd as an “opponent” is very scant. It seems that it appears only once at the very beginning and right at the very end in the "final show below", which is strongly promoted, but does not deliver at all. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also very mediocre. Most of the songs in this film belong to the 1980s and, with the exception of two or three, are very bad. Hearing safovy songs over a rather boring film only adds to the negative that surrounds this film. <br /> <br /> I could go on and talk about how the little things were annoying and were just very bad, such as very few sequences of actions that came and went very quickly, the lack of character development and how bad everything was built in this department, how you forget half the time that Cusack's character is even a hired killer in general, because the element does not exist like that. <br /> <br /> Even what the comedy finds ridiculous; but it is not. I never laughed once during this movie. Of course, maybe I was grinning from time to time, but my only PRESENT feeling was good when I realized that the movie was almost over! <br /> <br /> Please do not waste your time on the Grosse Pointe Blank, despite the relatively high (but very wrong) IMDb rating. I have seen films that are better than this film, which have a lower rating on this site, which tells you that there are better films there. Just do not worry about it.
