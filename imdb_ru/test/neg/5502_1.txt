Surely this movie was hacked by the studio? perhaps not, but I feel that there are serious flaws in storytelling, which, if they are not attributed to the editing process, can be caused exclusively by terribly bad, really criminal, writing and directing. <br /> <br /> I understand what effect Burton wanted to achieve with the help of a stylized Edward scissors gothic atmosphere, but here, unfortunately, it falls and does not reach the mythical depth of the tropes, but only the offensive form of affectation. . that is, a bad game and a petty character even for a fairy tale. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's not so scary, really, only slightly amusing in his attempts. using dialogue as a background for the plot was clumsy and unnecessary. there would be enough mystery about who is a headless horseman, you don’t need the myth of a German mercenary, although Christopher Walken did cut a dashing figure, but not so threateningly - the kind of horseman’s head makes him seem much more friendly than headless inhuman nine-foot height. spirit, as in the original legend. <br /> <br /> neither the present rhythm, nor the universal tone, nor the classics in the Bourton station was established. started and shave like my farewell shot ...
