Stay away from this movie! This is terrible in all respects. Bad behavior, subtle reworked plot and the worst end in the history of cinema. I rarely watch a movie that irritates me with adrenaline. In fact, the only other film that immediately comes to mind is another film, People in a Plane in Need (Airspeed). Please, please, do not look at it, because it is from beginning to end perfect and pitiful. Helge Iversen
