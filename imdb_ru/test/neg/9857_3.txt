Kasparov vs. Deep Blue is, without a doubt, an exciting story, but I don’t think you’ll know about it by watching this movie. I think it pays too much attention to conspiracy theories that IBM deceived ... and what does this theory depend on? The idea that at some point the computer made a move that "looked like a man." I am not a chess grandmaster or computer scientist. And although I have no doubt that this movement looked like a human being, for me it is possible that the most powerful chess computer ever created could make an amazing move ... or that such a machine could win. even a genius like Kasparov. The film is too much at odds with this theory and not enough from the personalities of the people involved ... which could make it a much more interesting story. The direction also depends too much on the conceited narration and images of the 18th century chess machine, similar to the animatronic gypsy fortune tellers you see at the carnival. Also, the story has been slowed down by many empty shots of Kasparov, re-visiting the "crime scene." I have no doubt that Kasparov and the chess community upset IBM's behavior, but I do not think it is different from what you could find in any other large corporation. At the end of the film, you have the feeling that Kasparov is a huge foothold, and Deep Blue programmers are victims or scammers. I think if the director wanted the viewer to believe in conspiracy theories (which he almost certainly did), he would have to present much more evidence. In fact, more evidence would be a good idea in the first place. All this left me with a sour taste in my mouth.
