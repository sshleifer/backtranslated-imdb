Another reviewer was completely right about that. The letter was terrible, the game was terrible, the subject was terrible. The actors looked as if they were not in the film, as if they almost had to be there. There were some unique camera effects, but they weren’t really relevant to the story (or what’s been in the story), and they weren’t produced particularly well. <br /> <br /> I believe that they tried to control the success (can I say so?) of other films with eschatological influence (Omega Code, Left) And yes, it makes Christians embarrassed when they make films of this type. I would not recommend this film to anyone, especially a non-Christian.
