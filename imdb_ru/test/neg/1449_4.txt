I did not expect much from this film, but I really wanted to try something that I originally thought would be primarily teenage horror of the early 80s. Although the three teenagers are somewhat critical, this is by no means a horror movie for teenagers. <br /> <br /> “Strength” is a small Aztec idol that exchanges many hands as its owner (who must be an adult and therefore “spoiled” becomes a vessel for uncovering all the evil idol, and often with deadly consequences for the victims of the owner, but also for the owner himself. After several exchanges of views in the struggle for control of this thing, three teenagers discover it and cannot understand what it is, except that since they discovered it, strange and dangerous things. The reporter who does not buy spiritual Bologna explains the situation, although it is her producer who wants to continue the investigation, especially if it means that he can gain control over the idol (I assume that teenagers are not yet spoiled enough to feel the dangerous desires encouraged by the idol) This story has been told a thousand times, especially in the 1950s and 60s, when it came to horror and science fiction. <br /> <br /> At least for me, it was quite interesting. Although the budget was low, it was not done, obviously, cheap or badly loaded with a bad game, as many of the low-budget, terrible “horrors” of the early decades had (they now have the same stupid qualities, but large budgets). ), We are free enough to at least allow ourselves at least a little to dive into the eerie atmosphere and so on, despite the story of the cliché. And, although it's not terribly awful, the special effects were done well. <br /> <br /> Again, this is a common horror story, especially with the ending (which by modern standards has become a device that is annoyingly abusing), but one that is not so embarrassingly bad. Perhaps worth checking out, even if only for laughter.
