An annoying and incompetent American documentary finds out about the legendary <br /> <br /> South African half-blood monster. Tradition says that this creature is half human, half leopard, and the closest parallel is the werewolf of the European tradition. Instead of focusing on the creature, the film follows the bends of the film crew. The movie has little action or suspense. This problem is exacerbated by numerous annoying characters, generating a continuous amount of even more annoying conversations. The basic premise is wasted because it is limited by inexplicable attention to the film crew. <br /> <br /> The director may have been influenced by the approach of The Blair Witch Project (1999) or The Last Broadcast (1998). Despite this, the film falls through on most levels. Avoid at all costs.
