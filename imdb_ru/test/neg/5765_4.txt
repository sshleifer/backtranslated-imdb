This is an awkward repetition of the same plot in a film about a girl called “Idiots, young adults, in danger because they are idiots” at the beginning of the millennium: this time we will learn the story of a crazy Miner who comes back from the dead hands usurpers. We have almost no thrills, almost no bare flesh (even if the girls are really hot, only one of them shows her bare ass for a few seconds), the usual bunch of horror stars on sunset boulevard in cameo roles (this time Karen Black, Richard Lynch , John Philip Lowe, Jeff Conavey), a lot of fake blood, just a crazy miner, reborn as a zombie, is steep enough to leave you stuck - well, not quite - on the screen to the end. Do not waste your time if you are not a full member.
