I have nothing against Paul Schroeder. Actually, HARDCORE (1979) is one of my favorite films. But some horror movie fans were in premature indignation when its original version of the prequel EXORCIST (DOMINION; you read about it now, as it turns out) was canceled by Warners, and when Renny Harlin was replaced with spruce things and made a new version that was "more terrible. " In my opinion, some viewers were biased and automatically orientated because they hate Renny Harlin’s view on this topic (EXORCIST: BEGINNING) even before the first frame of the film was ever condemned. And I should know; because I myself entered the theater premiere of BEGINNING with stubborn hands, folded, and prepared for the worst that I was sure of. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that Harlin BEGINNING was much more serious than I could have imagined with Stellan Skarsgard's good performance as the young version of Father Merrin, who fought with his faith in God. In any case, it was not a very good film, but it was far from the garbage for which I had prepared myself, in advance, imperceptibly. <br /> <br /> Well, now I finally saw the real version of garbage. - and this is the DOMINION of Paul Schrader: BREAKFAST TO EXORTER. It was relentlessly talkative, uninteresting and tasteless. The restless priest Stellan Skarsgard was far from being as interesting as he was to me in the film Harlin, and the actor himself is not so good in this role. For all those who pointed out the obvious effects of CGI at the BEGINNING, guess what? They are also here at DOMINION. Remember Harlin’s stupid ending (which, I also agree, messed up the rest of this movie)? Well, you find out that this final from Schrader is not so inconclusive. <br /> <br /> Let me also say that I resent what was suggested by those who value this film better than Harlin’s, saying that we are “mentally retarded” or “cannot appreciate subtle filmmaking” . As a person who despises MUMMY in the MTV style of Stephen Sommers of the 99s and is a true fan of the very promising and restrained old horror films of the 30s and 40s, I can assure you that this is not so with me. At least in “THE BEGINNING OF HARLIN” there was a “certain” degree of horror and exorcism type; here it’s just a real exercise in boredom and a serious test for even the most certified insomniac people. It will be quite interesting to hear how horror fans try to convince themselves that DOMINION: PREQUEL TO EXORCIST were as good as they had already decided that everything would be ahead; just as they were already predisposed to criticize Harlin’s HOME as soon as they learned that the name of Paul Schrader was imbued with “White-Out.”
