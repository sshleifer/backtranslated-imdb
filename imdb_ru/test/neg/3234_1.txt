Dean Kunz's book “Observers” is one of the best books I have read. Unfortunately, the film is a sad book cartoon. A frustrated middle-aged hero and a lonely girl, with whom he finds meaning in his life, turn into a couple of stupid teenagers in the film, a one-hundred guard and a conscientious sheriff unite into a farcical villain - do you get the picture? The filmmakers took a touching story about love, horror and adventures and turned it into a horror film Z-Grade, aimed - very badly - at the teen market. <br /> <br /> Buy a book and enjoy hours of reading. - it will be much better than watching a movie. <br /> <br />
