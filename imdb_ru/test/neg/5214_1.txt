(Most likely, I'm going to mess up Valuable plot points while writing this, and because I can't determine, and really don't care what you consider Valuable plot point, then if you think about watching this movie and you have the problem of studying such things, then I suggest you go directly to the next review.) You know, I don’t mind cult films being submitted in the “cult” section. And people who believe in it can go there and fill themselves with “reality”. I mean, is it too much to ask that openly pseudo-Christian propaganda films be served with other films of particular interest? <br /> <br /> I could not have been more amazed Pat Robertson made a porn movie. (or would it be “stunned”?) <br /> <br /> It was bad enough because there were very few punches and kicks in it. It was bad enough that the same story was repeated many times in the best ways. It was bad enough that it was not filed in particular interest, with other cult films. It was bad enough that for some reason he gets nods for being “realistic”, as if we live in a world where cities are obsessed with “debbil” and really deep and nasty evil is NOT done by people - usually in the NAME of religions founded on the god Abraham. It was bad enough to just turn off this thing, because people complained so loudly that it was awful. <br /> <br /> No, the really BAD part was when one of our guests got up after we finally had to just turn the damn thing over and declared that “I would like to see something in one really cruel or pornographic now, just to get that out of my head. Preferably as if you have it. ”And we just met her.
