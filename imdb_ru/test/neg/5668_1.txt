First of all, I just want to say that this show could be better, much better than now. What brought it down was of course valid. Miranda Cosgrove, who acts as Carly’s protagonist, looked almost worthy of her own show when she was on Drake and Josh. Unfortunately, iCarly was a big disappointment. Not only Miranda cannot act convincingly enough, but she is incredibly tough when she moves. She looks like she's not sure how the character "Carly" will move or stand. In the very first episode at the end, when she throws up her hat, her hand never lifts her elbow up. even when she danced, she looked like a stick in the wind. And singing? The song was great, just because Drake was in it, the music was pretty good, and Miranda’s voice was fake. I admit, the plot and settings are good, unreal, but this is Nick. They are practically known for stupid lines and characters. But wow, I'm the worst of them all.
