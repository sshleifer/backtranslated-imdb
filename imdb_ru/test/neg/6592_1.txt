You may suspect that the plot of this film was written in the process of filming. It begins as a “punk against vigilance” film, but in the middle of the film, the plot changes dramatically when the vigil turns into an honest man with his honest girl and his honest gym, and he has to fight the corrupt “businessmen” who want to turn the gym at any price, to build a mall or something else. Then the plot changes again, and we forget about the corrupt. The villain is now a leading friend who thinks he is a ninja. The guy becomes a "crazy evil" and wants at any price to win the Martial Arts Competition. Watching this movie is like a nightmare with a TV on.
