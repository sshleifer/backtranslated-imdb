This is one of the strangest things on television. It is located in the strangely sparsely populated area of ​​the Midlands, called Leatherbridge, which seems to be the most boring place in the country. It has a bar with no visible staff or customers, a university without students, a police station without criminals, and surgery with more doctors than patients. The plot lines are terrible - each episode revolves around a bizarre medical problem, played by a multitude of meaningless extras who can never act, and for some reason the doctor always turns around their home, solving their problem. Quite interesting because of its pure comedic value, but I can not believe that this thing is actually disguised as a serious drama. Nuts.
