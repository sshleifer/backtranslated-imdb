Lucio Fulci, the director, not quite famous for his sophistication, recklessly tries himself in black humor in “Touch of Death”, created for a television movie about Lester Parsons (Brett Halsey), a psyche who seduces and kills rich widows to pay gambling debts . <br /> <br /> Starting with the monstrous scene in which the deadly lotario gets rid of its last victim with a chainsaw, meat grinder and hungry pigs, Touch of Death starts quite promisingly, but Fulci soon loses. control over the process, the introduction of a strange story with the participation of a mysterious murderer of imitators and some tough "comedy" scenes. There are some more graphic killings that, in the true manner of Fulci, are extremely cruel and terrible, but even a high level of bloodshed does not prevent this from being one of the worst efforts of Fulci. <br /> <br /> As I did, found in many of his other films, an understandable storyline is not exactly on the agenda when Lucio stands behind the camera. There are many features in this film that left me at a loss: why didn't Leicester dispose of all his victims using the dismemberment method shown at the beginning? Why are all his victims hairy or disfigured? What the hell is this all over? <br /> <br /> Fulci is considered by many to be one of the “greats” in the horror film; I do not understand his popularity, because in most of his films, which I have seen so far, there is a lack of both decent stories and technical mastery. The touch of death certainly does not change my mind.
