As a loyal to Miss Frank, I remember that I was so excited that the play was reworked for television. That is, until I saw it ... This film is a vivid example of how important the castings are and how directing plays such an important role in creating a sense of purpose. The actor’s role in any central role is crucial for the production of this kind of ... shows, like AUNTIE MAME and MAN OF LA MANCHA, are completely dependent on the charisma of the main actor. And in the cast of this movie, it’s all destroyed by the cruel cast of Melissa Gilbert in the lead role. There is NO ONE MOMENT that Ms. Gilbert even brings close to populating the sensitive, mature spirit of Anna. Mrs. Gilbert - "white bread" throughout the film ... the only time I was close to tears was while reading Ann's most haunting line: "I still believe, no matter what, people are really good in the shower, ”says Miss Gilbert, so hurried, so unsure that she may have burped well and achieved the same effect. The legend of cinema and dance Marge Champion was the dialogue coach for this production - she should have returned her salary! Despite the fact that Ms. Gilbert spoiled DIARY, other performances are quite satisfactory, especially for Joan Plowright as Edith, for Scott Jacobi as Peter and for Clive Revill as Mr. Duessel. Maximilian Schell doesn’t have such a deep soul and spirit as Otto, as the creator of the role on stage and in the film (Joseph Shieldkraut), but he is fine. Doris Roberts and James Koko in the role of Van Dann are relatively superficial in their parts - they are shrill and pompous, but again, only on the surface. This CAN be due to the fact that the pace of the project is too hasty (as noted in previous publications) - this film works 45 minutes shorter than the version of the film - the difference due to pauses for a dramatic effect, which obviously needs to be promoted to the appropriate mood for stories. This is NOT a must-see, especially for young people who first learned about Anne Frank - stick to the original version of the film and, even better, the television production of “Ann Frank: TRUE HISTORY” with Ben Kingsley in the lead role, which is the NEAREST for The reality of the situation of Anna, ever filmed! Note: Especially horrifying is the fact that Melora Marshall, who plays Anna Margot's sister, is NOT included in the opening credits along with all the other members of The Secret Application ... she is listed in the post-loans along with the actors playing Mipa. and Mr Kraler. If I were Miss Marshall, I would sue!
