The man who wrote the summary and enthusiastic review for this film is either an idiot or an avid fan of crappy films. From the very beginning, it was just talking about the robbery of the cheap donkey “Descent,” a much superior film that definitely does NOT start slowly. <br /> <br /> From the very first moments of The Cave, I was amazed at how bad everything was, how it was not inspired and unoriginal, how bad it was written, bad things acted and bad director. This is, without a doubt, one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life, and that says a lot, considering that I recently experienced “Pulse”. I can not believe that this piece of garbage actually received awards, which suggests that the quality of marijuana and other illegal drugs is much better in Australia and other countries than in the United States. <br /> <br /> the group runs away from the “being” of a poorly directed, especially backward “upside down camera” designed to demonstrate disorientation, but only as a cheap effect for which the first-year student will be scolded by the Teacher. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this “director” will probably continue to make other films, more likely, of the same poor quality as this “film”, as I am sure that he did not learn from his mistakes which in this picture were excessive. <br /> <br /> If I could, I would give up the whole team and the team for the rest of my life without the right to parole. This film is a crime against humanity.
