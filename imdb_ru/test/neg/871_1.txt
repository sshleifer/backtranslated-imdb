This film is the last straw. As two loyal fans of the romantic comedy, this film finally made us realize that nothing good came out of this genre since Love Actually. There was nothing good about the movie. It was an insult to love, death, and everything in between. Including horses and beaches. There was absolutely no chemistry between the characters. This film shot the spark of Nicholas Sparks. Diane Lane can't act to save his life. She was unconvincing in her laughter, crying and dancing. And she needs the best haircut. No reason to watch this movie. Save yourself. Romantic comedy is officially dead.
