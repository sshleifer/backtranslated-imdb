Pigtailtail Linnea Quigley drinks milk, strips and kills her sister and her sister's boyfriend after having sex. She goes to an orphanage, makes a best friend from Amy (Karen Russell), and they blackmail their way out of a mental hospital, sleeping with their psychologists (one is played by "Carol Burnett Show," the usual Lyle Wagoner). Outside, these two hateful mafia princesses (!) Stop taking medicine and invite six former slimball guys to their big country house for a party, where they are systematically killed in very bloody ways with a leather glove and dressed as a secret killer. <br /> <br /> Horrible David Barton FX is so bloody, but so unrealistic, that it acquires a surreal quality. The same applies to the film. The dialogue is so weird and untidy, the film is so inept and edited, and the actions are so otherworldly that you will begin to doubt your sanity. This film is actually trying to have a plot and three-dimensional characters, but it’s all so poorly handled that it’s almost as if Ed Wood rewrote Ingmar Bergman’s script! And, like in any good Bergman film, there is a mature moral to be observed - any good party needs the right boyfriend / girlfriend ratio, so there will be enough chickens to “tickle your lizard.” See for yourself ... or not! <br /> <br /> Linnaeus (the only reason I was interested in watching from the very beginning) is very funny, there are much more dialogues in it than usual. and has some stunning nude scenes. Unfortunately, she also completely disappears from the last third of this film, and the film suffers because of this. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 10
