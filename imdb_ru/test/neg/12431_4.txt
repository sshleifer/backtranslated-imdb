Choose a stereotype, any stereotype (be it racial, sexual, cultural, etc.), And I bet you will find it in Wassup Rockers. Do you think all Latin American teenagers are stupid, hairy, slurred and dirty troublemakers? Are Hispanic girls insanely sexy whores? Do all blacks want to start fights and carry weapons? Do all gay people arrange theme parties with pink drinks and ask young guys to make a model for them? Are all white teenage girls rich, stuck princesses who are bored with white teenage boys and who are looking for something more dangerous? If you answered yes to any of the previous questions, you, my friend, are a fanatic, and you will love Wassup Rockers. <br /> <br /> Director Larry Clark loves to shock his audience (I was 15) the first time I saw Children, and I think that’s why I’m still a virgin), but Wassup Rockers are not shocked ?? it's just bad. He tries to be sharp and realistic with his minimal dialogue and close-ups of body hair, but these characters and this story are completely unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Simply put, Wassup Rockers is a teenage fantasy. What a 14-year-old boy doesn't want to be a figure skater who gets into trouble, has parties, drinks 40s, and a hot, rich, white girl says that his uncut penis "looks dangerous?" Besides the demographic, I really don't know who will enjoy this movie.
