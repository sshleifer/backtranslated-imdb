This piece of shit is not worth a critical review, so I will write some information for those who do not know the background of this film. First of all, this is not the first Saudi film, they used this incorrect information for commercial purposes (they lied!). Secondly, they did it for money, not for something else, so they chose a jerk (Hesham) who won the Star Academy (like Big Brother), this is a popular show, and this jerk Hesham is popular, but stupid, bold and talentless, and then chose a famous Kuwaiti actor. Mohammed Al-Sayrafi (also mute and worthless), but he has popularity (count how many times I will use the word “popular”, then email me to get your prize, however) there is a popular show and Jordanian actress Mais Hamdan which appeared in the pop show comic CBM (unfunny), so it is known * PoPular! Then they selected a few Saudi actors for ... blah blah blah. The funniest thing is the director! He is Canadian with Palestinian roots (I believe that the personality of the film is the identity of its director) .. wait a minute! The script was written by an Egyptian screenwriter (very terrible!) With some help from a Lebanese critic (known as a critic, but in fact he is a fundraiser!). This group of multiraces (monetary slaves) knows nothing about Saudi culture, they do not represent it, but when we find out who is behind this garbage, all our questions will be alleviated! Walid bin Talaal is a Saudi prince and (BUSINESSMAN) who does not care about Saudi culture or Saudi people he doesn’t even live in Saudi Arabia (even if he lives, he will live in his own world, his world is very far from real world, to the world of people), so he knows nothing and cares about nothing but to raise his infinite state. <br /> <br /> * Not a Saudi film (not a film of anything). <br /> <br /> Screw them all. <br /> <br /> Write out of 10!
