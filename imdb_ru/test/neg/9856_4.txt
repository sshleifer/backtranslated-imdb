This episode sucks. <br /> <br /> Over the past few years I have watched all the “Next Generation” and “Voyager” series and are now watching “Enterprise”. <br /> <br /> I am fully enjoying this series. Before this episode. I stared at the screen in horror, destroying the character and having fun. This is more like a slap attempt. <br /> <br /> He does not build characters, but throws them on limbs - and he suffocates from the audience. It does little to create a series. <br /> <br /> Why is it ever allowed to go on the air, it amazes me. Was it a letter? Was it a guide? Was it a producer? We will probably never know. <br /> <br /> But one bad apple is not so bad. I say that I hope that this is only one.
