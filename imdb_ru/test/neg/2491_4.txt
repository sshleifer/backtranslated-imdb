This film is final 5. I finally caught it on HBO that night. I remember in cinemas he told a friend that he would never be a hit, because Americans do not want films about history, especially films that are more about ideas than actions. I do not know if this was the reason why the FMLB succeeded, but now, finally, after seeing this, I can add some of my own observations. <br /> <br /> First, while Dwight Schulz was excellent in Star Trek and the A-Team, as he pushes the main role in this film. I kept expecting him to cry out, like John Lovitz, "I am ACT-ING!" His phrase and tone of voice sounded as if he was trying to be REAL, on stage, where he had to emphasize strangely different words and phrases. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I liked the tricky positioning of Paul Newman's character as a manipulator, who at every turn tries to pursue these cats (scientists) in order to achieve his goal. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the question of the moral consequences of creating an “A” bomb was discussed, and whether the United States should use it. This is probably not enough, or as deep as is justified. <br /> <br /> Finally, it seemed that a lot of turns had been added to the dramatic effect. I don’t know how believable the events in this film are, but such things as chain slipping or a laboratory accident caused by a spilled coffee cup (and as a result a scientist was killed) were stretching the boundaries of credibility. Maybe such things or events that were similar really happened, but there was a feeling that different scenes were added solely for the dramatic effect that undermined the entire tone and purpose of the film. <br /> <br /> FMLB was fine. I need to read more about real events, to know if it was excessive or just basically accurate.
