First of all, I don’t see how the film is on any “best” list or how it won any awards. Compared to La Pianiste, which is also on the “best” list, La Pianiste is gold. There were not so many things in this film, at various levels, but I cannot explain why I did not like it so much. The lead actor was annoying, I felt as if I never knew what was going on, and I was bored !! Even though it had to be some decent change in life that Pierre started, I wanted it to end ... as soon as possible. Why should it be his sister and cousin? Ugh. And why did Thibaw become evil? He just became bipolar. And besides, was it me or I missing the whole purpose of what this whole guy in black was? Who were all these people playing music in the large basement of a large warehouse? Why did they have all this strange equipment, weapons and extra rooms for people? I mean it with all seriousness, but does incest happen a lot in French culture? European culture? It took me 5 years to learn about culture, and I haven't heard anything about it!
