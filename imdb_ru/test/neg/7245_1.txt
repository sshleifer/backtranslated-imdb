It was the worst movie I've ever seen. And this is compared with Alexander, Fortress 2 and the New World. <br /> <br /> I have to go back to the blockbuster and ask for my money back with compensation, since this was a truly traumatic experience. For the first ten minutes, I changed the zoom on a widescreen TV, because the actors seemed to be off screen. I did not think it was possible to make such a bad film these days, I was wrong. When typing this message, I thought of a good reason to buy this movie. Joke is present at Christmas. I blame Mrs for this when she chose him, thank you, baby. <br /> <br /> Be careful ....... A real shock from all sides !!!!!!
