Like most, I rented it after hearing general praise. And despite the FREE strange, inexplicable moments along the way, I was very interested and had fun after 100 minutes of the film. Then the two women went to the "performance" late at night. The rest of the film (which is another 40 minutes) is even stranger than the first, and completely contradicts what I have already seen. Then the film suddenly ends. <br /> <br /> Puzzled, I went to my computer to see if I could buy a clue about what had just happened. Nothing made sense, and I'm a pretty smart guy. None of these other user comments makes any sense, even when they say “SPOILERS”. I still have no idea what they are saying. Someone's dream? Not real? Then what is the point in a 2-hour 30-minute film if it is “not real”? Or is it real? I have to make a choice. Either: <br /> <br /> [a] The film is the work of a genius at the level of MENSA, and I’m just too stupid to figure it out. <br /> <br /> [b] The film is strange for the sake of strangeness and simply does not make sense. Everyone who loves it, tries to save face and pretend that they “get” it. <br /> <br /> I choose [b]. Go nafig, I'm home ...
