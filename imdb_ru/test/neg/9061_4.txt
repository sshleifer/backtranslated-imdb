I'm a fan of the old SCTV show from the late 70s and early 80s, and John Candy was the main reason for this. He was given very funny characters and he was just merry. Unfortunately, he could not get these movie roles. Over and over again, I was disappointed with mediocre films in which he almost played a “direct” role instead of a funny guy. “Armed and Dangerous” rarely tries to use the comedic abilities of John or Harold Ramis in this regard. It’s just a very predictable film like cops and robbers. If you are a fan of John Candy or Harold Ramis, you can watch the movie, just don’t expect to laugh a lot.
