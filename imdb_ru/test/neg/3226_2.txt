Although this is one of the early films of John Cusack and Demi Moore, even hardcore fans can skip it, unless they absolutely need to complete the collection. I have rare moments when I can cope with the Better Off Dead, but this film is ultimately worse. I'm just not a Savage Steve Holland fan, and he starred in both films. So, if you don't like funny, casual comedy and amateur animation, stay away from that. By the way, even for fans of Demi Moore: she does not know how to sing, and the synthesizers of the 80s did not save her. Too many predictable turns and too simple jokes. I suppose if you want mindless entertainment or something that you can leave in the background and ignore while you are doing something productive, then do it. Otherwise, do not watch this movie. If John Cusack (or Demi Moore) could not save him, you know that it must be bad. They are the only reason I did not give this film 1.
