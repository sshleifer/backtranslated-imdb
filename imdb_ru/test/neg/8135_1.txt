I entered Heart Of Gold, thinking that I was going to watch a documentary about Neil Young. Instead, I witnessed the mercenary retribution of the arrogance of aging baby boomers, who lost their advantage and forgot their roots. Heart Of Gold, highly praised by aging baby boomer critics, directed and performed by more aging baby boomer artists, is a hectic holiday from beginning to end, that is, if you manage to sit through the entire almost 2-hour film. Neil Young and his team have long lost their positions and want the rest of us to join them in a cuddly mediocre mediocrity. What happened to the bawdy guitar of his early solo performances? I assume that all of his down boxes are rusty, and the overloaded vacuum tubes exploded in the hot air of his generation. As for Demme, is this the brave director of Something Wild & Melvin And Howard? A student filmmaker could make a bolder film than this poorly visualized film on the surface. Do not waste your $$ on Heart Of Gold and go straight to the Last Waltz and Jimmy Shelter. And if you really want to dive deep into the personality of the rock and roll icon, find the book by Chuck Berry: Hail Hail Rock And Roll, which is not printed at all. And baby boomers, don't worry about how this review is distorted by someone younger. I am also one of those baby boomers who listened to Cinnamon Girl on acid and danced in the streets with the Stones' Street Fighting Man. Go back and see “Don't look back” or “Gimmi Shelter,” and then come back and tell me that “The Heart of Gold” has value as a document.
