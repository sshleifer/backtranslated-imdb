A very, very, very slow, aimless film about an unhappy, drifting young man. Not sure who was more lost - flat characters or spectators, almost half of whom left. <br /> <br /> An attempt to trick with black-and-white and clever angles, the film disappointed - it became even more ridiculous - the acting was bad, the plot and plots were almost absent. Very little music or anything to talk about. The best scene in the film was when Gerardo tries to find a song that continues to sound in his head. He goes to a record store to buy it for his lover, and must sing a song for two vendors before they find an album. A pretty scene made a promise, but from there she went downhill. The rest of the film lacks art, charm, meaning ... If itâ€™s about emptiness, it works, I think, because it is empty. Wasted two hours.
