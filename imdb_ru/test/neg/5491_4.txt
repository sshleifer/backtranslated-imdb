“Illuminate” is partly unlucky that it came out after “Shakespeare in love”, because it touches on practically the same themes of life as art, art as life and theater magic, and the same archetypical “Disadvantages of folk theater”, is much more cumbersome . <br /> <br /> There are scenes that come to life when the play develops and is rethought by the life of the writer, but in this work / many ego of Orson Welles is directed. John Torturro performed the role / excuse as a vehicle for his wife Catherine Borowitz (with their son's charming cameo). <br /> <br /> Each actor literally gets his moment in the spotlight, but there are so many “masques” or sets that seem like 19th century saloon games. Bill Irwin says. Susan Sarandon becomes a diva. Christopher Walken becomes another villain - gay critic. Women have to undress unnecessarily, because it is a feature film. <br /> <br /> Art and direction are amazing, albeit rather dark. It should receive an award as Best Use of Jersey City Theater as a Scene Ever In Cinema. (originally written 08/21/99)
