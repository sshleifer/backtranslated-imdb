Two-page guys working on the radio network are moving from trying to uncover the killings to speaking in the dark between work shifts. Jack Moran and Sydney Miller starred in this film since 1945. They talked a lot, everyone shouted at everyone, and the boys on two pages called the police detective "Marty" (played by Ralph Sanford). This is a real “shorty” in the 59th minute, and it feels that it is adapted to the play, since it mostly happens on the sound stage of the radio station. We don’t care about any of the characters, so they probably never showed it. Nothing wrong. It was Phil Carlson's second film as a director. We are not given any clues about who can confuse people, so we just follow the police detective and pages, when they first try to solve the mystery. I will not say more so as not to hand out spoilers.
