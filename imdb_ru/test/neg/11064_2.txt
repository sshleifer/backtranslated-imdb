when I sat down to watch this movie, I thought that it might be a little good. but no. It was a good film, not very good, but not bad for the most part, but then you get to the final, and it loses all credibility. they should have just died. they did not leave the last bit, it made no sense. if they had something at the start of the crash, yes, but we didn't, so it didn't work. The first bit is fine, and I give them their due for it, but the rest is just a plane bad and unnecessary, if you are thinking about going to see this movie, DO NOT THINK it's terrible - rent what you really worth look. I give it 2/10
