I still do not understand what attracted Karen Black. She always had such beads and a strange look at her. She often seemed to be eccentric or abandoned as a "other" woman. In this film, she is a psychic adviser and occult expert for a dirty producer of bad commercials when he studies astral projection. He is sneaky, even without new baggage. Apparently, this is the path to immortality, because if you succeed in this, you can populate the bodies of future generations. I believe that Star Trek was such a conspiracy when Jack the Ripper held on for several centuries. Anyway, this guy is really dangerous. He has a good family and he makes them miserable. He starts killing friends only because they have unkind comments to them, or he does not love them. You can see the end coming from the back row in the left margin. This is a very sharp, without humor movie. Much of this must be taken for the truth. Why are some called but few chosen? I found it long and not very nice.
