When I first looked at Zoey101 with my sister, we thought it was a piece of trash. No one is rich and does not live in a dorm near the Pacific coast. In the series, Zoe is a mega-popular rich girl who everyone always turns to for advice. Zoe is always a good idea, and everyone agrees with her, no matter how stupid she is. She is always beautiful in everything, including her perfect figure. And she is such a diet, she talks about carbohydrates, as if she knows what they are. When she sees her friends eating chocolate, she confiscates it. And one more thing that annoys me is that she always chews a piece of mint every time you look at her. And everyone wants something with her, for example, in one of the episodes when Logan's boyfriend offered $ 4,000 so that she and her friends would support everything he does in his miserable life. And her friend Nicole is an overly cheerful freak who screams a lot. And Lola dresses like Lady Houdini. The 80s called, they want thick hair back there. You can shave and chase the hair. This show sends a bad message to children around the world to make them think that if they don't have the latest I-Pods and designer clothes, they will hate themselves. <br /> <br /> This show is a thumb down. <br /> <br /> We hate you, Jamie Lynn, <br /> <br /> Best regards, Ryan and Cara L
