Yes, there are voices. This film may well be Plan 9 from space for our generation. But while Ed Wood’s film, despite all its flaws, retains a certain charm, despite all this, this film defines the word “tasteless” to the n-th degree. In fact, I would suggest that the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary cite this film as a key example defining this word in the next dictionary update. <br /> <br /> Carrot Top is a performer of such terrible abilities, which are usually reasonable people I know when they hear his name become maniac killers committed to killing Mr. Top as soon as possible. In fact, if you go to Amazon.com and see customer reviews about the movie Carrot Top and other DVDs, you will find several that can be interpreted as deadly threats to Mr. Top. <br /> <br /> Another curious In connection with this film, I recall that Mike Nelson, the lead writer of MST 3000, in his book “Mike's Mega-Cheese” about good and bad movies, said that he had seen the film and soon after could not remember anything about it, including the title. Obviously, Mike suffered a classic reaction to injury. Watching this atrocity was so stunning that Mike Nelson had to block it from his mind. (Obviously, in a later chapter of his book, Mike Nelson regained his memory of this film. From the review he offers, Mike Nelson was definitely not grateful for the restored memory.) <br /> <br /> The only comment I offer about the film and it's not a spoiler, it's just God's truth, it's not funny. None of this, even a nanosecond is funny.
