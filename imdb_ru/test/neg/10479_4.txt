A sheltered young woman, educated at home and possibly very gifted, feeds a restless, overly emotional side, which manifests itself after her absentee father visits her mother, asking for a divorce. Directed by renowned cinematographer William A. Freaker, this poorly named psychological thriller falls into the trap that most films made by production directors fall into: each shot is made for the highest style, but sacrificed for a smooth rhythmic and dense Exciting story. Fracker (and his cinematographer Laslo Kovacs) loves the tasteless white and golden tones, giving the picture a polished, picturesque look. The mansion in the center of events looks like a funeral home, while Fraker is pacing along a wheezing thread like a funeral. Robert Shaw and Sally Kellerman (as Shaw's fiancée), two of the most interesting actors of the 1970s, managed to break through the plastic cover and are pretty convincing, despite the jagged editing (which turns their scenes into small pieces of a half-realized business), Sondra Locke One interesting person on the screen seems to have played the role of Catherine Deneuve in the film “Repulsion”. Pale and with a saucer, with impressive thick and long hair, Locke is a curious human mystery, and it is initially rather frightening and dangerous; however, this role is so old that Locke cannot find anything fresh to pull out of the deep freeze, and she flounders. Fracker lets Locke’s crazy scenes continue while Shaw (looking terribly reckless) finds herself in an impossible position to play along with sensual hostility. All this nonsense would probably be worth scrolling through if the script was spiced with at least some tangibility (or at least some kind of dry mind or humorous relief). In fact, the sluggish script by Lewis John Carlino and Edward Hume, adapted from the Stuton Forbes novel Go to Thy Deathbed, will sit on the viewer early, and only the players' charisma returns us to the finish line. * 1/2 of ****
