Being a young girl, beautiful Joan Woodbury (like Rita Adams) was orphaned after her father's "pigeon stool" was shot. As a young woman, Ms. Woodbury faces difficulties in finding work, because being a former convict of her murdered father makes Woodbury a dangerous business risk. Woodbury Rooms with understanding singer Linda Ware (as Donna Andrews), who advises Woodbury to contact old friends from the orphanage John Archer (as Bob Elliott) and Jack La Rue (as Mickey Roman). But none of her friends can help when Woodbury becomes a victim of fraud, as a result of which she is in prison. After his release, Woodbury decides to give the gangsters the men's price for their money. <br /> <br /> Renamed “Gangs, Inc.”, this is clearly a weak and cheap melodrama. However, it is very interesting to see how Woodbury works wonders with bad material. She quite convincingly plays an innocent, growing sophisticated "Rita"; and she casts pretty much like a blond prostitute. Woodbury should be added to the list of unfortunately underused Hollywood actresses of the past. “Paper Bullets” also features early Alan Ladd (like Jimmy Kelly or Bill Dugan). Mrs. Ware, who sang the hit "Apple for the Teacher" with Bing Crosby, sings well a couple of honest numbers from the 40s. But mostly, this is a Woodbury show. <br /> <br /> **** Paper Bullets (1941) Phil Rosen ~ Joan Woodbury, Linda Ware, Alan Ladd
