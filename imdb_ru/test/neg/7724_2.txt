When Uwe Boll, an extraordinary movie scammer, released the first adaptation of House Of The Dead to a fully deserved mockery, it was generally decided among fans of the original video game to think about making a sequel. The ratio of morons in Hollywood per capita really should be high, because we not only have a continuation, but it also spread in Sony’s antipodes, a company usually not known for its taste in expensive write-offs. Released directly on television in America, the sequel will greatly improve the original, but at the same time it becomes soft, not interesting. The scale of the scenario is expanded, and the action takes place in a desert city, which, as it turned out, surrounds the university, where experiments are being conducted with a virus that can revive the dead. In particular, the action is distributed throughout the university, where you can find the first infected residents. Simply put, the film differs from the original in that it actually takes place in a house where you can find dead people. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the cast is a real step backwards. Emmanuel Voigier was specially designed to resemble the low rent of Angelina Jolie, while the rest of the cast never reaches the level of slums - Jürgen Prochnow. In fact, the only name that will stand out among this composition is Sticky Fingaz, who probably did not want people who he meets at home so easily recognize him. Simply put, these people could not convincingly order pizza on the big screen, even in the best direction. Whatever you say about Bolle, he, at least, inspired such actors as She Grauer to fight his ineptitude. However, the people involved here, at least, know that their film sucks and that they could have fun with it. Most of the problem with the original was that the director thought he was creating some kind of misunderstood masterpiece, and took himself seriously. Unfortunately, due to the fact that the actors do not take their characters or the predicament seriously, a slight dramatic tension can be eroded. <br /> <br /> Most of the plot is connected with the search for the victims of the zero generation, no matter what plague the resurrection of the dead causes. Or, speaking more practical, they are trying to find someone who was infected immediately after the virus mutated into a form that threatened people. How this can help, when a nonmutant strain is usually required to create a vaccine, no one guesses, but the way to complete this quest suffers from its own problems. The “we have to return” plot device is used to determine the execution time, but the actual time of the additional quest is also problematic. At some point, we are told that the city will be destroyed by cruise missiles in ten minutes, but the heroes return to the university, find the pattern they are looking for, and beat off enough zombies to eat the Chinese army. this space of time. Cinematographers take note: it pays to be concrete with time when it can serve, rather than prevent dramatic tension. <br /> <br /> Special effects used in House Of The Dead 2 leave the original effects in the dust. Where Uwe Boll feigned the death of characters using idiotic tricks with a rotating camera, Michael Hurst instead uses all the graphic details that his budget can allow. Bitten neck, hands cut off, heads shot. All this provides a much more convincing bandwidth, but also prohibits mockery of obvious fakes. The photo is also greatly improved. As DVD Crypt put it, the fact that it is in focus everywhere makes it an improvement on the original, but it also deprives us of something to laugh at the expense of. Writing is also an improvement as well as a failure. Throughout the script, links to other horror and survival games are offered, the most obvious of which are “Run Like Hell”. The first couple of times they work, because they offer smart ways to turn headlines into ordinary, everyday dialogue. However, after the eighth time, they simply get on their nerves, because they remind gamers of the things they would prefer to do with their time. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, House Of The Dead 2 costs only six million to bring to television screens across America. Given that Tom Savini is currently more expensive than working on a film, I must say that I am somewhat impressed with the visual results. Unlike the widely offended original, the zombies here look more like real zombies, and not like extra characters with bad makeup shot poorly. Unlike the original, the actors seem to have an idea of ​​what they are doing. The conclusion of the transaction - the fact that in addition to some real zingers scattered throughout, the characters speak like real people. However, there is nothing in history that we have not seen a thousand times. When the Aliens, the real Dawn Of The Dead or The Evil Dead were released for recognition, the recognition came from the fact that these films either did something we hadn’t seen before, or did so well that we didn’t care. House Of The Dead 2 is competent enough that we do not mock him, but he does not bring anything new or especially brilliant to the table, so we don’t care about the end, either. <br /> <br /> For this and many other reasons I have given House Of The Dead 2 two out of ten. It's too good to be bad, but too bad to be good. If you don’t like horror movies like me, you better stay away from that.
