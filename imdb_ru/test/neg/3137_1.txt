Critics are strange people. Some of them are simple people like you and me. Some are not. When a critic says that Subconscius Cruelty is beautiful, I wonder where they grew up? Which is great with shooting a field, clouds, or a tree with an old camera, if you can't do it with style and convey the mood of the environment. Karim Hussein just can not. I saw the children shoot better than Karim in Subconscius Cruelty. But this is not the worst part. Worst of all, the whole record, I refuse to call it a film, is simply a bad excuse for nudes and extreme torture, rape of both sexes, masturbation, sperm, scripture, cannibalism, murder of children and much more. I love blood / spray and I love horror. This is neither. This is complete nonsense, and if my comments make one person skip Subconscius Cruelty, it would be worth it. Always remember that your life will not last forever, do not waste two hours of precious time on the Subconscious of Cruelty. You have been warned.
