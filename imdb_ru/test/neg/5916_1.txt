It occurs in the 1920s in Harlem. The black nightclub has to deal with gangsters and corrupt cops. <br /> <br /> A dreadful ambitious project for Eddie Murphy. He tries to mix comedy and drama and fails in both. The comedy is simply not funny, but the drama is boring and badly played. You think that a film with three legends of comedy - Eddie Murphy, Redd Fox and Richard Pryor - would be great, but it is not. There are unceasing curses, and on the OPENING scene there is a young boy who shot a man to death (this is shown as “everything is fine”). We also have a beautiful Della Reese, who went to Madame. One of the "comedic" moments - a long, unfunny and terribly fierce battle between her and Murphy. A boring, insulting and stupid mess. Not the worst movie of Murphy, but pretty close. And 1 completely.
