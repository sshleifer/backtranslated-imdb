This film has a pretty decent sequence of effects from the 1936 earthquake. The reason you didn’t see him was because the audience in the 1930s was fascinated by the “painting of Janette MacDonald”; in which the star of the same name made its way through countless songs, and the plots were deadlocked. FX crossing time is very good. There is no Macdonald song, and the awkward inset of the songs mentioned to show her only typical talent is not good. <br /> <br /> The simultaneous arrangement of two friends who grew up to become a priest and a bully give another run through the mechanism (Manhattan melodrama, The Departed). At the 30th minute you heard the song "San Francisco" three times. Entertainment in the thirties - it is usually the accumulation of irritation. Only a decade grand hotel avoids irritation to the extent shown in San Francisco, Dinner at 8, Little Caesar, Stagecoach, Everything Quiet on the Western Front, Les Miserables, etc ..
