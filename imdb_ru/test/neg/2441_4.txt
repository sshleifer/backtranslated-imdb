In British teenage films that tell about a girl (Justine) who accidentally creates her dream man (Jake) using a virtual reality machine, there is only one problem (well, not just one) in which she was trapped in his body. with a geek as the only person who knows the truth and the only person she can trust. It sounds a lot worse than it actually is, I found it more watchable because Laura Fraser appeared more in it than in the film, indeed, she looks amazing, especially when wearing a red lycra dress to impress Jake, Wow !! If I had a virtual reality machine ??????
