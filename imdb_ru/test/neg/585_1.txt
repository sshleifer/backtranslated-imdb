Terrible. The only way I could even find it ridiculous is if he made fun of himself. â€œAmazing. It's about the ass that fights crime. And he drinks / smokes! How very funny! This is ridiculous because when most people put things in their mouths, it puts them in themselves! the show is so cool! This is what I would say if I liked the show, although I'm sure you can see the obvious sarcasm. I noticed that some people compared this show with 12 ounces. Billy Mice and Squids. Why would you even try? There is nothing to compare. The other two shows actually have a decent character development. In conclusion, I hate Assi McGee. I twitch on behalf of this.
