I saw this movie when its premiere took place in Los Angeles. I think I laughed 2 or three times. The rest of the time I was shocked by how ridiculously / poorly shot and poorly written. Kirby - the only saving grace in the film. I was disappointed with the performance of Larry Bagby, whom I usually find interesting. If you like to watch crappy homemade short films that they shot on their mother’s 8 mm camcorder, there’s a small chance that you’ll enjoy this movie. On the other hand, part of what makes these films enjoyable is that your buddies play all the roles. You do not know these people, so you will probably find him as boring and stupid as I am. Dear Mr. Nelson, go back to film school, practice for a while as a PA or as an assistant, or for some low-level work, to see how everything is done correctly in the movie. Then look for as much as you need to find a director for photography who knows that f. stop means make sure it has an ND filter at hand. Then try again. Repeat as many times as necessary.
