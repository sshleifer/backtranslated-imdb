I do not know whether this type of film was as cliché as it seems now. <br /> <br /> Considering how many bad news films were already released by 1980, I think Similar films have long been tired. <br /> <br /> Former football player in Vietnam is partially paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair. The Chicago Bears offer him a public relations job, but he wants to train. At the same time, his minor nephew is taken for armed robbery. We are told that he has already been arrested more than a dozen times, and now he has to serve some difficult time ... which is less than a year! <br /> <br /> Of course, a child is actually a good child who needs only a hard example to follow in his life. The same applies to all children in the detention facility. Yes ... even the one who is locked up for an attempted murder! I’m sure you already know what is going on, so I’ll try to keep the rest of this brief description. <br /> <br /> Our main character becomes a coach of a children's football team. He overcomes the cynicism of the wrongdoers and earned their respect. His team opposes the local school team (yes, that's right!), And they get hit. Now he is determined to show himself as a worthy coach and demands revenge. Will these deprived, patchwork children with golden hearts be able to become better in order to win a rematch? The terrible performance of football episodes destroys any possibility of excitement in this film. "Coach of the Year" should be fined for the rudeness of my brain. 1/10
