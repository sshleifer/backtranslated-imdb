Uuuuaaa! Barf! Yuk Yuk Disgusting! Puke City! The worst piece of trash ever made. Sick. Weird. Horrible. Enough said. Keep your nose. Don't Eat After watching this sick, crazy, trash can from the movie, you won't be able to eat your food for a week. But maybe this is good. A new diet was invented. Go to see this vomiting film. Got sick stomach. And you will be so disconnected by this mess that you cannot eat for at least a week, and you lose about 15 pounds. <br /> <br /> Me Me Lay! With such a name it is really amazing that she has no fans of "cult" fans. She is considered the worst actress ever. From her films, Ed Woods looks like Gone With the Wind. This film estimates minus 10.
