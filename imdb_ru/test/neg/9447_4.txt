The life of Megan (Jackie Kresler) and Dylan (Shane Elliott) is changing in the Nevada desert between Reno and Las Vegas. They stop to eat for a little fat spoon, where they are reluctant to learn about the notorious Area 51 from the cafe owner (Jonathan Brek). After returning to the road in their forty-year-old Lincoln, the radio receives a little crazy broadcast of Hitler's speech at the Olympic Games of 1836, and then the 1958 Elvis Presley newsletter, drafted into the army. The car slowly breaks down, and both of them are frightened by their lives, as mysterious unexplained things happen in the desert, poisoned by radiation; remnants of nuclear testing. Megan meets a lost little girl (Channing Nichols) and a wounded soldier of World War II. The nightmare journey does not end there. Kresler is impressive to some extent, and screenwriter / director James Ley makes good use of Patsy Cline's melodies. In general, moderately interesting fiction.
