Fun with Dick and Jane failed to entertain on so many levels. For example, with writing letters there were bad ends, it seems that one of the main conflicts was the accusation of the character of Jim Carrey Dick Harper, but the authors never follow this particular conflict. Basically, the story is weak and mostly unfunny, but Kerry saves several scenes with her physical humor, but, frankly, Jim Carrey was not very funny in this film, and Thea Leone might have justly been present because was also not funny. This is just another example of how Hollywood bankers make a franchise with a lousy, non-original story.
