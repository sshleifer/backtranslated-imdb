You would think that against the backdrop of the incredible Stalingrad of World War II, the scriptwriters came up with a script. Nope There is NO history here! It's like porn, vignettes of violence interrupted by a pitiful, mechanical and meaningless dialogue. <br /> <br /> A bunch of Germans march around shooting and get shot. Gradually, the Germans become less to march, shoot and shoot. Then there are no Germans to march, shoot and shoot. <br /> <br /> Pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Chilcoot
